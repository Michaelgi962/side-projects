N+1 redundancy

N+1 redundancy is a form of resilience that ensures system availability in the event of component failure. 
Components (N) have at least one independent backup component (+1). The level of resilience is referred to as active/passive or standby as backup components do not actively participate within the system during normal operation. The level of transparency (disruption to system availability) during failover is dependent on a specific solution, though degradation to system resilience will occur during failover.
It is also possible to have N+1 redundancy with active-active components, in such cases the backup component will remain active in the operation even if all other components are fully functional, however the system will be able to perform in the event that one component is faulted and recover from a single component failure.
An active-active approach is considered superior in terms of performance and resiliency.
Examples of N+1 redundancy:
1+1 redundancy typically offers the advantage of additional failover transparency in the event of component failure. The level of resilience is referred to as active/active or hot as backup components actively participate with the system during normal operation. Failover is generally transparent (disruption to system availability) as failover does not actually occur (just degradation to system resilience) as the backup components were already active within the system.
Examples of 1+1 redundancy:
Applications.
Redundant systems are often used in data centers to ensure that computer systems continue without service interruption. Other common implementations include aerospace, where redundant systems are used to improve safety and integrity of spacecraft, electric power systems and automobiles, where the emergency brake is available in a car as a redundant component in case of failure of the main brake systems.

STANKIN

Moscow State Technological University “Stankin“ (MSTU Stankin) () (previously Moscow State Technological Institute STANKIN or Moscow Machine-Instrument Institute) is one of the leading Russian technical institutes founded in 1930. STANKIN is an abbreviation from Stanko-Instrumentalniy, what means machines and instruments. Today STANKIN trains specialists in much more areas than machinery.
History.
The university was found in 1930 to provide the USSR with high class engineers of machinery. Soon STANKIN became the USSR's leading machinery education centre and university training high-class engineers in wide range of areas.
The university was founded as the Moscow Machine Tool Institute in 1930 to provide the machine tool industry, the most important branch of industry at that time, with highly qualified specialists. Machine tools are the only machines that can create other machines (cars, planes, agricultural and everyday equipment, etc.), including machine tools themselves. 
Today Stankin is not only a place for study: It is a scientific industrial complex with the Technological Design Institute of Informatic of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RSA). There is a net of scientific, educational and industrial centers, where students can realize their ideas. There are some strong and authoritative schools in Stankin. It represents the main perspective in engineers and scientists training through post-graduate study (six special Doctors and Bachelors councils function under the university). Among 100 universities of Russia, Stankin is chosen the main one in the field of “machinebuilding technology, equipment and automatization of machinebuilding industry”. It has stable and always developing international relations with universities and firms from Austria, Brasilia, Hungary, Italy, China, USA, South Korea and other countries.
There are more than 600 professors and scientists working at Stankin today. Life at the university does not represent only studying and working; it also entails social activities. Stankin has its own newspaper: "Stankinovskiy vestnik". The show-group of the university is very popular because of its talent.
Education.
Beyond Russian students, "MSTU Stankin" educates students from India, China, Korea, South America, and Europe. Today, Stankin is an acknowledged science school for technical education in every possible streams.
Studies and corresponding research cover the specialty areas of automation of technological processes and manufactures; engineering ecology and security in machine building; information and marketing in machine building; information systems;
quality of production and management; computerization of computation durability of machine building construction; computer modeling in instrumental technics; computer control system in production and business; tool engineering and computer modeling;
laser technology; presses and metal treatment technology; metalcutting machines and tools; design and computer modeling of plastic deformation system; robotics and mechatronics systems; system production of automated technological machinery; computer-aided design systems; metrological production system; computer control machine tools; technological information of automated manufacturing technology; technology and business in no-waste production; technology and management in instrumental manufacturing; mechanical engineering; physics of high concentrated energy; economy and control of production.
Research.
Outstanding scientific achievement.
There were created new constructions of spindle nodes and bearing systems of machine tools ensuring multi-coordinate precision processing of details from pig-iron, steel and easy alloys. The originality of the developed automated means of calculation of machine tool nodes is made with new methods of the advanced final element and empirical methods of calculation.
There were developed the technology and equipment for plotting multi-layers abrasive resistant covers on tools and details ensuring essential increase of their reliability and resource.
There was developed the system of interpreters of the dialogue "person - computer", intended for acceleration and reduction of labour input of creation of appropriate appendices. The source submission of dialogues are the graphs of states, system functions on platforms of Windows 95 and Windows NT. The system was created as the tool for fast development and modernising of MMI appendices for open systems of the numerical control.
There was developed the method of substitutions of problem solving on the graphs. With the help of the given method it is possible to decide both optimisation problems relating the class of discrete programming problems and combinatorial problems on the graphs with edges without weights. The principle of pair substitutions with combination of the possibility of use the vectors of topology has allowed mathematically to formulate new classes of optimisation and combinatorial problems on the graphs, which could not be solved earlier by known widely classical methods.

<doc id="9676678" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9676678" title="Phylogenetic footprinting">
Phylogenetic footprinting

Phylogenetic footprinting is a technique used to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within a non-coding region of DNA of interest by comparing it to the orthologous sequence in different species. When this technique is used with a large number of closely related species, this is called phylogenetic shadowing.
Researchers have found that non-coding pieces of DNA contain binding sites for regulatory proteins that govern the spatiotemporal expression of genes. These transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), or regulatory motifs, have proven hard to identify, primarily because they are short in length, and can show sequence variation. The importance of understanding transcriptional regulation to many fields of biology has led researchers to develop strategies for predicting the presence of TFBS, many of which have led to publicly available databases. One such technique is Phylogenetic Footprinting.
Phylogenetic footprinting relies upon two major concepts:
History.
Phylogenetic footprinting was first used and published by Tagle et al. in 1988, which allowed researchers to predict evolutionary conserved cis-regulatory elements responsible for embryonic ε and γ globulin gene expression in primates.
Before phylogenetic footprinting, DNase footprinting was used, where protein would be bound to DNA transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) protecting it from DNase digestion. One of the problems with this technique was the amount of time and labor it would take. Unlike DNase footprinting, phylogenetic footprinting relies on evolutionary constraints within the genome, with the "important" parts of the sequence being conserved among the different species.
Protocol.
It is important when using this technique to decide which genome your sequence should be aligned to. More divergent species will have less sequence homology between orthologous genes. Therefore, the key is to pick species that are related enough to detect homology, but divergent enough to maximize non-alignment "noise". 
Step wise approach to Phylogenetic footprinting consists of :
Not all TFBS are found.
Not all transcription binding sites can be found using phylogenetic footprinting due to the statistical nature of this technique. Here are several reasons why some TFBS are not found:
Species specific binding sites.
Some binding sites seem to have no significant matches in most other species. Therefore, detecting these sites by phylogenetic footprinting is likely impossible unless a large number of closely related species are available.
Very short binding sites.
Some binding sites show excellent conservation, but just in a shorter region than the ones were looked for. Such short motifs (e.g., GC-box) often occur by chance in nonfunctional sequences and detecting these motifs can be challenging.
Less specific binding factors.
Some binding sites show some conservation but have had insertions or deletions. It is not obvious if these sequences with insertions or deletions are still functional. Though they may still be functional if the binding factor is less specific (or less 'picky' if you will). Because deletions and insertions are rare in binding sites, considering insertions and deletions in the sequence would detect a few more true TFBSs, but it could likely include many more false positives.
Not enough data.
Some motifs are quite well conserved, but they are statistically insignificant in a specific dataset. The motif might have appeared in different species by chance. These motifs could be detected if sequences from more organisms are available. So this will be less of a problem in the future.
Compound binding regions.
Some transcription factors bind as dimers. Therefore, their binding sites may consist of two conserved regions, separated by a few variable nucleotides. Because of the variable internal sequence, the motif cannot be detected. However, if we could use a program to search for motifs containing a variable sequence in the middle, without counting mutations, these motifs could be discovered.
Accuracy.
It is important to keep in mind that not all conserved sequences are under selection pressure. To eliminate false positives statistical analysis must be performed that will show that the motifs reported have a mutation rate meaningfully less than that of the surrounding nonfunctional sequence.
Moreover, results could be more accurate if the prior knowledge about the sequence is considered. For example, some regulatory elements 
are repeated 15 times in a promoter region (e.g., some metallothionein promoters have up to 15 metal response elements (MREs)). Thus, to 
eliminate false motifs with inconsistent order across species, the orientation and order of regulatory elements in a promoter region should 
be the same in all species. This type of information could help us to identify regulatory elements that are not adequately conserved but 
occur in several copies in the input sequence.

<doc id="9676747" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9676747" title="Outer Tantras">
Outer Tantras

The Outer Tantras are the second three divisions in the ninefold division of practice according to the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. This system divides the whole of the Buddhist path into three divisions of three and is in contrast to the division of the Sarma, or New Translation schools (Gelug, Kagyu and Sakya) which use a fourfold division. The three divisions of the Outer Tantra correspond to the lower three category of tantras of the New Translation (Sarma) schools.
Three divisions.
The three divisions of the Outer Tantras are:
As well as being differentiated in terms of emphasis in practice, the three categories of Outer Tantra are also textual categories, with lists of texts assigned to each category; for which see the individual articles for each section.
The stages of the lower tantras can be divided into 4 parts; empowerments; vows and commitments; close retreats; common and uncommon attainments. Every tantra requires the empowerment of a guru in order to enter and proceed along the path, and normally there are a number of different empowerments for different practices, and in addition the Bodhisattva and Tantric vows must be taken. A close retreat involves intense sessions of meditation in the practice of deity yoga (concentration on one's personal yidam and their mantra), and the common and uncommon attainments are the occult powers, or siddhis, that are obtained as a result of that practice.
Kriyatantra.
Kriyatantra (literally action tantra), is the first of the outer tantras, and places a special emphasis on ritual actions, such as ritual bathing, and ritual 'magic' to perform rites of pacification, increase and wrath. The empowerments required are the simple vase empowerment and crown empowerment. The emphasis of this level of tantra is on obtaining the siddhis, which are then used for the benefit of all beings, causing the accumulation of merit.
The deities of kriyayoga are split into 3 families; 
Popular deities of each family are Manjushri (Tathagata family), Chenrezig (Padma family) and Vajrapani (vajra family).
The principal scriptures of Kriyayoga are called General Secret Tantra, Excellent Establishment Tantra, Tantra requested by Subahu, and Concentration Continuum Tantra, but there are great many other branch tantras and commentaries.
Charyatantra.
Charyatantra (performance tantra), is the second of the outer tantras, and although it maintains a strong emphasis on external ritual actions, like Kriyatantra, the emphasis is now upon obtaining liberation through meditation. It is therefore externally similar to kriya tantra, and internally similar to Yogatantra. The empowerments required are similar to that of kriyatantra, except there is a 4-fold vase empowerment. 
There a very few scriptures that belong to this class of tantra, but the principal ones are the mahavairocanaabhisambodhi tantra, Subsequent tantra, and Vajrapani empowerment tantra.
In this tantra, Vairochana emerges as the principal deity, with all the other buddhas and bodhisattvas being seen as emanating from him. The Charya tantras are extremely influential in Japan, for example in Shingon buddhism.
Yogatantra.
Yoga tantra is the last and highest of the outer tantras, and here external rites are seen as much less important than internal practices. The empowerments given are the empowerment of the 5 Buddha families, and the empowerment of the Vajra master, and disciples must take on the commitments of the 5 buddha families, and take the tantric vows. 
The path is split into 4 seals; the great seal of body, the seal of the speech of Dharma, the seal of the mind of commitment, and the seal of enlightened actions. 
The principal scripture is Condensation of Thatness. Vairochana maintains his position as principal deity, but he is now envisaged as being in the centre of 5 buddha families instead of 3, each family belonging to one of the wisdom buddhas. Again, these ideas are very influential in Japan, notably Shingon buddhism.

<doc id="9676821" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9676821" title="Heat-shrinkable sleeve">
Heat-shrinkable sleeve

Heat-shrinkable sleeve (or commonly "shrink sleeve") is a corrosion protective coating for pipelines in the form of a wraparound or tubular sleeve that is field-applied.
History.
The first heat-shrinkable sleeves were introduced over 35 years ago when polyethylene pipeline coatings started to replace bituminous or tape coatings in the oil and gas industry. Back then, the processing for polyethylene to make the sleeve backing was new technology and the adhesives used in sleeves were much the same as those used on pipeline coatings.
The technology used to make sleeves has advanced significantly since then, with new methods of cross-linking the polyolefin backings and new generation adhesives that are formulated to provide performance under more demanding pipeline conditions.
Composition & Manufacture.
Polyolefin Backing.
Heat-shrinkable means just that, heat them up and they shrink, or more correctly, they recover in length. A heat-shrinkable sleeve starts out with a thick extruded polyolefin sheet (polyethylene or polypropylene) that is formulated to be cross-linkable. After extruding the thick sheet, it is taken to the “beam” where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation. The irradiation process cross-links the polyolefin. This improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work as part of a heat-shrinkable sleeve and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in-service. It makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough, heat-resistant, elastic material or rubber, rather than like a plastic material.
After cross-linking, the sheet is stretched by feeding it into a machine that heats it up, stretches it and cools it down. Because the sheet has been cross-linked, after stretching, it will want to recover to its original length when re-heated.
In recent years, many manufacturers had already developed their technologies of extruding and expansion of polyolefin backing. In the past, the production process of backing was done by extruding, cross-linking and expansion. However, in order to increase the production efficiency, some of manufacturers expand the backing during extruding, and then send the backing to e-beam for the cross-linking process.
Adhesives and Functions.
An adhesive is then applied to the sheet and various manufacturers use proprietary techniques depending on the type, viscosity and melting temperature of the adhesive. The adhesive is the key to ultimate performance of the installed system, which is why different adhesive types will be specified depending on the pipeline operating conditions.
The adhesive has many functions; it adheres the installed sleeve to the steel at the coating cutback and mainline coating, it resists shear forces imparted by soil pressure after the pipeline is buried and provides long term corrosion protection to the steel. The choice of which adhesive to use is based on the pipeline design and operating conditions. As an example, for small diameter flow lines operating at ambient temperatures, a soft mastic-based adhesive may be chosen, while on large diameter pipelines operating at higher temperatures, a hard, semi-crystalline hot-melt adhesive is used. The adhesive needs to be chosen based on its corrosion protection properties, adhesion strength, and resistance to shear forces imparted by pipe movement and the effects of soil pressures.
The coated sheet is then cut into individual sleeves suitable for application on a pipeline. As mentioned before, the sheet is stretched and wants to recover when heated, so a sealing strip or “closure” is applied during sleeve installation so that the sleeve will stay in place during and after recovery.
Epoxy Primer.
A final component is an optional epoxy primer. Primers for heat-shrinkable sleeves work in the same manner as an FBE primer does when it is specified on 3-layer polyolefin pipeline coatings and is typically applied between 150 µm and 300 µm thick. Usually, the primer of heat shrinkable sleeve is two components non-solvent Epoxy, one is primer base and the other is curing agent.
Use.
When steel pipelines are built, they commonly consist of 10~12m long sections of steel pipe that has had a corrosion protective coating applied to it in a factory. The factory will leave an uncoated area at each end of the pipe called a “cutback” so that when welding the pipe sections together, the coating is not damaged. Heat-shrinkable sleeves are applied onto the cutback at the field weld or “field joint” during the construction of a pipeline.
As described above, the heat-shrinkable sleeves have an adhesive that sticks the sleeve to the cutback and the factory applied mainline coating and also acts as a corrosion protective layer. The backing provides mechanical protection against abrasion and soil stress forces after the pipeline is buried.
Heat wrap tape may used in addition for pipe bends, or as an alternative method for wrapping the whole pipe.

Ascutney Mountain Resort

Ascutney Mountain was a ski area located on the western side of Mount Ascutney in Brownsville, Vermont. It opened in the winter of 1946 under the ownership of Catharine Cushman. Most recently, it was owned from 1993 until summer 2010 by Steven and Susan Plausteiner.
History.
The Mt. Ascutney Ski Club cut the first trail at Ascutney in 1938. Skiers initially had to hike up the mountain to be able to ski down the trail, now known as Screaming Eagle. In 1946, Catharine Cushman, with the help of others, began to develop real estate on the mountain, in essence opening Ascutney as a ski area. It wasn't until the second year, 1947, that two rope tows were installed to take skiers up the mountain. The first groomer was bought in 1947, while snowmaking was installed ten years later, when the ski area was owned by John Howland. Kurt Albert is the only man to ski 24 straight hours at Ascutney to raise money for charity in 2001.
More recently, when Summit Ventures owned Ascutney, they invested $80 million into operating the resort, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1990. After three years of closure, Steven and Susan Plausteiner from New York City, bought Ascutney for over one million dollars. Improvements under the Plausteiners include snowmaking coverage being expanded to 95% of the skiable area and installation of a high-speed detachable quad chairlift in 2000 from the bottom of the mountain to a new, higher peak.
2010 closure.
In the early summer of 2010, rumors spread of Ascutney's imminent closure. As the summer months went on, changes to the website concerning season passes, and the upcoming 2010-2011 season were never updated. Rumors spread of severe debt and financial troubles on the part of the current owners, the Plausteiners. As of October 2010, the State of Vermont has admitted that Ascutney Mountain had not yet filed for lift inspections, with the inspection deadline on November 1, 2010. Currently, the mountain is in foreclosure, and the lifts will not be spinning come winter time. Despite the closure of the ski operations, the resort at the base of the mountain, Holiday Inn Club Vacations at Ascutney Mountain Resort, continues to operate. Holiday Inn Club Vacations has no ownership ties to the ski operation. Until ski operations return to Ascutney Mountain, guests of Holiday Inn Club Vacations at Ascutney Mountain Resort are encouraged to visit nearby ski areas such as Mount Sunapee in Newbury, New Hampshire, Arrowhead in Claremont, New Hampshire, and Okemo Mountain in Ludlow, Vermont. The high speed quad, known as the "North Peak Express," was sold to Crotched Mountain with plans to install it in the Spring of 2012.
Rumors of possible reopening.
According to the employees of the resort hotel, owned and operated by Holiday Inn since 2008, the owners of the ski area decided not to declare bankruptcy, as such would require the owners to sell off their assets. Instead, the town of Brownsville was working with the hotel's parent company to repair and modernize the septic systems of both the hotel and the ski area. It's was rumored that there were seven possible individual or collaborative investors that want to bring the ski area back to functionality before it falls into a significant state of disrepair.
Final closure and deconstruction.
Plans to reopen the ski resort all failed to materialize by 2014. Following a protracted legal battle, MFW, the principal lien holder on the property, assumed ownership as the only bidder at an auction of the resort’s assets in November, 2013. The high speed detachable quad lift had been removed and moved to Crotched Mountain in Bennington, N.H. in 2012. In June 2014, removal of all of the remaining lifts and snow making equipment began. The largest remaining lift was to be moved to Pat's Peak in Henniker, NH. The ski lodge had fallen into disrepair and was scheduled for demolition.

Yogatantra

The 'Yogatantra' (Sanskrit) 'conveyance' (Sanskrit: yana) is the most sublime of the three Outer Tantras. It includes a class of Buddhist tantric literature as well as 'praxis' (Sanskrit: sadhana) associated with this class. The Yogatantra yana is evident in both the Sarma traditions of Tibetan Buddhism as well as the Nine Yana path of the Nyingmapa tradition.
Jamgon Kongtrul (1813-1899) defines Yoga tantra by making reference to the Two Truths doctrine and 'method' (Sanskrit: upaya) and 'wisdom' (Sanskrit: prajna) and is rendered into English from the Tibetan by Guarisco and McLeod, "et al." (2005: p.128) thus: 
"Yoga tantra is so named because it emphasizes the inner yoga meditation of method and wisdom; or alternatively, because based on knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the profound ultimate truth and the vast relative truth, it emphasizes contemplation that inseparably unites these two truths."
Praxis.
Yoga tantra involves 'deity yoga' (; Sanskrit: Devata-yoga).

Sullivan and Gilbert

Sullivan and Gilbert is a musical by Ken Ludwig with music and lyrics by Gilbert and Sullivan. "Sullivan and Gilbert" features over 15 Gilbert and Sullivan songs. It examines an eventful day in the lives of the famous Victorian era composer and dramatist, and takes place behind the scenes at the Savoy Theatre in London.
Sullivan and Gilbert premiered in 1983 at National Arts Centre of Canada, where it won the Ottawa Critics’ Circle award for Best Play of the Year, followed by a run at the Kennedy Center starring Fritz Weaver and Noel Harrison. It also played in Milford, New Hampshire in 1983. The cast includes eight men and four women. 
This is not the only show about the Gilbert and Sulivan partnership. A 1938 Broadway show, "Knights of Song", tells the story of the partnership, as do the musicals "The Savoyards", by Donald Madgwick (1971) and "Tarantara Tarantara", by Ian Taylor (1975), and the films "The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan" and "Topsy-Turvy".
Synopsis.
Near the end of their collaboration, and still smarting from their famous carpet quarrel, W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan have neither seen nor spoken with each other in months. Now they must supervise a rehearsal for a revue of their comic operas, a command performance for Queen Victoria. The underprepared show is set to open in about eight hours. Sullivan has been ill and has missed most of the rehearsals; and he’s in love with pretty Violet Russell, a young soprano of whom Gilbert disapproves. To make matters worse, Sullivan has invited Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh (and son of the Queen), to join the cast. The eager duke can't sing, dance or remember his cues. When Gilbert finds out, he's furious. With a company of temperamental actors to manage, and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, breathing down their necks, there is plenty for the two men to fight about. But their admiration for each other as collaborators and friends wins the day.

Pointe à la Hache Ferry

The Pointe à la Hache Ferry, or Pointe a la Hache Ferry, is a ferry across the Mississippi River in the U.S. state of Louisiana, connecting West Pointe à la Hache and Pointe à la Hache in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. 
Ferry service began at this site in June 1933. Although the ferry originally carried a toll, today, it is free.
It is the last vehicle crossing of the river in the down river direction. The East Bank side of the ferry is near the end of paved roadway; on the West Bank the river road continues down to Venice, Louisiana. As the eastbank of Plaquemines Parish has little population in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ferry service to the eastbank occurs at the top of every hour between 6 AM and 10 PM, as well as at 6:30 AM. Likewise, ferry service to the westbank occurs at 6:15 AM, 6:45 AM, and on the bottom of every hour between 7:30 AM and 10:30 PM.
On 9 January 2013 the ferry was closed indefinitely. In May 2013 it was reopened for light traffic (including passenger cars and pickup-trucks, but not for large trucks or buses)[http://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2013/03/07/plaquemines-parish-ferry-landing-to-reopen/.

<doc id="9677002" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9677002" title="Lithuanian calendar">
Lithuanian calendar

The Lithuanian calendar is unusual among Western countries in that neither the names of the months nor the names of the weekdays are derived from Greek or Norse mythology. They were formalized after Lithuania regained independence in 1918, based on historic names, and celebrate natural phenomena; three months are named for birds, two for trees, and the remainder for seasonal activities and features. The days of the week are simply ordinal numbers.
History.
Ancient Baltic cosmological schemes have been found on burial urns dated from 600-200 BC. As with other Bronze Age cultures, there were megaliths associated with the summer and winter solstices; hill enclaves with solar calendars have been discovered at Birutė Mountain near Palanga, and at the Purmaliai mound near Klaipėda. A modern interpretation of the ancient solar calendar was created in 2002 at the Kretinga Museum.
The Gediminas Sceptre, discovered in 1680, indicates that during his reign the year started in April and was divided into 12 months, varying in length from 29 to 31 days. Each month began with a new moon; the weeks were nine days long. The month names on this artifact are expressed in symbols, based on natural phenomena and agricultural cycles. 
The Julian calendar was used in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; the Gregorian calendar was adopted by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1586, a few years after its promulgation in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. In 1800, following Lithuania's annexation by the Russian Empire, the Julian calendar again became the norm, although a part of ethnic Lithuania left of Nemunas River (Suvalkija) retained the Gregorian calendar (see Aleksotas). The Russian Revolution of 1917 re-instated the Gregorian calendar, which had been the Western European standard for over a century, in January 1918. These changes caused some confusion before their usage became familiar.
Names of the months.
The standardization of month names was made difficult by the fact that publication in the Lithuanian language was illegal from 1864 to 1904 (see Lithuanian press ban) and some drift in the usages occurred. 
Month names are not customarily capitalized in the Lithuanian language, reflecting their secular origins. 
Trivia.
Some of the names are the same as those in the Polish calendar, where July ("Lipiec") is also named for the linden, and December ("Grudzień") also means, roughly, "frozen clod" (August, October and November also have semantically identical meanings although the words themselves are not cognate).
Days of the week.
The days of the week are named in sequence, beginning with Monday. They are "pirmadienis" ("first day"), "antradienis", "trečiadienis", "ketvirtadienis", "penktadienis", "šeštadienis", and "sekmadienis". They are not ordinarily capitalized.

Besan mehndi

Besan mehndi is a Hindu tradition which takes place once every 734.5 days. It is practiced in North India, taking place in four towns in particular:
The tradition was first established in 234 BC in Bareilly.
The towns were first determined by the first cattle of the first march's step. The direction of the step decided the direction of the town and the number of steps decided the distance of the town (one step being equal to 100 miles).
Originally, the towns were vast fields of grass and sand; the tradition marked them as places of interest, and so brought about many Hindus, many of whom decided to stay and so towns were set up.
Practice.
The actual tradition was started when a guru of a local Mandir in Bareilly decided to pour blessed rosewater over a sacred cow. The cow was deemed sacred as it had provided milk for a baby whose mother had died of malaria. According to the stories passed down generations, the cow began to float. It cried the Goddess of beauty's rāga. The guru kissed the cow on the top of the head, and later went on to live to the age of 130 as he was blessed. The tradition today is thousands of Hindus every two years commuting to the chosen town, typically by foot. A heard of female cattle walk on a circular field of flowers, which has a diameter of approximately 3 miles. They walk through the Falgu river, in Gaya, the river is often diluted with many litres of rosewater, in remembrance of Shringa-Sthan Gauri, the Guru who witnessed the sacred cow who was named Brahman, after the child she had fed.

Mitten im 8en

Mitten im 8en (or Mitten im Achten, abbreviated MiA)
was an Austrian TV soap/comedy series produced by the ORF
which ran from 10 May to 29 June 2007. The title translates to
"In the Middle of the 8th" (district), referring to Vienna's
Josefstadt. 
Repeatedly announced to be a core feature of the retuned
programming by ORF's new management, the show received extremely
bad ratings and devastating criticism from the start, and was
thus cancelled in the middle of its first season.
Setup.
MiA was set to air at 7:30 pm on weekdays on ORF1, replacing the main
evening newscast (Zeit im Bild), which until then was
broadcast on both ORF TV channels simultaneously.
The plot revolved around a family, a neighbouring flat share, and
a bar in Vienna. It showed a demagogic mix of stereotypical, 
one-dimensional characters, often drawing humor from their
incompatibility, and mocking cliches rather than providing real
identification figures.
The underlying concept was of John de Mol's, and was known to
have failed before in the Netherlands. For Austria it was redone
to combine Viennese humor and language style with slapstick and
sketch-like comedy as well as dramatic elements and focus on
character relationships.
Production.
Aware of losing many, especially younger viewers to German
private stations' daily soaps in that timeslot, ORF wanted to
offer a light dramedy-like series with a distinct Austrian
note. They also wished to respond to calls for a
domestic production, as opposed to the policy of buying
in German-dubbed U.S. sitcoms only.
MiA was shot entirely in studios on the outskirts of Vienna and
supplemented with a handful of outside establishing shots from
the "real" 8th district.
Among the actors were
kabarettists Gerold Rudle,
Angelika Niedetzky and Christoph Fälbl as well as the comedian
and TV show host Max Schmiedl. Most of the younger roles were
played by actors at the beginning of their careers. Due to ORF's
lack of authors and directors sufficiently experienced
in the genre, early production heavily relied on the assistance
of German personnel, who were planned to be gradually replaced by
Austrians as the show went on.
Journalists reported that test screenings had featured a laugh
track, anyway this was removed in the final version and replaced
by sound bits.
Reception.
The show is widely considered a total failure, with reactions
being tentative at best. Critics stated MiA was stuck between the
genres of soap opera and sitcom; its screenplays were said to be
too shallow to work as comedy *or* drama. Almost every
other part of the production was subject to scathing criticism as
well, including acting, directing and inaccuracy in depicting
Austrian (youth) culture.
MiA reheated the debate on public broadcasting's obligation to -
and definition of - quality programming, as well as its balance
between license fees and commercial
revenues. Namely the show was accused of excessive product placement. MiA was also heavily advertised outside the ORF
programmes, including posters, lottery games, ads in papers,
magazines, online and even on beer coasters.
Viewers' interest started out way below expectations and kept
shrinking throughout the whole season. Producers reacted by
having parts of the upcoming episodes rewritten to be less campy,
but negative reception from the media and the public
continued. Being a public foundation, ORF is supervised by
various boards representing the viewers as well as the parliamentary
constellation, most of which also supported the strong criticism
of MiA.
By the end of June 2007 MiA was eventually cancelled, closing with
a hastily written ending that skipped two years in the plot and
gave away the outcome to some major storylines. After that, the
rotation of Malcolm in the Middle was resumed as a
replacement.

She was inspired and influenced by Biblical teachings and the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson. She was taught by Emma Curtis Hopkins, the New Thought "teacher of teachers" and a student of Christian Science and Mary Baker Eddy.
Cady associated with several prominent figures in the New Thought movement of the time, including: Emma Curtis Hopkins, Divine Science minister Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes, founder of Religious Science, and Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, co-founders of Unity Church. "Finding The Christ in Ourselves", a pamphlet she had written and sent unsolicited to Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, was published by them in the October 1891 issue of "Thought". Beginning in 1892, a series of articles titled Lessons in Truth by Dr. Cady were published in "Unity" magazine. This material later was compiled into a book and was the first book published by Unity.
Death.
Cady died January 3, 1941 in New York City.

The attendance was around 55,000 and the event was dubbed the biggest festival in England, because Glastonbury was on its break year. It was the last of three consecutive years of Nokia sponsorship, which saw the likes of The Who, David Bowie and R.E.M. grace the Island stage.
New additions to the festival site included the Bandstand, which allowed local bands to perform, the Carling warm beer amnesty and the Strawberry fields a large area of bars and music venues. The festival achieved island-wide promotion by displaying the 2006 logo on Isle of Wight service buses. These buses were used to shuttle festival goers to a commemorative statue of Jimi Hendrix at Dimbola Lodge in Freshwater Bay near Afton Down (where the 1970 festival was staged).
The festival was filmed and highlights were shown on late night broadcasts on Channel 4.

But upon arrival in Martinique, Brody learns that Nicole has died from an apparent "heart attack". Brody is devastated. Later that evening, while wandering the streets of the town, Brody is attacked by a gang of thugs, but is rescued by a mysterious local man named George, who owns a fishing trawler and tells him that Nicole was a friend of his and she was killed because she knew that the crashed Concord flighted landed on a reef nearby and the two of them decide to investigate.
Meanwhile, a shady businessman named Milland (Joseph Cotten) and his business partner Danker (Edmund Purdom) learn about the Concord crash and after consulting with their associate, Martinez, plot to cover up any evidence involved with the crash. It becomes apparent that Milland and Danker are behind the events.
Brody and George are in a boat when they see Jean Beneyton jump off of the henchmen's boat and attempts to swim away before she is recaptured. Later, they arrive at the crash site and after doning scuba gear they find the wreck of the Concorde submerged under 100 feet of water in the Caribbean. While Brody goes inside the wreck, George gets his arm stuck in a jagged part of machinery and Brody has to amputate George's left arm to free him. Moses discovers explosive charges on the downed plane which were planted earlier by Milland's henchmen to destroy any evidence of foul play.
Upon surfacing, George gets hit in the goggles by a bullet as several henchmen in a speedboat appear and attack. Brody is forced to go back down under the water with two scuba men in chase. Brody outwits them by hiding in an underwater cave in which he goes back to the surface and pulls out the henchman who remained behind in the speedboard and steals it.
Brody then goes to the United States Consul of Martinique, and wants to start an investigation. He then takes them to the site and finds nothing. They call off the search for the missing Concorde. Brody then says that he saw Jean on a yacht. The Consul then says that if he knew it was Brody, he would have gotten him off the case as Brody was reporting a scandal concerning a Congressman.
Meanwhile, Milland and his men watch a video as the submerged Concorde explodes. They then find out that Jean is alive and being held for a $1 million ransom. At the same time, another Air France Concorde plane lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which prepares itself for a flight from Venezuela to London.
That evening, Brody sneaks on board the henchmen's boat, where he overhears them saying that they want to get rid of Jean and also overhears them talking about their superiors taking down a second Concorde flight. Brody rescues her and they escape from the boat. After reaching the shore, Brody tries talking to Jean about the crash, but she is so shaken by the traumatic experience that she can't remember very much. In the morning, they hitch a ride on a banana truck driven by a local farmer. But soon Milland's henchmen, led by Forsythe (Venantino Venantini) find Brody and Jean again and give chase, but they are cut off by a construction vehicle.
On board the airborne second Concorde, Flight 128, a crew member turns on one of the inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which same thing happened as with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts viles of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin.
In Martinique, Brody calls the Consul and has Jean begin to tell her story about it, but they are cut off as the henchmen are back. As the Consul calls up his associates in London with his ideas to what might be happening, the chase continues. The Concorde then loses radio contact with London control, and the cabin lights begin to flicker. Captain Scott soon regains contact with London, who suggests they run a circuit control. The London air traffic controller (Robert Kerman) also gets a call from Jean. The controller then reports they can't reach the Concorde. On board the plane, the navigator (Roberto Santi) then reports that pressure in the main cabin is dropping.
On the ground, Jean contacts the American Consul at a bank, but Forsythe and his henchmen arrive again, and she and Brody have to run. This time, the police are there and enter a shootout with the men in which all of the henchmen are killed.
Meanwhile, London Air Traffic Control gets radio contact with the Concorde on a VHF frequence. Captain Scott on the Concorde then descends the aircraft to a lower altitude below 12,000 feet, but London now can't get Concorde on the VHF frequency, either. Brody and Jean reach the American Consul and she begins describing what happened.
The Concorde banks and the number one engine overheats. London control reports that the crash began with overheating of the oven. The crew discovers the number one engine is now on fire, and they quickly extinguish it. The Concorde continues its descent, as one passenger becomes hysterical.
The plane then levels out at 9,000 feet. London control can now see them on radar, and proceed to clear a runway. Concorde then makes a beautiful landing. Brody is relieved.
The next day, Milland contacts Brody where he wants to offer him a shady contract after reading the headline "Concorde Passengers Saved by Journalist". Jean thinks that he'll get a big welcome in New York. Brody jokingly states that he doesn't have to go, and they laugh. He says he has to pay a visit "to a certain bigshot". Jean then gets on an Air France flight to return to Paris, but before she leaves he says he'll give her a call.
Brody then calls his friend Alfie and says that he wants to "push a certain Humpty Dumpty off his wall". He says he wants to know the heads of the top corporations in New York City, heavily involved in aircraft sales to South American countries, specifically those most hurt by competition from Concorde. The credits begin over footage of a Concorde in flight.

Leonard Sax

Leonard Sax is an American psychologist and a practicing family physician. He is best known as the author of three books for parents: 
"Boys Adrift", "Girls on the Edge", and "Why Gender Matters". According to his web site, he is currently employed as a physician at a healthcare facility in Chester County Pennsylvania, where he also resides.
Sax's views on gender differences are controversial and have received both praise and criticism. On his web site, Sax says that he wrote "Boys Adrift" and "Girls on the Edge" because he is concerned about "a growing proportion of girls who are anxious, depressed, and tired; girls who can tell you a great deal about what they "do" but not so much about who they "are." Likewise, we find a growing proportion of boys who are disengaged not only from school but from the real world. Those boys are comfortable in the virtual world, where they play their online video games, and/or surf the net for photographs of girls."
Biography.
Sax graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He completed the combined M.D.-Ph.D. program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. His Ph.D. was in psychology. He completed the 3-year residency in family practice at Lancaster General Hospital in 1989. In 1990, he founded Poolesville Family Practice, a primary care practice in Montgomery County, Maryland. He began an extended sabbatical from medical practice in June 2008. In December 2013, he returned to full-time clinical practice as an employee of Lancaster General Health.
Praise.
A March 7, 2005, cover story for "Time Magazine" included this statement: "Until recently, there have been two groups of people: those who argue sex differences are innate and should be embraced and those who insist that they are learned and should be eliminated by changing the environment. Sax is one of the few in the middle -- convinced that boys and girls are innately different and that we must change the environment so differences don't become limitations."
In an op-ed column in the "New York Times" published June 11, 2006, David Brooks calls Dr. Sax's first book, "Why Gender Matters", "a lucid guide to male and female brain differences."
Dr. Sax's second book, "Boys Adrift", was reviewed by the "Journal of the American Medical Association" (JAMA) in December 2007. According to the review, "Boys Adrift" is "powerfully and persuasively presented," and provides "excellent and informative references and information." The review concludes that "Boys Adrift is at its strongest in providing practical advice to parents about how to increase their sons' academic motivation; how to set appropriate limits on video game use; and how to protect their sons from the potential harm of psychotropic medications and environmental estrogens. Boys Adrift is at its weakest in supporting the thesis that there is an epidemic of unmotivated and underachieving young men."
Dr. Sax's third book "Girls on the Edge" was reviewed by "Library Journal" which called the book ". . .essential reading for parents and teachers, and one of the most thought-provoking books on teen development available.” Mark Bauerlein, professor at Emory University, reviewed "Girls on the Edge" for the Chronicle of Higher Education and called it "crucial" and said that "Parents of tween and teen girls would do well to check this book." "Booklist" called "Girls on the Edge" "persuasive, often fascinating . . .a holistic, sobering call to help the current generation of young women develop the support and sense of self that will allow them to grow into resilient adults.” According to a January 2011 review in the Atlantic magazine, "Girls on the Edge" is ". . .the best book about the current state of girls and young women in America."
Criticism.
Mark Liberman, a professor of linguistics and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, questioned on his blog, Language Log, many of the claims which Sax made in his first book "Why Gender Matters". Liberman asserted that there were serious problems with Sax's claims about sex differences in hearing, vision, and connections between emotions and language. Sax wrote to Liberman, and, receiving no reply, in October 2010 on the website of "Why Gender Matters", Sax acknowledged that points in his book were "out-of-date or inaccurate" and that his work, which was initially published in 2005, has been clarified by studies published by third parties in 2007 and 2009. He now provides updated references to scholarly papers on these three issues and he "expanded, updated, and corrected" the discussion of sex differences in hearing with a new article, "Sex Differences in Hearing", in October 2010; and the discussion of sex differences in vision is updated in chapter 5 of his book Girls on the Edge.
Sax's advocacy of single-sex public education has also attracted criticism. In 2008, "The New York Times Magazine" published a lengthy piece written by freelancer Elizabeth Weil, about half of which is about Sax (the other half is about single-sex education at, for example, the Young Women’s Leadership School in Harlem, New York City). The article asserts that "many academics and progressives tend to find Sax’s views stereotyped and infuriating". The article cites criticism by Michael Younger of the University of Cambridge as well as by Liberman. Sax responded on the NASSPE website that Weil's article is "awash in misrepresentations and distortions".
Cordelia Fine criticizes Sax's use of brain imaging in her talk that shared its name with her book, Delusions of Gender, at the 2010 Festival of Dangerous Ideas
Sax' advocacy of single-sex education was also criticized in an article "The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling" by Diane F. Halpern and others.
National and international media.
Sax has contributed articles and made appearances in the popular media in a number of English-speaking countries. In the United States, Sax was a guest on the "Today" show during February 2005 and July 2007. Matt Lauer interviewed Sax about the controversy surrounding boys' achievement, which was the topic of the cover story in "Time" that week. Al Roker interviewed Sax about his book "Why Gender Matters". In Canada, Sax was a guest in the Toronto studio of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for an interview broadcast nationwide in January 2008. In Australia, Sax was a guest in the studio for the "Today Show", interviewed by Jessica Rowe. In New Zealand, Sax was a studio guest of New Zealand's Channel One in May 2008 for a discussion of single-sex public education. In the United Kingdom, Sax was the subject of a full-page feature article in "The Times", and was also featured in an article which appeared in the "Daily Mail" during January 2008.
In May 2010, Sax was a guest on CNN's "American Morning", discussing his book "Girls on the Edge" and some of the challenges facing girls in the era of texting and Facebook. He returned as a guest on national television in New Zealand in August that year, discussing the girl-specific challenges of 'the cyberbubble'. He was again a guest on CNN's "American Morning" during the same month, discussing recent research suggesting that ADHD is over-diagnosed in American schoolchildren.

Edmund Barry Gaither

Edmund Barry Gaither is known for his education and museum-related activities. 
He was born in 1944 in Great Falls, a small town in South Carolina, USA. His interest and passion for art began at an early age, but because he grew up in a small town, he had no way to visit museums. After high school, Edmund Gaither attended Morehouse College in Georgia, only male historically black college in the United States. College was an extremely important time for Gaither, because it allowed him access to the artwork he had such a passion for, a population where he fit in, and an atmosphere to find himself. 
Gaither graduated Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts and went on to further his education at Brown University. He graduated from Brown with a Masters in Fine Arts in 1968. In 1969, Gaither became a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He went on to found the National Center of Afro-American Artists, located in Roxbury, Massachusetts. The Center has become a vitally important showcase of African-American artists and culture for Boston and the United States. 
A love for education led Gaither to develop a course on African-American art at which he served as a lecturer at various colleges across the nation. Some of these institutions included Spelman College (1968-1969), Massachusetts College of Art (1970-1971), Harvard College (1972-1975), and Wellesley College (1971-1974). Gaither also taught a course in African American studies at Boston University. 
He was a respected individual in the museum field and served many positions, some including Commission on Museums for a New Century, Commission on Equity and Excellence, and Museums and Communities, American Alliance of Museums. Outside the museum world, he served on President George W. Bush’s Advisory Board on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Gaither was the first president of the African American Museums Association.

Spy video car

The Spy Video Car is a hybrid product created by mixing a traditional RC car and a video baby monitor. The remote controller communicates digital command via the 49 MHz frequency to the car for control, and the camera on the car transmits video via the 2.4 GHz frequency to the remote controller for display. Because both directions use different radio frequency, they do not interfere with each other. The single-lensed display with a zoom lens produces a bigger virtual image in front of the operator, creating a first-person point of view feel for the driver.
Wild Planet launched it for the 2006 Christmas season. It may be the first RC toy with built-in camera in the US market, and it also received the 2007 T.O.T.Y (Toy of The Year) award at the American International Toy Fair.
Technical details.
"Video System:"
Inside the car body is a transmitting RF module (Richwave "RW67TX-NA03") and a black-and-white camera module (based around the OmniVison OV5116 IC). Similarly, the remote control unit contains a corresponding video receiver (Richwave "RW67RX-NA03") and a 3.5 mm phono jack which carries the video signal to the headset. The headset is based around the Kopin CyberDisplay 300M LV LCD and A300 controller IC. It contains simple optics and a diffused, white LED backlight. All of the components run on a 9v DC source (each has its own voltage regulator), and the Rx/Tx set operates on the 2.4 GHz range.
"Vehicular System:"
The radio and motor-control circuits are similar to those commonly used in other radio-controlled toys. The radio set operates in the 27/49 MHz range, with non-proportional control over steering and forward-and-reverse movement. The motors and gearboxes used to propel and steer the car are fairly typical of RC toys, though they have been designed for quiet operation rather than speed or power, allowing the vehicle to run almost silently.

Food desert

A food desert is a geographic area where affordable and nutritious food is difficult to obtain, particularly for those without access to an automobile. Food deserts usually exist in rural areas and low-income communities. Some research links them to diet-related health problems in affected populations. Food deserts are sometimes associated with supermarket shortages and food security. The concept is controversial, and not universally accepted. 
Definitions.
The term "food desert" is first documented in a 1995 United Kingdom government report from a working group in the Nutrition Task Force Low Income Project Team of the Department of Health and was originally defined as "populated areas with little or no food retail provision" or more specifically “areas of relative exclusion where people experience physical and economic barriers to accessing healthy foods”.
In general, there is no specific agreed-upon definition for the term. An initial definition counts the type and quality of foods available for purchase and the neighborhood residents being impoverished and unable to buy such foods. A second definition takes into account "access, or the degree to which individuals live within close proximity to a large supermarket or supercenter", which offers "consumers a wider array of food choices at relatively lower costs." Such a definition weights "the number, type and size of food stores available to residents." One study counted food deserts as "urban areas with 10 or fewer (grocery) stores and no stores with more than 20 employees." The existence of multiple definitions which can even change by country and the uncertainty over the exact measures by which a food desert can be recognized have fueled controversy over the existence of food deserts.
Maps, showing the distribution of food deserts in the United States can be found in Morton and Blanchard's 2007 article.
Despite differences in terminology, most research in the United States supports the hypothesis that on the neighborhood level, there are disparities in the retail food environment.
Origin and theories for development.
“Land-use policies that facilitate development of predominantly wealthy and white suburban neighborhoods” have altered the distribution of food stores. In the interest of profitability, larger supermarkets have followed this trend and are most prevalent in these white suburban neighborhoods. Prevalence of food deserts in poorer neighborhoods is driven by lack of consumer demand, as the poor have less money to spend on healthful, nutritious food. From an economic standpoint, low demand does not justify supply. Food retailers are also discouraged from opening chains in low-income rural and urban communities because of crime rates, transportation costs and low return of investment. Furey et al. describes food desert creation as arising where “high competition from large chain supermarkets has created a void”. As a result, the food supply within inner cities includes less variety, denying some urban residents the benefits of healthful foods at affordable prices. Remaining food retailers in inner-cities are gas stations, convenience stores, tobacco stores, drugstores, and liquor stores. A diet based on foods from these locations consists primarily of processed foods high in calories, sugars, salt, fat, and artificial ingredients.
Access to quality food.
The main factor used to classify a community as a food desert is distance from nutritional food retailers. There is no standard for “inadequate” access or “adequate” access to foods. This can be a limited classification and scientific limitation as individuals may live close to a retailer that provides nutritious food, but this food may be more expensive, creating an additional barrier to access. Access to food is calculated by distance of consumer residence to nearest supermarket or grocery store. Distance is measured from centroid of an area (by zip code, census tract, or block) to nearest supermarket or grocery store. Standards of access and methods of measurement vary among researchers to determine food deserts. Research suggests food deserts exist if consumer residence is one to ten miles away from the nearest supermarket. Other measurements include “urban areas with 10 or fewer stores with no more than 20 employers”. The USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan aims to standardize the methods of assessment for the availability and price of foods in stores.
Residents of food desert areas have no alternative but to utilize private cars, travel several miles on foot, or use public transit to gain access to healthful food. Consumers without cars are dependent on food sources in their closest proximity. Ownership and access to a vehicle may be the best marker for access regardless of Socioeconomic status. A study by Inagami reveals that the distance traveled to food stores is an independent predictor of BMI. The problem increases in rural food desert areas, where closing the distance to nutritional food access is impossible on foot.
Researchers have determined that distance to food is also psychological. The physical distance from fresh foods determine eating behaviors and preferences for palatable, processed foods. To create a healthy relationship with food, researchers recommend creating a direct connection between fresh produce and consumer. Examples of this include urban farm programs and incorporating healthful foods in schools.
According to a report to Congress prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, assessing the extent of limited access to affordable, nutritious food, approximately 2.4 million households in the United States are more than a mile from a supermarket and lack access to a vehicle. The physical distance from full service supermarkets leaves residents of these areas to be more likely to purchase food from convenience stores or corner shops that stock mainly cheap, processed foods or foods high in fats and sugars.
Affordability.
Research indicates that low-income households shop where food prices are lower, and generally cannot afford healthful foods. Compared with residents of higher-income neighborhoods, low SES individuals generally have diets higher in meat and processed foods with a low intake of fruits and vegetables. It has been suggested that people of low socioeconomic status ultimately spend up to 37% more on their food purchases, due to smaller weekly food budgets and poorly stocked grocery stores.
Fringe food retailers in food deserts can have a 30-60% markup on prices, provide a limited selection of products and a dominant marketing of processed foods. Comparing prices that consumers pay for similar foods purchased at a different outlets determines disparities in real food prices. Low-income individuals are more likely to purchase inexpensive fats and sugars over fresh fruits and vegetables that are more expensive on a per calorie basis. Nutritious foods such as whole grain products and fresh fruits and vegetables are more expensive than high calorie junk foods. “Energy-dense foods cost on average $1.76 per 1,000 calories, compared with $18.16 per 1,000 calories for low-energy but nutritious foods”. Brown rice at Walmart costs less than $1.00 per pound, or $0.60 per 1,000 calories. Lentils and other uncooked, nutritious beans are similarly priced as of September 2013.
Rural food deserts.
A rural food desert is generally classified as a county where residents must drive more than 10 miles to the nearest supermarket chain or supercenter, whereas an urban food desert is classified as having to drive more than a mile. Using this definition, twenty percent of rural counties are considered food deserts. Within these counties, there are approximately 2.4 million individuals determined to have low access to a large supermarket. This number may underestimate or overestimate those truly at risk of food insecurity since it only takes into account the number of individuals 10 miles or more away from the nearest supermarket. There may be individuals that live closer, however if they don’t have a vehicle or public transportation, then even being just a mile away can present access issues. Likewise there may be a large portion of this population with easy access to a vehicle, which regularly drives more than 10 miles to buy food. This is an unfortunate data limitation in studies of rural food deserts.
There is an increased risk of rural food deserts as market pressures continue to negatively impact small grocers. Smaller grocers in rural areas struggle to be profitable for many reasons, such as low sales volumes, which can cause costs of goods to increase or make it difficult to purchase large volumes of perishable foods. This in turn creates issues with meeting wholesale food supplier’s minimum purchasing requirements. “Economies of scale, which is when the costs of operating a store decrease as store size increases, and economies of scope, which is when the costs decrease as more product variety increases, suggests that larger stores that offer greater variety can do so and offer lower prices. Both factors may account for the ability of larger stores to survive more easily than smaller stores.” Small grocers tend to offer less variety and less produce as a result.
The market pressures experienced by small grocers in rural areas also lend to groceries being more expensive in these areas than in urban areas. For example, in New Mexico the same basket of groceries cost $85 for rural residents, and $55 for urban residents. However, this is not true of all rural areas. A study in Iowa showed that four rural food desert counties had lower costs on key foods that make up a nutritionally balanced diet than did the nearby larger supermarkets. This suggests an area in which further research is needed.
Barriers to food access for elderly living in rural food deserts
As of 2007, the elderly made up 7.5 million of the 50 million people living in rural America. The U.S Census website includes maps showing the percentage of residents aged 65 and older. Of these elderly citizens, nearly a half million live in rural food deserts and are food insecure, while many more may be at risk.
There are many barriers to healthful, affordable food for elderly living in rural food deserts. First of all, most elderly live on a fixed income. According to a study of rural seniors living in the Brazos Valley by Sharkey, et al., about 14% of respondents indicated that on a monthly basis household food supplies did not last, 13% could not afford to eat balanced meals, and 8.3% of respondents had to cut the size of their meals or skip meals altogether. A second issue faced by seniors is that they struggle with limited mobility. This can mean anything from having difficulty cooking and moving about their home, to not having a car or anyone nearby who could drive them to a store. Older persons and those with limited incomes are more likely to be dependent on family, friends, neighbors and others for transportation to purchase food. Older women are more likely than men to stop driving at younger ages or to have never driven, and minority women are even less likely to drive. Additionally, the death rate from motor vehicle accidents among those ages 75 and older is second only to (and virtually identical with) the highest risk group of those ages 15–25.
A third concern is that elderly have higher nutrient needs and are less able to tolerate the high sodium and sugar content typically found in processed foods. As people age, the degree of nutrient absorption in their digestive tract declines. Also, elderly tend to have existing diseases and/or take medications that interfere with nutrient absorption. There is evidence that elderly people living in rural areas suffer from inadequate nutrition intake due to low diet variety. If an elderly individual does not have a reliable source and access to an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables, as is the case in rural food deserts, their health is put in jeopardy and sets them up for future ailments.
Lastly, some seniors have time constraints that make it difficult to perform daily activities such as food shopping, especially when they are living with a sick spouse requiring a lot of their time and care. And for those who have recently lost a spouse and are suffering from depression, the desire to go to the store or cook for themselves can be greatly diminished, especially in the case of widows.
Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities.
Health disparities related to food access and consumption are associated with residential segregation, low incomes, and neighborhood deprivation.
In a study on urban food environments, participants described the lack of supermarkets as both a “practical impediment to healthful food purchase and a symbol of their neighborhoods’ social and economic struggles". Within cities, there are more than three times as many supermarkets in wealthier neighborhoods compared with poorer areas. Residents in low-income urban areas are often “forced to depend on small stores with limited selections of foods at substantially higher prices”.
Research has found parallel trends between high rates of obesity and individuals of low SES and non-white ethnicity, particularly in the case of women. Research by Morland "et al.", found that areas with a majority of convenience stores have a higher prevalence of overweight and obese individuals, compared to areas with only supermarkets. Fast food restaurants are disproportionately placed in low-income and minority neighborhoods, and are often the closest and cheapest food options. "People living in the poorest SES areas have 2.5 times the exposure to fast-food restaurants as those living in the wealthiest areas". The lack of adequate food sources and limited transportation available to low-income communities are contributing factors to malnutrition among those living in low SES neighborhoods.
Research has documented inequalities of access to supermarkets in urban city areas, and found a difference in access to supermarkets in poor vs non-poor areas. A study by Baker "et al.", found that mixed-race areas were significantly less likely to have access to foods that adhere to a healthful diet compared to predominantly white, high income areas. Research by Mari Gallagher has found that African Americans are farther from healthful foods than other racial groups. The availability of supermarkets in African American neighborhoods is 52% of their prevalence in white neighborhoods. Moreover, Morland’s study of food-frequency data in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study revealed that dominantly white populations had five times more supermarkets than neighborhoods with a dominantly non-white population. African Americans who lived in the same census tract with access to a supermarket were more likely to meet dietary guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption. For each additional supermarket, an increase of 32% in fruit and vegetable intake was found.
A 2010 study by Michael Correll published by the "Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy" entitled “Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender and Obesity in America," analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assess the health outcomes of women participating in the government Food Stamps and Temporary Aid to Needy Families programs. The study primarily examines and critiques the structure of current social welfare policies, but it also notes: 1) Many of the participants in the food stamps program live in “food deserts." Some 25% of food stamps participants do not have easy access to a supermarket; and 2) Under welfare-to-work reforms enacted in 1996, an adult recipient must have 30 hours a week of “work activity” to receive these benefits. Because many women are single with children and thus have limited time, this work obligation may limit their ability to travel to find nutritious foods, prepare healthful meals for themselves and their families, and exercise.
Prevalence of obesity is generally higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Socioeconomic factors inhibit access to private cars as well as limited reliable public transportation.
Research.
Initial research on food deserts explored the impact of retail flight from the urban core. More recent studies have explored the impact of food deserts in other geographic areas (e.g., rural and frontier), as well as among specific populations, such as minorities and elderly people. Studies of urban and rural food environments reveal significant potential for evidence-based interventions and policies to combat the growing obesity epidemic, and to decrease some health disparities. “Multilevel, mixed methods studies offer the potential to provide a more complete picture of the direct and perceived environmental influences on healthy behaviors".
A 2011 study published in the "Archives of Internal Medicine", “Fast Food Restaurants and Food Stores,” used 15 years of data on more than 5,000 young adults 18–30 years old in a variety of places around the United States. The study's findings include: 1) Higher levels of fast food consumption were strongly correlated to fast food availability, particularly among low-income men with fast food restaurants within 1.00 to 2.99 km of their homes. A 1% increase in fast food availability within 1 km and 3 km of the home was associated with a 0.13% and 0.34% increase in fast food consumption, respectively; 2) Greater proximity to supermarkets was not correlated in any consistent fashion with diet outcomes, nor was it associated with fruit and vegetable intake levels; 3) There were no consistent or strong correlations between neighborhood fast food availability and individual consumption of fast food for women of any income level; 4) On average, men of all income levels consumed fast food 2.1 times a week, while their female counterparts consumed such food only 1.6 times. The study’s authors conclude that by “promoting greater access to supermarkets, several U.S. policies aim to improve diets through provision of affordable healthful foods, particularly fresh produce in underserved areas. Our findings do not support this initiative in young to middle-aged adults. Rather, they suggest that adding neighborhood supermarkets may have little benefit to diet quality across the income spectrum and that alternative policy options such as targeting specific foods or shifting food costs (subsidization or taxation) should be further considered.”
A 2009 study of rural food deserts found a number of key differences in overall health, access to food, and the social environment when compared with urban environments. In terms of health, rural residents report overall poorer health and more physical limitations, with 12% of them rating their health as fair or poor, compared to 9% of urban residents Communities that are smaller and isolated from urban influences have decreased access to the broader global market and consequently have fewer choices in food retailers. Lack of competition in the community not only restricts access to food resources, but can also result in higher food costs. Respondents in this study felt that food quality and variety in their area were poor at times. The authors also found that although personal factors impact eating behavior for rural people, it is the physical and social environments that place constraints on food access, even in civically engaged communities.
But the study of food deserts requires further research, including longitudinal studies of food environments, to support associations with obesity and to support neighborhood interventions. Longitudinal studies “permit temporal associations” between exposure to nutritious food and obesity. They also provide historical data on grocery store location, nutritional environments, and data associated with life-course exposure to food.
Future research is required to overcome the barriers facing residents of food deserts, including retail trends and location of supermarkets, in order that food retailers and city planners may develop multilevel interventions to address barriers to health at the individual and environmental level. Studies that examine geographic differences in the access and availability of food, as well as nutritional quality of food, provide information for public health to explain disparities.
Other recent studies have shown some correlations between food availability and health, including a 2010 study that correlated distance from supermarkets with increases in body mass index. Among elderly people in particular, malnutrition caused by inadequate access to food can lead to other health risks. For those suffering from weight loss and undernutrition, risks include increased and longer hospitalizations, early admission to long term care facilities, and overall increased morbidity and mortality. Nutritional disorders with co-morbidities are the ninth most frequent diagnostic category among hospitalized rural elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Elderly adults struggling with obesity and overnutrition related to limited food choices are at risk of exacerbating existing chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, and increased functional decline.
Barriers and proposed solutions in the United States.
Access is not the only determinant to healthful eating. There are many environmental determinants that predict a positive outcome in healthful eating for residents of current food desert areas, such as transportation, culture, social capital, and food price. A criticism of current research on food access and obesity assumes a “simplistic deprivation effect associated with poor-quality food environments".
Audit research suggests that supermarkets are the most effective way to supply communities with a wide selection of fresh and relatively affordable healthful food. Moreover, supermarkets typically are open year-round, provide convenient hours of operation, and generally accept Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT). As a result, many programs focus on increasing incentives for supermarkets to operate in these underserved areas. Some incentives include property or sales tax breaks. Community-level interventions that focus on getting healthful food to low-income areas through farmers markets, mobile carts or community gardens.
One community intervention that increases food access is the community garden. Community gardens enable individuals to grow their own food on a designated area of land that is shared with other community members. Community garden programs successfully increased access to affordable, nutritious food in rural, suburban and urban areas. They also help strengthen community and social support for participants.
The USDA released an extensive report to Congress in 2009 as a request to reform the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The study outlines a list of recommendations for addressing access issues in food deserts that include the above options, but also includes transportation reform as a solution. Transportation is a significant barrier in rural food deserts (rural realities). Evaluating current transportation in these communities and developing community-specific solutions can target populations limited by current transportation options (rural realities). According to Morton and Blanchard, there is a need to address the added complications of individuals living in these isolated communities. Proposed solutions include utilizing a combination of public and private resources. Current transit assistance and meal-provisioning programs that are already established in many communities, such Meals on Wheels, have initiatives that focus on providing food residents with limited mobility and ability to shop at traditional food retailers.
In early 2010 the Obama administration unveiled the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) that will promote a range of interventions that expand access to nutritious foods, including developing and equipping grocery stores and other small businesses and retailers selling healthful food in communities that currently lack these options. The initiative provided more than $400 million in funding intended to bring grocery stores and healthful food retailers to low-income rural and urban communities. This effort is in concert with Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign to counter childhood obesity. The initiative receives funding from the Treasury Department, Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services.
Several states and cities within the United States are also implementing comprehensive programs that involve public-private partnership and a combination of financing initiatives and community-level interventions. The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Intitative, for example is a public-private partnership aimed at encouraging the development of new supermarkets by providing grants of up to $250,000 or loans of up to $2.5 million per store to defray the infrastructure costs of developing a new store. So far, $41.8 million in grants and loans have funded 58 stores.
The New York City FRESH program (Food Retail Expansion Health) is one of the most comprehensive attempts to increase access to full-service grocery stores in underserved areas. They offer an abatement of land or building taxes for a period of 25 years and a sales tax exemption on building materials.
Community-level interventions are useful in that they are less expensive and easier to implement than programs that encourage the creation of new stores. They require less space, promote local farmers and increase community and social capital.
Citizens of a rural community in North Carolina collaborated to develop and implement a solution to the problem of access to food in Bertie County, the poorest in the state. Community members, in conjunction with a class at the public high school, designed and constructed a pavilion to serve as the home for a local farmers’ market. This is one example of committed civic engagement, which can be a strong determinant in the successful development of community-specific solutions and improved access to food. Community involvement and the incorporation of local organizations and volunteerism can improve the effectiveness of food safety nets and alternative solutions such as community gardens.
However, farmers markets can be costly for low-income individuals living in these communities. The City of New York has implemented several community-level initiatives such as increasing the number farmers markets in underserved areas and increasing their use by residents through the Health Bucks program. This program offers $2 coupons purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables at participating farmers markets. This program was intended to reduce barriers to access based on affordability. Through this program, EBT sales at farmers’ markets more than doubled from $40,000 in 2007 to over $89,000 in 2008. The program is being expanded into upstate New York as the Fresh Bucks program.
Another proposed solution involves increased local food production and distribution in urban centers. The New York City Regional Foodshed is an initiative examining the local food production capacity of the New York City Metropolitan Region.

National colours of Germany

The national colours of Germany are officially Black, Red and Gold, defined by article 22 sec. 2 of the German Basic Law constitution on the flag of Germany: "Die Bundesflagge ist schwarz-rot-gold." ("The federal flag shall be black, red, and gold.").
The colours were used by nationalist and democratic revolutionaries since the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, and can be recognized in Holy Roman Empire symbols since the Middle Ages. The "Gold" ("Or") is nearly always represented by a shade of Yellow, as there is no distinct color "Yellow" in heraldry; they both count as "Gold".
Origins.
Though the medieval Holy Roman Empire knew no national colours, a black eagle, referring to the Roman "Aquila" standard, displayed on a gold shield with red trim had been used on the semi-official "Reichsadler" of the Emperor since the 12th century. The Imperial colours Black and Gold were adopted by many Imperial cities to underline their immediacy; when the last Habsburg emperor Francis II abdicated from the throne in 1806, he adopted the colours as the flag of his Austrian Empire.
The colours Black, Red and Gold were used e.g. at the election of Frederick Barbarossa as King of the Romans on 4 March 1152 in Frankfurt. According to contemporary sources, the new king's way from Frankfurt Cathedral to the Römer square was covered with a coloured carpet, which was afterwards cut into numerous small parts and distributed to the crowds. A red armed, beaked and langued Imperial eagle was used from the 14th century onwards, as depicted in the Codex Manesse about 1304. According to Friedrich Engels ("The Peasant War in Germany", 1850), the insurgents of the 1525 German Peasants' War marched against the Princes under a Black, Red an Gold banner.
Wars of Liberation.
Uniforms of the Lützow Free Corps during the German campaign (1813–1814) against French occupation under Napoleon also consisted of a combination of black, red and gold—though mainly for functional reasons: the corps under command of the Prussian major Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow was made up of volunteer university students from all over Germany, whose varied clothing was uniformly coloured in black, festooned with common brass knobs and red facings. The Uhlan forces used Red and Black lance pennons.
The Black, Red and Gold resembling the former Imperial colours soon became symbols of the German struggle for freedom, symbolizing the road from servitude (black) through bloody fight (red) to the stars (gold), similar to the "per aspera ad astra". This interpretive culture was perpetuated in the memory of venerated martyrs like Theodor Körner. The Red and Black colours with a golden oak leaf cluster were adopted as "couleur" by the first German national "Urburschenschaft" student fraternity established on 12 June 1815 in Jena, and publicly displayed on the 1817 Wartburg Festival.
The students' hopes of a national awakening dashed with the implementation of the German Confederation, not a nation state but a loose federation of the German monarchs, who by the 1819 reactionary Carlsbad Decrees banned any fraternity activities. Since then Black, Red and Gold tricolour became a widespread symbol of the pursuit of liberty, democracy and liberal unity, thus the colours were used on horizontal tri-colour flags by Lützow veterans and other democratic revolutionaries of the Hambach Festival in 1832, and in the Revolutions of 1848.
March Revolution.
As a result of the 1848 revolutions, the Federal Convention of the German monarchs, who had continued the use of the Imperial Eagle coat of arms in 1815, also adopted the tricolour ("from German time immemorial") in order to steady the nationalist unrest. Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria had the Black, Red, and Gold flag hoisted on St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and showed himself with the flag on a window of Hofburg Palace. In Berlin, King Frederick William IV of Prussia had to bow to the fallen insurgents of the liberation movement and to wear a Black, Red and Gold armband while riding through the city.
When on 18 May 1848 the Frankfurt Parliament first convened, the city streets were decorated in the "German colours" like the assembly room in St. Paul's Church. On November 12, the parliament passed a resolution whereafter Black, Red and Gold became the German war and merchant flag. However, as official flag of the German Confederation, the tricolour was mainly used in the small Imperial fleet (Reichsflotte), which was dissolved already by 1852. The Frankfurt Constitution adopted in 1849 and never carried into effect, omitted any provision of national symbols. After the dissolution of the Frankfurt Parliament, the tricolour vanished from public space. Mocked by Heinrich Heine as "Old-Germanic rubbish", it nevertheless remained the official flag of the German Confederation, "revitalized" in 1866 as the banner of Austria and her allies in the War with Prussia and the North German states.
Black, White and Red.
After the war and the break-up of the German Confederation, the Prussian-led North German Confederation was established at the instance of Minister-President Otto von Bismarck to answer the German question. Another colour scheme was desired, as the Black and Gold colours were associated with Austria. From 1867, the Black, White and Red colours became the flag of the newly established federated state; the tricolour derived from the Prussian Black and White colours, and the White and Red flag of the North German Hanseatic cities.
Since the 13th century, a Black cross on White coat had been carried by medieval Teutonic Knights which had founded the State of the Teutonic Order in Prussia. Their Grand Master Hermann von Salza received the rights to bear the Imperial black eagle by the 1226 Golden Bull of Rimini, issued by Emperor Frederick II, to indicate that he enjoyed Imperial immediacy as a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. When the Teutonic state was secularized in 1525 as Duchy of Prussia, the black eagle on a white shield became the Prussian coat of arms. The ruling House of Hohenzollern also had a Black and White family coat of arms.
In addition to the Black and White of Prussia, the White and Red colours of the former Hanseatic League were added. Even though this medieval international trade organization had lost its influence over two centuries earlier, the "city-states" of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, all former Free Imperial Cities, took pride in their centuries-old Hanse tradition. The navy commander Prince Adalbert of Prussia strongly advocated the implementation of a combined tricolour of Prussian Black and White and Hanseatic White and Red as war flag and civil ensign. Bismarck ("I don't care whatsoever about those colors! Whatever, green and yellow and dancing pleasure, or the flag of Mecklenburg-Strelitz...") made no objections.
From the 1871 German unification until 1918, Black, White and Red were widely accepted as the national colours of the German Empire, though they were not officially adopted as Imperial flag by law before 1892. At that time, German nationalism under the rule of Emperor Wilhelm II had overcome Prussian traditions and the colours had evolved to a symbol of German imperialistic politics. Numerous German associations embraced the patriotic tricolour, sports organisations that had been founded prior to World War I often choose White with additional Black and/or Red as their colours.
State colours.
In the German Revolution of 1918–19, Black, White and Red were abandoned drawing on the "democratic" Black, Red and Gold colours of 1848. In view of Germany's unfortunate position after the lost war and under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, monarchist and German National forces advocated the retention of the "Imperial colours" as a matter of national pride. Until then and up to today, Black, White and Red are often associated with right wing radicalism because of the use by right wing parties and later in far-right circles.
Weimar Republic.
Though even liberal deputies in the Weimar National Assembly spoke against a change of colours, Article 3 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 determined Black, Red and Gold both for the tri-colour national flag and the eagle coat of arms of the Weimar Republic. Considering the preceding debates however, the former Black, White and Red colours were retained as the German civil ensign, with Black, Red and Gold in the upper left corner. Not until 1922, the "Reichskriegsflagge" banner was officially outlawed on ships of the German Navy. The official Black, Red and Gold colours were refused by wide circles in the Reichswehr armed forces and World War I veterans' associations.
The issue of the national colours was, however, continuously debated in the German society. "Studentenverbindung" organisations emphasized the Greater German meaning of Black, Red and Gold, which have actually been frustrated by the Allied Powers prohibiting the accession of German Austria. Most of the centrist political parties were in favour of the new colours, but many people of all different political views still felt that Black, White and Red were the true colours of Germany. The flag of the Weimar Republic was insulted by conservatives and nationalists, Communists and Nazis alike, who sometimes referred to it as "black-red-yellow" or even "black-red-mustard". Still in 1921, even Gustav Stresemann, chairman of the national liberal German People's Party argued for the reintroduction of Black, White and Red. In May 1926, the German government of Chancellor Hans Luther had to resign after a quarrel over the display of flags at German embassies.
To encounter antidemocratic forces, the "Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold" was founded by members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Catholic Centre Party, and the (liberal) German Democratic Party in 1924. Led by the Social Democrat Otto Hörsing, the defined goal of the organisation was to defend the colours and the parliamentary values they represented. Initially a league of World War I veterans, the "Reichsbanner" soon evolved to a mass organisation with a membership of more than three million. Increasingly attacked by SA, Stahlhelm and Rotfrontkämpferbund paramilitary groups, it joined forces with the ADGB and AfA trade unions to form the democratic Iron Front. With the Weimar democracy, the Black, Red and Gold colours went down fighting.
Nazi rule.
Yet, upon the Nazi "Machtergreifung" when Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, the "democratic" colours quickly came out of use, though they were not officially abolished. By order of March 7, two days after the German federal election, Reich President Paul von Hindenburg re-introduced Black, White and Red as official decorations on the coming "Volkstrauertag" public holiday. Alongside the swastika flag of the Nazi Party, the Imperial colours were restored as a provisional national symbol, subject to a final decision by the German government. The concurrent Nazi flag also used a combination of black, white and red colours, but not in the same way as the old flag of the German Empire. Instead, the "socialist" red was the dominant colour.
After Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler styled himself "Führer" and Reich Chancellor. By law of 15 September 1935 he declared Black, White and Red again the national colours but made his own Nazi Party swastika the sole national flag and civil ensign of Germany. National conservative protests had become silent. In a speech, Reichtsag president Hermann Göring called the Black, White and Red flag of the German Empire "honorably pulled down".
Post-war.
After World War II, Germany was occupied and divided. Both new states founded in 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), took up the colours of black, red and gold again, with the GDR adding their socialist symbols in 1959. As a compromise, the Olympic United Team of Germany, which had first competed in 1956, had to add white Olympic rings to the flag for the games of 1960 and 1964, and also for 1968 when two separate German teams entered under common symbols. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, East German citizens cut out the socialist symbols of the East German flag in order to show support for a unification with West Germany, which had also continued the use of the traditional eagle coat of arms, called "Bundesadler".
In the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949), and especially after the 1960s, only very far-right parties use Black, White and Red, especially (radical) conservatives and neonazis. Right-wing populist and national conservative parties, for example The Republicans, pointedly display Black, Red and Gold in their logo. Beside the right wing extremists only the very small group of monarchists display the old colours.
Use of colours in sports etc..
German sports teams often use White as main colour, as organisations that had been founded prior to 1919 often have chosen the prussian colours: White with additional Black and sometimes Red. Examples are the German national football team fielded by the German Football Association (DFB) since 1908, German track and field athletes and rowers who use a red chest ring, and German race cars, which were, according to the international auto racing colour scheme, painted white with red numbers (since 1934, Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union have used unpainted metal, or Silver).
After 1918 and 1945, Black-Red-Gold became national colours (again). Organisations founded in that time frame, like the German American Football Association (AFVD) or the German Organisation of Non-Olympic sports IGNOV, often use black-red-gold in their colours, mostly on a white background. In recent years, most national teams of older organisations have added black-red-gold trim to their dresses.

Toyota All-Star Showdown

The Toyota All-Star Showdown was a nonpoints, all-star race that brought together the top drivers in NASCAR's lower-level series.
It was inaugurated in 2003, and all six events so far have been held at Toyota Speedway at Irwindale in suburban Los Angeles. Historically held in October or November, NASCAR moved the 2008 season event to January 23–24, 2009, after all of NASCAR's regional series had finished their 2008 seasons. The Showdown was cancelled in 2011. It was replaced starting in 2013 by the UNOH Battle At The Beach.
2006 format.
In 2006, the Showdown was a two-race card, as it had been throughout its brief history. One was for drivers in the AutoZone Elite Division, comprising the Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest divisions. The other was for drivers in the Grand National Division, which was made up of the Busch East and AutoZone West Divisions.
The top 15 drivers in points in each of the two Grand National series comprised the field for that division's race for a total of 30, while the top 10 drivers in points in each of the four Elite series set the field for that division's race, or 40 in total.
On Friday night, the fields were split in half and the drivers competed in qualifying races (akin to the Gatorade Duel) to determine the starting lineup for the following night's main event. The drivers with the worst position in their respective division's standings started at the front of the field, and the lineups were filled by alternating the series. (For example, a Northwest driver followed by a Southeast driver followed by a Southwest driver followed by a Midwest driver.)
Drivers in the first race took the inside lanes for the Saturday main event, while those in the second race took the outside lane. All drivers entered automatically qualified for the main race.
2007 format.
The 2007 Showdown was held October 19–20, again at Irwindale Speedway, with a new two-day format.
The first race became a 150-lap Super Late Model race held on the Friday night, with any Super Late Model racer who races in a NASCAR Whelen All-American Series track eligible for the event.
The Grand National race featured major changes:
The format change was required because the Elite Division is no longer in place. NASCAR disbanded the division after the 2006 season.
2008 season format.
A major criticism of the format was that because of the All-Star Showdown date, it could result in the race being held before certain major races (such as the ones at Phoenix International Raceway on Sprint Cup weekend) could be held before the Showdown. NASCAR had a problem with the Corona Series still in progress before the Showdown.
Thus, NASCAR moved the race to January 2009 for the 2008 season champions, allowing the entire NASCAR season for regional racing to finish before running the Showdown.
The 2008 season format will remain the same, with the Camping World East and West, Whelen Modified, Southern Modified, and All-American National, Canadian Tire, and Corona Series champions, and also race winners from the Camping World East and West series entered in the race.
The 150-lap late model race on Friday continues.
Rain interrupted the Showdown and forced all three races to be run on Saturday; however, only the Camping World Series race was run to its conclusion, with the race going past 10:30 pm.
Although Joey Logano crossed the finish line first, he was penalized by NASCAR for rough driving after an incident with Peyton Sellers on the last lap, and dropped to 40th place. Matt Kobyluck, who crossed the finish line in second place was awarded the victory and became the first 2 time winner of the event.
The Late Model race, a 75-lap race intended to run before the Camping World feature, was run afterwards, and hit the 40-minute time limit at 55 laps. The 150-lap Super Late Model race, intended for Friday, was run as a race that was after the Late Model race, and only ran until the 12:15 am curfew, which meant just 15 laps.
2009 season format.
The 2009 season's All-Star Showdown is set for January 30, 2010, again at Irwindale.
All race winners during both Camping World Series regional tours, in addition to the Series Champions of both Camping World Series, both Whelen Modified Tours, Canadian Tire Series, and Mexico Series, and the top five in the Whelen All-American Series National Standings (all must be state champions – new for the 2009 season; in previous years, it was only the National Champion), will be awarded exemptions to advance to the feature.
Qualifying, provisionals for Camping World Series regulars based on the 2009 results, and top drivers in the qualifying race will determine the starting order.
2010 season format.
The 2010 NASCAR season concludes with the All-Star Showdown for January 29, 2011, again at Irwindale.
The format again will carry the 225-lap K&N Pro Series (the new name for the Grand National Division for the 2010 season) race as the feature, with two 100-lap segments and a 25-lap final segment.
All K&N Pro Series race winners, both regional series champions, and champions of the Canadian Tire Series, Corona Mexico Series, and Whelen All-American Series are invited.
For the 2010 season version, the Super Late Model race (75 laps) will have the top five NASCAR Whelen All-American Series state champions automatically qualified. The Late Model race (50 laps) will continue. Both the Super Late Model (25 laps) and Late Models (20 laps) will have qualification determined by heat races.
Winners.
NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 NASCAR Camping World Series (now K&N Pro) season, the race is run in January of the ensuing year of the season listed, similar to the NFL Playoffs. Entry forms for this race since the 2008 season race (held January 2009) specifically state this is a 2008 NASCAR season race. Also, the Late Model and Super Late Model races are also run under the previous season's rules and regulations and do not count towards the track's new season, as the new season for these series does not start until late March or early April. As such, the January 2011 races are 2010 season events, and NASCAR lists the January 2010 race as part of the 2009 season.

Northern Premier Cricket League

The Northern Premier Cricket League is a cricket league in the North West of England and has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board and ECB Premier Leagues since 2000. Prior to that date it was known as the Northern Cricket League.
The League comprises two divisions – Division One for First XIs and Division Two for Second XIs. The Lancashire Academy is not represented in Division Two.
Foundation.
The Northern Cricket League was founded on 10 November 1951, in controversial circumstances.
Several of the clubs in the west of the area covered by the Ribblesdale League had been unhappy for some time about the format of that League. The League had a membership of 18 clubs which meant that only 5 opponents in the League were played against twice per season whilst the remainder were played against once. This group of clubs met secretly on 7 October 1951 and produced a handwritten document which stated:
"The following Ribblesdale League clubs:- Blackpool, Chorley, Darwen, Fleetwood, Lancaster, Leyland, Morecambe, St Annes being duly authorised by their respective Committees are resolved from this meeting to request the Ribblesdale League to form a West Section, comprising the above named clubs together with Leyland Motors, Furness and Kendal. Failing agreement on the part of the Ribblesdale League the above eight clubs pledge themselves to resign forthwith from the Ribblesdale League and to create a new league, which would include an invitation to Leyland Motors, Furness, Kendal and Preston."
At the AGM of the Ribblesdale League, held in Whalley on 10 November 1951, the motion was proposed to form West and East sections with the West section comprising Blackpool, Chorley, Darwen, Fleetwood, Lancaster, Leyland, Morecambe, and St Annes, plus two new clubs Furness and Kendal (both from the North Lancashire Cricket League) along with Leyland Motors if they wished to play in the West section.
After discussion the vote was 9–9 and was defeated on the casting vote of the President who had earlier expressed distaste at the way the western clubs had acted.
The eight clubs duly resigned from the Ribblesdale League, as did Leyland Motors, and representatives of these clubs along with those of Furness and Kendal then met at the Swan Hotel in Whalley where the Northern Cricket League was formed. Preston Cricket Club were invited to join the new league as the twelfth team. The invitation was accepted but they remained in the Liverpool Competition for one further year before participating in the Northern Cricket League's second season in 1953.

Chesterfield St Helena School

Chesterfield St Helena School, also known as Chesterfield Girls' Grammar School and St Helena School, Chesterfield, was an all-girls high school in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, teaching 11- to 18-year-old girls between 1892 and its closure in 1991. The building now serves as an Area Education Office for Derbyshire County Council.
History.
The early days.
In 1882 education for girls was still considered to be of minimal importance. Fortunately for the young female residents of Chesterfield a group of influential businessmen, satisfied with the arrangements for the education of their sons, decided they wanted to improve the opportunities for their daughters. As a result of this, a school was set up in the Congregational Schoolroom under the supervision of Miss Walton. The school seems to have thrived for a report of a Harvest Festival held in October 1889 states that it was held in the presence of about a hundred parents and friends. The schoolroom was appropriately decorated for the occasion and an interesting programme of vocal and instrumental music and recitations was performed. Prizes were presented by the Mayor, Mr. B. Douglas Esq. The Mayor proposed the vote of thanks to Miss Walton and this was seconded by Mr. Voules, Headmaster of the Grammar School.
The school continued to minister to the educational needs of the young ladies of the town until 1892 when the following advertisement appeared:-
So the Chesterfield Girls' Grammar School came into being. The original school building, located at East Bank, Sheffield Road, Chesterfield, still exists today and is now used as offices.
The school was to remain at East Bank until 1911 and during that period secured a reputation for providing a good all-round education for its pupils. In the Midland Railway Guide of 1899 a full page advertisement was devoted to include a sufficient variety of subjects to ensure proper development of all the faculties of the pupils.
By 1904 there were 112 pupils in the school and the number increased each term. The joint headship between Miss Wilkes and Miss Stevens came to an end when the County Council took over the responsibility for the running of the school in 1906. Miss Wilkes was designated Head Mistress and Miss Stevens Second Mistress. It was from this time that official records were kept and from these it would seem that, besides Miss Wilkes and Miss Stevens, there were nine other teachers in the school.
Plans were proposed for the erection of a new, purpose built school on vacant ground opposite East Bank. Before these plans could come to fruition, the school had increased to such an extent that number 68, St Helens Street was purchased to house the kindergarten and two lower forms of the school. Intake age was 4 years for both boys and girls, the boys leaving at the age of 11 to continue their education mainly at the local Grammar School.
In 1909 plans for the new school buildings were passed and work started, though it was not an easy site to develop owing to the severe slope of the land on the east side down to Infirmary Road. The best materials were used, local brick from the Wasps Nest Brick Works in Brampton, a roof of Cumbrian Slate topped off with a copper covered cupola. Masons were employed to dress the considerable quantity of stonework with the exception of the window sills which were cut by a special machine recently invented. Inside, the Assembly Hall was built to accommodate three hundred students and was to have an oak parquet floor whilst the rest of the school was to have floors of Canadian Maple parquet. There were those who regarded this huge office rising from the ground with scorn, predicting that there would never be enough students to make use of the accommodation provided. To overcome the slope on the east side of the site and provide a playing area for the children, the land was terraced and substantial retaining walls were built to prevent any danger of movement of the land. The bottom terrace was grassed over to provide a playing field. The lower ground floor contained two covered play areas built so that they could easily be converted into classrooms.
The foundation stone was laid on August 30, 1909 by Dr, George Booth, a local medical practitioner, described as being to doyen of educationalists in Chesterfield He was to have a long association with the school as chairman of the governing body and always encouraged the education of girls. This stone is still to be seen on the north east corner of the building. Behind it was placed a bottle containing a parchment giving a description of the building, the circumstances of its erection, the names of the governing body together with newspapers and coins of the realm. The whole building cost £24,000.
Miss Wilkes, alas, was never to benefit from the new school for she retired owing to ill health in 1910 and died on December 10 the same year.
The 1910s.
Miss Linnell became Head Mistress in January 1911 and in September that year the new building was opened by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. Though the school was at this time was fee-paying a surprising number of pupils were awarded grants by the County Council to cover all or part of their fees. It was not only the wealthy who could afford to send their children to the Girls' High School. A study of the occupations of the parents shows that the pupils came from varied backgrounds, for the September intake of 1911 the fathers' employment covered a wide variety of jobs. Miss Linnell's headship was of short duration as she left in 1913 to take up a post in Burton-on-Trent. Miss Easterby, known to many generations of kindergarten and transition pupils gave a lifetime of teaching to the school, joining the staff in July 1911 and retiring in July 1943.
Miss Munro was appointed Head Mistress and took up her post in September 1913. On October 15 that year the school celebrated its 21st birthday.
By now there was a definite school uniform of box-pleated gym tunic with a white blouse for the more senior pupils. Gym stripes were first awarded in this year.
Miss Stevens, who had been with the school since its foundation, relinquished her position as second mistress in 1912 because of failing health and eventually had to retire in 1914. In the same year, a school outing was arranged to Grindleford by train, than by wagonette to Eyam, a walk back to Grindleford and home again by train. This First World War was declared in the August and by 1915 the pupils at the High School were joining the war effort, knitting for the soldiers. It was reported in the school magazine that 91 scarves, 6 helmets, 40 belts, 3 pairs of cuffs and 2 pairs of socks had been dispatched to the men at The front. The following year, 1916, saw the girls busy collecting foxglove leaves to be used in the preparation of the drug digitalis.
The number of pupils in the school at this time was 34 boys and 300 girls, the boys being in the junior school only.
School dinners had been supplied at the cost of 6d but, owing to war-time conditions, the price had to be increased to 8d. Fees for attending the school were: Seniors £2-2s-0d per term and Juniors £1-5s-0d per term. Coal fires were lit in each form room; the cost of coal being 2s 6d per ton. The chimney-sweeping bill came to a total of £1-1s-0d. Games played an important part in school life, netball in the winter and cricket and tennis in the summer. At the end of the war, Peace Medals were presented to the pupils by Sir Henry Hadow. Some members of staff returned to teaching after being away on war work. However, the World War still cast its shadow over proceedings and it is sad to note that, out of nineteen marriages recorded in the school magazine, four old girls had lost their husbands, killed in action, before the magazine was published.
In 1917 the death of Mary Swanwick occurred. She had been the first woman governor of the school.
By 1918, with the end of the war, the school settled back into a peace-time routine. The number of pupils on roll increased each year so that there were now 349 girls and 12 boys so, only seven years after its opening, pupil numbers were near the limit for which the school was originally built. The staff had increased to twenty including the Head Mistress and it was agreed that staff salaries should be paid six times a year instead of at the end of each term as had previously been the arrangement.
The subjects taught at this time were History, Science, Classics, Modern Languages, Art, English, Scripture, Music and Singing, Gymnastics, Games and Dancing - a wide curriculum for the young ladies of 1918.
The 1920s.
By 1920, the school was going from strength to strength and the ever-increasing number of pupils was becoming an embarrassment. There were nearly four hundred girls and space was at a premium. It was at this time that St Helens House came up for auction on the death of the last private owner, Mr. Burkitt. The Governors decided in some haste to dispatch one of their number to bid for the property. He succeeded in purchasing the House for £2,863, Alderman Johnson Pearson providing the deposit which was required at the time of sale. The County Council did not altogether approve of being manoeuvred into buying a property in this hasty fashion but, after a letter which gently rapped the governors' knuckles, they seem to have co-operated over the adaptation of the House for school use. In 1922 the Lower School, i.e. Kindergarten, Transition, Forms 1 and 2 and the Lower Third moved from the main building to St Helens House. From then on, the main building was always referred to as Big School. Lack of teaching space saw the conversion of the covered playground at the south-east corner of the building into one form room and two Biology labs.
The first Sports Day was held; the races were run on the bottom terrace which was still grass and known as 'The Lawn'. The races were between forms as the House System had yet to be introduced. The appointment of eleven prefects was reported in the school magazine; the prefect system was to last until the 1960s when it gave way to the VIth form committee.
The 1930s.
On the academic side changes had taken place throughout the nineteen twenties. No longer were girls content simply to stay at home at the end of their school life. There was a steady increase of pupils going on to further education, especially into student teaching - a remarkably good system was introduced whereby a girl thinking of embarking on a teaching career did a year's practice teaching in a school before going on to college. Those who found they were not suited to the classroom could then seek another occupation. Girls going to University were becoming more numerous. Sadly there were those whose future looked bleak and there were a number of pupils who left on account of ill health reminding us that the 'good old days' lacked the medical skills to conquer tuberculosis, rheumatic fever and other debilitating illnesses. The nineteen twenties came to an end with the school flourishing both academically and on the sports field. Much progress had been made in adapting and improving the accommodation - and numbers were still rising.
The 1940s.
The war years changed life though lessons went on as usual in spite of the lack of equipment of all types. Margins were no longer acceptable in exercise books and both back and front covers had to be used for writing. School trips abroad were just a memory and even journeys into the countryside were curtailed for a short while. Because of the lack of blackout, the school closed promptly at 3.30pm and so societies of all kinds lapsed. The School Magazine ceased to be published because of the shortage of paper and the staff were initiated into the tiresome task of fire watching. Being on duty at night in the school, even with a companion for company, must have been an eerie experience, and the sleeping accommodation was not exactly three star. Evacuees, mainly from London, joined the school though in most cases they were not destined to stay for long. An air-raid warden's post was built just inside the main gate of the school and still exists, though today it now contains down-to-earth things like gas meters. National Savings groups were formed and the school adopted a Navy Motor Boat, sending the crew letters, books and at Christmas, cake which must have required some ingenuity in the making owing to the rationing of food. Some of the VIth form decided to start a chess club ad they met in different houses each Saturday afternoon, or if the weather was good, they went on rambles instead.
In 1941, the last entrants into the kindergarten were admitted. The Education Act of 1944 was looming in the distance and this decreed that the school would from then on take only pupils from eleven to eighteen. In spite of the war, the 'little ones' were still able to queue for buns at break and, though these were not of a high quality and all seemed to taste the same irrespective of what they were supposed to be, they were welcome.
The 1950s.
Structural alterations to the school building continued throughout the nineteen fifties. A new domestic science room was created by knocking down the wall between the existing domestic science room and the form room next door. The now completed Physics Laboratory and VIth Form Chemistry Laboratory came into use.
The venue for Speech Day in 1950 was the Civic Theatre, now the Pomegranate Theatre, in Chesterfield, with the attendant problem of marching six hundred plus girls to and from school.
In 1951, the long-awaited stage extension was installed and the lighting system improved. The play "Tobias and the Angel" was produced and a Verse Speaking Competition re-established. The smoke nuisance from the hospital chimney was once again in the news. It covered the terraces with a layer of grit and soot which provided interesting conditions for those playing netball on wet days. Visiting teams were at a distinct disadvantage for the home team had learnt to cope with the slippery surface. The problem was only solved when the Royal Hospital moved to Calow in 1984 by which time a new chimney had been built on the Technical College site on the other side of the courts.
In December 1951, Miss Ingram left the school to become Head Mistress and Holly Lodge School in Liverpool and, in January 1952, Mrs. Miller took her place.
The 1960s.
School plays had now become an annual event and in 1960 a production of "Viceroy Sarah" was performed.
A badminton team was formed and won all its matches and the other sports teams, hockey, netball and rounders had successful seasons but the real honours that year went to the tennis team who won the Northern Area Final of the Aberdale Cup played at Wimbledon. The Derbyshire Advertiser reported "St Helena School of Chesterfield won unstinted praise from the Lawn Tennis Association for their display in the Aberdale Cup. Their deportment was the admiration of officials and the competing schools - all of which were girls' public schools". Greater glory was to follow in 1961 for the team again won the Northern Area Final and, at Wimbledon in July, went on to win the Aberdale Cup, the first Grammar School ever to have won the trophy.

Winnie Winkle

Winnie Winkle was an American comic strip which appeared over a 76-year span (1920–96). Created by Martin Branner, who wrote the strip for over 40 years, "Winnie Winkle" was one of the first comic strips about working women. It was titled Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner until 1943. The main character, Winnie, was a young woman who had to support her parents and adopted brother, serving as a reflection of the changing role of women in society. It ran in more than 100 newspapers for several decades, and translations of the strip's Sunday pages (focusing on her little brother and his gang) were made available in Europe.
The Chicago Tribune Syndicate launched the comic strip on September 20, 1920. The strip's premise was conceived by Joseph Medill Patterson, but the stories and artwork were by Branner, who had previously created two unsuccessful comic strips.
The eponymous character Winnie Winkle was a young, unmarried woman who had to support her parents, making it the first popular comic strip about working women. It was a reflection of the new role of women in society, as could also be seen in comics like "Tillie the Toiler" from 1921. Writing for the Associated Press in 1993, Hugh A. Mulligan noted, "After women got the vote and joined the work force, family-centered comics were joined by working-girl strips like "Winnie Winkle", "Tillie the Toiler", "Dixie Dugan", "Somebody's Stenog" and "Brenda Starr", which was drawn by a woman, Dale Messick. Almost from the beginning, politics and a social conscience hovered over the drawing board."
Characters and story.
During its first years, the daily "Winnie Winkle" evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new character was introduced in the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffel coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood gang, the Rinkydinks, who, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing and were regarded by Winnie as "loafers." One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, "Youse is a good boy, Denny."
Other major plot elements were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and the disappearance of Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: "The Baltimore Sun" dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including a stint in the Peace Corps.
"Winnie Winkle" ended July 28, 1996, after 76 years, one of the longest runs in American comic strip history. Tribune Media Service, the syndicate that distributed the comic strip, "felt that the Winnie Winkle character was not recognized as a contemporary role model for the '90s." At the time, the strip was carried by only a handful of newspapers.
Artists.
Branner employed a number of assistants, including Royal King Cole (during the 1930s), Rolf Ahlson, Mike Peppe and Max Van Bibber (1938–1962). Another assistant was the young French author Robert Velter, who on his return to Europe created the famous series "Spirou et Fantasio".
From 1941 until 1958, his assistant was John A. Berrill, who later created "Gil Thorp". After Branner suffered a stroke in 1962, Van Bibber continued the series until 1980, later followed by students from the Joe Kubert school of cartooning and finally by veteran artist Frank Bolle. Bolle recalled:
International spin-offs and translations.
In 1923, Winnie's adopted younger brother Perry Winkle and his friends the Rinkydinks became the focus of the Sunday pages. In Europe, only the Sunday pages were translated. The Dutch translated it as "Sjors van de Rebellenclub" which became very popular in the Netherlands, where it was the predecessor of the long-running series "Sjors en Sjimmie" by Frans Piët. In France, it was known as "Bicot" and published by Hachette in 14 albums between 1926 and 1939. In both countries, local artists made new comics about Perry when the number of weekly pages by Branner was no longer sufficient.
The Sunday page of "Winnie Winkle" was the first American comic published in a Yugoslavian daily newspaper, "Jutarnji list" from Zagreb. It first appeared on August 5, 1923 and lasted until April, 1941, the beginning of World War II in that country. Perry, the hero, was renamed Ivica (Johnny), and Winnie Suzana. The Rinkydinks were rechristened Rantanplanci, allegedly after a group of kids from a contemporary Hollywood film series. The title was "Pustolovni Ivica" (Adventurous Johnny). A single Christmas episode taking place in Zagreb was published, the work of unknown local authors. Three albums collected the stories published in the newspaper.
Films.
From 1926 to 1928, ten "Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner" movies were produced, written by Branner and starring Ethelyn Gibson as Winnie, with Billy West as director. "Winnie Winkle" was reprinted in Dell Comics, and for a time her face appeared on a cigar box lid.
Due to its originality and longevity, "Winnie Winkle" became a household name and an icon, inspiring even the Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. It ran in more than 140 newspapers in 1939, and by 1970, it still ran in more than 150 newspapers. In retrospect, it is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.
Awards.
In 1958, Branner received the National Cartoonists Society's Humor Comic Strip Division Award for "Winnie Winkle".
Archives.
Syrcause University houses the Martin Branner Cartoons collection of 300 original daily cartoons from "Winnie Winkle" (1920–1957). There is a complete week from each year represented, with additional random cartoons from each year. There are no holdings for 1946–47. The daily cartoons display traces of graphite, blue pencil, Zip-A-Tone, brush, pen and ink on illustration board measuring approximately 7 ¼ x 22 ½ inches.

Burnaby Village Museum

The Burnaby Village Museum, previously known as the Heritage Village, is an open air museum in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada located at Deer Lake Park. It is a reconstructed 1920s village, containing 31 full scale buildings; its costumed staff demonstrate traditional trades. The museum spans of land. Some of the buildings are original heritage buildings, moved from other locations in the community and restored. Others are replica buildings, created to house specific displays and artifacts, including a 1912 B.C. Electric Railway interurban tram. The Museum is also known for the 1912 
C. W. Parker Carousel, available for visitors to ride.
History.
Founded in 1971, the Museum was originally known as the Heritage Village. It has grown from a site with a small number of displays, to a heritage site and major attraction in Metro Vancouver.
On November 19, 1971 the official opening of the museum took place, officiated by Roland Michener, then Governor General of Canada. Over 15,000 visitors attended the museum during its special three-day opening. It opened for its first season in 1972, and included several shops located in replica buildings on the main street, and the “manor house” (the 1922 home of the Bateman family, today known as Elworth). Livestock was part of the display, including horses who were shod in the blacksmith shop. An early promotional brochure promised visitors they would be able to “smell the burning hoof.” 
In 1975, the B.C. Society of Model Engineers opened a model railway at the Village. The same year, a Chinese Herbalist display was opened, and a 1911 bachelor’s house built by Burnaby resident Tom Irvine was moved to the site. 
In 1976, the Royal Bank building from Britannia Beach was moved to the Village, as well as a 1927 Burnaby heritage building set up as a real estate and surveyor’s office. In partnership with the Japanese-Canadian Citizens Association, an ofuru (Japanese bathhouse) display was opened at the Village in 1977. The replica ofuru was built to commemorate the arrival in B.C. of the first Japanese immigrant in 1877. The Vorce B.C. Electric railway station was also acquired in 1977.
In 1979, the Heritage Village became the set for the Canadian\German co-production of the 26 part TV series Huckleberry Finn and His Friends.
In 1984, the Museum’s name was changed from “Heritage Village” to “Burnaby Village Museum” to reflect its role as Burnaby’s community museum. Iredale Partnership was hired in 1985 to create an expansion concept for Burnaby’s Municipal Council to consider. The plan was completed in 1986, and accepted by Council in 1987. At that time, the site was expanded to approximately 9 acres, with new lands across Deer Lake Brook made available to the Museum to expand, and to create a new entrance facility and administration building.
In 1987 the Seaforth School display was opened at the Village, with the restored 1922 school open to the public. By 1989, the popular “3R’s” school program was being offered on a regular basis at the schoolhouse. In 1988, the 1893 Jesse and Martha Love farmhouse was acquired and moved to the Museum, to be part of the “rural zone” display established in the newly acquired museum space across Deer Lake Brook.
In 1989, the miniature railway moved to Confederation Park. That same year, the PNE’s historic carousel was decommissioned. The Friends of the Carousel were formed to raise the money to purchase and restore the 1912 carousel. Burnaby promised to provide a building for the carousel at the Burnaby Village Museum.
In 1990, the Municipality of Burnaby took over operation of Burnaby Village Museum from the Century Park Museum Association. 
In 1993 the C.W. Parker Carousel was officially opened, housed in the newly constructed Don Wrigley Pavilion. The Museum’s popular “Business as Usual” school program was launched in 1999, with “Home Sweet Home” following soon behind in 2000. In 2000, the museum opened its “Stride Studios” temporary exhibit gallery, allowing for temporary exhibits that explored topics beyond Burnaby in the 1920s to be featured as part of the visitor experience. 
In 2001, the Museum’s 1912 British Columbia Electric Railway interurban tram was moved offsite to a warehouse, where it would undergo a 5-year restoration project by the Friends of Interurban 1223. In 2007, the restored Interurban 1223 was returned to the Museum, and installed in the newly constructed tram barn. Vorce station was installed adjacent to the tram barn, and was restored to its original appearance in 2008 under the auspices of the City of Burnaby Community Heritage Commission. 
The Burnaby Village Museum was an official stop for the Olympic Torch Relay in 2010. In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Museum, Burnaby City Council agreed to offer free admission to museum visitors for the 2011 summer and Christmas seasons.

Calabar High School

Calabar High School is a prominent all-male, secondary school in Kingston, Jamaica. It was established by the Jamaica Baptist Union in 1912 for the children of Baptist ministers and the children of the poor blacks and was named after the former slave port Calabar, now in Nigeria. Today, it is considered one of the finest schools in the country, producing at least five Rhodes Scholars and is respected for it's outstanding performance in track and field.
History.
In 1839, William Knibb, Thomas Burchell and James Phillippo, the three leading English Baptist missionaries working in Jamaica, moved for the creation of a college for training native Baptist ministers. Out of this effort, Calabar Theological College came into being in 1843, sited in the little village of Calabar, near Rio Bueno, in Trelawny Parish. The town Calabar was named by the Spanish after a town in Nigeria of the same name.
In 1868, Calabar College was removed to East Queen Street, Kingston, where a "normal" school for training teachers and a high school for boys were added. Shortly afterwards, the high school was closed and the teacher-training activities ceased, leaving the practising school—now Calabar All-Age on Sutton Street—and the theological college, which was relocated at Studley Park (on Slipe Pen Road) in 1904.
At the beginning of the 1900s, there were very few high schools in existence to educate the sons of the working class and the rising middle class. It was to meet this need that, in September 1912, through the instrumentality of the Revs. Ernest Price and David Davidson—Principal and Tutor, respectively, of Calabar Theological College—Calabar High School came into existence under the joint sponsorship of the Baptist Missionary Society of London and the Jamaica Baptist Union.
The high school opened September 12, 1912, with 26 boys and the foundation was firmly laid in the Christian tradition. Rev. Price was the first headmaster. Within a year enrolment had reached 80 and the school had received government recognition. An early benefactor was Miss Elizabeth Purscell who, in 1919, bequeathed the adjoining property, on Studley Park Road, in trust for the school. The school offered boarding facilities on nearby premises —the Hostel— to facilitate boys attending from outside the Corporate Area of Kingston.
In 1952, Calabar Theological College and Calabar High School moved from their location at Studley Park to Red Hills Road, where of land (then called "Industry Pen") had been purchased for the re-siting of both institutions. At the time, this was a thinly populated, undeveloped area and many people thought the move unwise. The new school was built to house 350 boys but before long extensions became necessary. Boarding facilities were provided up to 1970. When boarding ceased, dormitories were converted to workshops.
In 1967 the Theological College moved to Mona as a part of the United Theological College of the West Indies and the High School took over the vacated space. This is the section of the premises which the boys now call "Long Island."
At about this time a portion of the Calabar lands was sold, to be used for commercial and residential development. A privately run Extension School was added in 1971.
In 1978, the school adopted a shift system incorporating the day and extension schools, at the request of the Ministry of Education. There are over 1600 students on roll with eight forms in each year group between grades 7 and 11, and four forms in grades 12 and 13 (sixth form).
Major scholarships —such as the Jamaica and Rhodes Scholarships— have been awarded to Calabar students. Sports, particularly athletics, have always been important and the Inter-Schools’ Athletics Championships (“Champs”) Trophy has been won 23 times since 1930.
One major accomplishment is in the Schools' Challenge Quiz, where Calabar is the only school to win the competition three years in a row, and has been to the most finals in one decade, six (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2012).
Insignia.
The school motto is "The Utmost for the Highest".
The official school colours are green and black.
The school's mascot is a roaring lion, a homage to the school being named after the Nigeria city and former slave port of the same name.
Extracurricular activities.
In sports the school dominates all major sporting areas including track and field, football, basketball, cricket, badminton, and rugby. Calabar was the first school in Jamaica to have a swimming pool and won the inter-schools swimming competition repeatedly for many years. When the school was relocated to Red Hills Road in 1953, the boys helped to construct the new pool there. At the Annual Boys and Girls Athletics Championships, the competition for which the school is most famous, Calabar is the only boys school to have won Champs titles in every decade since the 1930s.
In 2012, the school won both School Challenge Quiz and the all-island Boys Athletics Championships title (its 24th overall).
In 2008, the school Rugby Union team created history by placing for the first time a team in the finals of all four competitions entered. The boys won the Under-19 15-a-side competition for the second time in school's history and were runners-up in the under 16 version. The team was coached by old boys Sheldon Phillips and Romeo Monteith with Nesta Dawkins as manager.
In Rugby Football the school became the first to win the U19 15s championship 3 consecutive years (2008–2010). The school also won the inaugural U16 Rugby League championship in 2009.
Calabar is the only school to have won the popular "School's Challenge Quiz" on three consecutive occasions.
Notable alumni.
Calabar has produced a number of prominent members of Jamaican society including:

Araya (film)

Araya is a 1959 Venezuelan-French documentary film directed by Margot Benacerraf and co-written by Benacerraf and Pierre Seghers. It depicts the lives of laborers who extract salt from the sea off the Araya peninsula in Venezuela. Their method for extracting salt, virtually unchanged for centuries, depends on grueling physical labor, but provides a dependable, if meager, living for the men and their families. The film ends with a recently built plant for mechanized salt extraction that could eliminate the community's traditional source of income.
The film was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, where it shared the Cannes International Critics Prize with Alain Resnais's "Hiroshima mon amour".
In 2009, Milestone Films released "Araya" in North American theaters for the first time as well as rereleasing it internationally. Milestone also distributes a restored DVD version of the film.

Rishabhdeo

Rikhabdeo (aka Dhulev) is a census town in Udaipur district in the state of Rajasthan, in north-west India.
Rishabhadeo is situated from Udaipur and is on Udaipur-Ahmedabad Road. The name of the town is also Dhulev (धुलेव), however it is better known as Rishabhadeo. It is a well-known pilgrim site. The main attraction is the temple of Rishabhadeoji, the first Jain tirthankara. Local Bhils also worship the deity. Lord Rishabhadeo is also "Kesariaji" because a large offering of saffron (keshar, a common ingredient in Jain rituals) is made to the deity.
This temple was considered to be one of the four main religious institutions of Mewar, ruled by the Sisodia Maharanas of Udaipur, as stated by Chatur Singhji Bavji:
It has been a famous Jain pilgrimage center. The famous "Arati" by Mulchand refers to this temple:
The main idols in the temple.
The main idol of this temple is Lord Rishabh Dev, carved in black stone in padmasana posture, about tall. Two oxen are carved in the center of the "simhasana" (platform) of the main idol, which also has 16 dreams of the mother of Tirthankar. Surrounding the main deity, there are 23 idols, 2 standing and 21 seated, in an "ashtadhatu" (composed of eight metals) parikar. Here, pilgrims are bound to be lost in unstinted devotion; both Jain and non-Jain visitors and pilgrims experience a sort of sacredness, thanks due to the simply indescribable aura of the image of Shri Prabhu. The round face of Shri Prabhu is extremely attractive and pleasing to the mind. The whole temple, with the main inner apartment, the deep pandal, nine chowkis, the assembly pandal, the Bhamati, the small shrines of gods, the Shrungara chowki, the peak and the encircling fort is simply majestic. Even from a distance, the gorgeous 52 Jinalayas can enrapture the viewer. In the north and south sides of the Khela Mandapa of the temple, idols of Tirthankaras Vasupujya, Mallinath, Neminath, Parshvanath and Mahavir Swami (collectively referred to as Panch-Balayati) are installed.
There are 52 secondary ornate shrines ("devakulikas") of the Tirthankaras.
Elephants carved of black stone stand at the entrance of the temple. On the north is the image of Goddess Chakreshvari, and on the southern side is an image of goddess Padmavati.
The structure and architecture, of idols and temple, show clearly that it is a Jain temple, but since all Hindu castes and Jain sects have been offering prayers here since a long time ago, the management of the temple is done by the state Government.
The Bhattaraks.
A Jain Bhattaraka seat had existed at Rishabhdeo until the 20th century. Their memorials are marked by footprints. The footprints are present beside the elephant statues. Outside of the village, the foot-prints of Bhattaraka Chandrakirti and other Bhattarakas mark their memorials at Suraj Kund.
The Bhattarakas managed the temple until they were removed by the Maharana, who appointed a committee of some Brahmins and Shwetambara Jains for administration.
History.
The temple has a long history. The temple has about 65 inscriptions in the building and on several of the Tirthankara idols.
According to Caroline Humphrey, the temple was founded in the ninth century by Digambar Jains.
There is a 1376 (samvat 1431) inscription on the temple wall that mentions that Punja and Kota, sons of Shah Harda had the structure built as a result of the preachings of Bhattaraka Dharmakirti of Kashtha Sangh. That is when the "garbhagriha" and the "khela mandap" was constructed.
The compound wall was constructed in 1806 by a merchant, Dhanji Karanji of Sagwada. There is a long inscription in Sanskrit/Hindi that mentions Bhimsingh as the ruler. It gives a spiritual lineage of the Bhatarakas of Mula Sangh mentioning Kundakunda, Sakalkirti up to the reigning Bhattaraka Yashkirti, who blessed the construction. Names of the family of Sanghi Dhanji Karanji of Humbad community, of Kamaleshvar gotra, are also given.
The "nakkarkhana" (drum tower) was built in 1832. The smaller shrines ("devakulika") were constructed later.
The names of the Bhattarakas mentioned in the inscriptions include:
Amitesh Kumar comments on the historical significance:
The temple and the Maharanas of Udaipur.
Udaipur became the capital of the Sisodias in 1559. The revival of the fortunes of the Sisodias was made possible by the Jain ministers, like Bhamashah, who provided funds to reestablish the Maharanas after they had to leave Chittor. Because of significant Jain influence, the Maharanas became devotees of Lord Rishabh and worshipped here. They also made gifts to the temple.
The Bhattarakas accepted the royal support. They also permitted Swetambaras to use the Swetambara rituals in Sam. 1702 for the main idol. However in Sam. 1842, the Swetambaras obtained rights of Swetambara rituals on four other idols, with the support of the Maharana.
Sometime after the building of the compound wall, built by the Digambaras in Sam 1863, the Maharana expelled the Digambara Bhattarakas from the temple, and took over the temple. He appointed Brahmin priests to worship at the temple, and created a committee that included the Shvetambara Jains, but excluded the Digambaras. Gradually Vaishnava rituals, such as Bhagavat Katha and Annakuta, were introduced by the Brahmin priests.
Maharana Fateh Singh (1884–1930) presented a jewel-studded "angi" (coat) to the temple which is used on special occasions costing one hundred thousand rupees.
The administration was handed over to the government after India's independence.
The Digambara Bhattarakas built other temples in Dhulev, and continued the Bhattaraka seat at Rishabhadeo. The last Bhattaraka Yashakirti was consecrated by his guru Kshemakirti in 1917 AD. He died in 1978. His funeral memorial is on the Chandragiri hill.
The temple dispute.
The nature of the temple has been in issue between Digambers, Swetambers and other Hindus. However, the Supreme Court of India in its judgment delivered in 'The State of Rajasthan & Ors. Vs. Shri Sajjanlal Panjawat & Ors.' as (1974) 1 SCC 500 has, after considering the material produced, decided that it is a 'Jain temple' para. 12 at pg. 509/510 SCC. However, since the right to manage the said temple had been taken over by the State of Mewar before promulgation of the Indian Constitution, therefore, Jains had no right to manage the temple after the Indian Constitution came into force. For that reason, it was held, that the Jains had no right to protect under Article 25/26 of the Indian Constitution. The issue of management of the said tample was again cropped up, and Digambers, Swetambers, Hindus and the State of Rajasthan again brought the matter in the Supreme Court of India, claiming to have the right to manage the temple. However, this time on the strength of 'Rajasthan Public Trust Act', which says that those temples to which chapter X of the said Act is applicable, would be managed by a Committee constituted from the persons interested in the management. That case was decided by a Bench of the Indian Supreme Court and Hon'ble Justice S.B. Sinha and Hon'ble Justice Markandey Katju vide in the judgment dated 4 January 2007, delivered in Civil Appeal No.4092-95 of 2002 titled as "Deewan Singh & Ors. vs. Rajendra Prasad ARdevi & Ors". Other connected Civil Appeals, confirmed the judgment of Single Judge (which was modified by the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court) and ordered that the management of the said temple be handed over to the committee, as envisaged under Section 53 of the 'Rajasthan Public Trust Act' within four months.
A 2007 Supreme Court decision to hand over the administration to the Jain community had led to protests and violence by the local tribals. Frontline reported that:
Gulabchand Kataria, the home minister of Rajasthan believes that the tribals were incited by some elements. Dainik Navjyoti had reported on 14 February 2007 that:
Bhaskar reported the anonymous pamphlets were distributed among the tribals to incite them. The violence had erupted on 7 February 2007, when the tribal leaders had declared a "Mahapadav". Several hundred tribals attacked the members of the Jain community and destroyed theirs shops, houses, cars, etc. The police were unable to contain the destruction even after the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. One person was killed in the police firing.
There is pressure being put on the state government not to implement the Supreme Court decision. This has been causing alarm in the Jain community.
Demographics.
Right now around 500 students are going outside of Rishbhdeo for higher education, such as MBBS, BTech, B.Com., C.A. and many courses.
About half the residents of the town are Jain, 95% belonging to the Digambara, and another half are Brahmin, suthar, lohar, tailor, mochi, kumhar, somupura and other casts are here from many years ago. Many bhil and meena villages are surrounding Rishabhdeo, and they have come every day to Rishbhdeo for prayer, in sects belonging to Bispanthi Narsingpura and Humad communities. A small group of Svetambaras arrived about a hundred years ago.
Rishabhdeo is also famous for green marble. It has more than 300 marble mines in massaor ki obri and odavas kagder.
About 90% percent of the green marble around the world is produced by Rishabhdeo.
Nearly 70% percent of the marble of Rishabhdeo is exported to the USA, UAE, Canada and many other countries.
Gaj Mandir.
Gaj Mandir is a Jain Shwetambar Temple built in 2011 in Rishabhdeo. Also, Kika Bhai Dharmshala has been providing rooms and fooding facilities for all the yaatris travelling around India.
Other local attractions.
Nearby places worth visiting include: Paglyaji, Rishabh Garden, Patshala Jain temple, Ram Mandir, Emliyachod Hanuman ji, Chandragiri, Bhim Pagalya, Bhattarak Kirti Bhavan, Dadabadi, Peepli temple and vaghuvan.

Rotary feeder

Rotary feeders, also known as rotary airlocks or rotary valves, are commonly used in industrial and agricultural applications as a component in a bulk or specialty material handling system. Rotary feeders are primarily used for discharge of bulk solid material from hoppers/bins, receivers, and cyclones into a pressure or vacuum-driven pneumatic conveying system. Components of a rotary feeder include a rotor shaft, housing, head plates, and packing seals and bearings.
Rotors have large vanes cast or welded on and are typically driven by small internal combustion engines or electric motors.
Use.
Rotary airlock feeders have wide application in industry wherever dry free-flowing powders, granules, crystals, or pellets are used. Typical materials include: cement, ore, sugar, minerals, grains, plastics, dust, fly ash, flour, gypsum, lime, coffee, cereals, pharmaceuticals, etc.
Industries requiring this type include cement, asphalt, chemical, mining, plastics, food, etc.
Rotary feeders are ideal for pollution control applications in wood, grain, food, textile, paper, tobacco, rubber, and paint industries, the Standard Series works beneath dust collectors and cyclone separators even with high temperatures and different pressure differentials.
Rotary valves are available with square or round inlet and outlet flanges. Housing can be fabricated out of sheet material or cast. Common materials are cast iron, carbon steel, 304 SS, 316 SS, and other materials.
Rotary airlock feeders are often available in standard and heavy duty models, the difference being the head plate and bearing configuration. Heavy duty models use an outboard bearing in which the bearings are moved out away from the head plate.
Housing inlet and discharge configurations are termed drop-thru or side entry.
Different wear protections are available such as hard chrome or ceramic plating on the inner housing surfaces.
Grease and air purge fittings are often provided to prevent contaminants from entering the packing seals.
Uses.
The basic use of the rotary airlock feeder is as an airlock transition point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas while maintaining a flow of material between components with different pressure and suitable for air lock applications ranging from gravity discharge of filters, rotary valves, cyclone dust collectors, and rotary airlock storage devices to precision feeders for dilute phase and continuous dense phase pneumatic convey systems. 
Rotary airlock feeders/ rotary airlock valves are used in pneumatic conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls.
Rotary airlock valves are also widely used as volumetric feeders for metering materials at precise flow rates from bins, hoppers, or silos onto conveying or processing systems.
Types.
Rotary airlock feeders.
Drop through rotary airlock feeders are designed for rugged applications that require an outboard bearing style unit where contamination and /or an abrasive product cannot be handled with an inboard bearing style.
The outboard bearing feeders is engineered for use in high pressure pneumatic conveying systems, with high temperatures where more of an effective seal is required due to high or excessive wear that is experienced with a simple dust collector.
Blow-thru rotary airlock feeder.
The blow-thru rotary airlock feeder is ideal for pneumatic conveying applications in food, grain, chemical, milling, baking, plastics and pharmaceutical industries. The blow-thru airlocks feature a low profile with large capacity. High pressure differentials integral mounting feet, and retrofit competitive units. The blow-thru valves are available with 10-vane open-end rotor; outboard bearings and replaceable shaft seals.
Easy clean rotary feeder.
The easy-clean series rotary feeders can be fast and simply disassembled, thoroughly quick cleaned, sanitized and inspected or maintenance in a minimum amount of time without the use of tools or removal from service, thereby reducing downtime and increasing system production. Reassembly without tools is accomplished in minutes. Internal clearances are automatically re-established every time.
The Clean-in-place rotary feeder is a special purpose valve designed for where cross-contamination is a major concern and lengthy shut-downs for clean-out are cost-prohibitive, suited for Dairy, Pharmaceutical industries, Food, Baking, Chemical, Plastics, Paint, and Powder Coating plants.
It is ideal for batch mixing systems such as those handling different colored resins which demand regular cleaning between cycles.
Filter valve.
The filter valve is a low-cost solution designed for light duty dust collector applications.
Knife rotary feeder.
This type of feeder is used for discharge of secondary fuel as for example: plastics or wood. The knife is cutting the oversize material and is preventing the rotor from blockage.

Black Saturday (1983)

Black Saturday (24 September 1983) is the name given to the crisis when the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was at an all-time low. On that day, the USD $1 = HKD $9.6. For a period, Hong Kong stores began quoting products in US dollar prices, because of the uncertain fluctuation in domestic currency.
History.
From November 1974 to October 1983, Hong Kong was under a floating rate regime. The political talks of Hong Kong's handover of sovereignty to China involving UK's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Beijing began to send consumer confidence down in 1982. The stalling of the Sino-British Joint Declaration also contributed to a pessimistic attitude. The collection of events eventually resulted in "Black Saturday,” which came in the form of a currency, banking and fiscal crisis.
Response.
The government responded with a linked exchange rate in 17 October 1983.

Sybaris on the Traeis

Sybaris on the Traeis was an ancient city of Magna Grecia situated on the Traeis river, now known as the Trionto. It shares its name with the original city of Sybaris () which was destroyed in 510 BC. Its former inhabitants built a new city not far from the site of Sybaris, Thurii. This new colony was founded together with other Greek settlers in 446/445 BC. Soon a conflict arose between the two groups and most of the Sybarites were killed by the other Greek colonists of Thurii. The Sybarites who managed to flee then founded Sybaris on the Traeis a short time after 444 BC. The city was destroyed by the Bruttii not long after their emergence as an ethnic group in 356/355 BC.
In the present day the Trionto river flows through the Province of Cosenza in Calabria, Italy. The mouth of the river lies approximately 25 kilometers southeast of the site of Thurii. The exact location of Sybaris on the Traeis has not been found along the course of the Trionto yet.
History.
Foundation.
Diodorus Siculus relates how the Sybarites, whose city had been destroyed by Croton, were assisted by other Greeks in founding Thurii in 446/445 BC. Soon a conflict broke out between the Sybarites and the other colonists over their privileges. According to Diodorus, the Sybarites had assigned the most important offices to themselves, had their wives sacrifice to the gods the first and took the land which lied the closest to the city. Being more numerous and powerful, the other colonists killed practically all of the Sybarites. Some of them managed to flee and founded Sybaris on the Traeis. John Wonder dates the founding of the city to have taken place shortly after 444 BC.
Strabo also mentions Sybaris on the Traeis, stating that some people thought it was of Rhodian origin. Frank Walbank argues that this idea was probably a mistake not endorsed by Strabo himself.
Two alliances.
Polybius writes that Sybaris was allied with two other Achaean colonies, Croton and Caulonia. Walbank thinks it very likely that Polybius meant Sybaris on the Traeis. Wonder agrees, noting that the original Sybarites would have been hostile to Croton and would not have formed an alliance with that city.
Wonder argues the cities formed this alliance in the second half of the 5th century BC because they felt threatened by neighboring Greek city-states in Southern Italy. In spite of Croton's destruction of the original Sybaris, an alliance would have been mutually beneficial to the former enemies. The establishment of Thurii and its expansionist policy now threatened both cities. Sybaris on the Traeis probably would have been small and not powerful enough to threaten Croton. It could have functioned as a buffer against Thurii for Croton. In turn, the city could benefit from Croton's protection.
In the early fourth century BC the situation drastically changed when Dionysius I of Syracuse and the Lucanians threatened the Greek cities of Southern Italy. With the exception of Locri, which was an ally of Dionysius, the cities formed an alliance called the Italiote League in 393 BC. Wonder thinks Sybaris on the Traeis probably was a member of the league together with Croton, Caulonia, Thurii, Rhegium and Velia by 389 BC.
Destruction.
Diodorus Siculus writes that Sybaris on the Traeis was eventually destroyed by the Bruttii, but does not give a specific date. Because he dates the formation of the Bruttii as an ethnic group to 356/355 BC the city could not have been destroyed before that date.

Growth hormone-binding protein

Growth hormone-binding protein is a carrier protein for growth hormone. 
It is coded by the same gene as growth hormone receptor.
Low levels of Growth Hormone binding protein may indicate a growth hormone receptor problem, and thus a growth hormone insensitivity, rather than a growth hormone deficiency. 
Normal serum levels of growth hormone Binding Protein 3 may rule out growth hormone insensitivities, like those seen in Laron syndrome.

<doc id="9677936" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9677936" title="The Milky Waif">
The Milky Waif

The Milky Waif is a 1946 American one-reel animated cartoon and is the 24th "Tom and Jerry" short directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, produced by Fred Quimby in Technicolor, released in theaters on May 18, 1946, and re-released in theaters on January 9, 1954 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. It was animated by Ed Barge, Kenneth Muse and Michael Lah, with uncredited animation by Ray Patterson and Irven Spence. The name is a pun on "The Milky Way".
Plot.
Jerry is asleep in his bed when he wakes to the sound of a knock at his door and goes out to open it, finding a basket on his door step. He pokes the basket, and it comes alive and runs around in circles. Jerry pulls the blanket off to reveal Nibbles. An attached note says, "Please take care of Little Nibbles—He's always hungry! P.S. Feed him lots of milk." Nibbles then begins licking his lips and rubbing his belly.
Seeing that he has no food, Jerry tiptoes out of his hole, spotting Tom asleep by his bowl of milk. Nibbles sees the milk and runs toward it, but Jerry pulls him back and goes out to get the milk for him. Nibbles runs out, accidentally waking Tom. Jerry grabs Nibbles and the two fall into the bowl of milk, splashing it in Tom's face and waking him. Tom, startled, looks around and sees no one, so he starts to drink his milk. Jerry and Nibbles are under the milk holding their breath until Tom unsuspectingly scoops up Nibbles with his tongue. Jerry jumps out of the milk and opens the cat's mouth to retrieve Nibbles, which begins the chase. The mice retreat into the mousehole before Tom crashes headfirst into the wall.
Jerry builds a pipeline of straws to the milk but Tom turns the tables by grabbing the end of the straw and sucking Nibbles through it. Jerry squishes the end of the straw, saving Nibbles just in time, and blows the small mouse into the mousehole. Tom chases Jerry back to his hole but the cat moves the hole over so that Jerry crashes into the wall. Tom grabs Jerry, but Nibbles comes out and hits Tom's tail with a hammer. The chase starts up again until Nibbles sips and spits some milk into Tom's face.
Jerry and Nibbles hide in a closet, while Tom pounds on the door. Jerry uses a container of shoe polish to disguise himself and Nibbles as a pair of black people. Jerry (voiced by Lillian Randolph) emerges from the closet dressed in a headscarf and in blackface and greets Tom. Out comes Nibbles, also in blackface and wearing a headscarf. However, the disguise is revealed when Nibbles' diaper falls down, exposing his tail and gray fur. The chase continues until Jerry hits Tom in the face with a frying pan, knocking him out. 
Jerry sadistically pulls out Tom's tongue, and with all his strength knocks the cat in the head, causing him to chomp his tongue. Tom yells and the chase begins again. Jerry hands the frying pan to Nibbles and continues leading the chase. Instead of whacking the cat, Nibbles swings too soon and smashes his comrade. This repeats a second time, but on the third time around, Jerry stops and points at the cat. Nibbles obliges and hits Tom square in the face, then crawls under the rug to escape with Jerry. Tom grabs a bottle to trap the mice but catches only Jerry. Nibbles taunts the cat and darts back under the rug, and Tom continues the chase.
Nibbles stops at the bowl again, signals for the cat to stop, and starts to drink from it. Tom allows the mouse to drink briefly, then grabs Nibbles, but Nibbles crawls under Tom's fur. Tom grabs his tail and a revolver and shoots at Nibbles when he emerges from it, but just shoots his tail instead, screaming in agony. As Nibbles runs away, the cat chases him with a flyswatter and corners him. He gives the mouse a great swat on the back, and an enraged Jerry breaks through the glass to inspect his nephew. Jerry is furious about a big red mark left by Tom's swat. The guilty Tom hides the flyswatter behind his back but Jerry lets out a massive roar, literally turning Tom yellow with fright. Jerry grabs Tom's tail, slams him against the floor, throws him behind a garbage can, and smashes the lid into Tom's face repeatedly, over and over again.
In the final scene, a still-intensed Jerry stands menacingly with a wooden meat tenderizer over a bruised Tom to keep him in-line under the threat of getting whacked by the meat tenderizer, wanting him to feed Nibbles milk as punishment for terrorizing the little mouse. Tom timidly spoon-feeds milk to Nibbles, not to let one drop spill or else.
Censorship.
In the scene where Jerry and Nibbles hide in the closet and disguise themselves as a pair of black people, Jerry is voiced by Lillian Randolph, the same voice actress who also portrayed Mammy Two-Shoes in the shorts. This scene is removed from Boomerang in the UK, in the Arab World on Spacetoon and MBC 3 and in the US along with Cartoon Network, so that Nibbles spitting the milk at Tom cuts directly to Tom running into Jerry's pan, most likely to avoid any controversy of stereotyping.

<doc id="9677964" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9677964" title="Diastasis symphysis pubis">
Diastasis symphysis pubis

Diastasis symphysis pubis is the separation of normally joined pubic bones, as in the dislocation of the bones, without a fracture. 
Diagnosis.
This abnormally wide gap can be diagnosed by radiologic studies such as x-ray, MRI, CT scan or bone scan. Manual testing by a healthcare professional can also be used. The patient is placed in various positions and pressure is applied in such a way that it provokes pain and maybe movement in the pubis.
X-ray.
An X-ray film will show a marked gap between the pubic bones, normally there is a 4–5 mm gap but in pregnancy, hormonal influences cause relaxation of the connecting ligaments and the bones separate up to 9 mm. To demonstrate instability of the joint the patient is required to stand in the "flamingo" position, (standing with weight on one leg and the other bent). A vertical displacement of more than 1 cm is an indicator of symphysis pubis instability. A displacement of more than 2 cm usually indicates involvement of the sacroiliac joints.
CT scan and MRI.
Both diagnostic machines can produce detailed cross sections of the pelvic area. Images will show degrees soft tissue injury, inflammation of the subchondral region and the bone marrow and any abnormal posturing of the pelvic joints. 
Bone Scan.
A bone scan is able to determine areas of bone inflammation. 
External forces.
External forces such as falling from a horse or a car accident can result in this type of injury to the symphysis pubis.
In former times obstructed childbirth was sometimes treated by cutting the pubic symphysis (symphysiotomy), letting the pelvis halves hinge outwards at the sacroiliac joints.

McLean Mill National Historic Site is a steam-operated sawmill on Vancouver Island, officially open to tourists since July 1, 2000. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989.
History.
The mill originally ran as a family operated saw-milling business from 1926 to 1965. The original plot of land was purchased by Robert Bartlett ("R.B.") McLean, and he moved there with his wife Cora, and his three sons Arnold, Philip, and Walter.
The business was eventually taken over by Arnold, who then passed on the business to his son Howard McLean, who ran it until its closing in 1965. One of the main reasons for its closing was competition from the larger lumber companies in the area.

Ad Tracking

Ad tracking, also known as post-testing or ad effectiveness tracking, is in-market research that monitors a brand’s performance including brand and advertising awareness, product trial and usage, and attitudes about the brand versus their competition. 
Depending on the speed of the purchase cycle in the category, tracking can be done continuously (a few interviews every week) or it can be “pulsed,” with interviews conducted in widely spaced waves (ex. every three or six months). Interviews can either be conducted with separate, matched samples of consumers, or with a single (longitudinal) panel that is interviewed over time.
Since the researcher has information on when the ads launched, the length of each advertising flight, the money spent, and when the interviews were conducted, the results of ad tracking can provide information on the effects of advertising.
Purpose of Ad Tracking.
The purpose of ad tracking is generally to provide a measure of the combined effect of the media weight or spending level, the effectiveness of the media buy or targeting, and the quality of the advertising executions or creative. 
Advertisers use the results of ad tracking to estimate the return on investment (ROI) of advertising, and to refine advertising plans. Sometimes, tracking data are used to provide inputs to Marketing Mix Models which marketing science statisticians build to estimate the role of advertising, as compared to pricing, distribution and other marketplace variables on sales of the brand.
Methodology.
Today, most ad tracking studies are conducted via the Internet. Some ad tracking studies are conducted continuously and others are conducted at specific points in time (typically before the advertising appears in market, and then again after the advertising has been running for some period of time). The two approaches use different types of analyses, although both start by measuring advertising awareness. Typically, the respondent is either shown a brief portion of a commercial or a few memorable still images from the TV ad. Other media typically are cued using either branded or de-branded visual of the ad. Then, respondents answer three significant questions.
The continuous tracking design analyzes advertising awareness over time, in relation to ad spending; separately, this design tracks brand awareness, and then develops indices of effectiveness based on the strength of the correlations between ad spending and brand awareness. 
The most popular alternate approach to the continuous tracking design is the Communicants System longitudinal design, in which the same people are interviewed at two points in time. Changes in brand measures (for example, brand purchasing and future purchase intentions) exhibited among those who have seen the advertising are compared to the changes in brand measures that occurred among those unaware of advertising. By means of this method, the researchers can isolate those marketplace changes that were produced by advertising versus those that would have occurred without advertising.
Internet tracking.
There are several different tools to effectively track online ads: banner ads, ppc ads, pop-up ads, and other types. Several online advertising companies such as Google offer their own ad tracking service in order to effectively use their service to generate a positive ROI. Third-party ad tracking services are commonly used by affiliate marketers. Affiliate marketers are frequently unable to have access to the order page and therefore are unable to use a 3rd-party tool. Many different companies have created tools to effectively track their commissions in order to optimize their profit potential. The information provided will show the marketer which advertising methods are generating income and which are not. This information will allow the marketer to effectively allocate his budget in the best possible way.

NEPman

The NEPmen were businessmen and women in the young Soviet Union who took advantage of the opportunities for private trade and small-scale manufacturing created by the New Economic Policy (NEP). The NEP was a response to revolts against meager rations in the USSR during the early 1920s under Lenin's policy of War Communism. Vladimir Lenin responded by instituting the NEP, which encouraged private buying and selling, even to, as one official put it, "get rich".
These entrepreneurial activities, and their very existence, were an affront to the Communist Party and its goal of building socialism in the USSR. Yet, so long as state commercial and cooperative institutions were incapable of meeting the demand for goods and services, NEPmen were tolerated. As they gained a greater standard of living compared to their poor, working class counterparts, NEPmen became reviled, and stereotyped as greedy, and in some cases, Jewish.
By the early 1920s, NEPmen began to be taxed heavily. In 1925, these restrictions were reduced, affording NEPmen greater leeway in conducting commerce. This would not last for long, however. As Joseph Stalin consolidated power, he moved violently to end the New Economic Policy and put NEPmen out of business.

Cat Fishin'

Cat Fishin' is a 1947 American one-reel animated cartoon and is the 27th "Tom and Jerry" short directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, produced by Fred Quimby and animated by Kenneth Muse, Ed Barge, Michael Lah, Pete Burness and Ray Patterson. It was released to theatres on February 22, 1947 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer.
Plot.
The camera pans across a lake fence, where signs are posted that say "no fishing", "keep out", "private property", "no trespassing", and "beware of dog". Spike is shown guarding the fence asleep. Tom shows up with his fishing gear and he passes through the gate, but Spike just happens to yawn and recline on Tom's leg. Tom tries to get away, but Spike thinks Tom’s leg is a bone and grabs at it a second time. Spike licks the leg and takes a bite into it; it causes the cat to scream. Spike wakes up and looks around, but does not see anyone, as Tom hides behind Spike as the bulldog moves around. When he turns around again, Tom sits on top of his fishing pole. Spike still does not see him and goes back to sleep. Tom then walks towards the lake, but as he walks, the hook on his pole hooks Spike’s collar and drags him along. As the line tugs, Tom looks back and sees Spike about to fall off a small cliff of dirt. Frantic, the cat catches Spike and props him up with a stick. Tom then goes to the lake and starts to fish.
In his tackle box are plugs, lures, wigglers, flies, and live bait who was Jerry, sleeping. Tom wakes up Jerry, and the annoyed mouse takes off his robe with a look of disgust on his face. Tom then ties Jerry to his line and casts. Jerry is about to hit the water when he suddenly stops and dips his toe in the water to test the temperature. The water is ice cold, and Jerry races back to the tackle box with his blanket, shivering. A bunch of fish start making noise and Tom lowers Jerry over the water to feed them. The fish leap at him and Jerry fights them off, kicking and punching. Having failed, Tom casts again and a big blue and green pike with pointy teeth emerges. Jerry is cast into, and propelled out of, the fish's mouth. The pike chases Jerry, chomping all of Tom’s fishing pole in the process. The fish swats Tom with his tail and returns to the water, where he spits out Tom’s reel and throws it at Tom.
Tom then cuts a finger off a rubber glove and puts Jerry inside, making him look like a worm. Tom casts again and the pike prepares for dinner. Jerry, however, is on the ball and avoids the fork. As the pike leans in closer, Jerry squeezes the lemon into the pike’s face, beginning another chase. Tom grabs an oar and swats at the fish as the chase reaches the pier where he stands. It turns out that Jerry was the one who was hit and he emerges from the water, angry, with a lump on his head. To get back at the cat, Jerry smacks him with an oar, sending him into the water. The incensed cat emerges, but Jerry responds by tying a lure around Tom's tail. The pike bites Tom's tail, causing him to scream in pain and hold onto the dock as the pike pulls his tail. The impact slingshot throws the pike into Spike's mouth as he is waking up. After the pike hits Spike's head, the dog looks around to see Tom on the dock, and begins chasing him.
Tom dives in to escape, while Spike looks into the water. Tom emerges through a loose plank and swats Spike with it, and the dog falls. Tom then grabs Jerry and his pole and runs away until Spike emerges from another loose plank and chases Tom back to the end of the pier. Tom sidesteps Spike and Spike falls in, helped by a kick from the cat. Safe for now, Tom runs over to a rock and sees the pike again, so he casts again. Jerry then swims underwater toward Spike who is lying on the pier. Seeing a good chance to frame the cat, Jerry unties the line from himself and ties it to Spike’s foot, then tugs on the line to alert the cat of a bite. Tom yanks the line and gets the dog to fall off the pier and through the water. Spike grabs onto the pier, but the continued backward force causes all the boards to stack up and then come loose. The dog, followed by the boards, falls into the water.
Tom does not give up the fight, and Spike is squeezed through a pair of rocks on the way back to the cat. Jerry then hands Tom a club to knock out the "fish," and the oblivious cat, believing he has caught the fish and not noticing his bait next to him, wades into the water and hits Spike in the head multiple times. Eventually, Tom sees who he is attacking and yelps with fear. A lump forms on the dog's head, and the cat tries to remove it by pushing and lightly hammering it down. When it returns a third time, Tom hits the dog again, which removes the lump but angers the dog further. Jerry lowers a fishing line to Tom to help him escape from the dog as the chase passes under the tree where the mouse is, but he also teaches Tom a lesson by dangling him within the dog's range and pulling him repeatedly out of the way as Spike continues to bite at him.

Aristotelis Koundouroff

Aristotelis Koundouroff (Greek: Αριστοτέλης Κουντούρωφ) (1896–1969) was a Greek composer of the Modern Era. He attended the conservatories of Tbilisi (1924-5) and Moscow (1927–30), studying with Ippolitov-Ivanov, Glière and Vasilenko. He became head of Ippolitov-Ivanov's composition studio in Moscow. In 1930 he settled in Greece and he taught musical theory at the Piraeus League Conservatory (1931-2) and Woldemar Freeman's Musical Lycee (1932-8). He conducting the Nea Ionia municipal band (1938–41). From 1943 until his retirement in 1964 he was head of the music library and sound archives of Athens Radio. 
Koundouroff is now regarded as one of the most noteworthy figures of Greek music in the period 1930 to 1960. His earlier compositions (e.g. Suite-fantaisie sur des themes populaires 
grecs (1930–31), Sinfonietta (1934) etc.) show the influence of his Russian training, and of Prokofiev's `Soviet' style. Later works, including the tone poem Orpheus and Eurydice 
(1962) and the Mazurka for piano (1963), are harmonically more adventurous, inviting comparison with the more radical Russian modernists such as Skriabin and Roslavets.

Palazzo Carignano

The Palazzo Carignano is a historical building in the centre of Turin, Italy, which currently houses the Museum of the Risorgimento. It was once a private residence of the Princes of Carignano, after whom it is named. It is famous for its unique rounded façade. It is located on the "Via Accademia delle Scienze".
History.
The construction of the Palazzo Carignano was ordered by Emmanuel Philibert, son of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and his French wife Marie de Bourbon. Construction started in 1679 when the Prince was 51 years of age.
The Prince commissioned the native Savoyard architect Guarino Guarini to design a suitable residence for the cadet house of the reigning House of Savoy.
Guarini designed a vast structure in the shape of a square; he had a straight and restrained east facade created and a lavish and very unusual elliptical tower, slightly is withdrawn in facade, on the west. Guarini also added a large forecourt at the centre of the palace.
The decorations over the windows of the piano nobile recall the campaign of the Carignano family with Carignan-Salières Regiment against the Iroquois in 1667. The interior has always been described as lavish. The interior has splendid frescoes and stucco decorations. Among the frescoes are some by Stefano Legnani, called il "Legnanino". The main stairwell is decorated with busts by Pietro Somazzi.
The building, constructed in brick in a typical Baroque style, has an elliptical center façade. This facade offers the only domestic project to make use of the undulating 'concave – convex – concave' rhythm established by Francesco Borromini in the church of S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane.
The Palazzo was the birthplace of the future "princesse de Lamballe" in 1749 – confidant of Marie Antoinette and for whom she lost her life for in 1792. Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano was born there in 1770. It was also the birthplace of the first King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II in 1820.
From 1848 to 1861 the palace was used for the House of Deputies of the Subalpine Parliament. In 1861, with the creation of the parliament of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, the room became too small to host the House of Deputies, which was moved elsewhere.

Vietnam Idol

Vietnam Idol ( or from season 5) is a Vietnamese reality television competition to find new solo singing talents. It is part of the "Idol" franchise; it originated from the reality program "Pop Idol" created by British entertainment executive Simon Fuller. The 2010 season is being produced by Vietnam Television (VTV6) and the BHD Pictures, replacing the joint-venture between Ho Chi Minh City Television and Dong Tay Promotion before.
History.
"Vietnam Idol" was created based on the British show "Pop Idol" and U.S. show "American Idol". The show debuted in 2007 in Vietnam, broadcast by Ho Chi Minh City Television under the production of Đông Tây Promotion. After two years active, the TV station and production company lost the license to produce a season to BHD Corp. and Vietnam Television. The show then under a name "Thần tượng âm nhạc: Vietnam Idol", which only mentioned previously but not included in the title card. The show was renewed for a fifth season under a pure Vietnamese name regarding on regulation of Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
The show is currently in production with Anh Quân, Mỹ Tâm and Nguyễn Quang Dũng as judges and Phan Anh hosts after one season break. Former personnels are Siu Black, Quốc Trung, Diễm Quỳnh, Tuấn Khanh, Hà Dũng, Trần Mạnh Tuấn, Hồ Hoài Anh. Former MCs were Nguyên Vũ, Thanh Thảo, Sỹ Luân and Huy Khánh.
Series overview and season synopses.
Season 1.
The first season of Vietnam Idol premiered on May 23, 2007 on HTV9. It was hosted by Thanh Thảo and Nguyên Vũ. The judges panel includes Siu Black, Tuấn Khanh and Hà Dũng. The grand finale was held on October 3, 2007 at Hòa Bình Theater with Phương Vy crowned the winner over Ngọc Ánh; Vy then sang her coronation song ""Nụ cười và những ước mơ"" ("Smiles and Dreams") but did not release it as her single. Over 720,000 votes were counted for the finale and this has been the only season so far to announce the number of votes. Phương Vy, Ngọc Ánh, Thảo Trang, Trà My, Duy Khánh released their solo albums afterwards and enjoyed moderate success after the show.
Season 2.
Following the success of season one, it was confirmed by the producers that Vietnam Idol had been renewed for a second season with auditions would take place in June. However, the authorities subsequently postponed the contest until late July, early August, stating that there were many similar contests on HTV from then to the year’s end and the event was not suitable in the country’s current social and economic situation. As a result, auditions commenced a month later than the original schedule. The season premiered on September 3 on HTV7. Sỹ Luân replaced Nguyên Vũ in season 1 to co-host the show with Thanh Thảo. The judges panel welcomed Hồ Hoài Anh and Trần Mạnh Tuấn as two new judges along with the original judge from season one - Siu Black.
At the Grand Finale, Quốc Thiên was announced the winner, taking the title over Thanh Duy. The coronation song for season one ""Nụ cười và những ước mơ"" was used again for this season.
Season 3.
After the show took a one year break in 2009, it was renewed for a third season in 2010. Vietnam Television and BHD Pictures took over the production of the series from previous producers HTV and Đông Tây Promotion. While nearly 40,000 people signed up for the contest only 25,000 arrived to audition. This season followed the same structure as season 9 of American Idol, introducing "Save" option, inviting mentors for each round. The winner get a recording contract with BHD Entertainment instead of Music Faces Records as in the previous seasons. The semi-final and final rounds were filmed in BHD Pictures Studio and the grand finale took place in Lan Anh Music Center.
At the Grand Finale, Uyên Linh was announced the winner, taking the title over Mai Hương. Linh then performed the new coronation song called ""Cảm ơn tình yêu"" ("Thanks for Love") and released the song as her debut single a week later. 
Uyên Linh and Văn Mai Hương achieved significant media attention after the season ended. Both Linh and Hương have reached number one on Vietnamese Favorite Song chart.
Season 4.
It was officially confirmed that the show would return for the fourth season. Auditions will start in June, 2012. Siu Black ruled herself out of returning to judges' table only before the official press conference. On May 29, it was publicly unveiled the new judging panel, the new format and some changes. Mỹ Tâm replaced Siu Black, after her departure. Broadcast commenced on Friday, August 17 at 8PM slot, replacing The Amazing Race Vietnam.
Season 5.
Nguyễn Quang Dũng confirmed coming back for the fith season. Two new judges will soon be introduced.
Controversies.
The gameshow has come under intense criticism alleging voting irregularities and the lack of transparency in voting procedures. Major newspapers such as "Thanh Nien" and "Tuoi Tre" ran stories about votes for a contestant being counted for another contestant though there was no hard evidence to prove the allegation and the organisers maintained that the results cannot be manipulated. While the organizers maintain that allowing up to 500 votes per phone number and not publicly tallying votes are standard practices of all "Idol" shows, they have been accused of doing so to maximize profits at the expense of fairness. Furthermore, there were rumors about contestants' relationship with one of the judges and the PR manager of Vietnam Idol. A public auditor from the Singaporean auditing firm Paul Hooi & Co. was flown in to audit the vote counting process during the Grand Finale.

Godelina

Saint Godelina (also Godelieve, Godeliève, Godeleva) () (c. 1049 – July 6, 1070) was a Flemish saint. Tradition states that she was pious as a young girl, and became much sought after by suitors as a beautiful young woman. Godelina, however, wanted to became a nun. A nobleman named Bertolf (Berthold) of Gistel, however, determined to marry her, successfully invoked the help of Godelina's father's suzerain, Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. Godelina's mother-in-law soon forced the young bride to live in a narrow cell with little food to support her. Godelina shared this food with the poor.
Bertolf also spread false rumors about Godelina; the marriage was not consummated.
Godelina managed to escape to the home of her father, Hemfrid, seigneur of Wierre-Effroy. Hemfrid, appealing to the Bishop of Tournai and Soissons and the Count of Flanders, managed to have Bertolf restore Godelina to her rightful position as his wife.
Godelina returned to Gistel and soon after, at the order of Bertolf, was strangled by two servants and thrown into a pool. This was made to appear as if she had died a natural death.
After her death.
Bertolf married again; a daughter was born blind. Tradition states that Bertolf's daughter was cured through the intercession of Saint Godelina. Bertolf, now repentant of his crimes, went to Rome to obtain absolution. He went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and became a monk at St-Winnoc at Bergues.
Bertolf's daughter established a Benedictine monastery at Gistel, which was dedicated to St. Godelina. Bertolf’s daughter joined this new community as a nun.
Drogo, a monk at the former St. Winnoc abbey in Bergues, wrote Godelina's biography, the "Vita Godeliph", about ten years after her death.
Veneration.
Godelina's body was exhumed in 1084 by the Bishop of Tournai and Noyon, in the presence of Gertrude of Saxony, the wife of Robert I, Count of Flanders, the Abbot of Saint Winnoc's at Bergues and a number of clergymen. Godelina's popular cult developed thereafter.
Every year, on the Sunday following July 5, a procession celebrating St. Godelina takes place in Gistel.
Godelina's feast day, July 6, was, like that of Saint Swithun in England and Saint Medard in France, connected with the weather.[http://www.catholicculture.org/lit/activities/view.cfm?id=1133] She is thus considered one of the "weather saints."
The Godelieve Polyptych.
Godelina is also commonly known as Godelieve, and her life is represented in the Godelieve Polyptych, found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Cotswold is a small community located in the Town of Minto, in the northern part of Wellington County in southern Ontario, Canada. Cotswold was originally a separate community, but was amalgamated with other communities to create the Town of Minto. 
__FORCETOC__ 
History.
The name Cotswold is English, after a range of hills in the Midlands renowned for sheep grazing. The name does not reflect the backgrounds of the early settlers in the district, most of whom where Scottish and Irish; legend says that a settler imported sheep from Cotswold hills and borrowed the name for the post office. The community did have a couple stores, one of which also functioned as the post office. The early settlement also had a:
The Cotswold Cheese factory (Minto and Arthur Cheese and Butter Manerfacturing Company Limited) opened in 1881 and was successful in its thirty years of business but was still only a marginal operation. Records show a change in ownership of various businesses (possibly due to low profits). The community declined as the roads to Palmerston and Harriston improved. The post office was the last holdout, which closed in 1914. After fifty years of settlement, most of Cotswold's pioneers were gone.
Today.
The last remaining building was the Cotswold United Church. The Church was town down about 2010. The community has been amalgamated with: Clifford, Cotswold, Drew, Fultons, Glenlee, Harriston, and Palmerston to form the Town of Minto.

The University of North Carolina Press (or UNC Press), founded in 1922, is a university press that is part of the University of North Carolina. It is a member of the American Association of University Presses (AAUP) and the Green Press Initiative.
History.
In 1922, on the campus of the nation's oldest state university, thirteen faculty members and trustees met to charter a publishing house. Their creation, the University of North Carolina Press, was the first university press in the South and one of the first in the nation.
UNC Press was the first scholarly publisher to develop an ongoing program of books by and about African Americans, beginning in the late 1920s. By 1950, nearly 100 such volumes had appeared under its imprint. In the 1970s, UNC Press took an early lead in publishing feminist literary and historical works of distinction.
In 2009, the Press announced plans to bring back into print all of its out of print titles as print-on-demand titles through a series called “Enduring Editions.” These editions are published unaltered from the original and are presented in paperback formats, bringing both historical and cultural value to a new generation of scholars, students, and general readers.
Output.
Over the Press’s eighty-year history it has published more than 4,000 books. Many have won awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Bancroft Prize, and the Frederick Douglass Prize.
Notable UNC Press authors include historians such as John Hope Franklin, Edmund Morgan, Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, and Nell Irvin Painter; writers and critics such as Elizabeth Lawrence, Cleanth Brooks, and Paul Green; journalists such as Josephus Daniels and Lillian Smith; and local celebrities such as Mildred "Mama Dip" Council, Bland Simpson, David Stick, and Bill Neal.
The press has published many multi-volume documentary editions, such as "The Papers of John Marshall", "The Papers of General Nathanael Greene", "The Black Abolitionist Papers", and "The Complete Works of Captain John Smith".

Huỳnh Sanh Thông

Huỳnh Sanh Thông (Saigon, July 15, 1926 – November 15, 2008) was a Vietnamese American scholar and translator.
Life.
He was born to a rice-miller mother (Lâm Thị Kén) and a Francophile primary schoolteacher father (Huỳnh Sanh Thinh) in Hóc Môn, close to Sài Gòn (now Ho Chi Minh City). When the family moved into Sài Gòn itself, Thông enrolled at the prestigious Lycée Petrus Trương Vĩnh Ký where he studied French literature, specializing particularly in the works of Molière and La Fontaine.
In 1945, he joined the clandestine Vietnamese independence movement, opposed to the post-war re-establishment of French colonial rule in Vietnam. The following year, while working as a janitor at the US consulate, he was arrested by the French and held in a concentration camp outside Sài Gòn. Diplomatic pressure from the Americans resulted in his release, whereupon he fled to the United States as a political refugee, arriving in Athens, Ohio in 1948.
He graduated in Economics at Ohio University in 1951, but was particularly interested in the issue of gender inequality, which he saw as a serious problem both in the USA and in his native Vietnam. As he put it in 2008: "I looked for a way to
explain the difference between how responsible women and irresponsible
men were treated in society, as in my own family as well as in many others I could see." 
He studied international relations and anthropology at the Universities of Georgetown and Cornell before starting work with Robert B. Jones on a Vietnamese primer that was eventually published as "An Introduction to Spoken Vietnamese" (1960). 
For the month of May 1957, Thông was appointed by the US government as the official "Vietnamese welcomer" to Ngo Dinh Diem. Later that same year, he joined the staff of Yale University as a teacher of Vietnamese. He would remain associated with Yale for the rest of his life.
Works and awards.
Thông is best known for his English translation of Nguyễn Du's "Kim Vân Kiều", published as "The Tale of Kiều" (Yale University Press, 1973, reissued several times), and for "An Anthology of Vietnamese Poems: From the Eleventh through the Twentieth Centuries" (Yale). 
His translation of "Flowers from Hell" by the Vietnamese dissident poet Nguyen Chi Thien won the 1985 prize at the Poetry International Festival in Rotterdam.
He also founded the Lac-Viet book series, publishing work by Vietnam scholars such as O. W. Wolters; and the journal "Vietnam Forum" (16 issues, 1983–1997). 
In 1999, he self-published "The Golden Serpent: How Humans Learned to Speak and Invent Culture". 
He was awarded the Harry J. Benda Prize in Southeast Asia Studies in 1981, and a MacArthur "Genius" Award in 1987.

<doc id="9678445" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9678445" title="Political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency">
Political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency

A diverse variety of informal political groups emerged during the presidency of Vladimir Putin. They include remnants of the so-called Yeltsin Family, Saint Petersburg lawyers and -economists, and security-intelligence elements called the siloviki.
Background.
When Putin came to power, he had few protégés or long-term associates, and had to balance various competitive elements as he crafted his team. In contrast to the Yeltsin years, Putin's regime was marked by personnel stability, a gradual elevation of trusted associates and coalition-building across competing interests both within the presidential administration and with other political actors.
Overview.
As President Vladimir Putin, former employee of the Leningrad and Leningrad Oblast KGB Directorate and former Chief of the Committee for External Relations of Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office, had come to the presidency in 2000, many political observers noticed quick career promotion of bureaucracy and businesspeople from Saint Petersburg to the federal power bodies (especially the Presidential Executive Office, a very influential institution that has always been totally controlled by the presidential authority) and large state-controlled companies (such as Gazprom and Rosneft) and their struggle against old Moscow elites loyal to Boris Yeltsin's family, known as "Family group", as well as against influential media tycoon Boris Berezovsky and his allies, who helped Putin on his way to power in 1999 - 2000.
According to Associate Professor of Political Science John P. Willerton, it is difficult to make general judgements about the various informal groups, their backgrounds and political preferences.
Major groups.
St. Petersburg economists and lawyers.
According to Associate Professor of Political Science John P. Willerton of the University of Arizona in the United States, reformist St. Petersburg economists and lawyers constitute a prominent group in the Putin team. Many of them have career and personal ties to Putin dating back to the early 1990s.
Many of the members of the economic reform team, both in the presidential administration and the government, are drawn from the St Petersburg group. They are academically qualified and have significant administrative experience, are often focused on the technical complexities of the country's system transformation. They are - in general - committed to market development, privatization and the continued diminution of the state's role in the country's socioeconomic life. The liberal economists contend that the consolidation of democracy comes with improving the population's standard of living and developing the private sector. Prominent St Petersburg economists include Alexei Kudrin, German Gref and Putin's economic adviser Andrei Illarionov.
The St Petersburg lawyers focus on constitutional-legal-administrative arrangements to bolster and efficient democratic system, favouring reforms that strengthen simultaneously the market economy and political stability. Prominent members included the former presidential administration head Dmitry Medvedev and Dmitry Kozak.
Siloviki.
Much foreign attention has been given to the security-intelligence elements, what Russians refer to as the siloviki. They began coming to power under Yeltsin, but this accelerated during Putin's premiership and presidency. A common view in Russia is that these siloviki are generally non-ideological, are not corrupt, have a pragmatic law and order focus and have Russian national interests at heart. They do not form a cohesive group. It is worth noting that Putin himself is a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the KGB.
Remnants of the Yeltsin family.
Another identifiable group are the remnants of the so-called "Family" - a term which originally referred to relatives and associates of the former president Yeltsin. Most senior members of the group have left the highest corridors of power, but some have been able to survive and secure influential positions.
Ozero.
Ozero is the name of a co-operative society headed, inter alia, by Putin. The co-operative administers Putin's substantial personal wealth generated over the course of his presidency. The immense financial power of members of the co-operative fundamentally creates a wealthy clique of new oligarchs capable of replacing the financial power of Yeltsin era oligarchs.
Outside opinion.
According to a "The Washington Quarterly" article by Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap, at the start of his presidency, Vladimir Putin announced that he would consolidate political powers in Russia into the so-called "power vertical". However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within the president's inner circle. Although other institutions now became largely irrelevant, disputes and clashes between Kremlin factions, rather than the president's will, are getting more and more important in determining major policy outcomes, Bremmer and Charap write.
History.
During the final years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, Alexander Voloshin, chief of the Presidential Executive Office, was considered to be the most influential figure within the Family group. Despite his obvious connections to Russian commerce, he was dominating Russia's politics of that time. 
In 1999 the Family group, Vladimir Putin, Boris Berezovsky and their allies united their efforts in order to prevent coming to power of the Fatherland-All Russia political alliance of former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov that was supported by media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky and to some extent by the public opinion. The efforts were successful, but as soon as Putin had won the 2000 presidential election, an acute conflict with Boris Berezovsky developed, and in 2002 Berezovsky fled to London. As a result, Russian authorities consolidated their power over Russian TV companies NTV and ORT previously controlled by Vladimir Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky, respectively. 
The Family group has also almost entirely lost its influence by 2004 after the dismissals of Alexander Voloshin (October 2003), Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov (February 2004) and some key figures of his Cabinet, but some of the group's members secured their political survival. Vladislav Surkov, initially being an aide to Voloshin, gained much influence, as well as Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, who had leaned towards new Saint Petersburg elites and whose son had become Igor Sechin's son-in-law. Tycoon Roman Abramovich, who had leaned towards the Family group in the 1990s, also remained influential, as well as former Mass Media Minister Mikhail Lesin. Each of them, however, had already distanced away from the Family group by that time.
As the Family group had lost its influence, especially during Vladimir Putin's second four-year presidential term (since May 7, 2004), some conflicts between parts of the new elites of Saint Petersburg origin became evident, as witnessed e.g. by the disputes over the fate of YUKOS, failed project of merging Rosneft and Gazprom, struggle for Sibneft and upcoming 2008 presidential election, some appointments and dismissals in Mikhail Fradkov's Second Cabinet and consequences of the Three Whales Corruption Scandal, but the exact configuration of these new groups still remains unclear. However, it is widely acknowledged that Igor Sechin and Dmitry Medvedev are key figures heading their own factions and opposed to each other but both very close to Putin. Former Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov is considered close ally of Sechin.

Death of Kurt Cobain

Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of the American grunge band Nirvana, was found dead at his home located at 171 Lake Washington Boulevard in Seattle, Washington on April 8, 1994. Forensic analysis determined that he had committed suicide three days prior on April 5. The Seattle City Police Department incident report states that "Kurt Cobain was found with a shotgun across his body, had a visible head wound and there was a suicide note discovered nearby". The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbow. Prior to his death, Cobain had checked out of a drug rehabilitation facility and been reported suicidal by his wife Courtney Love.
Despite the official ruling of suicide, several theories have arisen offering alternate explanations for Cobain's death. Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Courtney Love to find Cobain after his departure from rehab, put forth his belief that Cobain was murdered. Grant's theory has since been analyzed and questioned by television shows, films, and books. Authors and filmmakers have also attempted to explain what might have happened during Cobain's final days and what might have led him to commit suicide.
Discovery of Cobain's body.
On April 8 1994, Kurt Cobain was discovered in the living quarters above his garage at his Lake Washington house by VECA Electric employee Gary Smith. Smith arrived at the house in the morning to install security lighting and saw Cobain lying inside. He found what he thought might be a suicide note with a pen stuck through it beneath an overturned flowerpot. A shotgun purchased for Cobain by Dylan Carlson was found resting on Cobain's chest. Cobain's death certificate stated that his death was a result of a "contact perforating shotgun wound to the head" and concluded his death a suicide. The report estimated that Cobain died on April 5, 1994.
Memorial and cremation.
On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at the Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived and distributed some of his clothing to fans. In the following days, Love publicly consoled and mourned with fans who would come to their house.
Cobain's body was cremated, and Love divided portions of his ashes, some of which she kept in a teddy bear and some within an urn. Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994. Here they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.
A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while his daughter Frances Bean scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he "had found his true artistic muse."
Theories.
Suicide.
Advocates of the verdict (death by self-inflicted gunshot wound) cite Cobain's persistent drug addiction, clinical depression, and handwritten suicide note as conclusive proof. Members of Cobain's family also noted patterns of depression and instability in Cobain before he achieved fame. Cobain himself mentioned that his stomach pains from an undiagnosed stomach condition during Nirvana's 1991 European tour were so severe that he became suicidal and stated that taking heroin was "choice" saying, "This [heroin is the only thing that's saving me from blowing my head off right now."
Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, pointed out that there was a family history of suicide. Beverly claimed that bipolar disorder and his struggles with drug addiction led him to commit suicide.
In Charles Cross's "Heavier than Heaven", Nirvana band member and bass guitarist Krist Novoselic talked about seeing Cobain in the days before the intervention: "He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody." An offer to buy a nice dinner for Cobain resulted in Novoselic unintentionally driving him to score heroin. "His dealer was right there. He wanted to get fucked up into oblivion. ... He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do." In his own book, "Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy", Novoselic alluded to the circumstances of Cobain's death: "Tragically, picked the wrong way to resign from the position he was thrust into."
In March 2014, the Seattle Police Department developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault—a reason was not provided for why the rolls were not developed earlier. According to the Seattle police, the 35mm photographs show the scene of Cobain's dead body more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a cold case investigator, was instructed to look at the film because "it is 20 years later and it’s a high media case." Ciesynski stated that Cobain's death remains a suicide and that the images will not be released publicly: 
What are people going to gain from seeing pictures of Kurt Cobain laying on the ground with his hair blown back, with blood coming out of his nose and trauma to his eyes from a penetrating shotgun wound? How’s that going to benefit anybody? It wasn’t going to change my decision that this was a suicide, and actually I’m the one that makes the decision finally: Do we go forward or not? Morally I would not be able to justify that. Legally I can’t justify doing that.
According to a Seattle Police Department spokeswoman, the department receives at least one weekly request, mostly through Twitter, to reopen the investigation, resulting in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.
Richard Lee.
The first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle public access host Richard Lee. A week after Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series covering Cobain's death called "Kurt Cobain Was Murdered". Lee claimed several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which Lee claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point-blank shotgun blast to the head (several pathology experts have noted that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head).
Tom Grant.
The main proponent of the existence of a conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death is Tom Grant, a private investigator employed by Courtney Love after Cobain's disappearance from rehab. Grant was still under Love's employment when Cobain's body was found. Grant believes that Cobain's death was a homicide.
There are several key components to Grant's theory:
Bloodstream heroin levels.
On April 14, 1994, "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" reported that Cobain was "high on heroin when he pulled the trigger". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of heroin in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was also evidence of diazepam, trade name Valium, in his blood. In the report was a quote from Dr. Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute who stated that Cobain's heroin level was at "a high concentration, by any account." He also stated in the report that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. Grant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger.
Several different studies on heroin use have noted the difficulty in pinpointing the level of heroin that an addict can tolerate. In a 2004 story, "Dateline NBC" questioned five medical examiners about the figure from the toxicology report. Two of them noted the possibility that Cobain could have built up a tolerance through repeated usage that would have allowed him to pull the trigger himself, while the three others held that the information was inconclusive.
Grant does not believe that Cobain was killed by the heroin dose. He suggests that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain before the final shotgun blast was administered by the perpetrator.
Some have noted that Grant, Wallace, and Halperin have used the dosage figure reported in the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", not the actual autopsy report, and they may not have the correct figure. The Seattle Police Department cannot release the information to the media because reports and records of autopsies and postmortems are confidential and protected under Washington State law and under federal law by the "Privacy Act of 1974, US Code".
There have also been concerns that the high concentration may not translate to a high heroin dose, especially if Cobain died only a couple of minutes after the drug had been injected.
Police reported that Kurt Cobain had injection marks on both arms. The Seattle police department made this information public in the full toxicology report.
Suicide note.
While working for Love, Grant was given access to Cobain's suicide note and used her fax machine to make a photocopy, which has since been widely distributed.
After studying the note, Grant believed that it was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Courtney Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserted that the few lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest of it, are the only parts implying suicide. While the official report on Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that the official report does not distinguish the questionable lines from the rest of the note and simply draws the conclusion across the entire note. However, it should be noted that many of Kurt's notes were written in this manner, proven when Cobain's Journals were published in 2002.
Grant claims to have consulted with handwriting experts who support his assertion. Other experts disagree, however. Document examiner Janis Parker concluded the suicide note was written by Kurt Cobain. When "Dateline NBC" sent a copy of the note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive. One expert contacted by the television series "Unsolved Mysteries" noted the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy, not the original.
Shotgun.
The shotgun, a Remington Model 11 20-gauge, was not checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint Analysis Report, four latent prints were lifted but contained no legible prints.
The Seattle Police Department's follow-up report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. The officer had to pry the shotgun from Cobain's hands, which could be a factor in the illegible prints.
Police report.
Grant also cites circumstantial evidence from the official report. For example, the report claimed that the doors of the greenhouse could not have been locked from the outside, meaning that Cobain would have had to lock them himself. Grant claims that when he saw the doors for himself, he found that the doors could be locked and pulled shut. Grant also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to the key evidence, including the shotgun (although this could be attributed to the gun's oil coating or condensation in the greenhouse). Grant notes that the official report claims that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note and the pen (although as it was stabbed in the soil, it would be likely that a palm print would erase fingerprints) that had been poked through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on his hands. None of the circumstantial evidence directly points to murder, but Grant believes it supports the larger case.
Rome incident.
After Cobain's death, Love claimed that Cobain's overdose in Rome was a suicide attempt. Love told "Rolling Stone"'s David Fricke, "He took 50 pills. He probably forgot how many he took. But there was a definite suicidal urge, to be gobbling and gobbling and gobbling."
In studying the Rome incident, journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt, telling Halperin and Wallace, "We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me." Galletta also specifically denied Love's claim that fifty Rohypnol pills were removed from Cobain's stomach.
However, they also stated:
""Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?""
Galletta also noted that Cobain's recovery was aided by the "timely intervention" of Courtney Love, who called for help.
Grant believes that the claim that the Rome incident was a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. Grant claims that people close to Cobain, including Nirvana's management Gold Mountain, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's death. Grant believes that if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told so that they could have watched out for him.
Others have asserted that the claims by Gold Mountain and others were simply efforts to mask what was happening behind the scenes. Lee Ranaldo, guitarist for Sonic Youth, told "Rolling Stone", "Rome was only the latest installment of around Cobain keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world."
Rosemary Carroll.
Grant spoke to Cobain's attorney, Rosemary Carroll, at her office on April 13, 1994. He says that she pressed him to investigate Cobain's death and claimed that Cobain was not suicidal. Carroll also claims that Cobain had asked her to draw up a will excluding Love because he was planning to file for divorce. Grant claims that this was the motive for Cobain's death. Carroll has not denied Grant's allegations or commented publicly on the matter.
Nick Broomfield.
Filmmaker Nick Broomfield decided to investigate the theories for himself and took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love, including Love's estranged father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to Mentors' bandleader El Duce, who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain,
C Love: "El, I need a favour of you. My old man's been a real asshole lately, I need you to blow his fucking head off."
El Duce: "Are you serious"?
C Love: "Yeah, I'll give you $50,000 to blow his fucking head off."
El Duce: "I'm serious if you are".
CLove: "Where can I reach you"?
El Duce: "You can reach me here".
El Duce passed a polygraph administered by polygraph expert Edward Gelb. Though El Duce claimed that he knew who killed Kurt, he failed to mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, during the interview, he mentioned speaking to someone called Allen, before quickly saying,"I mean, my friend" then laughing, saying, "I'll let the FBI catch him". Broomfield incidentally captured El Duce's last interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night.
Broomfield titled the finished documentary "Kurt & Courtney", and it was released in 1998. In the end, however, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying, "I think that he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable."
Ian Halperin and Max Wallace.
Journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace took a similar path and attempted to investigate the conspiracy for themselves. Their initial work, the 1999 book "Who Killed Kurt Cobain?," drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. In particular, Halperin and Wallace insisted that Grant play the tapes of his conversations with Carroll so that they could confirm his story. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's "".
Contesting the murder theory.
Grant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation. As Grant related, "I wrestled with that ... but if I go broke, I'll have to give up my pursuit and Courtney wins."
Halperin and Wallace spoke to several people involved in the investigation of Cobain's death who refute the conspiracy. The Seattle medical examiner who examined Cobain's body, Dr. Nicholas Hartshorne, insisted that all of the evidence pointed to a suicide. However, many have questioned his opinion because he once promoted concerts for Nirvana, to which he replied, "It's leap of faith, that someone who once promoted concerts for bands would now risk his job, prison, and public disgrace, in order to cover up a murder. I have promoted numerous concerts. Would I aid in covering up a murder? No. As a promoter you don't have that type of relationship with the bands you promote." Sergeant Donald Cameron, one of the homicide detectives, specifically dismissed Grant's theory, claiming, " hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide." Cobain's friend, Dylan Carlson, told Halperin and Wallace that he also did not believe that the theory was legitimate and in an interview with Broomfield implied that if he believed his friend was murdered, he would have dealt with it himself. In "Kurt & Courtney", he specifically stated that he would kill Courtney and others involved if he believed they had killed Kurt. He has criticized Tom Grant's investigation, saying, "I think he's just a dipshit. A total incompetent. I was with him for three days when he came up here. He is a total incompetent. He couldn't find his ass with a map."
Many of Kurt's friends and family have supported the suicide verdict. Bandmate Krist Novoselic has strongly voiced his opinion that Kurt killed himself.
Kurt's friend Everett True has also stated that Kurt killed himself, as has Dave Grohl. Kurt's father, Donald Cobain (who worked with Washington State Patrol), has made no attempts to reopen the case, despite his professional connections.
Reactions of Cobain's friends.
Several of Cobain's friends have accepted that he committed suicide, but noted being surprised when it happened. Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain's, told "Rolling Stone", "I never knew to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time." In the same article, Dylan Carlson noted that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that Rome was a suicide attempt.
Danny Goldberg, husband of Rosemary Carroll and founder of Nirvana's management agency Gold Mountain Entertainment, refers in his book "Dispatches From The Culture Wars: How The Left Lost Teen Spirit" to "the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered" and states that Cobain's suicide "haunts me every day".
In August 2005, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon was asked about Kurt's death in an interview for "Uncut" magazine. When asked what she thought to be Kurt's motive in committing suicide, Gordon replied:
In the same interview Gordon's then husband and collaborator Thurston Moore stated that: 
A musical hero of Cobain's, Greg Sage, said about him in an interview:
Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain, has publicly said that he believes Kurt was the victim of murder and not suicide. He explicitly stated that he thinks Kurt "was murdered." Also of note, Courtney Love's first husband, "Falling" James Moreland, lead singer of the indie rock band The Leaving Trains, has publicly expressed that if he had remained married to Love, then he would likely have "wound up like Kurt, shoving a shotgun down own throat." Moreland also said that "She was always threatening me with violence and loved the idea of paying someone else do her dirty work," after she threatened to pay someone to beat him up. Rozz Rezabek, another 1980s flame of hers, attested to Moreland's feelings as well in an interview featured in the 1998 film "Kurt & Courtney".

KSPL changed call letters to KGNW on September 24, 1984. On January 1, 1987, KGNW moved to its current home at 820 AM while 1150 AM would simulcast the smooth jazz format of KEZX-FM (now KLCK). In 1989, KEZX began branding itself as "Business Radio 1150", which aired Business/Talk programming. In 1999, the station flipped to Classic R&B as KSRB. The programming was predominantly satellite-fed through ABC Radio's The Touch. On June 1, 2001, at 6 AM, the station flipped to all-news as "NewsChannel 1150", and changed call letters to KKNW, which carried the audio portion of CNN Headline News. In the mid-2000s, the station shifted its programming to an "alternative talk" format featuring only local shows.
In 2013, Sandusky Radio sold its radio holdings in Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona to Hubbard Broadcasting.

MCC Interim Linux

MCC Interim Linux was a Linux distribution first released in February 1992 by Owen Le Blanc of the Manchester Computing Centre (MCC), part of the University of Manchester. It has the distinction of being the first Linux distribution capable of being independently installed on a computer.
The MCC first made Linux available by anonymous FTP in November 1991. Le Blanc's irritations with his early experiments with Linux, such as the lack of a working fdisk (he would later write one), the need to use multiple FTP repositories to acquire all the essential software, and library version problems, inspired the creation of this distribution.
Le Blanc claimed he referred to the distributions as "interim" because "...they are not intended to be final or official. They are small, harmonious, and moderately tested. They do not conform to everyone's taste -- what release does? -- but they should provide a stable base to which other software can be added."
History.
Prior to its first release, the closest approximation to a Linux distribution had been H J Lu's "Boot-root" floppy disk images. These were two 5¼" diskette images containing the Linux kernel and the minimum tools required to get started. So minimal were these tools that to be able to boot from a hard drive required editing its master boot record with a hex editor.
The first release of MCC Interim Linux was based on version 0.12 of the Linux kernel and made use of Theodore Ts'o's ramdisk code to copy a small root image to memory, freeing the floppy drive for additional utilities diskettes.
He also stated his distributions were "unofficial experiments", describing the goals of his releases as being:
Indeed, no attempt was ever made to distribute it with a wide range of software or even the X386 windowing system.
Successors.
Soon after the first release came other distributions such as TAMU, created by individuals at Texas A&M University, Martin Junius's MJ, Softlanding Linux System and H J Lu's small base system. These in turn were quickly superseded by Debian and Slackware, the oldest surviving distributions.
The 1.0 distribution of MCC Interim pointed out that Debian was "five times the size of MCC, and quite comprehensive", and the final distribution encouraged users to switch to Debian by providing transitional support.
Included software.
Version 0.95c+.
As discussed in an email dated 23 April 1992, the boot and utilities disk pair included:
An optional pair of disks contained gcc and g++ 2.1, kermit and shoelace.
Version 0.99.p8.
Released on the 14th April 1993. Added to version 0.95c+ were bison, flex, gdb, gprof, groff, gzip and man.

The Truce Hurts

The Truce Hurts is a 1947 one-reel animated cartoon and is the 35th "Tom and Jerry" short. It was produced in Technicolor and released to theatres on July 17, 1948 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. The title is a pun on the phrase "the truth hurts".
Plot.
This film show opens with Jerry being thrown from the house along with Tom as well as Spike. Jerry stops by the garage and grabs a pipe, Tom also grabs a frying pan and Spike picks up a baseball bat, but Spike then stops the fight questioning the three of them and he exclaims, "What's all this fighting getting us huh? Cats can love dogs can't they?" He looks at Tom, who nods. "And mice can get along with cats, can't they?" Jerry shakes his head, then nods as Spike glares at him. They then make a truce, sign a peace treaty, with the song ""Auld Lang Syne"" being played in the background, and become allies.
Later, Spike wakes up and goes into the kitchen to make breakfast for his new friends. He pours three glasses of milk and Tom helps Jerry brush his teeth. Then Tom helps Jerry sit at the table. Jerry later goes outside where Butch (the cat) is making a meal for himself out of the garbage cans. He notices Jerry and decides to place Jerry on the plate. Tom walks outside, screams, and makes the save just in time by slamming the garbage can lid in Butch's face, as if to say, "Leave him alone!" and revealing his eyes as two orange peels. Tom kisses Jerry and sends him on his way. Butch then suddenly realizes that Tom and Jerry are now friends, so he screams like a young woman and knocks himself silly with a brick.
Tom is soon walking along the sidewalk where an unnamed dog is eating a bone (he was the dog from the "War Dogs" (1943 film)). He decides to make a meal out of Tom when he sees him, but Spike screams and makes the save just in time by punching the dog and knocking out all the canine's teeth. Then, Spike said "Are you okay Tom? Speak to me pal. Speak to me." Tom points out the giant apple in his mouth and Spike punches it down. Tom tries to swallow it, but it's much too big, so Spike punches Tom on the head, knocking him out by accident.
The three friends then walk along the sidewalk where a mud puddle is and Spike takes off his fur to help his friends walk across. But then a truck drives by, splashing mud onto the three which leaves them entirely in blackface. To their delight, they look to see that a T-bone steak has fallen out. They take it home and cook it, but each greedily proposes an unfair division that would let them have the largest share for himself. Tom plunges the fork into Spike's hand because Spike gave him the bone of the steak. Then, Jerry with the meat got fed to Spike and Tom pulls the meat out. A three-way struggle for the steak ensues, which causes the steak to be sent flying out of the window and into the gutter. Tom, Jerry and Spike, anguished by what happened, have realized they can never be friends again. Spike tears up the treaty, and they continue their fight of beating each other up.
Censorship.
The scene where the meat truck splatters mud all over Tom, Jerry and Spike, leaving them in blackface, is edited out on Cartoon Network and iTunes Store.

I Can't Make You Love Me

"I Can't Make You Love Me" is a song written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin and recorded by American singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt for her eleventh studio album "Luck of the Draw" (1991). Released as the album's third single in 1991, "I Can't Make You Love Me" became one of Raitt's most successful singles, reaching the top-twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the top-ten on the Adult Contemporary.
In August 2000, "Mojo" magazine voted "I Can't Make You Love Me" the eighth best track on its The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list. The song is ranked at number 339 on the "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. "I Can't Make You Love Me" has been recorded by a number of other artists, including George Michael, Adele, Boyz II Men, Kelly Clarkson, Nancy Wilson, Nina Girado, Priyanka Chopra and many others. It has also become a popular selection for televised contestants in singing competitions such as American Idol, Canadian Idol, The Voice, The X Factor and others.
Writing and recording.
"I Can’t Make You Love Me" was written by Nashville writers Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin, who were well-noted for their successes in the country arena. The song was rewritten a lot of times before being finalized, months later. "We wrote, most every week, in Mike’s basement," Shamblin told Peter Cooper in an interview with the Nashville Tennessean. "And we’d worked on this song for more than six months. One day, he said, ‘Come up to the living room,’ where his piano was. He sat down and started playing this melody, and it was one of the most moving pieces of music I’d heard. I mean, it hit me in a hard way... Instantly, I knew it was the best thing I’d ever been a part of." Reid and Shamblin were both country music songwriters, who according to some accounts originally wrote the song as a fast, bluegrass number. Upon slowing down the tempo considerably, they realized the song gained considerable power and thought about giving the song for three artists: Bonnie Raitt, Bette Midler or Linda Ronstadt. Eventually, the song made its way to Bonnie Raitt, who recorded the track for her eleventh studio album, "Luck of the Draw" (1991). Raitt co-produced the song with Don Was, while Bruce Hornsby provided a piano accompaniment.
Composition and inspiration.
"I Can't Make You Love Me" was composed in the key of Bb major, with a moderate slow tempo of 72 beats per minute. Raitt's vocal range on the song spans from the low-note of F3 to the high-note of BB4. The idea for the song came to Reid while reading an article about a man arrested for getting drunk and shooting at his girlfriend's car. The judge asked him if he had learned anything, to which he replied, "I learned, Your Honor, that you can't make a woman love you if she don't." Raitt recorded the vocal in just one take in the studio, later saying that it was so sad a song that she could not recapture the emotion: "We'd try to do it again and I just said, 'You know, this ain't going to happen.'"
A pensive ballad, "I Can't Make You Love Me" was recorded against a quiet electric piano-based arrangement, with prominent piano fills and interpolations supplied by Bruce Hornsby. The singer depicts a now one-sided romantic relationship about to end in soft but brutally honest terms: "Turn down the lights, turn down the bed/Turn down these voices inside my head/Lay down with me, tell me no lies/Just hold me close, don't patronize... don't patronize me/'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't/You can't make your heart feel something that it won't," she sings.
Critical reception and accolades.
"I Can't Make You Love Me" received acclaim from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of "Allmusic" praised the track, calling it a "strong song" and picking it as one of the album's best tracks. Steve Hochman of "Los Angeles Times" hailed the song as one of Raitt's most elegant tracks. Elysa Gardner wrote for "Rolling Stone" that "Raitt's gorgeously understated rendering of 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' in which sentiments such as 'I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power/But you won't' are delivered with a quiet resignation that's worth a hundred glissandi in emotional weight."
"I Can't Make You Love Me" entered many lists of the greatest songs of all time. In 2000, Mojo magazine placed it at number 8 on its "100 Greatest Songs of All Time" list. The song is also ranked #339 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The website "Ultimate Classic Rock" placed the song at number 24 on their "25 Saddest Songs Ever", praising Bonnie Raitt vocals, writing that "she sings in one of her most impassioned vocals ever. There's real ache in every word that drips from her pained lips."
The song's popularity helped solidify her remarkable late-in-career commercial success that had begun two years before. In the time since, "I Can't Make You Love Me" has gone on to become a pop standard and a mainstay of adult contemporary radio formats. For Raitt, the song was notoriously difficult to sing, due to its required vocal range, difficult phrasing and breathing, and the emotional content involved. At the televised Grammy Awards of 1992 Raitt performed it in an even more austere setting than on record, with just her and Hornsby highlighted. As she negotiated the final vocal line, she let out a big audible and visible sigh of relief that she had successfully gotten through it. Her live performance of the song was released on the 1994 album "Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume III". Raitt has continued to sing the song in all her concert tours:
Chart performance.
The song was a big hit for Raitt, reaching number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The song placed at number 100 on the Billboard Year-End chart of 1992. In New Zealand, the song was Raitt's highest charting-single, reaching number 22, while in Netherlands, the song charted moderately at number 44.
Bruce Hornsby performance use.
Although Bruce Hornsby had no hand in writing the song, his piano part on it became associated with him. Phil Collins described it as instantly recognizable as Hornsby's work. Hornsby's own publicity material mentions his role on the "classic".
On his own subsequent tours, Hornsby included the song in a number of his set lists. He sometimes let a female backing singer in his band take on the vocal. Other times, he sang the song himself.
George Michael version.
English singer-songwriter George Michael covered "I Can't Make You Love Me" and released as a B-side of his single, "Older", which was released on 20 January 1997 as the fourth single from the album of the same name. Michael's version was also included on his compilation, "" (1998). "Older" and "I Can't Make You Love Me" both reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.
Background and release.
After the release of his second studio album, "Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1" (1990), George Michael started a legal battle with his label, Sony Music, declaring his contract was financially inequitable and creatively stifling. Michael sued Sony to end his contract, leading to a long and costly legal battle that ended in 1995, with Michael signing to the newly launched Dreamworks Records label in the United States and Virgin in the rest of the world. In 1995, the singer released the song "Jesus to a Child", which became a huge hit worldwide, followed by "Fastlove" and "Spinning the Wheel", which also became successful songs from his third studio album, "Older" (1995).
While choosing the fourth single from the album, the title track "Older" was announced as the chosen one, with an EP also titled "Older" being released to promote the song. The EP features four tracks, including "Older", "The Strangest Thing (also from the album "Older") and two covers: the Brazilian famous song "Desafinado" and Bonnie Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me", which became the official b-side of the single. Since it was released as a B-side to "Older", "I Can't Make You Love Me" also entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3.
Chart performance.
The peak position is the same of its A-side single ""Older"".
Boyz II Men version.
American R&B vocal group Boyz II Men recorded "I Can't Make You Love Me" for their third cover album, "Love" (2009). Their version was released as the album's first single on October 27, 2009. Having a more R&B approach, "I Can't Make You Love Me" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, while it has achieved minor success on the Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Background and release.
After releasing their second cover album in 2007, "", which was well received by critics, but failed to produce a successful single, the band announced plans for a new cover album, that features cover versions of songs by "artists I don't think people would expect us to cover," according to member Shawn Stockman. On October 23, 2009, "I Can't Make You Love Me" was announced as "Love"'s lead-single. The song was later released on October 27, 2009 through iTunes store. For the band members, "We wanted to stay true to our roots, and it's a very beautiful song. And with our sound, we gave it an R&B twist. It's always been a favorite of ours, and we hope people will fall in love with it again."
Reception.
A writer for "Soul Bounce" wrote that "The biggest surprise on this album is the bluesy interpretation of Bonnie Rait's country hit, 'I Can't Make You Love Me.' Starting with strong lyrics and a deep fried instrumental, the Boyz make this song their own with their unique flow providing good contrast to a familiar melodic line." "Los Angeles Theatre" called it an "impassioned" performance. On the charts, the song performed very modesty, reaching number 75 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Adele version.
In 2011, English singer-songwriter Adele covered "I Can't Make You Love Me" for her first live album, "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" (2011). The song was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Adele's delivery and vocals. The song has charted on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the top-forty, although it was never released as a single.
Background and live performances.
While receiving positive reviews from music critics, Adele's sophomore album, "21" became one of the most successful albums of the 2010s, being the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012 and entering the Guinness World Records. While promoting the album and its third single, "Set Fire to the Rain", Adele performed on the iTunes Festival London 2011. On the setlist, Adele performed tracks from "21" and a cover of Bonnie Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me". Before performing the track, Adele stated that it was one of her favorite songs and described it as "perfect in every way". She added that Bonnie Raitt has a "stunning voice" and went on to compliment the lyrics, calling them "mind-blowing".
After the positive response of the "iTunes Festival" performance, Adele covered once again the track, during her first live album, "Live at the Royal Albert Hall", recorded on 22 September 2011. She further comment over the song, saying, "It blows me away" and further adding that she thought the song was "incredibly moving". Adele also commented on the emotions the song gives her, saying, "It makes me really, really happy and really, really devastated and depressed at the same time. It makes me think of my fondest and best times in my life, and it makes me think of the worst as well, and combined, probably is a recipe for disaster, but I do love this song. It's just fucking stunning."
Critical reception.
While reviewing her "iTunes Festival" performance, David Smyth of "London Evening Standard" wrote that Adele sang the song "with raw expressiveness." Andrew Leahey of "Allmusic" wrote that the cover "made all the more tender by the rarely heard frailties in Adele’s voice." Donald Gibson of "Seattle Pi" wrote that "she breathes new life into Bonnie Raitt's 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' with similar intimacy and conviction."
While reviewing her "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" DVD, critics lauded Adele's rendition. Andy Gill of "The Independent" called it an "impassioned version," while Alex Young of "Consequence of Sound" named it "heartfelt and stunning." Kit O'Toole of "Blogcritics" praised her rendition, writing that it "retains its heart-wrenching, devastating mood thanks to Adele’s multi-layered voice. Hearing her perform this song, one would imagine her as an older woman who has survived lifelong heartaches instead of a 23-year-old." Maria Schurr of "PopMatters" lauded the covers (Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me" and Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love") on the live album, naming "the most successful," writing that "both seem deeply heartfelt, like Adele understands, and is the only one who can make these words that are not hers ring true." Chris Willman of "The Wrap" called it "a classic of unrequited love that you’d have to swear she wrote if Bonnie Raitt hadn’t turned it into the ultimate female weepie back when Adele was 2."
Chart performance.
Despite not being released as a single, "I Can't Make You Love Me" debuted at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart week of 30 September 2012. It later peaked at number 37, on the following week, 6 October 2012, becoming her eighth top-forty song and first non-single top-forty hit.
Priyanka Chopra version.
In 2014, Indian actress and recording artist Priyanka Chopra recorded a version of "I Can't Make You Love Me" for her upcoming debut studio album. Speaking about the song, Chopra said "This is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's my ode to a classic, a song that I love, and one that says so much – this is for the actor in me." Chopra's version of the song incorporates electronic dance music (EDM) and electropop in its production. which comes courtesy of German producer Manuel "DJ Manian" Reuter. Andy Gensler from "Billboard" commented on how different Chopra's version was from the original by Raitt, saying that "Chopra's more uptempo take on the song is more likely to connect with a generation of ravers with no idea of the song's origin" The up-tempo version was demoed by American singer-songwriter Ester Dean at the request of Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine.
It was released on 22 April 2014, by DesiHits, in association with 2101 Records and Interscope Records. It is the third internationally released single following "In My City" (featuring will.i.am), which failed to achieve airplay in the United States, and the more successful "Exotic". The latter, a collaboration with Cuban rapper Pitbull, reached number 11 on the US Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart. In the United Kingdom, "I Can't Make You Love Me" serves as Chopra's debut single.
Chopra's version of "I Can't Make You Love Me" will be used to promote Beats by Dre. In a press release, it was revealed that the song would be used in the "launch of a new campaign for the popular Beats Pill XL portable Bluetooth speaker. Chopra and her new track will be featured in the national ad campaign, which will run nationwide from May 1st through May 25th".
An accompanying music video was filmed at Los Angeles in February 2014. It was conceptualised and directed by duo Jeff Nicholas and Jonathan Craven of The Uprising Creative. Actor Milo Ventimiglia plays Chopra's love interest and scenes include Chopra throwing coloured paint at Ventimiglia as part of celebrations for the Indian festival of Holi, as well as embraces between the couple and solo scenes with Chopra. According to NDTV, the video charts a fictional relationship that "goes from loving to hellish". Behind the scenes footage was released to Access Hollywood. It premiered in New York on 30 April 2014. Gensler noted that the video also contained product placement for Nokia and Beats by Dre speakers.
CNN-IBN said, "The singer certainly sounds great, so much that it's almost unbelievable it is Priyanka Chopra. The number is definitely foot-tapping and you're going to be hearing this one at every restaurant and club in the days to come" and added that Chopra had "definitely done a great job recreating the Bonnie Ratt song".
Other versions.
Mike Reid himself recorded the song on his 1992 album "Twilight Town" and taped a live version that appeared on Austin City Limits in 1993. Actress Maria Bello sings the song in the 2000 film "Duets" as a character with a past reminiscent of the song's story. "I Can't Make You Love Me" has also been recorded by a number of other artists, including Bon Iver, Will Downing, Prince, Kevin Mahogany, Bonnie Tyler, Mary Coughlan, Kenny Rogers, DJ Tomski, Nancy Wilson, Kimberley Locke, Patti LaBelle, Sophie Milman, Boyz II Men, Tank, Ester Dean, Venice, Nelson Rangell, Jimmy Sommers, Candy Dulfer, Nina Girado, Arnee Hidalgo, Sarah Bettens, Piotr Żaczek featuring Kuba Badach, Jill Johnson, Heather Peace, Gina G, Paul Carrack, Kate Ceberano, Mathai, Kelly Clarkson, Cameron Mitchell, Ian Moss and Charlotte Jones, Adele, Ginny Blackmore &Stan Walker to name some.

Betsiboka River

Betsiboka River is a long river in central-north Madagascar. It flows northwestward and empties to Bombetoka Bay, forming a large delta. It originates to the east of Antananarivo. The river is surrounded in mangroves. The river is distinct for its red-coloured water, which is caused by river sediments. The river carries an enormous amount of reddish-orange silt to the sea. Much of this silt is deposited at the mouth of the river or in the bay.
It is dramatic evidence of the catastrophic erosion of northwestern Madagascar. Removal of the native forest for cultivation and pastureland during the past 50 years has led to massive annual soil losses approaching 250 metric tonnes per hectare (112 tons per acre) in some regions of the island, the largest amount recorded anywhere in the world. Several fish species are endemic to the river basin, including the three cichlids "Paretroplus petiti", "P. tsimoly" and "P. maculatus".
The Betsiboka's largest tributary, the Ikopa River, drains the capital city of Antananarivo.

J/105

The International J/105 is a fixed keel one design racing sailboat. It was the first production boat featuring a retractable bowsprit, which allows for an unusually large asymmetric spinnaker.
It was introduced in 1991 by J/Boats and designed by Rod Johnstone.
J/105s are a common sight in one design racing and as of 2006, J/Boats has built over 720 J/105s. 
The J/105 is regarded as a fast design with a clean deck layout.
It was selected as the 1992 "Boat of the Year" in the Racer/Cruiser category by Sailing World Magazine.
The concept behind the J/105 line is to produce boats that are fast, strong, fun and easy to sail shorthanded while racing in One Design fleets or while cruising with dodger raised, sails furled and swim ladder swung off the transom.
J/105 has the stability, rig and sail controls to handle 15-20 knot winds without the need of reefing. It has the strength and seaworthiness for ocean going passages.
The J/105 is the most successful one-design keelboat class over 30' in the USA with over 680 boats sailing worldwide. The class association is an owner managed organization with strict one-design rules. In addition to its active use in one design sailing, the J/105s affordability makes it an attractive choice for PHRF and Single/Double handed offshore sailing. J/105s are also well suited for community sailing programs training high school age sailors in keel boat and offshore racing.
In 2008, J/Boats announced that new J/105 production commenced at the US Watercraft facility in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. US Watercraft is also the official builder for the International J/22 (since 2001) and International J/24 (since 1999).

Reyesano language

Reyesano, or Chirigua (Chiriba), is a nearly extinct Tacanan language that was spoken by only a few speakers, including children, in 1961 in Bolivia.
There still are adult speakers in the largely indigenous community of El Cozar in Reyes. However, it is doubtful that this language will survive much into the 21st century. Such is the margination of the indigenous people in the Beni that very little Reyesano words have entered the popular criollo Spanish, very unlike the situation in Quechua and Aymara influenced areas. There are many indigenous terms in "camba" (Spanish of the Beni) but they mostly of Guaraní origin carried to the Beni by the original settlers from Santa Cruz.
Evidently the name "Reyesano" comes from the name of the town of Reyes, of the Province of Ballivián in the Departmentof the Beni in the plains adjacent to the Bolivian Amazon. The language is also known as Sapiboca (Sapibocona), Maropa, Chumana, and perhaps Warisa (Guariza); these may have corresponded to different dialects.

Joe Bratty

Joe Bratty (c. 1961 - 31 July 1994) was a Northern Irish loyalist activist and a leading member of the Ulster Defence Association's South Belfast Brigade. The head of UDA activity in the area during one of the organisations most active phases Bratty was suspected by security forces of playing a role in, or at least orchestrating, around 15 killings.
Early years.
Bratty first came to attention in his native Ballynafeigh (an area in south Belfast) as a teenage street-fighter battling with local Catholic/republican youths and was responsible for altering the Workers' Party of Ireland slogan "Sectarianism Kills Workers" on the side of Havelock House to "Sectarianism Kills Taigs". Bratty, who was known for his hatred of black people, also appended the initials of the Ku Klux Klan to this piece of graffiti. During his years as a street-fighter, Bratty, who had distinctive oriental shaped eyes, was given the nickname 'Chinky' by his Catholic opponents. Given the proximity of the two communities on the Ormeau Road, Bratty had grown up alongside Catholics and as such had for a number of years been accused of terrorising people he knew to be Catholic with beatings and intimidation before becoming involved in murder around 1990.
UDA activity.
Eventually Bratty became head of the UDA in Ballynafeigh, leading his own unit from Annadale Flats. Bratty's unit struck on 7 September 1990 when they entered the house of a 34 year old Catholic, Emmanuel Shields, and shot him dead as he lay in bed with his pregnant girlfriend. According his family, Shields, who had a criminal record but not for republican activity, had regularly been targeted by Bratty and his associates for physical attack in the past and they had fired shots into his mother's house in nearby Burmah Street when he lived with her. Bratty christened his unit Ku Klux Klan and members of the group, including himself, had the initials KKK tattooed on their arms.
Bratty ordered the attack on the lower Ormeau branch of Sean Graham's bookmakers on 5 February 1992, an act resulting in the death of five men. Bratty was widely believed to have been present along with his right-hand man Raymond Elder during the attack, although the team that Bratty sent was made up of UFF members from east Belfast rather than local members. Another gunman had been provided by west Belfast UFF leader Johnny Adair, who had first conceived of the action. Alex Kerr, Bratty's commanding officer as South Belfast brigadier, commended the attack, claiming that lower Ormeau residents had been involved in shielding republicans before suggesting that the attack was revenge for the Teebane bombing.
In addition to the 5 February Ormeau Road bookmakers shootings, Bratty's unit was allegedly involved in the murder of Michael Gilbride, a Catholic taxi driver who had settled in the Lower Ormeau area. Gilbride was killed outside his parents home on Fernwood Street not far from Bratty's Annadale Flats base. Another victim was Donna Wilson, a Protestant and resident of Annadale Flats who had recently moved to the area from the Tullycarnet, East Belfast. A number of residents had complained to Bratty in his role as local UDA commander about the noise of her stereo and he assembled a team of ten men armed with baseball bats who broke in, beat her to death, seriously injuring three of her companions and wrecked the flat. In the end only a sixty-year-old who had led the complaints to Bratty was charged with relation to Wilson's death. Bratty was also identified as the getaway driver for the attack in which Teresa Clinton, the wife of a Sinn Féin election candidate, was murdered in her lower Ormeau home. Thomas "Tucker" Arnett, one of Bratty's closest lieutenants, was identified as the main gunman although not charged. Arnett died on 12 July 1996 as part of an internal UDA dispute when two fellow members of the organisation kicked him to death outside a bar on the Ormeau Road.
Death.
Bratty was first targeted in late 1991 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) when they decided to adopt the tactic of focusing on prominent loyalists rather than the British Army, a strategy similar to that employed by the Irish People's Liberation Organisation. Bratty's Annadale Flats home was attacked on 13 November, but Bratty was not at home and no one was hurt. Some time after this attack Bratty moved from the Annadale flats to live in Greenwood Lodge on the Upper Newtownards Road in east Belfast.
However, Bratty and Raymond Elder were killed by the IRA on 31 July 1994 in an act seen as one of a number of "revenge attacks" immediately prior to the IRA ceasefire. The pair had been drinking in a loyalist band hall unaware that two gunmen were waiting outside in a van, and both died at the scene of the attack. The gunmen were armed with AK-47 assault rifles. The van was pursued by a Royal Ulster Constabulary vehicle that was in the area but the chase stopped when the police vehicle was impeded by a crowd of republicans. Bratty was 33 years old at the time of his death. He left behind a widow and a son. His son was given honorary membership of the Paisley Imperial Blues flute band, the leading UDA-aligned flute band in Scotland, immediately following his father's death.
Reaction.
In the short-term the murder of Bratty was greeted as a triumph even by some normally opposed to violence. However, the aftermath saw three Catholics killed by the UDA in separate attacks with these sparking a series of PIRA bomb attacks on loyalists bars, thus bringing about a temporary return to the spiral of tit-for-tat killing. The killings of Bratty and Elder, along with that of Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) leader Ray Smallwoods earlier the same month, played a central role in delaying the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire. The CLMC had been considering declaring a ceasefire following the shootings in Loughinisland, but reversed their decision after these three killings as any cessation of violence would have been seen by the PIRA as a sign of weakness in their determination. This was confirmed by the UDP's David Adams, who said the CLMC was ready to call a ceasefire in late June/early July 1994, although his party colleague Gary McMichael admitted the killings of Bratty and Smallwoods convinced him that an IRA ceasefire was near as he felt these were long-standing targets who were being cleared up before calling a halt to hostilities.
Certain hardline elements with the UDA would later claim that Bratty's killing had been sanctioned by members of the CLMC who were eager to see a ceasefire as Bratty had been an outspoken opponent of the initiative. The allegations were never proven however. Pastor Kenny McClinton, a dissident former UFF gunman who was variously associated with the Ulster Independence Movement, the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the Orange Volunteers, even suggested in a pamphlet that Bratty's killing had been arranged by the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). This was part of a wider theme in McClinton's writing arguing that the PUP was a front for MI5 activity.
Bratty and Elder were commemorated in a wall plaque erected outside the Kimberley Bar off the Ormeau Road. The pub, where the pair had been on the day they were killed, was known as a UDA stronghold in the area. In 2007, a banner honouring Bratty during Twelfth of July celebrations by members of the Orange Order was met by outrage from the relatives of those Bratty allegedly killed.

Barnabas of Terni

Barnabas of Terni (died 1474 or 1477) was an Italian Friar Minor and missionary, who established the first monte di pietà.
Early life.
He belonged to the noble family of the Manassei and was a Doctor of Medicine and well versed in letters and philosophy before he entered the Order of Friars Minor in Umbria.
Religious work.
After devoting himself assiduously to the study of theology, Barnabas began to preach with wonderful success, but a severe illness obliged him to abandon this work. He was almost continually employed in different offices of importance. He proved himself a zealous promoter of that branch of the order known as the Observance.
Founding of first mont de piété.
After consulting his fellow religious Fortunatus Coppoli, who had been an eminent jurisconsult, and with the generous co-operation of the wealthy Perugians, Barnabas established the first Monte di Pietà, a charitable loan-institution, in their city in 1462. Violent opposition ensued, but Barnabas and Fortunatus prevailed over their enemies at a public disputation. Barnabas next extended his work to other cities; it was enthusiastically taken up by several great Franciscan missionaries, and in their day, the monti di pietà wonderfully improved the social conditions of Italy.
Death.
He died at the hermitage of the Carceri on Mount Subiaco at an advanced age and his remains were deposited there in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdelene. He is commemorated in the Franciscan martyrology on 17 February.

The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb

The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb is a 1993 stop-motion animated film made by bolexbrothers, and funded by the BBC, La Sept, producer Richard Hutchinson and Manga Entertainment, which also distributed the film on video. Though it draws its title character from the fairy tale "Tom Thumb", the story and setting is substantially different, depicting Tom as a fetus-like child living in a grim and squalid urban environment.
The story follows the tiny Tom Thumb as he is abducted from his loving parents and taken to an experimental laboratory, and his subsequent escape. He discovers a community of similarly-sized people living in a swamp, who help him on his journey to return to his parents. The film is largely dialogue-free, limited mostly to grunts and other non-verbal vocalizations.
"The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb" was made using a combination of stop-motion animation and pixilation (live actors posed and shot frame-by-frame), often with live actors and puppets sharing the frame. It was originally commissioned as a 10 minute short for BBC2's Christmas programming, but was rejected for being too dark for the festive season. The short version nevertheless garnered critical acclaim through showings at animation festivals, and a feature-length version was commissioned by the BBC a year later.

Bob Locker

Robert Awtry Locker (born March 15, 1938 in George, Iowa) is an American former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1965 to 1975 for five different teams. The sinker-balling Locker never made a start in his big-league career.
Biography.
Locker graduated from George High School in 1956, where he played baseball and basketball. He enrolled at Iowa State University, and made the varsity team in both sports. Locker graduated from ISU in 1960 with a Bachelor of Sciences degree in geology. After graduation, he signed his first professional baseball contract, with the Chicago White Sox.
Career.
Minor Leagues (1960–61, 1964).
Locker began his professional career in 1960 at Idaho Falls, appearing in a handful of games. The next year, he made 33 starts, winning 15 games, pitching 228 innings and leading the Three-I league with 215 strikeouts.
Locker missed the next two seasons due to military service. He returned to baseball in 1964, and winning 16 games for Indianapolis. It would be his last year in the minors.
Chicago White Sox (1965–1969).
At age 27, Bob Locker had made the big leagues, joining a bullpen that featured knuckleballers Hoyt Wilhelm and Eddie Fisher. He made his debut in Baltimore on April 14, 1965, tossing two innings and giving up three runs. Locker settled down, however, and in a stretch from May 30 to June 20—10 total appearances—he was unscored upon. He would finish his rookie campaign with 93⅓ innings pitched and a 3.15 earned-run average.
During his time in Chicago, Locker was the most often-used reliever. He appeared in 77 games in 1967 and 70 games in 1968. In 1969, Locker got off to a rough start (2-3 record, 6.55 ERA), and on June 8, the White Sox shipped him to the expansion Seattle Pilots for Gary Bell.
Seattle Pilots (1969) / Milwaukee Brewers (1970).
Upon arriving in Seattle, the 31-year-old Locker began a reversal of fortune, posting a 2.18 ERA for an expansion team that would finish in last place in the division. He finished the season with a flourish, allowing just eight runs in his last 30 appearances on the season.
When the Seattle Pilots moved to Milwaukee at the end of spring training, 1970, Locker went with them. He didn't stay there long; after appearing in 28 games for the Brewers, Locker's contract was purchased by the Oakland Athletics.
Oakland Athletics (1970–1972).
Locker made his presence felt once he arrived in Oakland, having allowed no runs in his first seven innings for the Athletics. His most impressive outing came on August 12, 1970, against the Cleveland Indians, in which he pitched 5⅔ of scoreless relief, the longest outing of his career.
In 1972, Locker was a key member of the World Series champion team, posting a 6–1 record and 2.65 ERA, often appearing in the seventh and eighth innings as the setup man for closer Rollie Fingers. Locker struggled in the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, giving up three runs in two innings of work. On October 21, he made his first and only World Series appearance, relieving Vida Blue with two outs in the sixth inning of Game 6. He gave up a single to Tony Pérez but got the final out of the inning before being removed for a pinch-hitter.
A month later, Oakland traded Locker to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Billy North.
Chicago Cubs (1973, 1975).
Pitching in the National League for the first time, Locker had one of his best seasons, winning 10 games, saving 18 and topping 100 innings pitched for the first time since 1969. In an odd twist, in November the Cubs sent him back to Oakland. According to Bruce Markusen in his 1998 book, "Baseball's Last Dynasty: Charlie Finley's Oakland A's", Locker had told Cubs general manager John Holland that he would only pitch one season for the Cubs, then he wanted to be traded back to the A's as owner Charlie Finley had agreed to try to arrange. Locker moved his family to Oakland and planned to live and work there after his baseball career. Holland and Charlie Finley obliged the pitcher's request but it turned out to be a bad deal for the A's. Locker had to undergo surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow and would sit out the entire 1974 season.
Finley sent Locker back to the Cubs just days after winning the 1974 World Series in exchange for veteran outfielder Billy Williams. Locker's 1975 season would be his last in the majors.
Retirement.
Since April 2010, Locker has been the creator and webmaster of a Marvin Miller tribute site, ThanksMarvin.com. The site collects memorabilia about the late Major League Baseball Player Association Executive Director in an attempt to raise awareness of Miller's importance in the American Labor Unions in the United States and to get Miller elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame when his name comes up for a ballot in 2014 as part of the "Expansion Era" group.

Sega Lock-On

Originally known at "VR-SHOOTER", the Sega Lock-On was a little-known laser tag game developed by Sega and originally released in 1992. There were three versions of this system made, unofficially called Mark I, Mark II and Voice Command Lock-On. The Mark I and Mark II versions operated the same and differed in their overall appearance. Each system consists of a headset and a gun for each player, the aim being to shoot the opponent's headset. The headset required one 9-Volt battery while the gun required two C batteries. The Mark II headset used four AAA batteries instead of the single 9V one. Each gun and headset was able to select between two teams, A and B. A gun set to team A could only hit a headset set to team B and vice versa. This way 'friendly fire' was not possible. 
The guns have a primary trigger which can be pressed once for a single shot or held for continuous fire, with an unlimited number of shots. A second trigger called the high power button is located on the left hand side of the gun and when pressed gives a quick tone indicating that a high powered shot is ready. If, within a few seconds, the main trigger is then pressed, a high power shot would be fired. This high power shot would take off three hit points from a headset, whereas a normal shot would take off one. When turned on, each headset would start at nine hit points and when shot would count down and display the remaining hit points. When they reached zero, the headset sounds a death tone and the player is tagged out. 
There exists a way to perform target practice with a headset and gun. The user would activate the headset, and during the power-on process, would shoot at the headset from the gun. The headset would go dark and silent for a random period of time before beeping and lighting up, indicating a target to shoot. After a short interval, if you didn't shoot it, it would go dark. The process would then continue.

Lastheneia of Mantinea

Lastheneia (or Lasthenia) of Mantinea () was one of Plato's female students.
She was born in Mantinea, an ancient city in Arcadia, in the Peloponnese. She studied in the Academy of Plato dressed as a man. After the death of Plato she continued her studies with Speusippus, Plato's nephew. She is also said to have had a relationship with Speusippus.
A papyrus fragment from Oxyrhynchus mentions an unidentified woman who studied under Plato, Speusippus, and then Menedemus of Eretria. The fragment goes on to explain that "in her teens she was lovely and full of unstudied grace." This woman is probably Lastheneia or Axiothea of Phlius.

Julie Gregg

Julie Gregg (born Niagara Falls, January 24, 1944) is an American television, film and stage actress. She generally played supporting or guest, but not lead, roles. She is best known for her portrayal of Sandra Corleone in "The Godfather". Very little information is available on her personal life.
Roles on television.
Gregg's first television role was in 1964 as a nurse in "McHale's Navy". She guest starred in many television shows in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, in both dramatic and comic roles. For example, she twice appeared on "Bewitched", in two different guest roles. The first was in "Double Split," episode no. 62 in season 2, 1966, and the second in 1967 during season 3, episode no. 99, "The Crone of Cawdor." In the latter show, she played Terry Warbell, a magic crone, who stole the youth of people when she kissed them, which she tried with Darrin Stevens, but which ultimately failed. In 1966 she played in Batman (episodes 33 and 34).

Episode: The Gift
S08, E24
A wounded bank robber hides his loot and dies in a saloon girl's (Julie Gregg) room, making her the target of his partner (Tab Hunter).
She had a recurring role in Banyon, an NBC detective series that aired from 1972-73. "Banyon" was a period drama starring Robert Forster set in Los Angeles in the late 1930s. Gregg played Banyon's girlfriend, Abby Graham, a nightclub singer who was constantly trying to encourage him to "settle down" and marry her, but to no avail during the brief run of this series.
Among her guest roles in the late 1960s and early 1970s were two separate episodes of "", where she again played different characters. In 1969, in season 4, episode 91 "Amnesiac", she played Monique, an Impossible Missions Force operative. That was the season when the show had no permanent female operative because Barbara Bain, who played Cinnamon Carter in seasons 1-3, had resigned and Lesley Ann Warren, who played Dana Lambert in season 5, had not yet signed on. Then in 1970 in season 5, she played Anna Kerkoska, a premier's daughter who needed rescuing, in episode no. 112, "Decoy". Anna fell in love with Jim Phelps, who did indeed rescue her by driving her across the border in a specially outfitted, low to the ground, automobile that could drive under the border gate. Also in 1970, she guest starred in a season 2 episode of "Hawaii Five-O", "The One with the Gun", as the wife of the man shot after a crooked card game.

Su Quanzhong

Su　Quanzhong (Chinese: 苏全忠; Pinyin: Sū Quánzhōng) is a character featured within the classic Chinese novel "Fengshen Yanyi". 
Su Quanzhong is the son of Su Hu, a neutrally high-ranked official of the Shang Dynasty. In appearance, Su Quanzhong had a face like a full moon with red lips which seemed as if painted. With his hair tied behind his head with a large golden ring, two large bird feathers would be seen protruding. Following the coalition against Su Hu led by Chong Houhu, Su would be known as a renowned protector of Ji province. Once Chong had arrived at the borders to Ji province and unleashed his right hand general, Mei Wu, Su would spur his horse forward and duel it out with him. Following twenty rounds of spear clashes, Su would find an opening and cut Mei Wu down. Following Chong's second retreat during the night from the burning forest, Su would descend down the mountaintop upon Chong while shining through the full moon's light. 
During his charge, he would elaborate his prowess by striking down both of Chong's head generals and even wounding Chong through his left arm. Once the moon was blotted out by the clouds and Chong retreated for the third time, Su found the situation as being too dangerous and decided it best to head back to his father. In time, the great Chong Heihu came as support for Chong Houhu. Soon enough, Su, even when told not to by his father, would charge out of Ji province and duel it out against Heihu. During their battle, their spears clashed like lightning through darkness-stricken clouds. In time, Heihu would unleash his magical gourd and capture Su. Following the end of the Su Hu arc, Su Quanzhong would pay his respect towards the first man who ever defeated him, Heihu, and continued to prosper with his respected father.
Su Quanzhong was appointed as the deity in Beidou Xinggong (北斗星宫) in the end.

Peter Schickele Presents an Evening with P. D. Q. Bach (1807–1742?)

Peter Schickele Presents an Evening with P. D. Q. Bach (1807–1742?) was the first concert and also the first release of the music of Peter Schickele under his comical pseudonym of P. D. Q. Bach by Vanguard Records. The Chamber Orchestra was conducted by Jorge Mester. The album consists of musical parodies with commentaries by the composer.
The recording was made at New York's The Town Hall at 8:30 P.M. on Saturday April 24, 1965. Here, for the first time, the professor discussed his imagined studies of the life and "recently discovered" works of P. D. Q. Bach. Some of New York's finest musicians were on hand to give splendid performances, according to Howard Klein of "The New York Times". Klein, realizing this was a one-time concert, hoped that a suitable foundation could be found to fund a nationwide tour.
Schickele made his first concert entrance by using a rope to slide down from the Town Hall balcony to the orchestra level and then taking the stage. Similar slapstick entrances became "de rigueur" at subsequent concerts.
The album was released as an LP in 1965 (Vanguard VMD 79195), and as a CD in 1987 (Vanguard VBD-79195).

<doc id="9679074" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9679074" title="Cruel Coppinger">
Cruel Coppinger

Cruel Coppinger is a semi-legendary figure in Cornish folklore. Coppinger was a real person, but various legends grew up around him, lending him near superhuman powers and a fearsome reputation. He is portrayed as huge and fearsome Dane who after being shipwrecked off Cornwall became the leader of a feared band of smugglers.
Legend.
The legend of Cruel Coppinger recognised today, is that recorded by Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker, the composer of the Cornish anthem "The Song of the Western Men", who collected the existing legends and, with a few additions of his own, published them in Charles Dickens' magazine "Household Words" in 1866.
His story was prefaced with the verse:
"Will you hear of Cruel Coppinger"
"He came from a foreign land;"
"He was brought to us by the salt water,"
"He was carried away by the wind!"
According to the legend, one night, during a great storm, a ship got into trouble near the shore of Cornwall. The local inhabitants turned out to the beach as they often would when there was a chance that a ship would be wrecked and valuable commodities washed up on shore.
On the deck of the ship they saw the lone figure of huge man, who, leaping into the sea, waded through the surf until he reached the shore. There he grabbed the cloak of an old woman and leapt up on the horse of a young woman who had come down to the shore. Shouting something in a foreign tongue, later held to be the language of the Vikings, he rode off with the girl and made his way to her house where he installed himself, uninvited. He announced himself as Coppinger from Denmark, and little-by-little secured the favour of Dinah Hamlyn, the girl he had carried off.
Eventually he secured her hand in marriage. He mysteriously raised enough money to buy himself a house and lands, and set himself up as the leader of a feared band of smugglers, wreakers and pirates in Cornwall. He controlled a number of bridle paths and footpaths which converged at a steep cliff, at the foot of which was a cave where he kept his booty and stolen livestock.
To discourage surveillance by the Revenue Officers, one of his gang beheaded one of them. Among the ships used by the "Cruel" gang was the "Black Prince", a ship built to Coppinger's own design in the shipyards of Denmark, with which he terrorised the English Channel. Using his knowledge of the waters of the Cornish coast he lured a Revenue cutter into the shallow waters of a cove and wrecked her.
When his father-in-law died Coppinger was eager to secure the remainder of his money, and to force his widowed mother-in-law to hand it over, he would threaten to whip his wife with a cat-o-nine-tails.
His son was born a deaf-mute. It was said that because of his father's crime, he was born without a soul. He was known to be mischievous and cruel, and one day was found laughing at the top of cliff, at the bottom of which was the body of a neighbour's child.
Coppinger is said to have disappeared one night when the pressure from the Revenue Officers finally became too much. A lone man saw him put out in small boat to a ship anchored off shore, which raised its sails and disappeared into the night. Coppinger was "carried away with the wind" and never seen again.
History.
Little is known of the real Coppinger. Two possible models are John Coppinger who arrived in Cornwall in around 1793 and Daniel Coppinger who was shipwrecked in 1792. It is likely that the Cruel Coppinger of legend is based on an amalgamation of the two.
John Coppinger was of Danish stock, but his family had established itself in Ireland. Reports in his family history suggest he left Cork in about 1760, and moved to Roscoff in Brittany where he had estates. His property in Brittany was destroyed during the French Revolution in 1793 and around this time he moved to Cornwall where he bought an estate named Trewhiddle, near St Austell. It is likely that he supplied contraband from Brittany to Cornwall
Daniel Coppinger is closer to the version of Cruel Coppinger in the legend. Shipwrecked in 1792, he married a woman named Hamlyn, though she was much older than the young girl featured in the legend and was called Ann rather than Dinah. He had property in Hartland and was known to be a "Free Trader" (a pirate or smuggler). He claimed to be a former Navy surgeon; a Coppinger did serve in the Royal Navy as a surgeon around that time, but whether these two were the same person is unknown.

Edwin T. Pratt (December 6, 1930 – January 26, 1969) was an American civil rights activist. At the time of his assassination in 1969, he was Executive Director of the Seattle Urban League.
Life.
Born in Miami, Florida, Pratt received his bachelor's degree from Clark College (Atlanta, Georgia) and his master's in social work from Atlanta University. He worked for the Urban League in Cleveland, Ohio and Kansas City, Missouri before arriving in Seattle in 1956 to be the Seattle league's Community Relations Secretary. In 1961, he became the Executive Director of the Seattle Urban League. Among his achievements was the Triad Plan for the desegregation of the Seattle Public Schools; he also led an initiative for equal housing opportunities.
Pratt was killed outside his home in Shoreline, Washington, a suburb immediately north of Seattle. Two men were involved in the shooting; it is presumed that a third drove the getaway car. It is still unknown who killed him; they were reportedly young men, but not even their race is certain. However, Seattle Weekly reported in May 2011 that the Pratt case was essentially solved, naming the three men involved in the shooting and the person who may have paid for it, a black contractor, although the ex-wife of the getaway driver maintained that the gunman killed Pratt purely for racial motives, not money. 
Pratt was survived by his wife, Bettye, and his daughter Miriam Katherine, who was five years old at the time of his death.
He is commemorated today by Seattle's Pratt Park and by the Pratt Fine Arts Center, which is partially in that park.
Pratt is also survived by a son Bill Pratt.

William des Roches

William des Roches (or Guillaume des Roches) (1165–1222), seneschal of Anjou, was a knight in the service of the Angevin Kings of England, and King Philip II of France after 1202. Guillaume was born somewhere in Anjou, most likely at Longué-Jumelles. 
Early life and career.
William des Roches early in his life had been a mesnie knight of King Henry II of England. During the rebellion of 1189, Richard of Poitou (later Richard I of England) and King Philip II of France attacked the ageing king of England in the city of his birth, Le Mans. Guillaume had participated in the defense of Le Mans in the company of such knights as William Marshal and Gerard Talbot and was with King Henry when he was forced to flee the city. According to "The History of William the Marshal", des Roches rode in the vanguard of the retreating royal force. He wheeled around with William Marshal and engaged Count Richard's vanguard where he successfully charged and knocked Philip de Colombiers off of his horse. 
After the death of King Henry, Guillaume enrolled in the royal mesnie of Richard, now King of England, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and Count of Anjou. William was a trusted confidant of King Richard, and during the Third Crusade he was involved in the conquest of Sicily, the Siege of Acre, the Battle of Arsuf, and the Battle of Jaffa. In 1192, he was sent with Pierre de Preaux and Gerard de Fournival as part of a deputation to obtain safe conducts for the crusading host to enter Jerusalem and its environs. William remained a steadfast adherent to Richard in his wars with King Philip of France from 1194–1199 and it may have been at this time that he was arranged to be married to Marguerite, the daughter and heiress of Robert de Sablé.
Angevin Civil War.
At the death of Richard at Chalus in April 1199, the Angevin kingship faced a serious succession dispute between Prince John of England, brother of King Richard, and Arthur of Brittany, Richard's nephew. The leaders of England, Normandy, and Poitou sided with John, while the barons of Anjou and Brittany chose Arthur according to their customs of succession. William, then at Le Mans, threw in his support for Arthur along with a very powerful group of Manceaux and Angevin barons, including Juhel II of Mayenne and his mother Isabella of Meulan. Des Roches became Arthur's seneschal of Anjou and was entrusted with the defense of Le Mans. The city of Tours was surrendered to Arthur and Eleanor, duchess of Aquitaine and queen-mother of England. In addition, she was Arthur's grandmother. She sent a force under Viscount Aimery VII of Thouars, John's newly appointed seneschal of Anjou (replacing Robert of Turnham), Hugh IX of Lusignan, and his brother Ralph of Exoudun, count of Eu. Eleanor's force was successful in entering the suburbs of Tours, but was driven back by King Philip II of France who had himself chosen Arthur as Richard's rightful successor. 
In May 1199, King Philip of France met with William des Roches at Le Mans and together they attacked the border fortress of Ballon, the fortress was surrendered by Geoffrey de Brûlon, the castellan, but not before being demolished. A quarrel ensued between King Philip and William over the lordship of the site. William was adamant that Ballon belonged rightfully to Duke Arthur, while King Philip wished to retain it as his own. 
In June 1199, King John of England launched a massive attack into Northern Maine from Argentan. On 13 September he was successful in repulsing King Philip from the fortress of Lavardin which protected the route from Le Mans to Tours. Arthur's supporters were forced to come to terms with John, and William met with the English king at Bourg-le-Roi, a fortress of the pro-John viscounts of Beaumont-en-Maine on or about 18 September. John convinced William that Arthur of Brittany was being used solely as tool of Capetian strategy and managed to convince him to switch sides. With this, John promised him the seneschalship of Anjou. During the night, John's incumbent seneschal, Viscount Aimery, took Arthur and Constance and fled the court. They fled first to Angers, then to the court of King Philip. King John officially designated William seneschal of Anjou in December 1199 and entered Angers triumphantly on 24 June 1200. 
During the summer of 1201, William married Marguerite de Sablé. With this marriage came a vast landholding that included Sablé, La Suze, Briollay, Maiet, Loupelandé, Genneteil, Precigné, and the Norman manor of Agon (which was held of the lord of Mayenne). William had become overnight one of the greatest barons of Anjou and Maine and relative-in-law to the most exclusive houses of the region. 
Coinciding with a renewed French attack on upper Normandy, Arthur along with many prominent knights of France and Poitou attempted to capture Eleanor of Aquitaine as she traveled from Anjou to her chief seat at Poitiers. Taking refuge in the castle of Mirebeau on the road just north of Poitiers, she came under siege. William agreed to help John with the relief of the castle as long as any prisoners captured were treated within common custom. He led a large contingent of Angevin knights along with Aimery of Thouars (now returned to favor with John by the diplomacy of Eleanor of Aquitaine) in John's company, and they arrived outside the castle on the night of July 31, 1202. The Battle of Mirebeau, fought the following day, was a decisive victory for King John in which Duke Arthur of Brittany was captured. Many of the prisoners captured were important Poitevins and Bretons that were grossly mistreated, including royal relatives like the viscount Hugh of Châtellerault and André de Chauvigny, they were starved to death. Arthur himself disappeared in John's Norman prisons and many, including the French king, came to the conclusion that Arthur was in fact murdered by his uncle, King John.
William immediately left John's service (between the 17th and the 25th of August) and departed to the court of Juhel de Mayenne. John sent soldiers to secure Angers and Tours and revoked William's seneschalship. King John then split the office and gave the seneschalship of Anjou to Brice the Chamberlain, a mercenary in his pay. The seneschalship of Tours was given to another mercenary captain, Martin Algais. Des Roches launched an attack on Angers and captured the city on 30 October 1202. Simultaneously, Sulpice III d'Amboise captured the town, but not the citadel at Tours. In January 1203, John mustered an army at Argentan for the reconquest of his Loire provinces. John took up court in Alençon and then Le Mans while his army was mustering. While in Le Mans he learned of the treachery of the count of Sees who had usurped authority in the town of Alençon ( a town that belonged to his grandfather, Count William Talvas, up to 1166). Along with Count Robert of Sees rebelled Viscount Ralph of Beaumont. With two great barons of northern Maine now in the French camp, John's chances of retaining even Maine were reduced significantly. John, avoiding fortresses belonging to rebels, slowly made his way back to his army at Argentan. Alençon was offered to King Philip of France by the rebellious count in return for Philip's recognition of his comital authority over the area and possession of the family's castle at La Roche-Mabile.
While the barons of northern Maine kept John busy, William and a league of barons from the region including Maurice III of Craon, Thibaud V of Blaison, Bernard III of La Ferte, and Juhel II of Mayenne traveled to Paris and offered their homage and fealty to King Philip of France. With this, King Philip launched his forces into Anjou to attack strongholds that still held out for John. Saumur was captured in April 1203 and Beaufort-en-Vallée and Châteauneuf-sur-Sarthe fell soon thereafter. William, and his forces launched an attack on Le Mans and captured the city by about 17 May. One of John's final acts of 1203 was to bring Alençon under siege in August, he was unsuccessful in capturing the castle, and with many of his Norman castles under siege or already captured (including Vaudreuil), he must have known that the end of Angevin rule north of the Loire was upon him.
King Philip triumphant.
William's family had originated from the lesser aristocracy, knights from Chateau-du-Loir, a castle that was granted as a dowry property of King Richard's widow, Berengaria of Navarre. Guillaume arranged for the exchange of his lordship of Le Mans (split with the bishop and the hereditary Manceaux seneschals, the 'Mauchien' family) for Berengaria's castle which he then became lord of. The exchange was ratified by King Philip. 
King Philip had conquered Normandy (receiving the surrender of Peter de Preaux at Rouen in April 1204. Philip had then marched through Anjou and entered Poitiers after the death of Duchess Eleanor on April 1. It was in Poitiers that Philip officially granted the hereditary seneschalship on to William. By a later charter (1206) William received custody of Angers, Loudun, Saumur, Brissac, Beaufort, and "all the land of Anjou" at the King's pleasure. The lasting settlement arranged in 1208 had King Philip retain authority in Touraine with the castles of Chinon, Bourgueil, Loudun, Saumur, and Langeais. William was granted custody of all of Anjou and Maine including the fortresses of Bauge and Chateauneuf-sur-Sarthe. In addition, William was granted the "third penny" of justice in Anjou and one mark of silver per fifty livres of demesnial revenue. He was also permitted to assign baillis to assist him, Hamelin de Roorta being the most prominent. Coincidentally, Aimery of Thouars was conferred the seneschalship of Poitou by King Philip to similar terms with exception to the added revenue. King John's senechal of Poitou for 1205 had been Savaric of Mauleon, who was limited to the Aunis coastline and later in the year the castle of Niort. 
Des Roches and Dreux of Mello, constable of France conducted the attack in Touraine culminating with capture of John's last Angevin fortresses, Chinon and Loches. Hubert de Burgh, John's castellan of both locations was forced to surrender in June 1205.
In 1206, John restabilized his rule in Poitou, Guienne, and Gascony, driving Castilian forces from Bourg, Bayonne, and Dax. Leading barons of Poitou preferred the absentee rule of King John to the more autocratic rule of King Philip; the Thouars, Mauleon, Lusignan, Parthenay, and Sugeres families all allied with King John. William set out with a force of knights to defend the Roman road connecting Tours and Poitiers. Other than a brief occupation of Angers, John was unsuccessful in making further progress north of the Loire. John departed after signing a two-year truce with King Philip that recognized the status quo. As soon as the truce was up in 1208, William and Dreux de Mello (based at Loches) collected some 300 knights and launched numerous attacks on Thouars holdings in Poitou.
Albigensian Crusade and later life.
William took the cross in 1209 and left Anjou to crusade in the Toulousain and Languedoc with the Eudes III of Burgundy against the Cathar heretics. He was active at the siege of Béziers in July and Carcassonne in August. He wouldn't again participate in the Albigensian Crusade until 1219 at the Siege of Marmande under Prince Louis (later Louis VIII of France, the eldest son and heir of King Philip II of France.
King John again attacked Anjou from the south during the Bouvines Campaign of 1214. John was repulsed from Nantes but was able to enter Angers on 17 June. John moved out of the city to reduce the local forts, two succumbed quickly, but the garrison of the new fort at La Roche-aux-Moines, located just south of Angers, held out. An army of 800 knights under the command of the seneschal, Prince Louis, Amauri I de Craon, and Henri Clement, marshal of France collected at Chinon. John was deserted by his Thouars and Lusignan allies upon hearing of the collection of so great a force. On 2 July 1214, William and Prince Louis were victorious at the Battle of La Roche-aux-Moines and forced John to retreat clear to La Rochelle.
The seneschal died in 1222 and his eldest daughter, Jeanne brought the Sable barony and the hereditary seneschalship to her husband, Amauri de Craon.

Early College High School (Costa Mesa, California)

The Early College High School Initiative.
Early College High Schools compress the time it takes to complete a high school diploma and the first two years of college. They are small schools from which students graduate with not only a high school diploma but also an associate’s degree or up to two years of college credit toward a bachelor’s degree. 
By changing the structure of the high school years and compressing the number of years to achieve a college degree, Early College High Schools attempt to improve graduation rates and better prepare students for entry into high-skill careers. 
The History of N-MUSD/CCC Early College High School.
Early College High School, otherwise known as "ECHS", is a collaborative effort between the Newport-Mesa Unified School District and Coastline Community College. It is a public high school for grades 9 through 12 located at 2990 Mesa Verde Drive East in the Mesa Verde neighborhood of Costa Mesa, California, on the former site of Mesa Verde Elementary School. Previously ECHS was on the Backbay / Monte Vista High School Campus.
Newport-Mesa Unified School District and Coastline Community College opened Early College High School in August 2006. ECHS is an academic program intended to enable students to pursue post-secondary education at a community college, four-year college or university. 
Students are offered not only the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and meet university entrance requirements, but they also take college courses for which they receive college units through concurrent enrollment. 
ECHS has a maximum population of one hundred students per grade level, allowing for smaller class sizes, frequent opportunities for individual participation, and personalized attention from faculty and staff.
In 2013, Coastline and Early College parted ways and now the High school is partnered with Marymount University and University of California Irvine.

Raquette Lake Camps

Raquette Lake Camps are located in the center of the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York, west of Lake George and south of Lake Placid. They are approximately 5 hours from Boston, Philadelphia, Montreal, and the metro New York area. Campers come from 18 different states and 10 countries. Campers can canoe for a radius of in all directions. The majority of the adjacent land is owned by the state and is utilized as a state park.
History.
In 1916 Mrs. Ray K. Phillips established the Cedar Island Camp for girls on Fourth Lake, near Inlet, NY. In 1920 the Cedar Island Corporation, of which she was a member, purchased the Antlers Hotel on Raquette Lake and she moved the girls' camp to the Antlers property, changing the name to Raquette Lake Girls Camp. Construction on the present girls' camp site began in 1922. At that time she formed a partnership with Max Berg to build a boys' camp across the lake on Woods Point (Timm, 1989).
In 1951 Philips and Berg sold their camps on Raquette Lake. The hotel was acquired by S. & I. Hotels, the girls' camp by Lee Krinsky, and the boys' camp by Phil Drucker and Gordon Liebowitz (Timm, 1989). The boys' and girls' camps then operated as separately owned "brother and sister" camps. Drucker and Liebowitz sold the boys' camp to Dave Gold in 1967 and Krinsky sold the girls' camp in 1973 to Jerry Halsband, who also purchased the boys' camp from Gold, returning the two camps to unified ownership after 22 years. He owned both camps until 2000. From 1981 through 1995 Helene (Falk) Leibowitz was head counselor positively impacting the lives of the campers and staff. The "Helene Leibowitz" legacy continues to this day through the presentation of the special camper spirit awards given at the final campfire.
At times through their history the camps have alternately been named Raquette Lake Girls Club, Raquette Lake Boys Club, but have always been private, tuition-based summer camps.
Camp alumni from the 1950s and 1960s recall the overnight train travel in sleeper cars from Grand Central Station in New York City to the Thendara station, then a transfer to the Town of Webb school buses to reach Raquette Lake. Girls were dropped off at their camp site but boys needed to walk down to the Antlers dock to ride the barge across to Woods Point.

<doc id="9679328" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9679328" title="Adam Air Flight 172">
Adam Air Flight 172

Adam Air Flight 172 was involved in a serious accident involving a Boeing 737-300, registered PK-KKV, while flying on a scheduled domestic passenger flight in Indonesia between Jakarta and Surabaya. Officials stated the aircraft passed safety checks prior to its departure. On 21 February 2007, the plane bent on landing, with the fuselage cracking in the middle of the passenger section. All six of Adam Air's remaining 737s were immediately grounded, but five of them were back in regular service later that year. This incident has caused further concerns regarding the safety of flights operated by Adam Air, which has received much criticism after the 1 January 2007 crash of Flight 574.
Aircraft.
The aircraft, a Boeing 737-33A, registration PK-KKV, was acquired by Adam Air in early-December 2006, having previously been operated by Brazilian operator Varig. The aircraft was manufactured in 1994.
Accident.
The plane bent upon landing at Juanda International Airport, with the fuselage cracking in the middle of the passenger section. It was reported that the landing itself was particularly hard, with baggage being ejected from cabin lockers into the cabin space. The tail section of the plane was bent down compared to the rest of the plane. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to alternate airports. The investigation into the cause of this accident is continuing, with Adam Air's fleet of Boeing 737-300s grounded for safety inspections in the interim. Immediately after the accident, Adam Air repainted the aircraft, covering the original orange livery with a plain white exterior. This is legally permissible, so long as no evidence is destroyed. Also in the immediate aftermath, a large number of passengers cancelled their flights with Adam Air, saying they had "lost faith" in the airline. They were all refunded in full.
Grounding of Adam Air's 737s.
As a result, all six remaining Adam Air 737s were immediately grounded awaiting safety checks. Adam Air described this as "harsh punishment" for an accident it blames on poor weather conditions causing a momentary loss of control, but the Vice President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, has said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked. He eventually decided the entire Indonesian fleet of 737s should be checked, but did not ground any more aircraft. There were also suggestions that Adam Air should be suspended from all operations until the entire fleet could be checked, with MP Abdul Hakim saying "It will be good for the company and the government ... until the flight authorities can determine if Adam Air is still worthy as national aircraft company". 
The Indonesian Transport Ministry has said that if the aircraft show signs of problems, the checks will be expanded to cover all 737s currently operating in Indonesia. On 5 March it was reported that five of the six aircraft had returned to normal operations, but the sixth was still undergoing a full maintenance overhaul at a maintenance, repair and overhaul firm GMF AeroAsia facility. Adam Air had resumed a complete normal schedule by 9 March 2007.
Investigation.
The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Committee (INTSC). Investigators have compiled data from the Indonesian weather agency and from the air traffic control center in Surabaya in an attempt to determine the cause, and have also interviewed the pilot. Officials state the aircraft did pass safety checks prior to its departure. Boeing has announced that they will also be providing technical assistance to both the authorities and the airline during the course of the investigation.
The final report from the NTSC stated that the probable cause of the accident was an excessive sink rate upon touchdown, following an unstabilized approach. In the report, the INTSC mentions that the approach was unstable to as low as , and that as a result the aircraft landed exceedingly hard, with a vertical airspeed in excess of 2500 fpm. This resulted in a force of approximately 5 g on landing. Additionally, the aircraft initially touched down with the right main gear approximately outside of the runway edge.
The investigation further revealed that there was no technical malfunction on the aircraft prior to touchdown.
The flight crew was also criticized for not maintaining a sterile cockpit during the landing, with excessive non-flight related discussion going on throughout the flight. This was considered a significant factor contributing to the accident.
Unusually for an aircraft accident investigation, the investigative committee was not provided information as to the identities of the flight crew of the aircraft.
Maintenance concerns.
The safety record of Adam Air has been heavily criticized, especially in the aftermath of Flight 574. Adam Air has reportedly bribed pilots to fly planes they knew were unsafe. Pilots have reported repeated and deliberate breaches of international safety regulations, and aircraft being flown in non-airworthy states for months at a time. They claim that there have been such incidents as requests to sign documents to allow an aircraft to fly, while not having the authority to, and while knowing the plane to be not airworthy, flying a plane for several months with a damaged door handle, swapping parts between aircraft to avoid mandatory replacement deadlines, being ordered to fly aircraft after exceeding the take-off limit of five times per pilot per day, flying an aircraft with a damaged window, using spare parts from other aircraft to keep planes in the air and the ignoring of pilot's requests not to take off due to unsafe aircraft. The Associated Press quotes one pilot as saying that "Every time you flew, you had to fight with the ground staff and the management about all the regulations you had to violate." They also claim that if pilots confronted their seniors in the airline, they were grounded or docked pay.
Aftermath.
Even though the accident remains under investigation, the Indonesian government announced plans immediately after the accident to ban jets over ten years of age for any commercial purpose. The age limit is currently 35 years or 70,000 landings. Although this is in response to a large number of aircraft accidents, it is mainly in response to this accident and the loss of Flight 574. Indonesia has also announced plans to reshuffle the Transportation Ministry in response to this incident, Flight 574 and the loss of the ferries and . Among those to be replaced are the directors of air and sea transports and the chairman of the National Committee for Transportation Safety. Indonesia also intends to introduce a new system of ranking airlines according to their safety record, with a level one ranking meaning the airline has no serious issues, a level two ranking meaning the airline must fix problems, and a level three rating forcing the airline to be shut down.

Bittu Bhaizee

Origins.
Like most localized folklore, Bittu Bhaizee, a popular folk hero in the North Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, originated as a social and moral guardian, an inhibitor against bad-deeds. The tale originates in the Rohru region located to the north of Shimla, the state capital. 
The legend tells of an enigma, a man who invariably inhabited every village, disguised as the faceless neighbour you would never pay attention to, the porter who would haul baskets full of apples into the waiting mule trains only never returning to collect his rightful wages, a vagabond known to loiter in the local orchards but never really seen by anyone. The role assigned to him is almost universally agreed now to be that of a “Watcher,” or an accountant of life’s good’s and evils and a creature some said did the work of the local village deity. He was later freed of these subservient limitations and became a somewhat independent entity. One who didn’t answer to anyone but existed all by himself as an integral part of the universal fabric of life, recording the behaviours of those around him and filling them into the giant mythological brass pots of good and evil at the end of each day.
Some credit the invention to a great storyteller who lived in the Pabbar river valley in the late 18th century, popularly known as “Shanthala Chacha” but these reports are mostly legends in themselves as no records indicating such a person have ever been found.
Today.
The legend is still alive and well today but has taken somewhat of a different twist. Today it is not uncommon to find people from this hilly state, especially in the Shimla district area, greeting each other with a rhetorical “Bittubhaizee ko zantay aap bhaizee?” (“Do you know Bittu Bhaizee my brother?”). The phrase has become a part of popular youth culture and is seeing a revival in the internet years as groups online are commemorating this folk hero, most notably on the social networking site Orkut, where a thriving Bittu Bhaizee community exists.

Soviet submarine K-431

Soviet submarine "K-431" (originally the Soviet submarine "K-31") was a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine that had a reactor accident on 10 August 1985. An explosion occurred during refueling of the submarine at Chazhma Bay, Vladivostok. There were ten fatalities and 49 other people suffered radiation injuries. TIME magazine has identified the accident as one of the world's "worst nuclear disasters".
Reactor refueling disaster.
The K-431, completed around 1965 as unit K-31, was a Project 675 (Echo II) class submarine with two pressurized water reactors, each 70 MWt capacity and using 20% enriched uranium as fuel. On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor tank lid was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly and had to be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control rods was lifted up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a criticality excursion of about 5x1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the machine enclosures, ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within 50–100 metres of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a 6 km stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, 1.5 km from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as 2 km2 in a swath 3.5 km long and 200 to 650 metres wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products. In part because the reactor did not contain spent fuel, the fraction of biologically active isotopes was far smaller than in the case of the Chernobyl disaster.
M. Takano "et al." suggest that only 29 GBq of I-131 was released, but larger amounts (620 GBq of I-133 and 1840 GBq of I-135) of other isotopes. The same source suggests that the total release was about 259 PBq but due to radioactive decay this decreased to 43 TBq after 24 hours. The same source suggests that the fission yield was 5e18 fissions which would deliver 156 MJ of heat into the reactor.
Ten naval personnel were killed (8 officers and 2 enlisted men), probably by the explosion itself and not from radiation injuries. Radiation injuries were observed in 49 people, with 10 developing radiation sickness; the latter figure included mostly firefighters, some of whom sustained doses up to 220 rad (2.2 Gy) external and 400 rem (4 Sv) to the thyroid gland. Of the 2,000 involved in cleanup operations, 290 were exposed to high levels of radiation compared to normal standards.
High-level waste gathered during clean-up operations was placed in temporary disposal sites. Due to the rapid decay of most of the fission products and the cleanup operations, some dockyard facilities were able to resume operations four days later. About two months post-accident the radioactivity in water in the cove was comparable to background levels, and 5–7 months post-accident the radiation levels were considered normal throughout the dock area. The damaged submarine was towed to Pavlovsk Bay and berthed there.
Consequences.
There were 10 fatalities and 49 other people suffered radiation injuries.

Pseudomedian

In statistics, the pseudomedian is a measure of centrality for data-sets and populations. It agrees with the median for symmetric data-sets or populations. In mathematical statistics, the pseudomedian is also a location parameter for probability distributions. 
Description.
In descriptive statistics, the pseudomedian of a data-set is measure of centrality, similar to a sample median. Other centrality statistics include the sample mean and a mode. 
In inferential statistics, the pseudomedian of a finite populations is the location parameter computed by the Hodges–Lehmann statistic. It coincides with a population median when the population is symmetric. 
In the statistical theory of probability distributions, the pseudomedian is the location parameter that is estimated by Hodges–Lehmann statistic. When the distribution is symmetric about a median, its pseudomedian coincides with that median. For nonsymmetric distributions, the pseudomedian is defined as the median of all of the midpoints of pairs of observations. Like the set of medians, the pseudomedian is well defined for all probability distributions, even for the many distributions that lack modes or means.
Pseudomedian filter in Signal Processing.
In Signal Processing there is another definition of pseudomedian filter for discrete signal. For a window of width 2N+1 pseudomedian defined as the average of the maximum of the minima and the minimum of the maxima of the N+1 sliding subwindows of length N+1.

John French, 2nd Earl of Ypres

John Richard Lowndes French, 2nd Earl of Ypres (6 July 1881- 5 April 1958) was the son of the British field marshal and the first commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in World War I Sir John French.
He was born near Morpeth in Northumberland where his father was stationed. He followed his father by joining the army and he served with the Royal Field Artillery but his military career was cut short following a riding accident. French was also a talented artist, something which did not endear him to his father.
He succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Ypres following his death on the 22 May 1925. During the Second World War he commanded a battalion of the Home Guard. He was succeeded by his son John.

Gold Coast Blaze

The Gold Coast Blaze was an Australian men's professional basketball team which competed in the National Basketball League (NBL). The Blaze competed in their inaugural season in 2007/08. The club was based on the Gold Coast and joined two other NBL clubs competing from Queensland. The Blaze played its home games at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre (GCCEC) in Broadbeach, known as "The Furnace" within the NBL. The team was not related to the previous Gold Coast representative in the NBL, the Gold Coast Rollers.
History.
The first official reports of a new Gold Coast franchise surfaced in September 2006. Former Gold Coast Rollers head coach Dave Claxton spearheaded a bid for a new NBL license for the Gold Coast. On 21 November 2006, the NBL Board officially accepted the bid and announced the addition of a new Gold Coast franchise and reported that the club would compete out of the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.
At the beginning of 2007 the newly founded Gold Coast franchise held a competition to name the club. The franchise offered four options to choose from including the 'Heat', 'Marlins', 'Flyers' and 'Waves', as well as the ability to suggest another alternative. On 23 February the franchise announced that it would compete under the 'Blaze' moniker. Despite the 'Heat' name being voted the most popular in the naming competition, club officials decided it would be best to steer clear of the name following objections from the NBA, due to the name being held by American franchise the Miami Heat.
Prior to the official naming of the franchise, the Blaze made their first major signing on 18 January in signing former Wollongong Hawks head coach Brendan Joyce as their inaugural head coach. Following this signing, two days later the club signed former West Sydney Razorbacks head coach Mark Watkins as the assistant coach.
On 5 April the Blaze announced the signing of their first player: former West Sydney Razorbacks captain Scott McGregor. On 2 May, Juaquin Hawkins was signed as the first import.
In the 2008–09 season, Shane Heal, the former South Dragons captain/coach joined the team along with Pero Cameron & Casey Frank. 
On 17 July 2012, the Gold Coast Blaze owners, Owen and Ben Tomlinson, decided to withdraw their bid to stay in the NBL for the 2012–13 season.

FLIR Systems

FLIR Systems is the world's largest commercial company specializing in the design and production of thermal imaging cameras, components and imaging sensors. Based in Wilsonville, Oregon, United States, and founded in 1978. The company makes thermal cameras and components for a wide variety of commercial and government applications. FLIR is a component of the S&P 500 index with annual revenues in excess of $1.5 billion annually as of 2013. In the spring of 2013, Andrew C. Teich became FLIR's chief executive officer and president after the retirement of Earl Lewis. FLIR employs approximately 3,000 people worldwide.
History.
FLIR took its name from the acronym for forward-looking infrared imaging systems. The company began in 1978 with airborne IR systems, and developed from 1978 to 2004 through product development and acquisitions of related companies. Originally based in Tigard, Oregon, the company relocated to Portland in the mid-1990s. FLIR teamed up with Hughes Aircraft Company in 1990, with Hughes taking part ownership of FLIR.
The company became publicly traded in a June 1993 IPO which raised $11.5 million for the company with shares offered at $12.50. In 1994, the company had grown to sales of $47 million annually. The next year, J. Kenneth Stringer III was named as president of the company. The company bought Sweden's Agema Infrared System in 1997, which doubled the size of the company. Acquisitions continued the following year when they purchased Inframetrics Inc. of Massachusetts for $48 million.
The company's president and chief executive officer Kenneth Stringer III was fired by the board of directors in May 2000 due to errors in the company's accounting practices. In September 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued FLIR over accounting irregularities. The next year three, executives at the company were charged with fraudulent accounting related to the SEC case that included claims of inflated sales. Sales at FLIR grew to $311 million in fiscal year 2003. In 2004, the company bought a building in Wilsonville from Mentor Graphics for $10.3 million for use as a new headquarters.
Beginning in 2005, the company began supplying BMW with imaging technology for use on the luxury automaker's vehicles. Also in 2005, FLIR was named the 55th fastest-growing company on CNNMoney's list of the 100 fastest-growing tech companies. In 2006, FLIR was listed as the 83rd best small business by "Forbes". The previous year they were ranked 39th. That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters.
In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants. FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations.
The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million. The next month FLIR executed its first stock split. FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million. For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company. On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation. FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the "Seattle Times" in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003). It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009, and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million. FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million.
Operations.
Headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, the company also has manufacturing facilities in Portland, Goleta (California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Bozeman (Montana), Täby (Sweden) and West Malling (UK). Worldwide, FLIR employs in excess of 3,000 people, with more than 1,200 located in the United States.
The company is structured to focus on six specific business segments. The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets. The Instruments segment produces thermography cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R&D, as well as test and measurement tools. Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group. Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment. Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the FLIR and Lorex brands by the Security segment. The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.

Philip Euen Mitchell

Sir Philip Euen Mitchell (1 May 1890 – 1964) was a British Colonial administrator who served as Governor of Uganda (1935–1940), Governor of Fiji (1942–1945) and Governor of Kenya (1944–1952).
Birth and education.
Philip Euen Mitchell was born on 1 May 1890 in London to a Scottish family.
His father Captain Hugh E. Mitchell (1849–1937) had served in the Royal Engineers, and after retiring had studied law at the Inner Temple and had become a barrister.
His father had played for the Royal Engineers team in the 1872 FA Cup Final.
His mother died when he was two years old, and his father moved to Gilbraltar where he built up his legal practice, living at Campamento in Spain. Philip was educated by a French tutor, becoming equally fluent in English, French and Spanish.
He won a scholarship to St Paul's School, London.
From St Paul's, he won a classical scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford.
While at university he was a friend of Joyce Cary. His behaviour was often wild, risking encounters with the police or the university proctors.
He was physically strong and good at most games, particularly golf.
He dropped out of University after two years and after losing his scholarship could not afford to return.
Early career.
Mitchell joined the Colonial Administrative Service in 1913.
He was sent to Zomba District in Nyasaland as an assistant resident.
While there he learned the Nyanja language, with some difficulty since it is a Bantu language completely unrelated to European languages.
He served in the King's African Rifles during World War I (1914–1918).
During this period he became completely fluent in the Swahili language.
In 1922 he was promoted to District Commissioner at Tanga, a seaport on the coast of Tanganyika near the Kenyan border.
In 1925, while on leave in South Africa, he married Margery Tyrwhitt-Drake.
As Tanganyika Secretary for Native Affairs, in 1929 Mitchell supported cooperatives, and claimed that "in a sense every Bantu village is in fact a co-operative society". The Tanganyika government did not act on his recommendation, using lack of staff and budget as the reason.
Colonial governor.
Uganda.
Mitchell was appointed Governor of Uganda in 1935.
During the depression, capital expenditure in Uganda had been slashed, and public infrastructure and services had deteriorated. In 1936, Mitchell appointed a committee to set priorities for development and to provide for financing.
He saw a need to completely review the relationship between Buganda and the government of the Protectorate.
He was concerned with political reform, recognising that the eventual goal was self-government.
In 1937 he implemented reforms that increased the planning and budgetary capacity of the Secretariat, and introduced district-level planning teams working with the District Commissioners.
All these changes had little time to show results when World War II (1939–1945) began.
In mid-1940 Sir Philip was transferred to Nairobi to co-ordinate the East African war effort.
In January 1941 he was appointed Chief Political Officer to General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander in Chief Middle East.
He was given the delicate job of administering the Italian African colonies that had fallen to the British.
In January 1942, as Chief Political Officer for the Commander in Chief, East Africa, Major-General Sir Philip Euen Mitchell signed a treaty with the Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. The reconquest of that country from the Italians had recently been completed.
Fiji.
Mitchell became Governor of Fiji, arriving there on 21 July 1942.
Mitchell was also British High Commissioner in the Western Pacific, and a large part of his job was to smooth out differences between the allied forces in the struggle with Japan.
Fiji had a mixed-race population of 210,518 of whom about 100,000 were Fijians and 90,000 Indians.
Although the white and Fijian people were on good terms and often intermarried, there were tensions with the large Indian population, most of whom were descendants of indentured labourers.
Another issue was that, while the Fijian people were happy to belong to the British Empire, many of the Indians were in sympathy with the independence movement in India and could not be called loyal subjects. 
A further source of tension was that between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian community.
Mitchell proposed that the islanders should be given greater power, but to his surprise found that the Fijians preferred the status quo, at least for the time being. Their reason was that they needed more time to develop experience in local government, or they would be dominated by the Indians. Mitchell nevertheless intended that Fiji should be put on course towards self-government, and wrote to the Colonial Office describing his views on how this would be achieved, and on the program for post-war reconstruction. Nothing was done about his recommendations during his term in office.
Even while the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were under Japanese occupation, Mitchell was in charge of planning for the colony`s future after the British regained control. At first, he was in favour of merging the colony with Fiji, since he felt it was too small to be viable on its own. The Colonial Office would not accept this proposal.
Later he moved to the idea that the Gilbert and Ellice Islands would have to remain as a Native Territory, but wanted the islanders to be trained so they could take on their own administration as far as possible.
Kenya.
Mitchell was Governor of Kenya from 11 December 1944 until 1952.
In February 1952, he received Princess Elizabeth on a visit just before her father died and she ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II.
Attitudes.
Talking after his retirement of the lack of planning in the early days in East Africa, Mitchell said "there was no colonial policy, for Secretaries of State changed every eighteen months or so; so no one ever disciplined a Governor and no Secretary of State would ever force a row with settlers".
However, Mitchell had a paternalistic attitude towards Africans, considering that they needed help from white settlers to become civilised. In "The Agrarian Problem in Kenya" he said of Africans: "They are a people who, however much natural ability and however admirable attributes they may possess, are without a history, culture or religion of their own and in that they are, as far as I know, unique in the modern world.
Once progressive, by 1947 Mitchell had become highly conservative. In May that year he wrote to Arthur Creech Jones, Secretary of State for the Colonies, saying Britain's task was "to civilise a great mass of human beings who are at present in a very primitive moral, cultural and social state".

Keith Feiling

Sir Keith Grahame Feiling (1884–1977) was Chichele Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford, 1946–1950. He was noted for his conservative interpretation of the past, showing an empire-oriented ideology in defence of hierarchical authority, paternalism, deference, the monarchy, Church, family, nation, status, and place. A Tory Democrat, he felt that conservatives possessed more character than other people, as he tried to demonstrate in his books on the history of the Conservative Party. He acknowledged the necessity of reform—as long as it was gradual, top-down, and grounded not in abstract theory but in an appreciation of English history. Thus he celebrated the reforms of the 1830s. English historian A.J.P. Taylor in 1950 praised Feiling's historiography, calling it "Toryism" in contrast to the more common "Whig history", or liberal historiography, written to show the inevitable progress of mankind. Taylor explains, "Toryism rests on doubt in human nature; it distrusts improvement, clings to traditional institutions, prefers the past to the future. It is a sentiment rather than a principle."
Early life and education.
The son of Ernest Feiling and Joan Barbara Hawkins, Keith Grahame Feiling was educated at Marlborough College, Marlborough, Wiltshire, England and Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated with first-class honours in Modern History in 1906.
Academic career.
Feiling was appointed tutor in history at Christ Church, Oxford in 1911 and became lecturer in Modern History in 1928 and was elected Ford's Lecturer in 1930. He was Chichele Professor of Modern History at All Souls College, Oxford between 1946 and 1950.
Honours.
He was invested as an Officer, Order of the British Empire and was awarded the James Tait Black Award for his biography of "Warren Hastings" in 1954.
For Feiling's 80th birthday in 1964, Hugh Trevor-Roper edited a festschrift, "Essays in British history presented to Sir Keith Feiling" with a foreword by Lord David Cecil.

StagsTV

StagsTV (formerly The Ham Channel) is a student-operated closed-circuit Student television station channel offering a regular season schedule of original programming written by, starring, and produced by Fairfield University students under the direction of the Media Center.
Change in Format.
To keep up with the changing times of the digital age - starting in the Fall of 2007 - the HAM Channel changed its primary media from analog cable TV to videos on the internet. StagsTV is now capable of reaching a global audience and viewers have the added convenience of choosing when and where to watch the programming. While the analog channel 64 still exists and is still in use, the new home for Ham Channel programming is their YouTube page.
In keeping with their new method of getting to their audience, the format of their programming has changed from the traditional half-hour shows on the campus CCTV channel to the new method of uploading segments to YouTube that are 3–10 minutes in length.
This new format has also given way to new programming which StagsTV is currently producing.
The only traditional analog show still on the CCTV channel is StagsTV's flagship program, Into It!, which has be re-vamped with a new host and a new format. The show features a new host,a monologue, various guests from the campus, and still allows fans to call in to the show. The show, which airs at 7:30 on Tuesday nights, aims at being a talk show and variety show loosely formatted on programs such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Daily Show.
Student Programming.
Stagstock.
Stagstock is an annual outdoor concert at Fairfield University each September to start off the year. It is produced by the HAM Channel with help from WVOF, the student radio station at Fairfield University.
The concert is popular and has showcased previous up-and-coming headlining musicians such as Howie Day, Matt Nathanson, Aloha, and The Alternate Routes.
Stagstock is also recorded and broadcast by the HAM Channel using their television production satellite uplink truck.
Notable Interview Subjects.
StagsTV has been able to interview several "big-names" in recent years:
Steering Committee.
A Steering Committee of eight students works closely with faculty and staff on management of the channel and production of scheduled programming for the season.
Media Center.
The Media Center is the facility located on the ground floor of Xavier Hall that houses The HAM Channel along with the New Media: Film, Television, and Radio major and the Campus Television Network. It contains two fully functioning television studios with control rooms, editing bays, a head end and classrooms. In keeping the technological changes in the field, the Media Center has invested much into High Definition studio and field cameras and a Blu-ray projector.
The Media Center also operates a television production satellite uplink truck that can transmit and receive digitally encoded television signals from geostationary domestic satellites. Fairfield University is one of few colleges in the nation to have this technology allowing campus programming and international news organizations including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and Bloomberg Television to be broadcast worldwide from the University.
The Media Center Staff has won national recognition for its Award-Winning Programs and production of Multimedia Presentations for the University. Some of the most recent honors have included the Crystal Award of Distinction from the Communicator Awards 2005 Print Competition; two Awards of Excellence from the Videographer 2005 Awards; and the Platinum BEST of Show from The Aurora 2005 Awards.
New Media Major.
All members of StagsTV are not required to major in New Media: Film, Television, and Radio which is the first of its kind among Jesuit universities. The New Media major offers students three distinct track concentrations in film, television and radio. The program requirements include classes in history, theory and production, all taught at the Media Center, a which provides students full access to two well equipped studios, high definition television production equipment; the mobile television and satellite uplink truck, 14 editing suites, screening and digital imaging rooms and classrooms.

Veniamin Kagan

Veniamin Fedorovich Kagan (; 10 March 1869 – 8 May 1953) was a Russian and Soviet mathematician and expert in geometry. He is the maternal grandfather of mathematician Yakov Sinai.
Biography.
Kagan was born in Shavli, Russian Empire (now Šiauliai, Lithuania) in 1869, to a poor Ashkenazi Jewish family. In 1871 his family moved to Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk), where he grew up. Kagan entered the Imperial Novorossiya University in Odessa in 1887, but was expelled for revolutionary activities in 1889. He was put on probation and sent back to Yekaterinoslav. He studied mathematics on his own and in 1892 passed the state exam at Kiev University.
In 1894 Kagan moved to St Petersburg where he continued his studies with Andrey Markov and Konstantin Posse. They tried to help him to obtain an academic position, but Kagan's Jewish background was an obstacle. Only in 1897 was he allowed to became a dozent at the Imperial Novorossiya University, where he continued to work until 1923. His students in the theory of relativity class he taught in 1921-22 included Nikolaj Papaleksi, Alexander Frumkin and Igor Tamm. 
Kagan worked at Moscow State University where he held the Geometry Chair from 1923 till 1952. Aging and disillusioned with anti-Semitic practices, he resigned from the university and died in Moscow soon afterwards.
Mathematical work.
He published over 100 mathematical papers in different parts of geometry, particularly on Lobachevsky geometry and on Riemannian geometry. He received the USSR State Prize in 1943. He founded the science publisher "Mathesis" in Odessa. He was a director of the mathematics and natural sciences department of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. He wrote a definitive biography of Nikolai Lobachevsky and edited his collected works (5 volumes, 1946–1951).
Kagan's doctoral students include Pyotr Rashevsky, Viktor Wagner and Isaak Yaglom.

Tauweru River

The Tauweru River, sometimes called the Taueru River, is a river in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand's North Island. It drains from the pastoral eastern highlands of the Wairarapa and joins the Ruamahanga River just north of the Gladstone Road bridge into Gladstone, southeast of Carterton. The river's name is Māori for "hanging in clusters" and named after it is the town of Tauweru, located along the middle reaches of the river east of Masterton.
The river itself is slow and sluggish, flowing in a willow-lined, restricted and gravel-less channel. A group of local farmers, the Mid-Tauweru Landcare Group, was established in 2000 to facilitate sound management of the river's riparian zone by replacing willows with native plants to enhance the river's flow and biodiversity. Its catchment east of Masterton is extensive and fishing conditions in the lower three kilometres of the river are considered to be excellent, especially in summer.

Carried Away (Ooberman album)

Carried Away is the third album by Ooberman, released in August 2006 on the band's own Rotodisc label. It was recorded and produced by the band.
The album.
The album was released soon after the band's reunion, and features several tracks recorded during the band's hiatus by various members of the band, as well as two which were released before the band's split. "Falling Down" was released on the Japanese issue of "Hey Petrunko", and "Lavender Blue" was available as a download from the band's website in December 2002. An earlier version of "Bong" was featured on an "official bootleg" pressed by the band, and featured in their live set during their 2003 tour. 
Two of the tracks were taken from albums by Ooberman side-projects - "Eye of the Storm" from Ooberon's "Waiting for the Sonic Boom" and "Twinkling Aurora" from Symphonika's "The Snow Queen". 
Three singles were released from the album - a 7" of The Beauty of Your Soul, and download-only releases of Carried Away and Crashing Ellipticals. 
The songs.
Most of the songs on the album were written by Dan Popplewell - either alone or in collaboration with Sophia Churney. As on "Hey Petrunko", Andy Flett has three sole writing credits. Bassist Steve Flett gets his first writing credit on an Ooberman album for "Go To Sleep", for which he also provides lead vocals. The track is very similar in style to his work under the Phantom 309 name. 
Track listing.
The album was also released in Japan on the Art Union label, with a new track - "Rosie Mel" - replacing "Falling Down", which had already appeared on an earlier Japanese release. Provisional tracklistings of the Carried Away album included this, as well as a cover of "My Yidishe Mama", a song made popular in the early part of the 20th century by Sophie Tucker. The latter has not yet surfaced on any release.

Morning Again

Morning Again was a Hardcore band from Florida. They were known for their metalcore sound as well as for their straight edge, vegan and anti-government ideas. The band
was a "sister band" to Culture, often switching members after one had left the other. Several members went on to play in other bands such as As Friends Rust and Dead Blue Sky. The band was originally from Cooper City, Florida, but moved to Fort Lauderdale in 1998.
History.
John Wylie who had left Culture earlier that year wanted a band with more intense and personal views. In December 1995, Morning Again was formed with Damien Moyal and Louie Long who had both been in Culture in the two prior years, on vocals and drums. Mike Wahls came in on second guitar, and Eric Ervin on bass. The band recorded an EP's worth of material which was sent to Conquer the World Records as it had released Born of You and the members were familiar with it. The label agreed to put it out, and the band made some promo tapes to help promote the upcoming release. Soon after the mini-album came out, Intention Records, who had also worked with Culture on their split with Roosevelt, asked John to release a 7" of new material. After landing a deal with the then-new label Good Life Recordings (as the first American band on the label) in Belgium (H8000 area), a compilation of all the released material was compiled for the European market.
Tensions between Moyal and Wylie once again surfaced, as they had in Culture. During one of the last shows with Moyal, Morning Again played with Ohio band Outcast . Byers and Wylie were getting along well and he was asked to replace Moyal. Within a week Byers had moved to Cooper City and was the new vocalist. During this time Ervin was also replaced by Peter Bartsocas (who was in Bird of Ill Omen, a band that had toured with MA early that year, and was on Wylie's record label). Immediately they started working on new songs, which would be released on a split with Shoulder on Moo Cow Records. Wahls and Bartsocas left almost immediately after, and Jerry Villarroel became the first stable bassist. They released another 7", as a four piece, on Immigrant Sun Records, My Statement of Life in a Dying World. Joe Simmons would come in as second guitarist and would help to write most songs on the sophomore Good Life release, Martyr. Matt Thomas came in to replace Long and the band gained attention of Revelation Records who quickly signed them.
They released their final record for Good Life, a split with 25 Ta Life, and went back to Europe to tour. Their final release was To Die a Bitter Death on Immigrant Sun. In 2000, Wylie's own label released a compilation of both Immigrant Sun Records 7"s as "The Fallen... The Few That Remain".
The band has since done two reunion shows. The first was in 2000, where they played under the name "The Cleanest War", which featured Damien Moyal back on vocals as well as the original line-up. The second was under the name "Hand of Hope" in 2002, where they had merch made specially for the show in Orlando, Florida. First a compilation of Hand of Hope and Martyr, Hand of the Martyr and an appropriate shirt. The line up for that show was Moyal on vocals, Wylie on guitar, Ervin on bass and Wes Keely on drums.

Lawrence Experiment Station

The Lawrence Experiment Station, now known as the Senator William X. Wall Experiment Station, was the world's first trial station for drinking water purification and sewage treatment. It was established in 1887 in Lawrence, Massachusetts. A new, 22,000 square foot building opened in 1954 at 37 Shattuck Street. In 1975, it was added to the ASCE List of historic civil engineering landmarks. In 1993, the facility was renamed after state senator William X. Wall, who had lobbied for the construction of the new station in the 1950s.
History.
Lawrence Station was established by the Massachusetts State Board of Health, based on the earlier work of scientists William Thompson Sedgwick and Theobald Smith who understood the linkage of water-borne germs to specific diseases. In 1886 the Massachusetts legislature required its Board of Health to adopt water pollution standards, which led to creation of the station under the direction of Hiram Francis Mills, the "Father of American Sanitary Engineering". MIT professors William Ripley Nichols, Ellen Swallow Richards, and Thomas Messinger Drown also played important early roles. Allen Hazen and George W. Fuller were in charge of some of the earliest research on sewage treatment and drinking water filtration.
At first, the station's main mission was to develop practical methods for treating wastewater. Its task as to determine the effect of filtration as compared to natural oxidation, which it decided by experiments in its chemistry laboratory. During this time, Sedgwick and students invented techniques for identifying and quantitatively analyzing the microorganisms in water and sewage. These studies helped set the standards in Massachusetts, other states, and other countries.
A bacteriological laboratory was added two years later. In 1893 when a typhoid epidemic (Salmonella typhi) arose along the Merrimack River, the City of Lawrence began filtration of river water using Mills' slow sand filters, thus becoming the first American city to filter its water for disease prevention. This filtering led to marked reductions in typhoid fever rate and overall death rate in the city.
The facility is now part of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) - Division of Environmental Analysis. It is responsible for providing technical and laboratory support to all DEP programs. In 2011, a $30 million, 13,000 square foot expansion was completed. The new LEED certified addition also houses the state occupational safety laboratory.
