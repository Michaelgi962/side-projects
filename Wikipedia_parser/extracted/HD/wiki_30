Aftershock (Motörhead album)

Aftershock is the 21st studio album by British rock band Motörhead. Originally expected to be released in mid-2013, it was released on 18 October in Germany, 21 October 2013 in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, and on 22 October in North America. The album was produced by Cameron Webb.
Writing and recording.
In an August 2012 interview with "Artisan News Service" during the Rockstar Mayhem Festival, Motörhead drummer Mikkey Dee revealed that the band had written a number of songs already for a follow-up to 2010's "The Wörld Is Yours", but that the band were continuing to write. He then went on to say that the new album would be recorded and released in 2013. In an interview with "Classic Rock Revisited", Lemmy was asked about the possibility of the album consisting of all covers. Lemmy said that it had been discussed and that "it would be fun to do". He further noted that if a covers album would be made, the band's varying musical tastes would ensure a diverse track listing.
In late October 2012, it was announced that the band had made plans to enter the studio in January 2013. In addition, Cameron Webb, who had produced the previous four albums, would again return to produce the new album. The title was revealed on 18 June 2013.
Reception.
The album has received mostly positive reviews. Brandon Ringo of New Noise Magazine gave it a full 5 star rating. He considers the album the best Motörhead have released in 20 years and praises it for its return to basics. Sammy O'Hagar of MetalSucks website comments on the flow of the album, "everything sounds as snarling and nasty as it always has and always will be", he writes.
Hank Shteamer of Pitchfork Media notes that although there was a three year gap between The Wörld Is Yours and "Aftershock", the album is nothing new. Nevertheless, he calls the album "deeply satisfying and frequently thrilling". Shteamer ends the review writing: "In theory, what the band does might seem overfamiliar, but in practice, it's a minor miracle that they're still doing it so well."
USA Today newspaper had "Aftershock" as the album of the week and in particular praised Phil Campbell's work throughout the album. Kevin Fitzpatrick highlights also Phil Campbell and consider's his playing on the album "to contain some of his finest work today". Fitzpatrick also comments the blues influences on the album. Motörhead have "worn Chuck Berry's, Robert Johnson's and Little Richard's influences on their sleeves for the entirety of their 40 year career", but it shines through more on the "Aftershock".
"Aftershock" sold 11,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 22 on The Billboard 200 chart.

All songs are written by Motörhead.

MV Sun Sea incident

MV "Sun Sea" is a cargo ship that brought 492 Sri Lankan Tamils into British Columbia, Canada in August 2010.
The MV "Sun Sea", a Thai cargo ship which had been tracked by multiple countries since June 2010, was intercepted off the coast of British Columbia on 12 August 2010, and boarded by Canadian authorities. Escorted by HMCS "Winnipeg" and HMCS "Whitehorse", it docked at CFB Esquimalt on August 13. 492 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were on board, some with possible links to the Tamil Tigers. The passengers left from Thailand on a three-month voyage. 380 were men, 63 women, and 49 minors. All made refugee claims due to violence in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Civil War.
On August 14/15, the adult migrants were transferred to "accommodation and detention facilities" in the Lower Mainland, while minors were taken to low-risk facilities, with their mothers if they were accompanied. On 10 February 2011, Amnesty International Canada, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Tamil Congress, and the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group criticized "the government's aggressive efforts to keep the passengers of the MV Sun Sea in detention", claiming that
In February 2011, the incident was estimated to have cost the federal government $25 million. Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave Thailand $12 million to battle human smuggling operations in 2012, and the government toughened immigration laws and penalties on human smugglers. Six suspects—two Canadians and four Sri Lankans—were charged in connection with the case.
As of 18 May 2012, the majority of the passengers had been released, with refugee claims in progress. Two were in police custody, three were in Canada Border Services Agency detention, 19 had been given deportation orders for alleged crimes, six had been accepted as refugees, and six had had their claims rejected.

General Union of Negro African Workers

The General Union of Negro African Workers, more widely known by its French name "Union générale des travailleurs d'Afrique noire" ('General Workers Union of Black Africa', abbreviated UGTAN), was a pan-African trade union organization. Ahmed Sékou Touré was the main leader of the organization. In its heyday, around 90% of the trade unions in Francophone West Africa were affiliated to UGTAN.
History.
Foundation.
UGTAN was founded at a conference in Cotonou on January 16, 1957, through the merger of Confédération générale des travailleurs africains (CGTA), the West African branches of the French Confédération générale du travail (CGT) and some independent unions. The conference was held following a call from the railway workers' union to build an independent and united African trade union centre. The Cotonou conference called for the setting up of UGTAN branches across West Africa. Challenging colonialism, UGTAN declared itself as independent from French union centres. 
"Confédération africaine des travailleurs croyants" (CATC) participated in the Cotonou conference, but abstained from voting in the election for a Provisional Executive of UGTAN, stating that they wished to confer with their member organizations on affiliation to UGTAN. In the end CATC remained outside of UGTAN, wishing to remain a non-political union organization. Another group that resisted integration in UGTAN were unions in French Equatorial Africa linked to the pro-Soviet World Federation of Trade Unions. Countering UGTAN, the WTFU-affiliated Cameroonian trade union centre CGTK launched "Confédération générale aéfienne du travail" (CGAT). In Soviet discourse, UGTAN was condemned as a 'petty bourgeois-racist' entity.
Bamako conference and "loi cadre".
At the onset UGTAN committees were dominated by people hailing from the CGT, with Abdoulaye Diallo as general secretary. However, the influence of the CGT leaders was soon outmaneuvered by the former CGTA functionaries under the helm of Sékou Touré. The UGTAN leadership met in Bamako in March 1958. By this time the organization was faced with internal difficulties. The expansion of the organization had been stalled at many points. Nor had a functioning UGTAN administration been set up. Moreover, under the "loi cadre" autonomy had been established in the French West African territories, enabling many UGTAN leaders to assume public offices, creating confusion as to whom represented the government and whom represented the union movement leadership. After the 1957 elections UGTAN leaders became Ministers of Labour or Ministers of Civil Service in seven out of the nine territories of French West Africa. Abdoulaye Diallo (Minister of Labour of French Soudan) was amongst the UGTAN leaders that moved away from union organizing towards party politics.
1958 referendum.
A second meeting in Bamako, held September 10–11, 1958, decided that UGTAN would campaign for a 'No' vote (i.e. for independence) in the referendum on the French Community. Union syndicale des travailleurs de Guinée, the Guinean section of UGTAN, formed one of the pillars in guaranteeing a victory for the 'No' side in Guinea. However many other sectors of UGTAN did not heed the call from the Bamako meeting, rather adopting the 'Yes' line of the political parties that they were aligned with. The Ivorian section outright rejected the 'No' line. The referendum campaign left UGTAN divided. The Senegalese Progressive Union (UPS) managed to divide UGTAN in Senegal, and a new organization (UGTAN-Autonome) was founded under the leadership of Abbas Guèye.
UGTAN participated in the December 1958 All-African People's Conference, and voiced its support to the Ghana-Guinea Union.
UGTAN congress.
UGTAN held its general congress in Conakry January 15–18, 1959. In his report to the congress, Sékou Touré emphasized three points: African independence, the political contributions of the trade union movement and international relations. Delegations from the French CGT, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, AFL-CIO and national trade union confederations of Ghana, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia participated in the event. The congress elected Sékou Touré as president as UGTAN and John Tettegah (from the Ghana Trades Union Congress) as vice president.
Splits in Senegal.
In mid-1959 the Senegalese branch was again divided, as the UGTAN general secretary Alioune Cissé broke away and founded UGTAN-unitaire. The loyalist wing in Senegal, also known as UGTAN-orthodoxe, was led by Seydou Diallo. Likewise there were other splits in the movement. In March 1959 seventeen Nigerien unions broke with UGTAN, and founded UGTAN-Autonome in Niger.
Suppression.
UGTAN came into conflicts with local governments in several of the colonies. In Niger, Dahomey and Upper Volta the authorities sought to suppress the movement. In Niger the UGTAN leader and former Minister of Labour Saloum Traoré was exiled. In Ivory Coast tension between the trade union movement (UGTAN and CATC) and the government of Felix Houphouët-Boigny arose, as the government sought to build a yellow union in the public sector. The conflict escalated in the second half of 1959, as the leader of the Ivorian UGTAN branch Yao N'go Blaise was exiled to Guinea. UGTAN called for strikes (which never materialized), while the government declared martial law. Many union leaders were arrested and many public employees were fired from their jobs. In Senegal the UGTAN branch (i.e. the 'orthodox' UGTAN) was banned by the government on November 22, 1960. Several key UGTAN leaders were imprisoned. The remnants of the orthodox UGTAN would later form the Union sénégalaise des travailleurs in 1962.

North American Soccer League (1968–84) on television

North American Soccer League (NASL) was a professional soccer league with teams in the United States and Canada that operated from 1968 to 1984. Beginning in 1975, the league final was called the Soccer Bowl.
CBS (1967-1976).
National Professional Soccer League (1967).
In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association, which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the US and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network (which signed a two-year contract to broadcast a game every Sunday afternoon live and in color). The NPSL kicked off on Sunday, April 16 with a full slate of five matches. However, the ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement was terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NASL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.
Play-by-play voice Jack Whitaker was joined by the former Northern Ireland international Danny Blanchflower as a pundit. Blanchflower was not impressed with the standard of play and did not hesitate to say so. The NPSL was also criticised after Pittsburgh's 2-1 triumph over Toronto in the Falcons' home opener on Sunday, May 14. Of the twenty-one fouls that afternoon, eleven were called to allow CBS to insert commercials into its telecast. Referee Peter Rhodes also admitted that he had forced players to fake injuries to serve the same purpose. This raised many questions about whether the television networks and its sponsors were having too much influence over televised sporting events.
The leagues merged in 1968 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). It has been suggested that the timing of the merge was related to the huge amount of attention given throughout the English-speaking world to the victory by England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, "Goal". The league lasted until the 1984 NASL season. While the USSF and FIFA refused to recognize the NPSL, the television contract with CBS guaranteed some element of financial stability.
Controversy.
Toronto Croatia played in the National Soccer League until 1975 when they purchased the Toronto Metros of the North American Soccer League to form Toronto Metros-Croatia. During this period the team attracted many soccer stars, such as Portuguese superstar Eusébio, and were successful enough that they won Soccer Bowl '76 – a 3–0 win over the Minnesota Kicks – at the Kingdome in Seattle. The championship team was coached by Marijan Bilić, an immigrant to Canada who had played for Dinamo Zagreb. The champions' team was: Paolo Cimpiel, Ted Polak, Željko Bilecki, Ivan Lukačević, Robert Iarusci, Eusébio, Mladen Cukon, Carmen Marcantonio, Ivair Ferreira, Wolfgang Suhnholz, Damir Sutevski, Ivan Grnja, Filip Blašković i Chris Horrocks.
However, the NASL was never comfortable with the Croatia link (an obvious ethnic connection). League executives lobbied CBS to ensure they were only referred to as Toronto at the Soccer Bowl on television.
The Pelé effect.
It was during the 1975 season that the New York Cosmos acquired the Brazilian star Pelé, whom they had been attempting to sign since the team was created. Ross had apparently not heard of him before getting involved in soccer, but agreed to finance the transfer when Toye compared the Brazilian's popularity to that of the Pope. Pelé joined the Cosmos on June 10, 1975 on a salary of $1.4 million per year, an enormous wage for an athlete at that time. A number of contracts—only one of which mentioned soccer—were set up for Pelé to ensure that he paid the lowest amount of tax possible, including one as a "recording artist" with Warner subsidiary Atlantic Records. "We owned him lock, stock and barrel," Toye retrospectively boasted.
Pelé's arrival created a media sensation and overnight transformed the fortunes of soccer in the USA. The Pelé deal was later described by Gavin Newsham, an English writer, as "the transfer coup of the century". His arrival turned the Cosmos from a motley crew of foreigners, semi-professionals and students into a huge commercial presence. The club's groundsman, on hearing that the Brazilian's début for New York was to be broadcast on CBS, spray-painted the pitch green to disguise how little grass was on it: the match, against the Dallas Tornado, was broadcast to 22 countries and covered by more than 300 journalists from all over the world. From the moment he signed his contract at the 21 Club on 10 June 1975 in front of ecstatic Steve Ross and a crush of worldwide media, the player's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to the sport in America. As previously mentioned, his debut NASL match five days later versus Dallas Tornado at the dilapidated Downing Stadium on Randall's Island was broadcast live on CBS network -- the first regular-season NASL match on US network TV in six years. 
It was the Cosmos' tenth match of the season and led by the Brazilian, who recorded an assist and a goal; New York came back from two goals down for the 2–2 final score. The contest was also Pelé's first competitive match in eight months since his last outing with Santos FC in October 1974. He would eventually end up with five goals in his debut season during which his biggest challenge became figuring out how to fit into this team of journeymen players with abilities far inferior to his. Still his biggest impact was on the sport in New York and the rest of America as Cosmos' home attendance got tripled in just half the season he was there. They also played in front of huge crowds on the road since everyone wanted to see Pelé - towards the end of the season when he pulled a hamstring and couldn't suit up, 20,000 fans in Philadelphia showed up just to see him in street clothes. Furthermore, the league's profile got raised as other NASL teams - encouraged by Ross' investment in Pelé and the prominence his arrival brought to the Cosmos franchise - started bringing over more big-name aging foreign stars such as George Best who was about to turn 30, 31-year-old Rodney Marsh, 34-year-old Geoff Hurst, and 35-year-old Bobby Moore.
TVS Television Network (1977-1978).
Soccer Bowl '78 was broadcast live in the United States on the TVS network. Jon Miller handled play-by-play duties, while Paul Gardner was the color analyst. This would be the final NASL game broadcast by the network, as the league signed a deal with ABC Sports in the fall of 1978. Gardner would continue as the color analyst for ABC's coverage, while Miller would move on to a long career announcing Major League Baseball.
ABC (1979-1981).
In 1979, ABC Sports began covering the NASL in a deal that called for 9 telecasts of league games, including the playoffs and Soccer Bowl. In 1979, the team from the "Village of Vancouver", the Whitecaps (a reference to ABC TV sportscaster Jim McKay's observation that "Vancouver must be like the deserted village right now", with so many people watching the game on TV) beat the powerhouse New York Cosmos in one of the most thrilling playoff series in NASL history to advance to the Soccer Bowl. In the Soccer Bowl, they triumphed against the Tampa Bay Rowdies in a disappointed New York City.
Decline.
On 1 October 1977, Pelé closed out his legendary career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. Santos arrived in New York and New Jersey after previously defeating the Seattle Sounders 2–0. The match was played in front of a capacity crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the United States on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" as well as throughout the world. After the retirement of Pelé in 1977, much of the progress that American soccer had made during his stay was lost; there was no star at the same level to replace him as the NASL's headline act. After enduring briefly during the late 1970s, attendances dropped after 1980. The sport's popularity fell and the media lost interest. The deal with broadcaster ABC to broadcast NASL matches was also lost in 1980, and the 1981 Soccer Bowl was only shown on tape delay. All of the franchises quickly became unprofitable, and a salary cap enforced before the 1984 season only delayed the inevitable. The league folded at the end of 1984, following the loss of most of its franchises.
ESPN and USA Network (1981–1984).
In the last few years of its existence, the NASL did manage to get some games on a new cable sports network that had begun in 1979 called ESPN. In 1981, they signed a contract to broadcast 20 games on Saturdays. The new USA Network also carried games, usually on Wednesday nights.
Major Indoor Soccer League.
The 1982-83 Major Indoor Soccer League season was the fifth in league history and would end with the San Diego Sockers winning their first MISL title. It would be the Sockers' second straight indoor championship, as the club had won the North American Soccer League's indoor league the previous spring.
The league would enter into an agreement with the NASL in the summer of 1982 to begin plans for an eventual merger. Initial plans to have all 14 NASL teams play in the winter would not come to pass, as most teams preferred to concentrate on the outdoor season. However, the Chicago Sting and Golden Bay Earthquakes would join the Sockers for the MISL season.
The MISL continued to make inroads on national television. While the spring would see the end of the league's two-year deal with the USA Network, CBS would broadcast a playoff game live from Cleveland on May 7 that drew an estimated four million viewers.
With the NASL near death in the summer of 1984, a handful of teams made plans to switch from outdoor to indoor soccer once the NASL season ended in October. Along with the Sockers, the Chicago Sting, Minnesota Strikers and New York Cosmos formally made the leap in late August. With the addition of the Dallas Sidekicks, the league went back to a 14-team, two-division setup.
This would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television, CBS broadcast Game 4 of the championship series live on May 25.

The Leopard in Autumn

The Leopard in Autumn was a BBC comedy-drama radio series by Neil Anthony set in the fictional principality of Monte Guano in Renaissance Italy. Its title was a reference to the 1966 play by James Goldman "The Lion in Winter". It was run for 12 episodes between April 2001 and June 2002 on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011 and 2012.
Synopsis.
"The Leopard in Autumn" follows the lives of the ruling family and court of Monte Guano, a small and impoverished Italian principality. Prince Ludovico II ("the Magnificent") is the impious king of Monte Guano, but repeatedly finds his political ambitions thwarted, both by the financial demands imposed by the Pope on Monte Guano and by his family. Princess Plethora is a much more intelligent and thoughtful character who is behind many successful ploys to improve Monte Guano's financial clout. She is good friends with Countess Rosalie, Ludovico's "official mistress" who arrived in Monte Guano with the intention of marrying the eldest son of the Prince. Salvatore, the eldest son, wants to go into the church (to become pope) and thus could not marry. Unfortunately for him, his career cannot start because his family do not have enough money to pay to have him ordained priest. His (excessive) private devotion to Catholicism brings him into friction with the youngest brother Guido, a Protestant, and devotee of Martin Luther's works. The middle brother, Allesandro, to the disappointment of his father wishes to be an artist and inventor, and thus requires financial support (and a degree of tolerance) from his father.
Other characters include Francesco, frustrated poet, chronicler and secretary to Ludivico. His constant inebriation and frustrated poetic ambitions are the subject of several jokes.
Throughout the series, Ludivico's speech is characterised by his use of the word "Sneck" as a form of swearing.
Both series are set in the period 1520-1523.
Cast.
"The Leopard in Autumn" starred David Swift as Prince Ludovico, ruler of Monte Guano; Siân Phillips as his wife Princess Plethora; Graham Crowden as Francesco (Ludovico's secretary); Saskia Wickham as Countess Rosalie (Ludovico's mistress) and as Ludovico's perpetually squabbling sons: Nick Romero as the religious Salvatore, Paul Bigley as Allesandro (artist and inventor) and Christopher Kellen as Guido (a staunch Lutheran).

2012 Mangalore homestay attack

On July 28, 2012, activists belonging to the Hindu Jagarana Vedike, a right-wing group affiliated with the Sangh Parivar, allegedly attacked a birthday party at an unlicensed homestay in Mangalore, Karnataka.
The 12 people at the party, including 5 girls, were allegedly beaten, stripped and molested. The faces of some girls were blackened. The activists claimed the youngsters were consuming alcohol and were involved in "some indecent activities".
Hundreds of locals, including women, staged protests complaining police had not taken steps to check "illegal activities" in the home-stay despite complaining on several occasions. Hindu Jagaran Vedike President Jagadish Karanth demanded an check on such "obscene activities".
Parts of the attack were captured on camera by a reporter at the scene, and were shown on various news channels.
Twenty two activists were arrested in the following days.
Government Response.
Karnataka Home Minister R. Ashok condemned the attack and said police would take strict action and would not tolerate such incidents.
Police.
The government sent a senior police officer, Bipin Gopalakrishnan to visit the spot and investigate. Based on his extensive investigation, Gopalakrishnan made it clear that the boys and girls were colleagues. He also said that there was no use of drugs or any other illegal material at the party and the group of youngsters wanted to leave the home stay by 7:30 pm.
Karnataka State Women's Commission.
The Women’s Commission, which is not an investigating agency, contradicted the police findings. It's chairman, C. Manjula, continued to insist that it was a rave party, despite police confirming no drugs were involved. She asked the home ministry to investigate the victims, and claimed they were involved in human trafficking.
Manjula also blamed “pseudo-feminists” for allegedly not raising their voice over other instances of atrocities against women.
She claimed that people at the homestay were consuming drugs, and blamed the "irresponsible" district administration "for such behaviour of youths". The chairperson also demanded unlicensed homestays in Mangalore be shut down and asked home ministry to "initiate an inquiry into the antecedents of the two boys" who were victimized.
Commission Report.
The Commission submitted a report to the Home Ministry on July 29.
The report recommends investigation into whether the 'boys who organised the birthday party had misled the girls'. In direct contradiction to the police investigation, chairman Manjula claimed that people at the homestay were consuming drugs, and blamed the "irresponsible" district administration "for such behaviour of youths".
The Commission also recommended the use of a separate cell for missing trafficked women.
It also demands that the father of one of the girls at the party, who is a police official, should be transferred out of the district.
Legality of Homestay.
Loretta Rebello is the proprietor of the homestay ‘Morning Mist’. One of the victims claimed that they paid a sum of Rs 10,000 for five hours (2.30 pm to 7.30 pm) to party in the ‘Morning Mist,’ a bungalow with many bedrooms.
Mangalore City Corporation Officer Manjunath Shetty said Loretta Rebello did not possess any commercial licence to run the homestay. Deccan Herald reports Rebello started renting it out on hourly basis about two years ago.
Public Reaction.
Prohibitory order were immediately slapped on the city. Colleges in the city stayed closed for a day in protest.
Seminar of C Manjula.
A seminar titled ‘The Role of Alcohol and Drugs in the Mangalore Attack’ was conducted under the auspices of C. Manjula, the chairperson of the Women's Commission.
Kannada thinker M Chidananda Murthy, senior advocate Pramila Nesargi, Women’s Commission head C Manjula and KSTB chairperson Sacchinanda Hegde said the victims were under the influence of alcohol.
They claimed alcohol was the main reason for attack at the Morning Mist Homestay in Mangalore. Sacchinanda Hegde insisted that the 5 girls and 2 boys were part of a rave party. He further claimed media portrayed it as a birthday bash as a daughter of a police official was present at the party and claimed officials had found beer bottles at the homestay.

Forced evictions in Baku

Since 2008, the government of Azerbaijan has been implementing a program of forced evictions in the capital city of Baku, confiscating and subsequently demolishing privately owned properties to make room for the development of modernized infrastructure. The evictions were first ordered by the city's municipal government as part of a massive reconstruction effort aimed at increasing the appeal of the downtown metropolis. From 2011 onward, the number of housing complexes being forcibly vacated has increased substantially.
Numerous development projects have begun in the aftermath of the housing demolitions, including new parking lots, several boutique stores, boulevards, skyscrapers, a shopping center, luxury housing, and a Formula One race track. There are also plans to build a 1,050 m (3,444 ft) housing complex, which would make it the world's tallest man-made structure upon completion.
Baku city officials have stated that the compensation being offered to residents is fair, while human rights groups argue that residents have been pressured to leave without adequate compensation to buy similar dwellings elsewhere. Independent observers estimate that several thousand Azeris have been displaced as a result of the forced evictions.
Background.
Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union following its dissolution in 1991. Despite severe infrastructural damage resulting from the Nagorno-Karabakh War and the post-Soviet transition phase, the country has managed to develop a robust and stable economy through revenues from petroleum exports. The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (abbreviated as "SOCAR") is the 68th largest organization in the world, valued at roughly $20 billion USD. Azerbaijan ranks 7th in the world on an aggregate list of countries by proven natural gas reserves, as well as 19th on a similarly compiled list of nations by proven petroleum reserves. In recent times, Azerbaijan has made efforts to focus on greater cultural and economic integration with the West, notably through hosting the 57th annual Eurovision contest in 2012.
Demolitions.
According to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, authorities used various methods to expel people from their homes, including arbitrary arrests and detentions, deprivation of basic necessities for occupants in targeted households, intimidation, and beginning the demolition process prior to the evacuation of inhabitants. The report stated that authorities sometimes acted without any prior notice.
Construction of new public facilities and attractions generally commenced shortly after demolition, with a new 25,000 square metre park nearing completion as of 1 August 2012. The government offered to compensate the former residents of expropriated properties. HRW criticized the reimbursements as being inadequate for purchasing any new property in Baku. Those who refused compensation were evicted and often became homeless. 
In the run-up to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, authorities evicted more residents to make room for the Baku Crystal Hall arena, where the event would subsequently be held. Zohrab Ismayil, who authored a report on forced evictions in Baku, said that 281 families were evicted to make room for construction, and that the government paid them compensation below the market rate on several occasions. The government stated that the evictions had no relevance to the contest, but were part of a larger seven-year reconstruction plan aimed at developing the downtown area of the city.
Reactions.
The evictions were condemned by several international human rights organizations, including Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International. As part of a resolution passed by the European Parliament on 24 May 2012, which condemned Azerbaijan's human rights abuses, the elected body also expressed alarm over the mass expulsion of civilians from their households for future development projects, including the Crystal Palace. The evictions became a point of contention in Azerbaijan's successful bid to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest.
On two occasions, authorities were accused of retaliating against activists and journalists who publicized the evictions. On 11 August 2011, the office of Azerbaijani human rights activist Leyla Yunus was bulldozed without warning, giving the occupants no time to salvage furniture or other personal belongings. All documents inside the building at the time of its demolition were destroyed. An Azeri MP denied that the demolition was connected with Yunus's activism. The European Union delegation to Baku stated that it "deplored" the destruction of her organization's office, describing her as "a regular partner of the international community". The demolition came hours after "The New York Times" published an article detailing Yunus's advocacy against the forced evictions. Later, on 18 April 2012, several Azeri journalists were severely beaten by SOCAR security forces, allegedly for covering the demolitions while they were in process. This includes Idrak Abbasov, who was subsequently hospitalized in critical condition.

Leno weave

Leno weave (also called Gauze Weave or Cross Weave) is a weave in which two warp yarns are twisted around the weft yarns to provide a strong yet sheer fabric. The standard warp yarn is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these twisted warp yarns grip tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. Leno weave produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads.
Uses.
Leno weave fabric allows light and air to pass through freely so are used in any area where a sheer, open weave fabric is required that will not bruise (where the threads shift away from their woven uniformity disturbing the beauty of the weave). If a simple in-and-out flat weave were woven very loosely to achieve the same effect the threads would have a tendency to this bruising. Leno weaves are often used for window treatments and for sheer layers for fine clothing. When made with glass fibre or other strong yarns or when permeated with a strengthening compound it can be used as an engineering material in construction, though due to the openness of the fabric if a solid covering is required it is often used in conjunction with other weave styles.
Leno weave production.
To produce a leno weave the loom is threaded with the warp yarn and a doup yarn together. The doup yarn can be of similar or lesser weight and strength. The weft is woven in and for each weft shuttle the warp yarns are twisted intechangeably to produce a figure of eight pattern.
Karamiori.
Karamiori or Japanese Leno Weave includes all loom techniques that make use of intertwining threads to create the structure of the weave. Karamiori is an old and highly respected textile production method. The Japanese divide karaori into three basic styles based on structure: sha (紗), ro (絽), and ra (羅). Sha is the basic leno weave, Ro adds additional areas of flat or twill weaves and Ra maintains the concept of twisted threads but allows both warp and weft to be freed and recombined to form highly intricate weaves.

<doc id="36630453" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36630453" title="N=8 Supergravity">
N=8 Supergravity

N=8 Supergravity is the most symmetric quantum field theory which involves gravity and a finite number of fields. It can be found from a dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity by making the size of 7 of the dimensions go to zero. It has 8 supersymmetries which is the most any gravitational theory can have since there are 8 half-steps between spin 2 and spin -2. (The spin 2 graviton is the particle with the highest spin in this theory). More supersymmetries would mean the particles would have superpartners with spins higher than 2. The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as String Theory). Stephen Hawking in his Brief History of Time speculated that this theory could be the Theory of Everything. However in later years this was abandoned in favour of String Theory. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century with the possibility that this theory may be finite.
Calculations.
It has been found recently that the expansion of N=8 Supergravity in terms of Feynman diagrams has shown that N=8 Supergravity is in some ways a product of two "N" = 4 super Yang–Mills theories. This is written schematically as:
N = 8 Supergravity = (N = 4 Super Yang–Mills) × (N = 4 Super Yang–Mills)
This is not so surprising as N=8 supergravity contains 6 independent representations of N=4 Super Yang–Mills.
Particle content.
The theory contains 1 graviton (spin 2), 8 gravitinos (spin 3/2), 28 vector bosons (spin 1), 56 fermions (spin 1/2), 70 scalar fields (spin 0) where we don't distinguish particles with negative spin. These numbers are simple combinatorial numbers that come from Pascal's Triangle.
One reason why the theory was abandoned was that the 28 vector bosons which form an O(8) gauge group is too small to contain the standard model U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) gauge group which can only fit within O(10).
For model building it has been assumed that almost all the supersymmetries would be broken in nature leaving just 1 supersymmetry (N=1) although nowadays because of the lack of evidence for N=1 supersymmetry higher supersymmetries are now being considered such as N=2.
Connection with superstring theory.
N=8 Supergravity can be viewed as the low energy approximation of 11D M-Theory with 7 of its dimensions on a certain compact surface.
Extensions.
When derived from Heterotic Superstring Theory compactified on higher-dimensional tori, there are two extensions to N=8 Supergravity. They are the coupling of additional fields which form E8xE8 N=4 Super-Yang Mills and SO(32) N=4 Super Yang–Mills. When adding those fields the number of particles increases to 256 + 496x16 = 8192 = 213 particles.
Global symmetries.
Some surprising global symmetries have been found in this theory. For example it has been shown that there is an E₇ global symmetry but in order for the theory to be finite it is thought that there may be other symmetries not yet found.

Daddy At Home

Daddy At Home (企鹅爸爸) is a Singaporean television series which debuted on the local Chinese language channel Channel 8 on 2 November 2009. It was screened every night at 9pm from Monday to Friday.
The series' Chinese title literally means "penguin father". As the series is about house husbands, the title was derived from the fact that Emperor penguins is the only penguin species of which the male is fully responsible for incubating the eggs.
Synopsis.
Liu Bang (Li Nanxing) is a senior vice-president of a bank and takes great pride of his social standing. His friend Ye Zhengkang (Chen Hanwei) is a house husband who looks after the household and children while his wife Meihui (Cynthia Koh) owns a beauty parlour. Liu Bang, being a traditionalist, disapproves of this arrangement but Zhengkang is undaunted by the unwanted attention he occasionally receives due to his unusual "occupation". 
However, the financial crisis hits Singapore and both Liu Bang and Zhengkang find themselves cash-strapped. Liu Bang in particular was the worst affected. As he had offended a superior years ago, he quickly became a target in the mass entrenchment. His wife Xinbei (Ann Kok) is forced to find a job to support the family. Liu Bang has to swallow his ego as he is suddenly forced to take over homemaker duties from his wife. 
Meanwhile, Meihui's younger brother Jinfeng (Adam Chen) moves in with the family. The carefree happy-go-lucky Jinfeng falls head over heels for his nephew's tuition teacher Ruxuan (Dawn Yeoh) and tries his best to woo her.
Awards.
"Daddy At Home" earned several nominations at the 2010 Star Awards.

G&amp;SWR 141 Class

The Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR) 141 class is a class of ten 0-4-2 steam locomotives designed in 1866. They were by Patrick Stirling’s sixth 0-4-2 design for the railway.
Development.
The ten examples of this class were designed by Patrick Stirling for the GSWR and were built by Neilson and Company (Works Nos. 1226-35) in 1866. They were numbered 141-50.
The members of the class were fitted with domeless boilers and safety valves over the firebox, these were later replaced by those of Ramsbottom design over the centre of the boiler following a boiler explosion at Springhill in 1876. The original weather boards were also replaced by Stirling cabs.
Four of the class were rebuilt as 0-4-2 tank locomotives between 1880-1886.
Withdrawal.
The bulk of the class, including all the rebuilds were withdrawn between 1900 and 1913. However, two examples survived into London Midland and Scottish Railway ownership and were withdrawn in 1923 and 1924 respectively.

Triplaris americana

Triplaris americana is a species of flowering plant in the knotweed family known by many common names, including ant tree or pau-formiga ("ant tree"), guacamayo, guayabo zancón, hormiguero, palo de Santa María, tachí, vara santa, pau-de-novato, formigueiro, and taxizeiro. It is native to Central and South America, occurring from Panama to Brazil. It is also cultivated as an ornamental for its showy pink flowers.
This species is a tree growing up to 30 meters in height with a trunk diameter reaching 30 centimeters. The smooth bark is a mottled gray color. There are ochrea up to 12 centimeters in length. The leaves are oval to oblong and measure up to 40 centimeters long by 20 wide. The undersides are sometimes woolly with brown fibers. The tree is dioecious. The male flowers are around 2 millimeters long, while the female flowers are up to 5 centimeters long. The sex ratio of the species is skewed, with many more female plants than male.
This tree grows in riparian habitat types. It is a colonizer of disturbed habitat. It has been introduced to areas outside its native range, including Hawaii and southern Africa.
This species is a myrmecophyte, forming a mutualistic relationship with ants. Ants living on the plant include "Pseudomyrmex triplarinus". This species lives within the tree, feeding on substances produced by it, and defending it against invaders. This tree is known as a "novice tree" ("pau-de-novato") because only one unfamiliar with the tree would touch it, soon discovering that the ants are aggressive and venomous.
This tree is considered a noxious weed in southern Africa. The fruits are dispersed on the wind and the seedlings easily take hold and become invasive, growing in the local habitat and displacing native plants.

HM Prison Shotts

HMP Shotts is a prison near Shotts, Scotland. It is a prison holding male prisoners with maximum security classification. Shotts exclusively holds prisoners serving a term of 4 years or longer, with some prisoners being transferred from other prisons due to a need for a more secure environment. The prison was opened in 1978 with a design capacity of 528 inmates; Upon its last inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons in February 2007, Shotts held a total of 512 prisoners.
National facilities.
Shotts is the location for two national facilities, which provide specialist environments for a range of offenders around Scotland, including those outside the standard "catchment area" for the prison.
National Induction Centre.
The National Induction Centre (NIC) is a national facility providing for prisoners at the start of sentences of at least 8 to 10 years. The function of the centre is to provide an environment which can prepare the inmates for eventual moves to mainstream prisons. The NIC excludes prisoners serving sentences for sex offences. The centre was created to provide for prisoners in the first 3 to 6 months of their sentence, but some stay for up to 2 years with the average stay being approximately 1 year. In February 2007 the centre held 116 inmates.
Kerr House.
Kerr House is a 'top-end facility' located at HMP Shotts. It became the national top-end facility for Scotland in March 2007. It provides accommodation for low-supervision prisoners nearing the end of medium to long sentences (at least 4 year), most of whom have progressed from the mainstream facility at Shotts. The facility provides room for up to 59 inmates and in February 2007 held 46.
Accommodation.
HMP Shotts contains 6 accommodation units, including a Segregation Unit and the two National Facilities. 'B' and 'C' halls are the mainstream halls holding prisoners from the National Induction Centre or other nearby prisons. 'D' hall is a non-sex offender protection unit which houses inmates who have asked to be removed from mainstream circulation for their own protection. The NIC, 'B', 'C' and 'D' halls are almost identical in design, providing accommodation for approximately 120 prisoners. The Segregation Unit houses up to 12 inmates, from Shotts and other prisons around Scotland, who have been removed from general prison populations. 
During the most recent inspection in February 2007, the units held the following number of prisoners:

John Berry (speedway promoter)

William John Berry (16 October 1944 – 3 August 2012), better known as John Berry, was a speedway promoter, team manager, and writer who revived the Ipswich Witches in 1969 and managed the England team.
Biography.
Berry was born in Westminster Hospital in 1944 and grew up in Edmonton. He was educated at the Edmonton County Grammar School before studying for a degree in Food Technology. His first business venture was a fish and chip shop in London's East End.
Along with his school friend turned business partner Joe Thurley, Berry brought speedway back to Ipswich in 1969 by building a new track at Foxhall Stadium inside the old one which had been covered in tarmac for stock car racing. Their application for a licence to compete in the second division of the British League was initially turned down by fellow promoters as they were considered to lack sufficient experience, but later accepted, and Ipswich joined the top division in 1972, taking the place of West Ham Hammers. Recruiting a team of riders largely from the Ipswich area, the Witches were one of the most successful teams of the 1970s and early 1980s, winning the British League in 1975, 1976, and 1984, and finishing as runners-up in 1981 and 1983. 
Berry went on to manage the England team, taking over from Reg Fearman in 1975 and continuing until 1977, and returning to the role in 1978 and 1979. He managed the England team again in 1982 and 1985, and managed a National League representative team in a series against Poland in 1987. In the mid-1980s he was considered for a position in overall charge of British speedway, but did not get the full support of fellow promoters. He was instrumental in introducing Billy Sanders to British speedway in 1972, and after Sanders' death in 1985, Berry retired from his position as Ipswich promoter. He returned to speedway first as a consultant and then promoter for the Wimbledon Dons in the 1987 season. He emigrated to Australia in 1989. He wrote two books about his time in British speedway, "Confessions of a Speedway Promoter" and "More Confessions". He was also a columnist for the speedway magazine "Backtrack".
Berry died on 3 August 2012 at his home in Perth, Australia, aged 67.

1st Proletarian Brigade

The 1st Proletarian Brigade was the first regular formation raised by the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II.
At the time of formation, the Brigade numbered 1.186 soldiers, NCOs and officers, 71 of which were women. The brigade then fought in many battles against the Italians, Germans and their Chetnik auxiliaries, as well as the forces of the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia from its creation until the end of the war. It fought in six of the Seven Enemy Offensives described in Yugoslav historiography. During 41 months of battle engagement, in the Brigade fought 13.443 men and 651 women, and 4.818 of them died in battle.
The Brigade was one of the elite formations of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia. Its combat value was respected by the enemy. Artur Phleps, V SS Mountain Corps Commander, in his war journal in 1944 assessed 1st Proletarian Division as a serious opponent, very well managed and well trained, who fights like a regular troop.
Chronicle.
It was formed by Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on 22 December 1941 (Stalin's birthday) in the village of Rudo in eastern Bosnia. Initially comprising 1,200 of the best Serb and Montenegrin Partisans under the command of the Spanish Civil War veteran Koča Popović, it began to take on a more multi-ethnic character from March 1942 when 15 Bosnian Muslims from Sarajevo joined the brigade. The formation of the brigade represented a significant change for the Partisans, as it gave the Partisan Supreme Command a politically reliable and mobile force that was not tied to a particular geographic area. This innovation allowed the Partisans to more easily concentrate fighting power at a particular point to achieve a decision, and permitted withdrawal when faced by a superior enemy force. The brigade fought its first battle on the day following its creation, when it encountered Italian troops and Chetniks as it marched out of Rudo. 
During Operation Southeast Croatia the brigade crossed Mt Igman in freezing temperatures. After Operation Trio, it participated in the Partisan Long March from Zelengora in eastern Bosnia to XXX. The withdrawal of the brigade from eastern Bosnia to Foča caused a number of problems, including recriminations between Tito and Svetozar Vukmanović.
From formation until June 1942 this was as an independent brigade, after which the brigade formed part of the Shock Group of Proletarian Brigades. In June 1942, Tito ordered the appointment of priests and hodjas to the battalions of the brigade, to cater to the religious needs of the troops and population. This was a recognition that respecting religious beliefs was important in the context of the Liberation Front. From November 1942 the brigade became part of the 1st Proletarian Division.
Battles.
For the most part of its war time, the Brigade relayed mostly on manoeuvrability and initiative. In frequent marches it covered some 20.000 km. The change in tactics occurred after Belgrade Offensive, when it was engaged in frontal battles on Sremski front.

New Republic (Romania)

The New Republic () is a political party of Romania. It was established in October 2011, as a grassroots movement inspired by the launching of a manifesto on different blogs and center-right platforms. The movement spread around and it led to the birth of more than 40 branches around the country. The President is Mihail Neamțu, a intellectual who joined the politics. The Prime Vicepresident of the New Republic is Valeriu Todirascu, an economist and businessman, who became a senator.
History.
In July 2012, the party's first National Convention elected Mihail Neamțu as party president. Neamțu is a public intellectual with a PhD degree in theology from King's College London. Soon after its foundation, the party joined the Right Romania Alliance (ARD), together with the former governing party, Democratic Liberal Party (PDL); Civic Force, the party of former Prime Minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu; and the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNTCD). The party filled 9 candidates on the ARD list at 2012 legislative election, but because of administrative problems, New Republic's candidates ran as independents or under PNTCD's logo instead. The party's First Vice-President, Valeriu Todirascu, was elected to the Senate.
Ideology.
The New Republic was born as a civic movement protesting against a corrupt and untrustworthy establishment. It called for seizing the opportunities of growth and development, which former Communist and populist politicians have squandered. The New Republic movement supported the middle-class citizens, while critiquing local Sultanism and Statism.
The New Republic party called for a radical departure from old-style politics, as shaped by former nomenklatura. The New Republic called for the revival of civil society, in an attempt to surpass the cynicism and mistrust of older generations. Among its principles, one counts the support for natural rights, private property, free market, entrepreneurship, limited government, and for the Judeo-Christian values.

HeartBeat Love

Heartbeat Love (再一次心跳) is a 2012 Taiwanese short film starring Rainie Yang and Show Luo. It was filmed in Australia (Sydney, Melbourne and Tasmania). It is a miniseries that aired on the internet, and has a total of 5 episodes. It started 12 April 2012, and aired every Thursday midnight Taiwan time (i.e. early Thursday morning). This was the second time these two stars collaborated after the successful Taiwanese drama "Hi My Sweetheart".
Australia's Tourism commission invested in the film to introduce Australia to Chinese tourism.
Synopsis.
Heartbeat Love is a miniseries that chronicles the love story between two travelers named Lee Wei Chen and Yang Xiao Yu (played by Show Luo and Rainie Yang respectively) who, due to a gender misunderstanding on Xiao Yu's part, share a hotel room in Australia. Xiao Yu initially mistakes Lee as being gay, and therefore agrees to share a room and sleep on the same bed as him. (This misunderstanding happened because Lee accidentally exchanged his bag with a gay named GayGay.) The night when they share the room Lee manages to get Gaygay's phone number and arranges to meet up the next day and switch back the suitcases.
The next day, they go out together and accidentally fall in love with each other after pretending to be a married couple. After the day ended, they both went back to the hotel. In the hotel, Gaygay was waiting in the lobby for them and they exchanged their bag. Xiao Yu is very angry about Lee's deception. She slaps him and runs away.
Day after that, they both went to Melbourne deciding they will not share the same room anymore so they both went to different directions. That day, they coincidentally meet up several times, much to Xiao Yu's anger and Lee's chagrin. They end up meeting again in a food store, where Xiao Yu is forced to beg for Lee's help in escaping a guy who comes in, though she refuses to tell Lee who the man is. They continue their day and Xiao Yu finally forgives Lee. They end up kissing and sleeping together.
They continue to vacation, until the man Xiao Yu had run from shows up while she is trying on wedding dresses. Lee helps her escape again, but demands the truth from her. She tells him that her life is similar to "Roman Holiday," a film in which a runaway bride seizes her last few days of independence. Lee asks her if she ever had any feelings for him, and she says no. Heartbroken, he returns to Taiwan. 
After a year, Show meets up with the man Xiao Yu had run from. Lee asks about their marriage, and the man informs him that he is Xiao Yu's brother. He hands Lee a video explaining that Xiao Yu hadn't been engaged—she'd undergone a very risky heart surgery and hadn't wanted to hurt him by telling him the truth. Lee goes to the island to find her—following the trail of pictures that she left him—and they meet up in Tasmania happily.

Montana Highway 35

Montana Highway 35 is an approximately state highway in the west of the US state of Montana. It begins at U.S. Route 93 in Polson in the Flathead Indian Reservation and ends at U.S. Route 2 in Evergreen, the eastern portion of the city of Kalispell. As well as serving the townships along the eastern shore of Flathead Lake, it also acts like an alternative route of U.S. Route 93 between Polson and Kalispell and is the terminus for both Highways 82 and 83.
Route description.
Highway 35 begins within the Flathead Indian Reservation, in the eastern outskirts of Polson, at an intersection with U.S. Route 93. Initially, the highway heads east in a straight line. After a few miles, the road takes an abrupt turn northwards as it meets the foothills of the Mission Mountains. Passing Flathead Lake's East Bay, it then forms the eastern boundary of the community of Finley Point. Meeting Skidoo Bay of the lake, Highway 35 is then squeezed between the shoreline on its left and the mountain range on its right and is forced by the topography to wind its way northwards between the two. After leaving the Flathead Indian Reservation, the road passes through the community of Woods Bay before crossing from Lake to Flathead County. Very soon afterwards, the highway enters Bigfork and crosses the Swan River, one of Flathead Lake's tributaries. On the northern outskirts of Bigfork, Highway 35 meets the ends of Highways 83 and 82 in quick succession, before continuing northwards amidst farmland. After zigzagging to the northwest, Highway 35 joins with Secondary Highway 206, which allows motorists to shortcut to the communities further upstream along the Flathead River. Highway 35 heads west from this junction and crosses the Flathead River into Evergreen, and terminates at U.S. Route 2 soon afterwards: traffic travelling straight-ahead from this point moves onto U.S. 2 westbound towards Kalispell.

ʻEua Noble by-election, 2012

A by-election was held for the ʻEua Noble seat to the Legislative Assembly of Tonga on 2 August 2012. It was triggered by the dismissal from Parliament of the incumbent, the Speaker Lord Lasike, following his conviction for illegal possession of ammunition in July.
The Tongan nobility elect nine representatives to Parliament. Technically, ʻEua is not a distinct constituency. Seventeen nobles jointly elect the three representatives of Tongatapu and the single representative of ʻEua, from within the same pool of nobles.
Candidates and voters.
Nobles do not officially stand as candidates, and none belong to any political party. Of the seventeen nobles attached to the joint Tongatapu / ʻEua constituency, three (Lord Ramsay Robertson Dalgety, Lord Tevita Poasi Tupou and Lord Feleti Sevele) are life peers, were entitled to vote but not to be elected. There were fourteen titles of hereditary nobility attached to the constituency, entitling their bearers to vote and be elected. However, Lord Lasike was barred from the election, while the Lavaka title was at that time held by King Tupou VI. In addition, three nobles (Prime Minister Lord Tuʻivakano, Lord Maʻafu, and Lord Vaea) were already members of the Assembly.
Result.
Twelve votes were cast. Lord Nuku (former Minister for Police, Prisons and Fire Services under Prime Minister Prince Lavaka Ata from 2005 to 2006, then Minister for Works under Prime Minister Feleti Sevele from 2006 to 2010) was elected with eight votes, regaining a seat he had lost in the 2010 general election. Lord Vahaʻi received two votes. Prince Ata, the King's younger son, received one vote, as did Lord Veʻehala.
Aftermath.
In October, Lord Lasike was acquitted on appeal; the Court of Appeal ruled that the Crown prosecution had not proved that Lasike had been aware that the incriminating ammunition was in his possession. Lasike immediately announced that he would challenge his dismissal from Parliament.

Urushibara nickel

Urushibara nickel is a hydrogenation catalyst, made from nickel. It is useful for various hydrogenations.
History.
It was discovered by Yoshiyuki Urushibara in 1951, while doing research on the reduction of estrone to estradiol.
Preparation.
First nickel is precipitated in metallic form by reacting a solution of a nickel salt with zinc. This precipitated nickel contains relatively large amounts of zinc and zinc oxide. Then the catalyst is activated by digesting with either base or acid. There is different designations for differently prepared Urushibara nickel catalysts. The most common is U-Ni-A and U-Ni-B. U-Ni-A is prepared by digesting the precipitated nickel with an acid such as acetic acid. U-Ni-B is prepared by digesting with a base such as sodium hydroxide. After the digestion with acid most of the zinc and zinc oxide is dissolved from the catalyst, while after digestion with base it still contains considerable amounts of zinc and zinc oxide. It is also possible to precipitate the nickel using aluminium or magnesium.
Properties.
Urushibara nickel is not pyrophoric. It can be used for most hydrogenations where Raney nickel can be used.

Nambi

Nambi is a pastoral lease and sheep station located about north east of Leonora and south east of Leinster in the Goldfields of Western Australia,
The station was established in 1899.
The property was owned by the Leonora Pastoral company in 1925, who ran cattle on the leasehold. The Company sold 129 mixed cattle at Midland Junction sales in December 1929, another 28 in January 1930, and another 30 in March 1930.
Plans were underfoot to change to sheep as early as 1925 when Geo Sexton, one of company directors arrived at the station to commence fencing in preparation for the arrival of sheep at the station. The station had also recently purchased eight lorries.
By 1926 Nambi sold some of their first clip with 55 bales sold at the Perth sales in October 1926. and another 46 bales in 1928.
Approximately 10,000 sheep were shorn at Nambi in 1928, with a total clip of 252 bales of wool. The shearing shed had recently been fitted with 6 stands of Lister machinery, whereas shearing had been all done by had in the past.
The Leonora Pastoral company put the property up for auction in 1930, advertising the property as having an area of with tenure up until 1948. The station had of 5 or 6 wire sheep-proof fencing enclosing into 14 paddocks and an additional of cattle fencing also in place. Water was available from 23 wells complete with windmills for a flock of approximately 11,000 sheep of which about 6,000 are breeding ewes, 70 cattle and 100 horses.
The station was sold the Murrum Pastoral Company and Mrs C. Fitzgerald in August 1930, they had bought the station for £18,600 with all plant but no sheep. At this time the station occupied an area of and had over of fencing in place. Having little surface water the property also had 28 wells and in 1930 carried a flock of 9,500 sheep. One of Nambi's neighbours is Clover Downs Station.
William Fitzgerald, of the Murrum Pastoral Company died in December 1933, leaving his wife and two sons. One son, Cyril Irwin Fitzgerald, is the manager at Nambi while the other, Victor Fitzgerald, is the manager at Murrum Station.
In 1937 the station bought an additional 70 Bungaree blood rams from the Hagley stud in Tammin, followed by another 25 in 1938.
A station employee, William Paul, inadvertently shot himself with his own outside the men's quarters in 1941. The bullet grazed his ribs and lodged in his left arm, the wound was not serious.
The station had a good year in 1948 when 17,715 sheep were shorn and 465 bales of wool were collected which was an increase of 3,500 sheep on the previous year. Lambing was estimated at 81%.
Two shearers, members of Len Mitchell's shearing team, became lost when out shooting following rain held up shearing in 1949. The two men, Don McDonald and Ronald Bacon went shooting and became lost in the bush where they spent two of the coldest and wettest nights of the year. Both men were found safe and well about from the homestead. Vehicles and trackers from the station covered over in the search for the men.
The following year the station sold off 3,000 sheep to nearby Wilbah Station.
Cyril Irwin Joseph Fitzgerald, who had owned a managed Nambi since 1933, died in January 1951 aged 41. He left his entire estate to his widow.
Nambi is currently owned by Minara Resources along with three other nearby properties: Glenorn, Yundamindera and Minara Stations. Glenorn and Nambi currently run approximately 1,700 head of cattle.

<doc id="36631197" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36631197" title="Surendra Chaturvedi">
Surendra Chaturvedi

Surendra Chaturvedi (1929–1977) was a journalist and activist prominent in the post-independence Indian cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s when India saw a gradual increase in cultural freedom, quality of life, and means of expression, such as literature, fine arts and journalism. Poetry, drama, historical plays and paintings received great impetus. The number of newspapers, magazines and radio increased, with greater acceptance of vernacular and regional media.
Early life and education.
Born at Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh on 15 October 1929, Surendra had his early education at Sikandarpur (District Farukhabad), Gwalior and Holipura in District Agra. His father Kalika Prasad Chaturvedi was a civil contractor, a Gandhian, and a fan of poems eulogizing patriotism and valour. Due to his father's emphasis on reading, the boy developed an interest in novels, short stories, plays, other fiction and poetry. His sister Pramilla was a student of Hindi literature. 
Chaturvedi attended Agra and Allahabad universities. Drawn to Parimal and its cultural society, he took active part in all the plays staged under its banner and was recognized for an inborn flair for parody and mimicry. The society was under the patronage of famous poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, his wife Teji Bachchan and Dharam Veer Bharti. He also attended University of Lucknow for further studies. 
In 1954 he sailed for Glasgow, Scotland to take study management. Once in England, Chaturvedi participated in BBC cultural programmes. He returned to India in 1958.
Journalism.
Chaturvedi worked for the Bennett Coleman and Company, first in the Public Relations department and then in the print media wing.
Chaturvedi was invited to take the role of the anchor at the historic inaugural show of Doordarshan (State TV Channel) on 15 September 1959. He was one of the earliest anchors of the small screen in Lucknow. UP Natak Academy often called him to assess their plays. 
Navbharat Times, a sister publication in Hindi of the Times of India, posted Chaturvedi as a special correspondent in 1960 to Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. He reported objectively and frankly on interviews and press conferences of province and state leaders.
While at Navbharat Times, Chaturvedi sat on the Board of Advisors for the Institute of Creative Studies, a TV News and film Production Company established in 1974. Known for his ready humor, he was also a member of the Uttar Pradesh Press Club, which was established in 1956. Chaturvedi was known as one of Lucknow's "eminent journalists".
Poetry and fine arts.
Surendra excelled in muktaks (short poems). He was popular at Kavi sammelan and Mushaira gatherings due to his witty and satirical manner and subject matter. He usually targeted politicians, inefficient and corrupt bureaucrats and orthodox society norms. 
Top writers, dramatists and poets were his close friends, such as Dr. Dharamvir Bharati, Amritlal Nagar, Dr. Nagendra, Bhagwati Charan Verma, Yash Pal, Kamleshwar, Giridhar Gopal, Shivani, Dushyant Kumar and Sri Lal Shukla. Stalwarts of music and dance like Begum Akhtar, Birju Maharaj and Shambhu Maharaj often invited him for their performances or renderings. 
In the later part of his life Surendra developed an interest in painting nature and particularly flowers. He was imaginative and bold with his choice of colours and his work was well regarded by artists Ranbir Singh Bhist and Little. 
A few days before his death, he had composed a couplet that perhaps carried an indication of his passing away. It read "Akela, Par Abaad kar deta huoon veerana, Bahut Royegi mere jane ka bad shame tanhai." ["Alone, but I enlive the solitude. Lonely evenings will greatly mourn my departure."]
His work on nawabi adab (etiquette in the time of Nawabs) remained incomplete due to his untimely death.
Death.
Surendra died on 14 January 1977 at Lucknow in a road accident. He was survived by his wife Indu, three daughters and a son.
Contribution.
Giving a new dimension to Hindi reporting Surendra is to be credited for introducing a style of simple and effective prose. He encouraged Hindi journalists to shed off their inhibition of the reporters accredited to English dailies and magazines.

Flying Water

Flying Water (8 April 1973 – 25 June 1978) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which was disrupted by injury she ran eleven times and won six races between July 1975 and June 1978. After winning her only race as a two-year-old she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse in the spring of 1977. Having missed the second half of her three-year-old season through injury, she returned in 1978 to prove herself the best older filly in Europe by winning. She defeated leading sprinters in the Prix Maurice de Gheest, mile specialists in the Prix Jacques le Marois and middle distances horses in the Champion Stakes. In 1978 she was sent to race in the United States where she was killed in an accident in a race at Belmont Park on 25 June.
Background.
Flying Water was a dark chestnut filly with a white star and a white sock on her left foreleg, bred in France by Dayton Ltd. She was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Flying Water's dam, Formentera was a half-sister to the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud winner Felicio and closely related to the Epsom Derby winner St. Paddy.
During her racing career, Flying Water was owned by Daniel Wildenstein and trained by Angel Penna, Sr.. In 1976, Wildenstein and Penna won three of the five British Classics: in addition to Flying Water's 1000 Guineas, they won the Epsom Oaks with Pawneese and the St Leger with Crow.
Racing career.
1975–1976: early career.
Flying Water made her first appearance at Chantilly Racecourse in July 1975 and won a maiden race over 1200m, beating a filly called Imogene. The form of the race was later boosted when Imogene finished second to Vitiges in the Group One Prix Morny. Shortly afterwards the filly developed a splint in one of her legs and was unable to race again that year.
On her first appearance of 1976, Flying Water was sent to England for the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket. She won the Group Three event impressively by three lengths and was immediately made favourite for the 1000 Guineas. Three weeks later Flying Water, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin started 2/1 favourite in a field of twenty-five fillies for the 1000 Guineas. The field split into two groups across the wide Rowley Mile course, with Flying Water towards the back of the group furthest from the stands. In the closing stages, Flying Water produced a strong burst of acceleration to take the lead inside the final furlong and win comfortably by a length from Konafa and Kesar Queen. Her winning time of 1:37.83 was 0.26 seconds faster than that set by the colt Wollow in the 2000 Guineas the previous day. Just over a month later, Penna won the Epsom Oaks with Pawneese, a filly he reportedly regarded as Flying Water's superior.
Flying Water returned to France and moved up in distance for her next start, but disappointed in finishing sixth behind Riverqueen in the Prix Saint-Alary. During the race she sustained a chipped bone in one of her feet which ruled her out for the rest of the year and put her racing career in serious doubt. Flying Water eventually recovered after being sent to the United States for an operation.
1977–1978; later career.
After a break of more than a year, Flying Water resumed her career by finishing fifth to the three-year-old filly Polyponder in the Prix de la Porte Maillot at Longchamp. In August she was moved down in distance for the Prix Maurice de Gheest (then a Group Three) over 1300m at Deauville. Competing against specialist sprinters, Flying Water won from Girl Friend, a mare who had won the race in 1976, with Polyponder finishing third to give females a clean sweep of the places. Flying Water returned to Deauville later that month for the Prix Jacques le Marois, one of France's most important weight-for-age mile races. In a race run at a "muddling" pace, she showed superior speed in the closing stages to win by half a length from Blushing Groom and Trepan. In September, she ran poorly behind Pharly in the Prix du Moulin, a performance which Penna was unable to explain.
On her final European appearance, Flying Water returned to Newmarket for the Champion Stakes in October. Having run poorly in her only previous race over a distance further than a mile (in the Prix Saint-Alary), she was not strongly fancied and started at odds of 9/1. As in her previous start, the filly was suited by a slow pace and accelerated clear inside the final furlong to win by two lengths from the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup winner Relkino.
In 1978, Angel Penna moved his training base to the United States, taking many of his horses, including Flying Water with him. On her second American start, the mare contested a division of the New York Handicap on the turf course at Belmont Park on 25 June. Early in the straight, Flying Water collided with the running rail when moving up to the leaders and fell heavily, throwing her jockey Jean Cruguet. A broken shoulder was diagnosed and Flying Water was euthanised.
Assessment and honours.
In the first official International Classification, a collaboration between the handicappers in Britain, Ireland and France, Flying Water was rated the best older female racehorse in Europe in 1977. The independent Timeform organisation concurred, awarding her a rating of 132.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Flying Water a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

G&amp;SWR 6 Class

The Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR) 6 class is a class of twenty-two 4-4-0 steam locomotives built in 1873. They were designed by James Stirling to handle Midland Railway express passenger trains between Carlisle and Glasgow on the newly opened Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway.
Development.
The twenty-two examples of this class were designed by James Stirling for the GSWR and were built at Kilmarnock Locomotive Works (Works Nos. between 95 and 127) between 1873 and 1877. They were numbered irregularly, and not in chronological order between 3 and 115, to fill gaps in the sequence of running numbers.
The members of the class were fitted with domeless boilers and a cut away cab. The first locomotive (No.6) was fitted with a spring balance type safety valve, but the remainder had those of Ramsbottom design over the centre of the boiler. 
No. 106 was exhibited at the Darlington Exhibition in 1875.
Withdrawal.
The bulk of the class, including all the rebuilds were ‘renewed’ (i.e. substantially rebuilt) as G&SWR 194 Class by James Manson between 1895 and 1900, but five were scrapped between 1894 and 1897.

Santi Vittore e Carlo (Genoa)

Santi Vittore e Carlo is a Baroque style church on Via Balbi in central Genoa, Italy. Originally belonging to the Discalced Carmelite Order, the church was constructed in the shape of a Latin Cross between 1629 and 1635 from a design by Bartolomeo Bianco. Designs by Eugenio Durazzo were incorporated in 1743 with the construction of a façade. 
Inside the church are a number of works of 17th- and 18th-century artists, including the wooden sculptures "Madonna of the Carmine" (Alessandro Algardi, 1678) and "Angels and Saints" (Filippo Parodi, 1680) and paintings by Andrea Carlone ("Saint Teresa"), Lorenzo De Ferrari ("Saints Anne and Young John the Baptist, Francesco di Paola and Liborio"), Orazio De Ferrari ("Nativity", "Adoration of the Magi"), Giovanni Maria delle Piane ("Decapitation of Sant'Agostino") and Domenico Piola ("Saint John of the Cross"). The main altar is the remnant of a destroyed church of San Domenico.
Domenico Parodi painted the figure of "Virtue", but many of the decorations were overseen by Maurice Dufour in the last decade of the 19th century, 1890–1898.

Biography.
A member of the Gens Nummii, Nummius Tuscus was probably the son of Marcus Nummius Tuscus, the consul of AD 258. He himself was appointed "consul prior" alongside Gaius Annius Anullinus in AD 295. Sometime between 295 and 302, Nummius Tuscus served as the proconsular curator of "Aquarum et Miniciae"; this was followed by his appointment as "Praefectus Urbi" of Rome, a position he held from 19 February 302 until 12 September 303.
Sometime during the reign of the emperor Maxentius (AD 306–312), Nummius Tuscus and 12 other senators each contributed 400,000 sesterces, probably for the construction of a building in Rome.

Call My Name (Cheryl Cole song)

"Call My Name" is a song by British recording artist Cheryl Cole taken from her third studio album, "A Million Lights" (2012). It was written and produced by Calvin Harris, and released as the lead single from the album on 10 June 2012. "Call My Name" is a dance-pop song that is compared by critics to songs produced by Harris for other singers. 
The track received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Although many thought it was catchy, it was thought to be generic when compared to other songs played on the radio, and is noted for being a departure from Cole's previous works.
"Call My Name" achieved commercial success on Cole's main markets, reaching the top spot of the charts in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. The song also entered the top twenty in New Zealand, and earned a Gold certification in the country. 
The accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler, and features Cole performing an elaborate dance routine with backup dancers. The release of it was promoted with two teasers, until the full video premiered on 2 May 2012. To promote the song, Cole performed the track on "The Graham Norton Show", Stand Up to Cancer, Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2012, "T4", "The Voice Denmark", and "The Voice UK". It was reported by various media outlets that Cole had lip synced her performances of "Call My Name".
Background.
On March 2012, critics speculated that Calvin Harris and Cole were collaborating on a track following a Twitter discussion between them both. When asked if he would like to work with Cole, Harris said, "I'd love to work with somebody like Cheryl Cole, she would be great." The following month, it was confirmed that the track was titled "Call My Name", and it would be released as the lead single from Cole's third studio album, "A Million Lights", on 10 June 2012. The song was written and produced by Harris, and was initially offered to singer Rita Ora, who reportedly turned it down after she decided it wasn't her style of music. The track had its radio premiere on Capital FM's breakfast show on 23 April 2012.
Composition.
"Call My Name" is a dance-pop song written in E major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 125 beats per minute. The vocal range from the singer spans from C4 to C5. "Call My Name" borrows similarities to Rihanna's "We Found Love" (2011) and Scissor Sisters' "Only the Horses" (2012), tracks that were also produced by Harris. Brogan Driscoll of "The Huffington Post" speculated that the "dance anthem" title, "Call My Name", could be linked Cole's recent decision to drop her married name from her professional career. Sarah Deen of "Metro" stated that the track features a "typical Calvin Harris beat and singalong chorus", the chorus of the song was considered a departure from Cheryl Cole's previous works, namely "Fight for This Love" (2009) and "Promise This" (2010), while "Marie Claire" columnist Eleanor Young described "Call My Name" as a "fast paced party track". When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to "We Found Love" during an interview with the singer, she responded, "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. Although you might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing." She also said that the lyrics of the song don't have a meaning, but they do have a feeling: "I think it's quite a sexy lyric? Um… It's really not that deep. We're not saving the world with lyrics or anything."
Critical response.
"Call My Name" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com explained that, after many believed that rejecting her judge role on " the US version of The X Factor" in 2011 would be a career setback, the release of the "hot, current dance pop" track proved them wrong. Writing for the same website, DJ Ron Slomowicz stated that, despite being "a little generic" when compared to mainstream tracks, "there's still something undeniably catchy about the track." Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated "Call My Name" four out of five stars, and added: "unsurprisingly, is a ballsy dance anthem about an elusive lover complete with a foot-stomping trance section that becomes more addictive with each listen." Copsey also added that it isn't the "greatest song of all time, nor the most original you'll hear this year, but the feeling we get from it more than makes up for it." Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, despite not being innovative, the song has catchy hooks and melodies that "manage to grab you from the first listen, no matter how familiar they might sound." 
"NME" reviewer Issy Sampson explained that the track is so addictive after a few listens that "you’ll find yourself driving to Cheryl’s house, at 4.35am on a Tuesday, crying uncontrollably and muttering something about HER calling YOUR name." Entertainment Wise reviewer Wil Jones also thought that "Call My Name" wasn't innovative, and compared it to other productions by David Guetta, saying, "a bit of a drop there, the same old floor-to-the-floor beat here, a big synth-y chorus that’s meant to be anthemic but isn’t really, over-produced, bland vocals. 'Call My Name' is isn’t by no means terrible, it’s just very blah." Similarly, Jenn Selby of "Glamour" noted that "Call My Name" bears resemblance to other productions by Harris, yet admitted that she was surprised with the result of their collaboration, while Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said that the song has everything to become the summer's hottest anthem. "The Guardian" critic Alexis Petridis gave the song a mixed review, criticizing it for being generic and adding that it lacks "the spark that powered Rihanna's We Found Love."
Chart performance.
Hours after its official release on the iTunes Store in the United Kingdom, "Call My Name" reached the top position of the UK store's chart. With only three days of release, the track sold a total of 97,000 units in the United Kingdom alone. After a full week of sales, "Call My Name" sold a total of 152,001 digital copies in the country, becoming 2012's fastest selling number one single on the UK Singles Chart until December of the same year, when "The X Factor" winner James Arthur sold 490,560 copies with his cover of Shontelle's "Impossible". "Call My Name" sold a total of 417,000 copies in the UK, and was the 34th best-selling single of 2012 there. "Call My Name" also debuted and peaked at number one in Ireland. On its second charting week, the track fell to number two in place of Maroon 5 and Wiz Khalifa's "Payphone" having sold 70,640 copies. "Call My Name" entered the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 25 on 2 July 2012, climbing into the top twenty four weeks later, peaking at number 13. It earned a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand for selling over 7,500 units there. "Call My Name" failed to make such impact on the Australian Singles Chart, peaking at number 49.
Music video.
The music video for "Call My Name" was directed by Anthony Mandler in Los Angeles, California. A 15-second teaser was unveiled on 25 April 2012, followed by an extended version five days later. The music video officially premiered on 2 May 2012. It starts with a quote from French writer and philosopher the Marquis de Sade that reads, "The only way to a woman's heart is along the path of torment." This is followed by scenes of Cole strutting down a graffiti-daubed storm drain before meeting with her dancers and performing an elaborate dance routine in the Los Angeles River while wearing a neon yellow bra. This scene is a reference to the drag race scene in the 1970s musical film "Grease". The camera cuts intermittently to footage filmed on the London Eye before the California shoot, which shows Cole posing through the reflection on the capsule window. Scenes of the singer driving a car over and posing on a Los Angeles bridge are intercalated later in the video. It received mixed reviews from critics. Jo Usmau of the "Daily Mirror" said that the video "doesn't disappoint", and, regarding the dance sequences, stated that "she can really really dance", adding: "Check. Out. Her. Stomach. no wonder she's number two on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list which was released today." Robbie Daw of Idolator commented that the song itself is better than the video, and added the one thing he learned from it: "when you don’t have a huge budget, spend what you can on clothing, makeup and wigs, and make the most out of the artist’s ample curves."
Live performances.
On 26 May 2012, it was reported that Cole would perform "Call My Name" with live vocals on "The Voice UK", following allegedly pre-recorded performances that occurred the previous year on "The X Factor UK". It was also reported that "The Voice" executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." As the performance began, Cheryl swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly ellaborated routine. Following the broadcast, Cole received mixed comments from viewers, with a few who accused the singer of lip synching, while others, including pop singers Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, Cole addressed the negative comments, and said that "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment." She performed the track again on "The Graham Norton Show" on 8 June 2012, and was also accused of lip synching. Cole also performed "Call My Name" at Capital FM Summertime Ball on 9 June 2012 in front of 80,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium, she was a surprise artist. During the energetic performance, the singer sported an outfit designed by Pam Hogg, and was accompanied by 12 backing dancers. Colette Fahy of the "Daily Mail" accused Cole of lip synching and stated that "it was evident to the crowd that was miming." Cole performed "Call My Name" at Stand Up to Cancer. However, the performance was also subject of controversy after technical errors with her microphone occurred, meaning that viewers could only hear her voice faintly singing along to a musical backing track. Cole also performed the track on a "T4" special, at "The Voice Denmark", and at the 2012 Jingle Bell Ball. "Call My Name" was also performed on Cole's debut headlining solo concert tour, named "A Million Lights Tour", in October 2012.

When it is time for her to give birth, she seeks refuge in the house of her best friend, played by Gina Alajar, and her husband, played by Lloyd Samartino, who has absolutely no sympathy for the cause which his wife's friend is fighting for.
Childless, Lloyd and Gina get emotionally attached to the baby, especially after the mother temporarily leaves the infant to look into the circumstances of her guerilla husband's death in the hands of the military. Unfortunately, before she could return to her baby, Andrea is arrested and detained in a safehouse by military men who torture her mercilessly.
Having lost contact with the freedom-fighter and presuming her to have been killed, the surrogate parents have decided to keep the child as their own and bring him to the United States for seven years. When they return to the Philippines for a visit, Andrea confronts them and tries to claim her child back.

Heart of the Matter (TV series)

Heart of the Matter is a British television debate series that aired on BBC One from 1979 to 2000. Presented by Joan Bakewell, its subject matter was often concerned with religious or ethical issues. Topics covered include subjects as diverse as substance abuse, the effects of anti-personnel landmines, and homosexuality. Bakewell would usually chair an in-studio debate in which invited guests would discuss the edition's chosen topic. An edition from 1996 hosted by Joan Bakewell, "The Heart of the Matter: God Under the Microscope" featured a debate on science and religion and included as guests David Starkey, Mary Warnock, Wentzel van Huyssteen, Richard Dawkins, Michael Heller, and James Watson.
"Heart of the Matter" was broadcast late on Sunday evenings, usually alternating with the similarly-themed "Everyman", though the latter tended to have more of a religious focus. Both programmes were cancelled in the 2000s following a revamp of BBC output.

New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915) 20 CLR 54 is a landmark Australian judgment of the High Court regarding judicial separation of power. It is also known as the "Wheat Case".
The High Court of Australia decided that the strict insulation of judicial power was a fundamental principle of the Constitution. This also applies to tribunals and commissions set up by Federal Parliament which, can only recommend consequences.
Further the High Court held that only a court has judicial power under Chapter III of the constitution, so the Inter-State Commission created by Section 101 could not exercise judicial power despite the words of the Constitution, because it was set up by the executive and violated the conditions for being a Chapter III court.

Lotus Development's DataLens, originally known as Blueprint, was a standardized system for database queries used in a number of Lotus products, notably 1-2-3. It provided drivers for a number of common data sources, including a variety of mainframe SQL servers, microcomputer database files of various sorts, and even flat-file systems. Drivers from 3rd parties were also available.
Unlike the better-known ODBC, DataLens did not use SQL in the query interface. The API was based on a variety of data structures that were interpreted by the database drivers into their own internal query format - including SQL in some cases. In contrast, ODBC used SQL as its basic interface, and interpreted and translated it in the driver for those data sources that did not use SQL.
Lotus also released two user-oriented query builders, the DOS-based Query Builder which could interact with DataLens sources but was not built on it, and the Windows-based Data Query Assistant (DQA) which was built directly on DataLens.

Martin Kazinski (Kad Merad) is a middle-aged working stiff who, on the train to work one morning, discovers he has inexplicably become a celebrity. His simple life is turned upside down. As he asks "Why?" his life becomes more and more complicated. He sees a lawyer for help in getting people to leave him alone, and is put in contact with a media agent, Fleur Arnaud, whose efforts inadvertently make him more and more famous. When he appears on Fleur's television show, everything he says is twisted into a symbolic statement, and the more he pleads for his privacy, the more famous he becomes. He is told he is causing disruption at his job and is pursued by well-wishers and paparazzi. Others are jealous and resent his "success." Fleur and he grow close, though she is a having an affair with the manipulative producer of her television program. 
Martin is now broke, and the TV studio offers him a chance to cash in on his fame. He turns them down. A TV host introduces him to some shady characters who try to get him involved in their activities but he refuses them too. Suddenly the public turns against him. A woman strikes and spits on him in a grocery store, and he is pursued by a mob. Fleur decides to move in with the TV producer. Martin quarrels with her, then falls into despair as he becomes an object of public vilification. He hides out with a drag queen (Philomène) who appeared with him at a talk show. He returns to the studio to ask for help but is treated with contempt by the producer, who does however reveal that Fleur has disappeared. 
Months later we see Martin at a private launch of an autobiography he has had ghost-written for him. Some of his friends from his celebrity period are still around, but he has apparently been largely forgotten. The doorbell rings and, when he opens it, Fleur is there. He tells her to leave, but a passage Philomène reads from the autobiography makes him change his mind and goes after her. As the film ends, the two seem to be returning to the launch.

Angim

The work known by its incipit, Angim, “The Return of Ninurta to Nippur,” is a rather obsequious 210-line mythological praise poem for the ancient Mesopotamian warrior-god Ninurta, describing his return to Nippur from an expedition to the mountains (KUR), where he boasts of his triumphs against "rebel lands" (KI.BAL), boasting to Enlil in the Ekur, before returning to the Ešumeša temple – to “manifest his authority and kingship.”
The ancient Sumerian epic had been provided with an intralinear Akkadian translation during the course of the second millennium.
The Myth.
Three copies from Nippur provide a subscript labeling it a šír-gìd-da, or “long song,” of Ninurta, where the term "long" perhaps refers to the tuning of the musical instrument intended to accompany the song. It is extant in unilingual Sumerian from Nippur during the Old Babylonian period, and thereafter in bilingual editions from the Kassite, middle Assyrian and neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian versions, where the later ones are closer textually to the old version than the Middle Babylonian. Along with its companion composition, Lugal-e, it is the only Sumerian composition other than incantations and proverbs to have survived in the canon from the Old Babylonian period into the first Millennium. The title comes from the opening line: an- dím-ma, den-líl-gim dím-ma, “created like An, created like Enlil.”
The narrative relates that he mounts the monsters, “slain heroes,” he has defeated as trophies on his [gišgigir z]a-gìn-na, “shining chariot.” Echoing the number of Tiāmat’s eleven monstrous offspring, (from the Enûma Eliš, whom Marduk had vanquished), Ninurta’s conquests included 
He then journeys with his attendants, Udanna, the all-seeing god, Lugalanbadra, the bearded lord, and Lugalkudub, with full battle regalia in a terrifying procession to Nippur. Nusku warns him that he is frightening the gods, the Ananna, and, if he can tone it down a little, Enlil will reward him. In the Ekur, he displays his trophies and booty to the general astonishment of the gods – including his brother, the moon god Sin, father, Enlil, and mother Ninlil. Ninurta then extols his virtues in a long hymn of self-praise in an effort to solicit the establishment of his own cult. On his departure from the Ekur, he is petitioned by the god Ninkarnunna to extend his blessings to the king, perhaps the underlying purpose of the whole poem. The work ends with: dNinurta dumu mah é-kur-ra, “Ninurta, the magnificent scion of Ekur.”
The ancient use of the text is uncertain. It may have been recited during some kind of cultic activity, such as the annual transport of the Ninurta idol between the temples, Ešumeša and Ekur.

Ahasuerus Fromanteel

Ahasuerus Fromanteel (circa 1607 – 1693) was a clockmaker, the first maker of pendulum clocks in Britain.
Life and work.
Fromanteel was baptized in Norwich on 25 February 1607. He was the first of five children born to Leah and Mordecai Fromanteel, a wood turner. The Fromanteels were a highly respected Flanders family of the sixteenth century. Following Spanish conquest, members of the family fled across the sea to East Anglia, establishing themselves in Colchester, Norwich, and London.
Ahasuerus Fromanteel was apprenticed for seven years to a blacksmith, before settling in London in 1629. He began as a crafter of steeple clocks in East Smithfield, near the Tower of London, becoming a member of Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in 1631. He made lantern clocks with balance wheel escapement, and spring-driven table clocks, and joined the Clockmakers' Guild in 1632. In 1658 Fromanteel were taken before the guild for hiring more apprentices than the rules stipulated, which suggests that the firm was thriving. He developed microscopes and lenses, building on the work of Cornelis Drebbel and Benjamin Worsley in Amsterdam.
Fromanteel married Maria de Bruijne in 1631 and together they had eight children of whom four became clockmakers themselves. From birth Fromanteel was involved with the Dutch Reformed church, however in he and his wife were rebaptised and formally transferred to the Baptist faith.
Pendulum clocks.
In 1657 Ahasuerus's son John Fromanteel began studying pendulum clocks, invented by Christiaan Huygens (1656). Before the invention of the pendulum clock, timepieces were accurate to only within ten to fifteen minutes a day. The use of the pendulum made for near frictionless time keeping, ensuring that the mechanism lost measurement of only a few seconds a day: a sixty-fold improvement. It was termed a "horological breakthrough". This revolution in time keeping could be said to have caused industrial espionage on a grand scale. Following a trip to the Netherlands John and Ahasuerus implemented the new, more accurate pendulum technology. Fromanteel became the first maker of pendulum clocks in England, although this distinction has also been claimed by horologists Richard Harris and Robert Hooke. Precise measurement of time was critical for disciplines including maritime navigation and astronomy. Fromanteel used the design for regulating steeple and domestic clocks and sold them from the family house in Southwark and at the a shop in Lothbury, which had been a famous retailer of clocks for more than a hundred years. The Fromanteel family sold also weight-driven clocks, watches that needed only a single annual winding and a variety of domestic and industrial engines, selling to the city of Norwich one of his patent fire engines.
In the "Commonwealth Mercury" of Thursday 25 November 1658 Fromanteel advertised : 
clocks that go exact and keep equaller time than any now made without this regulator (examined and proved before his Highness the Lord Protector by such doctors, whose knowledge and learning is without exception) and are not subject to alter by change of weather, as others are, and may be made to go a week, a month, or a year with once winding up, as well as those that are wound up every day, and keep time as well, and is very excellent for all House Clocks that go either with springs or weights; and also Steeple Clocks that are most subject to differ by change of weather. Made by Ahasuerus Fromanteel, who made the first that were in England. You may have them at his house on the Bankside, in Mosses Alley, Southwark and at the sign of the Mermaid, in Lothbury, near Bartholomew Lane end, London. 
He had gained the notice and patronage of "The Lord Protector", Oliver Cromwell, Britain's interregnum head of state. A popular legend developed that Cromwell himself owned such a clock, however there is little evidence to support this theory. As Mark Denny states in "Five Machines That Changed the World", Fromanteel's patent "ushered in the age of English longcase clocks, which dominated horology for a century".
Later years.
Fromanteel relocated back in the Netherlands in 1667-76. His son John was left in London to look after the business with Thomas Loomes, a former apprentice, married to Fromanteel's daughter Mary. Following the death of his wife Maria, Ahasuerus Fromanteel wed the widow Sarah Winnock (c. 1660). They lived in Whitechapel, where other of the Fromanteel family were established as silk weavers. Fromanteel died in 1693, and was interred at St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, on 31 January 1693.
A Fromanteel brand-name of clocks and watches exists today, based in the Netherlands.

John Walton (translator)

John Walton, also John Capellanus ("fl". 1410) was an English Augustinian canon, known as a poet and translator.
Works.
Walton appears to have been a canon of Osney Abbey in 1410, when he completed his verse-translation of the "De Consolatione Philosophiæ" of Boethius. This work was undertaken at the request of Elizabeth Berkeley; she, possibly, was the daughter of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, patron of John de Trevisa, who married Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. Boethius's work had already been translated into English prose as Geoffrey Chaucer's "Boece", and Walton makes use of Chaucer's version. He refers to Chaucer as "the floure of rethoryk", and also mentions John Gower.
Ten manuscripts of Walton's translation are extant. Walton's book was printed in 1525. Extracts from Walton's poem were printed in Wülker's "Altenglisches Lesebuch" (ii. 56), in Skeat's edition of Chaucer (vol. ii. pp. xvi–xvii), and in the "Athenæum" (1892, i. 565).
Identification.
Walton has been confused by Thomas Tanner with John Walton], archbishop of Dublin, with John de Waltham, prior of Drax and subdean of York, and with others of similar names.

<doc id="36632023" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36632023" title="Hurricane Ernesto (2012)">
Hurricane Ernesto (2012)

Hurricane Ernesto was a Category 2 hurricane and damaging tropical cyclone that affected several Caribbean Islands and areas of Central America during August 2012. The fifth named storm and second hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Ernesto originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa in late July. Moving westward, the system developed into a tropical depression in the central Atlantic, and further into a tropical storm prior to entering the Caribbean Sea. The system encountered high wind shear south of Jamaica but subsequently reached its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane as it made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Ernesto briefly emerged in the Bay of Campeche as a strong tropical storm before dissipating over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. The remnant circulation emerged in the eastern Pacific basin, contributing to the formation of Tropical Storm Hector. 
Following the formation of the system, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for the Windward Islands. Hurricane watches and warnings were extended for nearby Caribbean Islands in the days following as Ernesto trekked across the central Caribbean Sea. Evacuations were performed in low-lying areas on the Yucatán Peninsula and cruise ship departures were cancelled.
Meteorological history.
On July 27, the precursor to Ernesto moved off the west coast of Africa as a tropical wave. At the time, the wave was associated with a disorganized area of convection. On July 29, a broad low pressure area developed in association with the tropical wave. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first monitored the tropical wave in its tropical weather outlook on July 30, noting that the system had an accompanying low pressure area and was showing signs of development. The convection slowly organized due to generally favorable environmental conditions. After the circulation became better defined, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Five at 2100 UTC on August 1. At the time, the depression was located about 810 mi (1305 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, moving west-northwestward due to an anticyclone to its north. In the 12 hours after its formation, the system's convection became disorganized due to westerly wind shear and dry air, and the NHC remarked the potential for degeneration into a tropical wave. However, the depression's rainbands began to strengthen and become more organized. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 2 observed tropical storm force winds, and accordingly the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ernesto at 2100 UTC. 
After becoming a tropical storm, Ernesto initially had difficulty maintaining convection near the center, and its rapid westward movement prevented significant organization. At around 1200 UTC on August 3, the storm moved over or very near Saint Lucia, and radar imagery observed a well-defined circulation moving by the island. Wind shear gradually decreased over the storm, allowing for outflow to increase in its western portion. There were disparities among tropical cyclone forecast models over the future of Ernesto; some anticipated significant intensification due to warm waters and low shear, whereas others forecast the storm to remain a minimal storm or even weaken. Although the satellite appearance was well-organized, a Hurricane Hunters flight on August 4 observed a disorganized structure, and early the next day the circulation became exposed to the northwest of the convection; the weakening was possibly due to dry air and some mid-level shear, despite otherwise favorable conditions. On August 5, the storm passed south of Jamaica. Early on August 6, convection redeveloped over the center after Ernesto slowed its westward movement, and decreasing wind shear allowed for restrengthening. Late on August 7, Ernesto intensified into a hurricane to the north of Honduras.
While approaching the Yucatán Peninsula, Ernesto quickly intensified, developing a well-defined eye. Early on August 8, the hurricane moved over Banco Chinchorro offshore extreme eastern Mexico as a strong Category 1 storm, then strengthened further into a Category 2 hurricane before making its mainland landfall on Mahahual, Quintana Roo, at around 10:15 p.m. CDT (0315 UTC), with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The 85-kt estimated landfall and peak intensity of Ernesto is based on a blend of Dvorak
intensity estimates of 77 and 90 kt from 0000 UTC and 0300 UTC 8 August 2012, respectively;
the 90-kt Dvorak estimate at landfall was performed by TAFB during the post-storm analysis.
The improved structure and continued intensification of Ernesto through landfall is also
supported by two minimum pressure observations in Mexico. An automated observing site on
the Banco Chinchorro Islands reported a minimum pressure of 979.4 mb (Table 2) at 0100 UTC
8 August as the center passed over the area. This was 5 mb lower than the minimum pressure
reported by reconnaissance aircraft 8 h earlier. A storm chaser located inland near Buena Vista,
Mexico, reported a minimum pressure of 975.0 mb (Table 2) at 0534 UTC while still
experiencing strong winds. Based on these data, the estimated minimum pressure at landfall is
973 mb. Ernesto later weakened to tropical storm status after its convection weakened over land. It reemerged over the Bay of Campeche, and intensified into a strong tropical storm. The system moved inland across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the afternoon of August 9, and into southern Mexico before dissipating as a tropical cyclone on August 10. The remnants later contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Hector in the Eastern Pacific on August 11.
Preparations and impact.
Caribbean.
When Ernesto first formed, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. All of the watches were upgraded to a warning after Ernesto intensified into a tropical storm. While moving through the Lesser Antilles, Ernesto produced wind gusts of on Saint Lucia and sustained winds of in Barbados. Due to the storm, the airport in Dominica closed for two days, and ferry service between Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, and Saint Lucia was canceled. On Saint Lucia, officials ordered businesses to close early. No damage was reported in the Lesser Antilles.
At 1200 UTC on August 4, the government of Jamaica issued an island-wide tropical storm watch, which was upgraded to a warning only three hours later. Officials ordered fishermen on outlying islands to evacuate to the mainland. A tropical storm watch was issued for the Cayman Islands.
Before Ernesto passed south of Jamaica, the government of Honduras issued a tropical storm watch from its border with Nicaragua to Punta Castilla. Portions of the watch area were upgraded to a tropical storm warning on August 6, around the same time that the Mexican government issued a hurricane and tropical storm watch for portions of the Yucatán Peninsula. After Ernesto began quickly intensifying, however, the Mexican government upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning from Chetumal to Punta Allen along the peninsula and a tropical storm warning northward to Tulum. At the same time, the government of Belize issued a hurricane watch for its coastline.
Mexico.
Authorities in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo were moving more than 1,300 tourists from resorts in Mahuahal and other spots to Chetumal, a bayside city that was expected to see less rain and wind than the coast. Two cruises ships scheduled to dock on the Riviera Maya put off their arrival. In the city of Tulum, some 6,000 tourists were sheltering in hotels that authorities said were strong enough to qualify as storm shelters. Authorities also prepared two kindergartens as shelters that can hold up to 220 people. Soldiers and police were moving 600 residents from the fishing village of Punta Allen in Quintana Roo and began preparing for the evacuation of residents from other low-lying coastal settlements. Mexico closed its three major oil export ports in the Gulf of Mexico - Coatzacoalcos, Cayos Arcas and Dos Bocas. Almost all of the country's crude oil exports are shipped to refineries on the Gulf Coast of the United States from the three ports. Authorities expected them to be back in operation by 9 August.
In Tabasco, heavy rains from the storm triggered flooding that killed two fishermen and damaged 100 homes. Three members of a family were killed when a tree fell on their pick-up truck of Río Blanco, Veracruz. Also in the state of Veracruz, a teenage girl died after her car got dragged in a current, and a 62-year-old man was killed by a lightning strike.
United States.
In the United States, authorities in the Florida Panhandle and Alabama warned swimmers of potentially dangerous rip currents that will affect the coast for a few days. At least ten people were rescued in Pensacola Beach on 9 August alone. A man was injured in a lightning strike, and part of a store was washed away in Pensacola Beach on 10 August.

NGC 4651 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation of Coma Berenices that can be seen with amateur telescopes, at a distance not well determined that ranges from 35 million light years to 72 million light years
Features.
This member of the Virgo Cluster, located on its outskirts, is known as the "Umbrella Galaxy" due to the umbrella-shaped structure that extends from its disk to the east and that it's composed of stellar streams, being the remmants of a much smaller galaxy that has been torn apart by NGC 4651's tidal forces, something that explains why NGC 4651 has been included on Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 189 -galaxy with filaments-.
Studies using radiotelescopes of the distribution of its neutral hydrogen show distortions on NGC 4651's outer regions and a gas clump associated with a dwarf galaxy that may have born in the event that produced the mentioned stellar streams
Unlike most spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, NGC 4651 is rich in neutral hydrogen, also extending beyond the optical disk, and its star formation is the typical for a galaxy of its type.

Ha'argaz

Ha'argaz, founded in 1932, is one of the oldest leading industrial companies in Israel.
History.
Ha'argaz was founded on August 18, 1932 as a cooperative manufacturing work boxes for citrus production. The first factory of Cooperative trunk was founded on May 1, 1933 in Tel Aviv, on Salomon street at the corner of Gaon. after three months of development and construction of the factory were factory new machines and began to work regularly. In 1933 sought founders of the plant further employment and contacted with "expert" His main work was the development and production vehicles from tree to buses. on September 15, 1933 began construction of another factory L"hargz "in Neve Shaanan in Tel Aviv. During heavy rains in November 1938, the factory in Neve Shaanan was flooded and workers toiled for hours save many raw materials 
During 1936 a Defense plant was established which produced armored and protective vehicle bodies. 
During World War II the plant expanded and added many fulltime employees. It was later decided in 1945 to convert the box to a company half owned by investors and half-owned by a workers cooperative. 
In 1949 owner of Ha'argaz decided to take it upon themselves to produce jerry cans, military helmets and a variety of logistical equipment for the newly established Israeli army. Following the successful managers have decided to "trunk" to initiate additional projects such as collaboration with " AMPA ", becoming exclusive import agent for Philco refrigerators from the United States. This collaboration led to the creation company Amcor a factory of refrigerators and electrical appliances.
In December 2000 the company was acquired by the Histadrut by Hagai Shalom incumbent chairman of the group. Due to a change of ownership through Ha'argaz underwent a streamlining process, As of 2008 revenues estimated at NIS 200 million. Major activities of the company today are: transportation, metal and packaging, wooden furniture, portable structures and systems for display and storage.
Today Ha'argaz is one of the providers of buses headquarters of Egged and Dan bus companies and other private and public transportation companies in Israel. Crate factory is the second largest producer bodies in Israel, after company Buses(that is also about producing vehicles to vehicles and public transport ).

<doc id="36632085" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36632085" title="Azane">
Azane

Azanes are saturated hydronitrogens, which means that they consist only of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms and all bonds are single bonds. By definition, cycles are excluded, so that the azanes comprise a homologous series of inorganic compounds with the general chemical formula . There are no commercial sources.
Each nitrogen atom has three bonds (either N-H or N-N bonds), and each hydrogen atom is joined to a nitrogen atom (H-N bonds). A series of linked nitrogen atoms is known as the nitrogen skeleton or nitrogen backbone. The number of nitrogen atoms is used to define the size of the azane (e.g. N2-azane).
The simplest possible azane (the parent molecule) is ammonia, . There is no limit to the number of nitrogen atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is saturated, and is a hydronitrogen.
Azanes are reactive and have significant biological activity. Azanes can be viewed as a more biologically active or reactive portion (functional groups) of the molecule, which can be hung upon molecular trees.
Structure clasification.
Saturated hydronitrogens can be:
According to IUPAC definitions, the former two are azanes, whereas the third group is called cycloazanes. Saturated hydronitrogens can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g. polycyclic), and branching structures, and they are still azanes (no general formula) as long as they are acyclic (i.e., having no loops). They also have single covalent bonds between their nitrogens.
Isomerism.
Azanes with more than three nitrogen atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming structural isomers. The simplest isomer of an azane is the one in which the nitrogen atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the n-isomer (n for "normal", although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of nitrogen atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of nitrogen atoms.
Due to the low energy of inversion, unsubstituted branched azanes cannot be chiral. In addition to these isomers, the chain of nitrogen atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called cycloazanes.
Nomenclature.
The IUPAC nomenclature systematically naming nitrogen compounds by identifying hydronitrogen chains, analogous to the alkane nomenclature. Unbranched, saturated hydronitrogen chains are named with a Greek numerical prefix for the number of nitrogens and the suffix "-azane" for hydronitrogens with single bonds, or "-azene" for those with double bonds.
Linear azanes.
Straight-chain azanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix "n"- (for "normal") where a non-linear isomer exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers.
The members of the series (in terms of number of nitrogen atoms) are named as follows:
Azanes with three or more nitrogen atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix. Hence, triazane, ; tetrazane or tetraazane, ; pentazane or pentaazane, ; hexazane or hexaazane, ; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, with the exceptions of nonaazane which has a Latin prefix, and undecaazane and tridecaazane which have mixed-language prefixes.
Hazards.
Ammonia is explosive when mixed with air (15 – 25%). Other lower azanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid azanes are highly flammable; this risk increases with the length of the nitrogen chain.
Considerations for detection and risk control:
Organoazanes.
The organoazanes are a group of chemical compounds derived from azanes containing one or more organic groups. They are a subset of the general class of organonitrogens, although the distinction is not often made. As with organoamines, organohydrazines are a subsets of organoazanes, derived from ammonia, and hydrazine, respectively.
In addition to amines and hydrazines, organoazanes also include compounds such as, hydrazones, imines, nitriles, and nitrosos, but excludes compounds such as, but not limited to azo compounds.
Many substituted hydrazines are known, and several occur naturally. Some examples include
Related and derived hydronitrogens.
Related to the azanes are a homologous series of functional groups, side-chains, or radicals with the general chemical formula . Examples include azanyl () and hydrazinyl. This group is generally abbreviated with the symbol N.

Rossano Cathedral

Rossano Cathedral (, "Cattedrale di Maria Santissima Achiropita") is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Rossano, Italy, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary as "Maria Santissima Acheropita". It is the seat of the Archbishop of Rossano-Cariati, and previously of the Bishops and Archbishops of Rossano.
History and description.
The cathedral was built in the 11th century, with substantial reconstruction in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has a central nave and two side-aisles, terminating in three apses. The bell tower and the baptismal font date from the 14th century, while the other artworks and furnishings are of the 17th and 18th centuries.
"Maria Santissima Acheropita".
The cathedral is famous for its ancient image of the "Madonna Acheropita", an image of the Madonna and Child supposedly discovered in the cathedral plaster and not painted by human hand, which is dated to somewhere between about 580 and the first half of the 8th century.
Rossano Gospels.
In the sacristy in 1879 was discovered the "Codex Purpureus Rossanensis" ("Rossano Gospels"), a Greek evangeliary of the 5th or 6th century of Middle Eastern origin (probably Antioch), which was probably brought to Rossano by a monk taking refuge from the Arab invasions of the Middle East during the 9th and 10th centuries.
The manuscript comprises 188 leaves of parchment dyed purple containing the Gospels of Matthew and Mark and the "Epistula ad Carpianum" (a letter from Eusebius of Caesarea to a Christian named Carpianus). Although it is mutilated and anonymous, the manuscript is perhaps the most representative testimony of the Byzantine connections of Rossano. The texts are in gold and silver ink, with 15 miniatures showing the most important moments in the life and preaching of Jesus.

Everyman is a British television documentary series that aired on BBC One in a late-night slot on Sunday evenings between 1977 and 2005. Its subject matter tended to be focused on moral and religious issues, often in the form of a film in which individuals would discuss their thoughts. One edition from 1990, "A Game of Soldiers" concerned a group of soldiers exploring their feelings about being trained to kill. Throughout much of its time on air, series of "Everyman" aired alternately with "Heart of the Matter", a debate series which featured somewhat similar topics. Both series were cancelled in the 2000s after the BBC revamped the output of its religious programming.

Montana Highway 117 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Montana. Formerly Secondary Highway 249, the route allows traffic from Montana Highway 24 at Fort Peck to travel north to U.S. Route 2 at Nashua, providing a shortcut between the two routes, as well as providing access from the north to the Fort Peck Dam and Fort Peck Lake.
Route description.
Highway 117 begins at the western end of the Fort Peck Dam, in a tightly angled junction with Highway 24. It proceeds eastwards, winding its way through the town of Fort Peck before turning northwards at a T-intersection on its northern outskirts. The road then proceeds past the Missouri River on its right, and heads in a generally northeasterly orientation. After crossing the Milk River, Highway 117 enters Nashua from the southwest and curves east, before taking a left turn and crossing the BNSF Railway's Northern Transcon, linking the two halves of Nashua together. Soon, the road meets U.S. Route 2 on the town's northern side and terminates.

German submarine U-271

German submarine "U-271" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 21 October 1941 at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen-Vegesack as 'werk' 36, launched on 29 July 1942 and commissioned on 22 September under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Curt Barleben. After training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla, "U-271" was transferred to the 1st U-boat Flotilla, for front-line service from 1 June 1943.
"U-271" sank no ships in her short career. She was a member of two wolfpacks.
Service career.
1st patrol.
The boat's initial foray started and finished in Lorient in occupied France. It was relatively uneventful.
2nd patrol.
It was a different story on her second patrol. While serving as a 'Flak' boat, "U-271" was attacked by two TBM Avengers from the USS "Core" on 21 October 1943. One man died.
She was also attacked by a B-24 Liberator on 24 June south southeast of Cape Finisterre. The aircraft was shot down. The submarine sustained some damage.
3rd patrol and loss.
"U-271" set off from Brest for the last time on 12 January 1944. On the 28th she was attacked and sunk west of Limerick in Ireland by an American Liberator.

Anne Gallagher

Anne Therese Gallagher AO is an Australian born lawyer, practitioner and scholar. She is considered to be an international authority on human rights and gender issues and, according to the 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report prepared by the United States Department of State, ‘the leading global expert on the international law on human trafficking’.
Education.
As an undergraduate Gallagher studied at Macquarie University, Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (Political Science and International Relations) in 1984 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1987. She completed a Master of International Law at the Australian National University in 1991. In 2006 Gallagher obtained a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Utrecht, Netherlands.
Career history.
Gallagher was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1988 and as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court of Australia in 1988 and of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in 1990.
From 1990 to 1992 Gallagher was a lecturer in the Australian National University's Graduate International Law Program.
She is a former United Nations Official (1992–2003) and was Adviser to Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, from 1998 to 2002. During her tenure as Adviser, Gallagher represented Mary Robinson at the negotiations for the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime as well as its protocols on trafficking and migrant smuggling. In 2001–2002 she led the development of the United Nations "Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking" and during that same period was the founding Chair of the United Nations Inter-Agency Group on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling.
Since 2003, Gallagher has led a high profile and sensitive regional development initiative, funded by the Australian Government Aid Agency AusAID, aimed at strengthening legislative and criminal justice responses to trafficking in persons and related exploitation in all ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Member States. The US State Department cited Gallagher's contribution to this Project, which they note has been ‘widely acclaimed for its positive impact on laws, policies and practices within and outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region’. The ASEAN Secretary-General, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, also noted Gallagher's contribution, stating that: ‘Dr Gallagher's expertise in this field, particularly in the area of criminal justice responses to trafficking, is recognised and deeply appreciated throughout the ASEAN region. … It is not wrong to say that the achievements that ASEAN, as a region, is enjoying in the criminal justice response to the heinous crime of trafficking are in no small part due to Dr Gallagher’s persevering efforts and her compassion towards ASEAN.'
Gallagher is also an independent, self-funded scholar with a compelling research and publications record on areas related to human rights, criminal justice and the rule of law, and the international law on human trafficking. In addition to numerous articles in major journals, including the International Criminal Justice Review, Human Rights Quarterly, Virginia Journal of International Law and the Anti-Trafficking Review, Gallagher is the author of "The International Law of Human Trafficking" published by Cambridge University Press and awarded the 2011 American Society of International Law Certificate of Merit – Honorable Mention.
A frequent panellist, expert and rapporteur at international and national governmental and non-governmental consultations, meetings, workshops and other fora, Gallagher has also been invited to be a guest speaker and lecturer at universities around the world, and commented for, or cited by, media.
Gallagher continues to work for the United Nations as a consultant and adviser. Recent major outputs include the commentary to the United Nations "Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking" and the United Nations Office on drugs and Crime Issue Paper, "Abuse of a position of vulnerability and other “means” within the definition of trafficking in persons".
Recognition and Awards.
Gallagher was recipient of the Anti-Slavery Australia Freedom Award in 2011. In June 2012 she was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), that country's second-highest civic honour. This appointment was made for her: ‘distinguished service to the law, and to human rights, as a practitioner, teacher and scholar, particularly in the areas of human trafficking responses and criminal justice.’ Also in June 2012, she was named a “2012 TIP Report Hero” by the United States Government for her work in the global fight against human trafficking.
Anne Gallagher is a 2013 Australian National University Alumni Award recipient - joint Alumnus of the Year.

Dorothy Rabinowitz of "The Wall Street Journal" observed that the show is more relevant than ever given recent world events, and proclaimed that "Television's best drama series is, in short, back with all that was delectable about season one on vivid display again—first-class writing, sterling performances, rocketing suspense".
David Wiegand of the "San Francisco Chronicle" felt that Season 2 delivered on extremely high expectations and maintained the show's level of writing, acting, and tension.
"TV Guide"s Matt Roush praised the "powerhouse performances" by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, as well as the relentless pace of the writing.
"USA Today"s Robert Bianco gave the season a 4/4 score, calling it "unmissable TV", and said that even with the expertly crafted plot, Homeland's biggest strength is in its characters.
Brian Lowry of "Variety" wrote a positive review, noting that there are some plot points that strain plausibility, but that "once the narrative begins hitting its stride in the second episode, it's clear the program remains on a rarefied creative tier".

Claire Danes and Damian Lewis each won for Best Performance in a Television Series – Drama, with Mandy Patinkin receiving a nomination for Best Supporting Performance in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.

Reception.
Interviews and presentations.
Acemoglu was interviewed on the "EconTalk" podcast by host Russ Roberts about the book in March 2012.
Robinson presented the main ideas of the book at the RSA.
Positive reviews.
Warren Bass reviewed the book for the "Washington Post", writing: "It’s bracing, garrulous, wildly ambitious and ultimately hopeful. It may, in fact, be a bit of a masterpiece."
Development economist Paul Collier reviewed the book for "The Guardian". He concluded his review by writing: "A thesis can be summarised, albeit crudely, in a short review. Yet the main strength of this book is beyond the power of summary: it is packed, from beginning to end, with historical vignettes that are both erudite and fascinating. As Jared Diamond says on the cover: "It will make you a spellbinder at parties." But it will also make you think."
Thomas Friedman reviewed the book for the "New York Times", concluding his review by writing: "We can only be a force multiplier. Where you have grass-roots movements that want to build inclusive institutions, we can enhance them. But we can’t create or substitute for them. Worse, in Afghanistan and many Arab states, our policies have often discouraged grass-roots from emerging by our siding with convenient strongmen. So there’s nothing to multiply. If you multiply zero by 100, you still get zero. [...] Acemoglu worries that our huge growth in economic inequality is undermining the inclusiveness of America’s institutions, too. [...] When one person can write a check to finance your whole campaign, how inclusive will you be as an elected official to listen to competing voices?"
Peter Forbes reviewed the book for "The Independent", writing: "This book, by two US economists, comes garlanded with praise by its obvious forebears – Jared Diamond, Ian Morris, Niall Ferguson, Charles C. Mann – and succeeds in making great sense of the history of the modern era, from the voyages of discovery to the present day."
Mixed and negative reviews.
The negative reviews of the book focused on the following lines of criticism:

Some of her important works in English are "Movement in Stone", which looks at early Chola temples and the influence of Pallava art prior to the 9th and 10th centuries; and, "Yoga for Living" (1996), a contemporary look at the direction of India.
"Vasaveswaram" is one of her works which focused on women and dealt with issues faced by them in the society. Krithika has also authored books on Hindu Epics such as Ramayana.
Her written correspondence with Chitti which spanned over 30 years have been brought together and published in the form of a book titled "Lettered Dialogue" by K. R. A. Narasaiah, a relative of Chitti.

Chibisov in the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow he predicted the spectrum of inhomogeneities in the Universe, which are originated from the initial quantum fluctuations. The numerous experiments in which there were measured the temperature fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation are in excellent agreement with this theoretical prediction, thus confirming that the galaxies and their clusters originated from the initial quantum fluctuations. Later on V. Mukhanov proved that the results, he obtained with G. Chibisov in 1981, are of the generic origin and he has developed the general consistent quantum cosmological perturbation theory.

Henbury Hall, Cheshire

Henbury Hall is a country house located about to the southwest of the village of Henbury, Cheshire, England. The present house was built in the 1980s in Neo-Palladian style, its design being based on Palladio's Villa Rotonda.
History.
A hall known as Henbury Hall existed in the area in the 1600s.
A Neoclassical style hall was built on the present site in 1742. It was sold by Sir William Meredith to John Bower Jodrell in 1779 for £24,000 and passed on to his son Francis Bower Jodrell in 1796. John Charles Ryle, the banker and MP for Macclesfield, bought it in 1835 for £54,000 and sold it following his bankruptcy to Thomas Marsland, first MP for Stockport (1776–1854) in 1842. The hall was remodelled in a more severe Neoclassical style in the early part of the 19th century, and then stuccoed and drastically reduced in size in the 1850s. The estate passed to his grandson Edward Marsland (died 1857) whose widow Jane Marsland was forced to sell after a disastrous flood in 1872.
It was bought for £9000 and extensively remodelled by local silk manufacturer Thomas Unett Brocklehurst. In 1876 Brocklehurst reputedly imported a pair of grey squirrels from America and released them into the estate with ultimately disastrous results for the native red squirrel. The Brocklehurst family remained in residence at Henbury for several generations.
In 1957 the estate was bought by Sir Vincent de Ferranti. He demolished the existing house and commissioned the architect Harry Fairhurst to convert the stable block for his own residential use. After the death of Sir Vincent in 1980, his son Sebastian and the designer Felix Kelly, who had already been involved with some work on the Henbury estate, came up with the idea of creating a house in the style of a Palladian temple. Kelly executed an oil painting based on Villa Rotondo, a house near Vicenza built in 1552 and designed by Andrea Palladio. Sebastian then commissioned the architect Julian Bicknell to create a design similar to Kelly's painting. The new building was completed in 1986. Sebastian lives there with his wife Gillian.
Architecture.
Exterior.
Henbury Hall is constructed in brick and concrete which is faced with limestone from northeast France, with the roof in local stone. The dome is in lead, with a lantern in gunmetal and gilded copper. It has a plan of square, with four-way symmetry. There is a rusticated basement, and an Ionic portico on each side. A stairway leads up to the south front. Within each portico is a Venetian window. Life-size statues by Simon Verity stand on the pediments. Topping the house is a dome surmounted by a lantern.
Interior.
The dining and drawing rooms are on the ground floor (the "piano nobile"), on the east and west sides of a central great hall which is open to the dome, with smaller rooms in the corners. In the basement is a central hall surrounded by kitchens and accommodation for the staff. The upper floor has a gallery overlooking the great hall, with six bedrooms with bathrooms and dressing rooms. The great hall has a floor of English limestone and Purbeck marble. The internal decoration is by David Mlinaric, with carving of the doorcases by Dick Reid of York.
Comparison.
Although Henbury Hall is based on the Villa Rotonda, there are significant differences. The major difference is that it has a smaller plan, with porticos of four rather than six columns. Venetian windows have been inserted behind the porticos. The entrance is at basement, rather than at "piano nobile", level, and the profile of the dome is higher.

Kulb

Kulb is a village on the Nile in northern Sudan. It has been inhabited since the time of the Christian kingdom of Makuria. Until the 15th century, it was in a remote area, serving as a retreat for Christians in Nubia. The domed Kulubnarti church, located on Kulubnarti (Kulb Island), is the only known example of a Christian center plan building in Lower Nubia.
Geography.
Kulb is located about south of Wadi Halfa, and just north of the Dal Cataract, which is situated between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts. There are two districts, one on the left (west) and another on the right (east) banks of the Nile, called Kulb West and East Kulb accordingly. Between them lies the long island of Kulubnarti. Kulb is situated in the stony Batn-El-Hajar region and is characterized as being a craggy and barren rocky area.
History.
In ancient Egyptian times, Kulb was the southernmost point for metal miners who searched for copper ore and gold for the Pharaohs. During the 4th and 5th Dynasty, the Egyptians quarried from the northern Wadi Allaqi large amounts of copper, leaving rock inscriptions naming Kulb by two officials, "Overseer of the metal detector" (LMY-r smntyw) and a "scribe of the metal detector" (SŠ smntyw). They were apparently responsible for the collection of gold, as their titles indicate that the search for raw materials in Nubia was organized as a state enterprise. From the Roman period, the granite mountains of the Batn-El-Hajar separated the area culturally from the Egyptian influenced Upper Nubia. Kulubnarti has been inhabited since about 1100 AD. It was used until the end of the Christian kingdom of Makuria as a retreat for Christians in Nubia. A fortress on the island may have existed even before that time.
Excavations.
The first sketches of the domed church were made in the beginning of the 20th century by the English Egyptologist Somers Clarke, who published his findings in 1912 in "Christian Antiquities in the Nile Valley". The domed church was excavated in early 1968 under the direction of James Knudstad. In March 1964, the island was examined and surveyed by Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann, Erich Dinkler, Peter Grossman, and other members of the German Archaeological Institute Cairo. In 1969 and 1979, William Adams Yewdale led the University of Kentucky team in extensive excavations on the island and on the adjacent mainland. In January–February 1967, Dinkler and Grossman excavated in the southern area of the Batn-El-Hajar. This was followed in the years 1968 and 1969 with two excavation campaigns at Kulb, and on the two northern islands of Sunnarti and Turmuki. It was during this excavation that the perimeter wall of the Kulb fort and some building remains were located. Excavations in the area of research showed evidence of prehistoric culture of the A-group to the Islamic period.

Ryan Tuerck

Ryan Tuerck (born April 10, 1985), is an American professional drifting driver from Derry, New Hampshire who currently competes in the U.S. Formula Drift series in his Portland Speed Industries built 2013 Scion FR-S for Retaks Backpacks and Maxxis Tires.
History.
For as long as he can remember, Ryan has loved Extreme Sports, and at a young age he became interested in BMX and Motocross. At the age of nine, his father bought him his first dirt bike, and by ten years old he started racing motocross. As he progressed through the ranks of amateur motocross he had countless podium finishes. The highlight of Tuerck’s amateur career was placing 7th in the nation, at Lorreta Lynn’s Amateur Nationals. At 16, he received his professional license from the American Motocross Association (AMA), and by 17, Ryan earned the opportunity to travel Canada, to race in the professional Canadian Nationals. Some of the highlights of his professional career included, placing 5th in the 125cc Canadian Nationals Championship, as well as qualifying for Budds Creek, and Unadilla in the AMA Motocross Nationals. Though Ryan’s motocross career looked promising, he was forced to stop due to personal reasons.
Ryan was gaining a lot of interest in cars since he turned 16. When he stopped racing, he bought his first car, a 1990 Ford Mustang. At night, feeling the need to challenge himself he would get his car sideways pulling out of stop signs and slide around in empty parking lots near his home. After having the Mustang for a year, Ryan found out on the internet that sliding your car around or “Drifting” was actually a real sport. Ryan immediately sold his Mustang to buy a lighter, and better handling Nissan 240sx. He upgraded the suspension and bought a 2-way LSD for the car to help it drift. In 2003, Ryan went to his first formal event at Raceway Park in Englishtown, NJ where he met future “Drift Alliance” teammates Tony Angelo, Chris Forsberg, and Vaughn Gittin Jr. Ryan did very well at first winning the competition. Ryan continued to do very well everywhere he went and constantly spending all his money upgrading his car.
Before joining Formula D, he completed successfully in Drift Mania Canadian Championship. In 2005, Ryan Competed in Two Rounds or Formula Drift where he did well enough to get noticed by a few sponsors. In 2006, Ryan competed in the entire Formula Drift series with help from his Drift Alliance brothers, Cooper Tires, Discount Tire, and 240sxMotoring. Ryan did exceptional in his rookie season with a 6th place finish at the Sonoma round. In 2007, Ryan moved to California with his Drift Alliance Teammate Tony Angelo and started “Team Snakebite” together and ran the whole Formula Drift season independently with help from sponsors which resulted in Ryan finishing the season 15th in points. In 2008, Ryan was picked up by Gardella Racing and drove a 2007 Pontiac Solstice GXP sponsored by Gardella Racing, Mobil 1, GM Racing, and Maxxis Tires. Following in 2009, Ryan won first place on podium in Round 1 at Long Beach and again later in the year at Irwindale and in 2010 came 3rd in series points. In 2011, Gardella retired the Soltice from Ryan, picked up Red Bull as a lead sponsor and drove the 2011 Mobil 1/Red Bull Chevrolet Camaro in which he finished 15th that year. The 2012 season began with a shuffle of sponsorships, Ryan left Gardella Racing for personal reasons, and was picked up by Retaks before the first event at long beach. He finished off the season in fifth after a third place finish at Irwindale.
Ryan is also in part of a missile drifting group (along with many of his drift alliance brothers) based out of Englishtown, NJ called "Blood Masters".
Currently in drifting.
As of November 28, 2012, Ryan stars in his own internet show "Tuerck'd" of which focuses on exhibition drifting and challenges with other professionals. Tuerck'd is aired on Network A every two weeks and is current on a second season.
Ryan now drifts a 2013 Scion FR-S, built by Portland Speed Industries, in Formula D for the 2013 season.

Kleč, Semič

Kleč (; in older sources also "Kleče", , also "Kletsch bei Stockendorf") is a remote former settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Planina.
Name.
The origin of the name "Kleč" is uncertain. Snoj observes that settlements named "Kleč(e)" generally lie along rivers and he connects this with the Slovene common noun "kleč" 'sandy or gravely river bank; gravely area covered with thin soil', referring to the local geology. Bezlaj also mentions the possibility of derivation from *"klękъ" 'small branching hills'. Another possibility is that it is derived from "kleč" with the meaning 'cliff'. Petschauer suggests that the name is derived from "klet" with the meaning 'shed, shack'.
History.
Kleč was a Gottschee German village. It was one of the more recent Gottschee settlements, founded after 1558 in a group of about 25 new settlements. In the land registry of 1574 the settlement had two full farms divided into four half-farms plus an additional eighth-farm, corresponding to a population between 25 and 30. In 1770 there were 11 houses in the settlement. Its population peaked at 53 in 1890, followed by a decline due to large-scale emigration to the United States. In 1931 the village included six houses and a population of 29. Before the Second World War, the economy of the village was based on raising animals, growing grapes, and selling wooden ware, logs, and firewood. The original residents were evicted on 25 November 1941. Italian troops burned the village during the Rog Offensive on 26 August 1942 and it was not rebuilt after the war. There was a Partisan camp for some time in the forest below Kleč. A Partisan field hospital operated here in the fall of 1943. A hunter's house was built at the site in the 1950s. The entire former village site is registered as cultural heritage.
Church.
A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Anthony the Great stood southwest of the village. It dated to the end of the 17th century. A 1741 visitation record reported that it was dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua. The church was destroyed after the Second World War. Two of its bells were sold to the church in Jugorje pri Metliki and a smaller bell was stolen. The clock was taken to Štrekljevec. The furnishings of the church were looted, and its building stones were crushed and used to repair the roads. Visible remnants of the church include part of the wall from the altar area and the floor, some remnants of cast-iron grave markers, and a small statue of a saint preserved in a niche.

Rotherham by-election, 1899

The Rotherham by-election, 1899 was a parliamentary by-election held on 23 February 1899 for the House of Commons constituency of Rotherham in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
Vacancy.
The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Liberal MP, the Rt. Hon. Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, fearful of a breakdown in his health and following the death of his father in 1898.
Candidates.
Liberals.
Acland’s possible resignation had been spoken of publicly since the summer of 1898 and the local Liberal Association had met in July of that year to discuss the implications. They were reluctant to lose Acland as their MP in view of his standing and record in politics and government but a formal request to him to reconsider his decision to stand down made by Rotherham Liberals fell on deaf ears. 
However, Acland was willing to delay his resignation to enable the local party to find a suitable replacement and the search began at the end of July. Their choice was William Henry Holland, a 49-year-old textile manufacturer, originally from Manchester where he had had a successful career in local government having been an Alderman on Manchester City Council. He was also formerly MP for Salford North.
Conservatives.
Rotherham was considered a safe Liberal seat. It had been represented by Acland for the Liberals since its creation for the 1885 general election and Acland had always enjoyed comfortable majorities. In fact at the two elections preceding the by-election, a by-election in 1892 when he had to resign on appointment as Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education, and the 1895 general election, Acland had been returned unopposed. This time however, with the prospect of facing a new candidate, the Conservatives chose to fight. They selected a barrister from York, R H Vernon Wragge, to be their man.
The campaign.
Holland relied heavily on the personal support of the former MP. Acland, although too unwell to campaign on the ground, sent letters of support praising Holland as worthy of the confidence of Liberals and Radicals in Rotherham. Holland also obtained the backing of the local Irish community in view of his support for the question of Irish Home Rule.
Wragge leant on the record of the Unionist government and the support by telegram of the prime minister. He also enlisted a number of local MPs and peers to support him at his meetings in the constituency.
The result.
Holland held the seat for the Liberal Party with nearly 60% of the poll but with a reduced majority on the last contested election, the 1892 general election. However, the Liberals had been victorious in the country in 1892 and the same tide could not be said to be running through the nation in 1899. In addition Holland was previously unknown in the constituency and was replacing a popular local MP.

Ralph Douglas Stacey

Ralph Douglas Stacey (born 10 September 1942 in Johannesburg) is Professor of Management at Hertfordshire Business School, University of Hertfordshire, in the UK and one of the pioneers of enquiring into the implications of the natural sciences of complexity for understanding human organisations and their management. He is best known for his writings on the theory of organisations as complex responsive processes of relating.
Biography.
Ralph Douglas Stacey was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 10 September 1942 to Jack, an English immigrant, and Auriel, a South African of Scottish descent. His father was a welder in the steel industry and his mother was a housewife. He completed school at Jeppe High School for Boys in 1960 and was awarded an NCR Scholarship to study at the University of the Witwatersrand where he pursued the degree of Bachelor of Commerce specialising in law subjects. He had the intention of going on to study further to become a lawyer but in the course of his studies he developed a greater interest in economics. He won the McBride Scholarship to the London School of Economics which enabled him to travel to London in 1964 and complete a Master of Science degree in 1965. This was followed by a PhD which he completed in 1967; the research topic was the construction and estimation of econometric models intended to predict patterns of industrial development.
In 1968, he returned to South Africa where he taught applied economics at the University of the Witwatersrand for two years after which he moved permanently to the United Kingdom where he has lived ever since 1970. He took a post in the Commercial Assessment Department of the British Steel Corporation where his main task was forecasting the demand for and prices of a range of steel products. In 1972 he moved to the Corporate Planning Department of the international construction company, John Laing, where he eventually became the manager of the department. He left in 1984 to become an investment analyst at what was to become an investment bank and then in 1985 moved briefly to a management consultancy before taking a position as Senior Lecturer at Hatfield Polytechnic. This organisation became the University of Hertfordshire in 1992 and in the same year Stacey was appointed Professor of Management, a position which he still holds.
He published his first book in 1990 which was on his experience of doing strategic planning and this was followed in 1991 by the first of his books, The Chaos Frontier, which sought to explore the implications of the complexity sciences for management and organisations. Then in 1993, he published "Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics", a textbook which located complexity thinking about strategy and organisations in the wider strategy literature. The textbook is now in its 6th edition. The year 1996 saw the publication of his book "Complexity and Organisational Creativity". In the meantime he had embarked on the training programme of the Institute of Group Analysis in London, qualifying as a group psychotherapist in 1998 and becoming a member of that Institute and of the Group Analytic Society. He ran clinical therapy groups at a local hospital until about 2004. Also in 1995 he set up a group supervision of PhD students and it was through this activity that he met Patricia Shaw and Doug Griffin as their PhD supervisor. They became friends and colleagues and together they developed the theory of complex responsive processes of relating as a way of understanding human organisations and their management. The collaboration between the three had a major impact on what Stacey was writing so that there is a radical shift in his way of thinking from a systemic approach prior to 2000 to a responsive processes approach in 2000 and thereafter. Together, in 1995, they set up the Complexity and Management Centre as a research centre at Hertfordshire University with Stacey as its director. Also in 2000, Stacey, Griffin and Shaw established the Doctor of Management programme at Hertfordshire Business School and Stacey took the role of its director until 2011 when he was succeeded by Professor Chris Mowles, although he continues his involvement as research supervisor. The programme is still running and has produced 58 graduates from many different countries.
Work.
There are two phases in the work of Stacey but the driving questions remain the same in both of these phases. Having been educated in econometrics and having spent years in the corporate planning functions of commercial enterprises his driving questions had to do with why leaders, policymakers and managers in all organisations are so bad at forecasting the consequences of their actions and why, given the frequently surprising and often unwanted consequences of their actions, they carry on with strategic planning processes. If they do not accomplish what they accomplish through their plans then what is it that they are actually doing to accomplish what they accomplish? These questions made it natural for Stacey to respond to the emerging complexity sciences. During the first systemic phase of his work he applied first chaos theory and then the models of complex adaptive systems to organisations and management arguing that organisations are complex adaptive systems and that the patterns in the actions of organisations, which are their strategies, emerge unpredictably in self organising processes. Leaders, policymakers and managers are bad at forecasting because it is impossible to predict the consequences of actions, a conclusion supported by the complexity sciences. Management is not the rational, analytical decision-making it is made out to be but a fundamentally political process. In an attempt to integrate mainstream management theories with the notion of organisations as complex adaptive systems he presented a diagram which expresses a contingency theory of organisations in which the appropriate forms of decision-making and control depend upon the nature of the change situations faced. This diagram became known as the Stacey Matrix and has been frequently adapted by other writers, often in ways not consistent with Stacey’s original.
However, in moving to the second, responsive processes phase, of his work he dropped the diagram and now argues against its use because it is easily interpreted in a way that collapses the paradox of certainty and uncertainty and so sustains the dominant discourse on management while using an alternative jargon of complexity. The second phase of Stacey’s work reflects collaboration with Doug Griffin and Patricia Shaw. This phase drops the application of complex adaptive systems to organisations, arguing that it is invalid to simply apply the natural sciences to human action. Instead, the complexity sciences are regarded as a source domain for analogies and when these analogies are transferred to the domain of human action they need to be interpreted in a manner that takes full account of the attributes of human agents, namely, that they are conscious, self-conscious, emotional, often spontaneous, often thoughtful and reflective beings who have some degree of choice over what they do. Human agents are basically interdependent, they respond to each other and their choices and intentions play into each other producing unpredictable, emergent patterns over time. To signal the move from the domain of the natural sickness to the domain of human action, Stacey and colleagues refer to these processes as "complex responsive processes of relating". These responsive processes take the form of:
It is in these local responsive processes that there emerge population-wide patterns of activity, culture and habitus. Organisational life is thought of as the game people are invested in and organising processes are understood to be the ordinary politics of everyday life.

Allied Rugby Conference

The Allied Rugby Conference (ARC) is an annual rugby union competition played among universities in the South Central United States. ARC features a spring 15s competition and a fall 7s competition.
Member schools.
Notes:
Founding and early success.
The formation of the Allied Rugby Conference was announced in May 2012. 
The Allied Rugby Conference was formed with three schools from the D1-AA Southwest Conference (Texas, Baylor, Sam Houston State), two schools from the D1-A Mid-South Conference (Oklahoma, Texas A&M), and one school from D2 (Texas Tech). 
The formation of this new conference was part of the trend in college rugby of regrouping into traditional conferences to take advantage of existing brands and rivalries. Another goal behind forming the ARC was to assist clubs to reach their maximum potential and raise the standard of rugby throughout the region. The conference also formed to establish a core group of name-recognizable institutions to market for sponsorship & recruitment on the collective college campuses.
Before the Conference had even begun play, they had already secured sponsorship from the World Rugby Shop, and the Allied conference also secured a sponsorship with Gilbert. The ARC was formed to get the teams significant exposure from a marketing and brand perspective. Games are podcast and in some instances live web cast. The ARC webcasts a conference "game of the week" each Monday during the spring 2012 competition.
Leadership.
Johnny Smith is the Executive Director of the conference. Craig Coates in the interim Competitions Director.
Competitions.
The ARC announced a desire to pursue a bowl game type of event, which would involved playing matches against teams from neighboring conferences.

Nathan Mileikowsky

Rabbi Nathan Mileikowsky (August 15, 1879 - February 4, 1935) was a rabbi, educator, writer and prominent Zionist activist. Mileikowsky's grandson is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Biography.
Mileikowsky was born in 1879 in Kreva, Lithuania (today located in Belarus), which at that time was part of the Pale of Settlement region of Imperial Russia in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed. Mileikowsky's father, Zvi, made a living from leasing an agricultural estate in a nearby village. At the age of 10 Mileikowsky was sent to the Volozhin yeshiva, where he spent eight years and was ordained.
Already while Mileikowsky attended yeshiva he began to make speeches and lectures and was in contact with the Zionist activist Yehuda Zvi Ibzarov who encouraged him to engage in this field. At the age of 20 Mileikowsky began promoting Zionism in the Siberia region, following a request to do so by the Zionist leader Yechiel Chlenov. In the following years Mileikowsky continued to engage in Zionist propaganda and in addition gave speeches against the "Bund" movement and against other socialist Jewish anti-Zionist movements. During the sixth Zionist Congress Mileikowsky was among the opponents of the "Uganda Programme, despite belonging to the Theodor Herzl camp.
In 1908 Mileikowsky moved to Poland and became the director of the Hebrew Gymnasium of Mordechai Yaakov Krinsky in Warsaw, while he continuing to promoting Zionism in Poland. He went through hundreds of towns and was considered one of the most popular Zionist speakers. In 1912 Mileikowsky moved to Lodz, and served as a Maggid in the Zionist synagogue "Beth Jacob". he used to deliver his sermons in Hebrew, a practice which was not common at that time. In 1913 the Hebrew newspaper Ha-Tsefirah reported about a major event held in Lodz which was organized by the members of the Mizrachi movement. The report mentioned also the "excellent speech" made by Rabbi Mileikowsky, which was carried partly in Hebrew and partly in Yiddish. According to his son, Benzion Netanyahu, the Mileikowsky family was one of the few families in the world who spoke Hebrew at that time. In 1914 Mileikowsky was appointed rabbi of the city Rivne, but following World War I he remained with his family in Lodz.
By 1920 Mileikowsky immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and became the director of the school "Vilkomitz" in Rosh Pina. During this period he published various articles in the Hebrew press which promoted the Jewish settlement of the Galilee region.
On some of the articles he published he signed under the name "Netanyahu", a surname which his sons adopted.
In 1924 he moved with his family to Jerusalem, and during that same year he traveled to England on behalf of Menachem Ussishkin in order to raise funds for the Jewish National Fund and Keren Hayesod. Following the success of these campaigns he was sent to the United States on behalf of the Jewish National Fund. Mileikowsky's numerous speeches made a strong impression on the American Jewish community. In 1926, the newspaper "Dos Yiddishe Folk" reported that the American Zionist Rabbi Mileikowsky lectured in 700 lectures through nine months. Once a year Mileikowsky used to visit Israel. In 1928 Mileikowsky published several of his speeches in the book "Nation and State" (Hebrew: עם ומדינה).
On the eve of the 1929 Palestine riots Mileikowsky returned to Israel, purchased land in Herzliya in which he built up a farm, and in addition he was active in the Hitahdut HaIkarim settlement movement for private farmers.
After the assassination of Haim Arlosoroff in 1933 Rabbi Mileikowsky, whom was affiliated with the Revisionist movement, took part in the establishment of a public committee, headed by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook which protected those accused of Arlosoroff's assassination - namely, Zvi Rosenblatt and Abraham Stavsky.
Rabbi Mileikowsky died in Jerusalem in February 4, 1935 and was buried in the Mount of Olives Cemetery. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook referred to Mileikowsky in his eulogy as a "divine speaker".
The square most adjacent to Israel's national cemetery in Mount Herzl is named after Nathan Mileikowsky.
Family.
Nathan and his wife Sarah Mileikowsky (née Lurie) had nine children, including: Benzion Netanyahu (the father of Iddo, Yonatan and Benjamin Netanyahu) and Elisha Netanyahu (the husband of Shoshana Netanyahu and the father of Nathan Netanyahu).

Donald Locke

Donald Cuthbert Locke (17 September 1930 – 6 December 2010) was a Guyanese artist who created drawings, paintings and sculptures in a variety of media.
He studied in the United Kingdom, and worked in Guyana and the United Kingdom before moving to the United States in 1979.
He spent his last twenty years, perhaps the most productive and innovative period, in Atlanta, Georgia. His eldest son is British sculptor Hew Locke.
Biography.
Birth and early education.
Donald Locke was born on 17 September 1930 in Stewartville, Demerara County, Guyana.
His father, also Donald Locke, was a skilled carpenter who made furniture and his mother, Ivy Mae ("née" Harper), was a primary school teacher.
The family moved to Georgetown in 1938, where Locke attended the Bourda Roman Catholic School and then the Smith’s Church Congregational School.
He went on to the Progressive High School, graduating in 1946. 
He was accepted as a student at the Broad Street Government School, where he became increasingly interested in drawing.
In 1947 Locke attended a Working People's Art Class (WPAC) taught in Georgetown by the local artist Edward Rupert Burrowes.
This inspired him to take up painting.
Burrowes has often been called the "father of Guyanese art".
Writing about Burrowes in the 1966 Guyana Independence Issue of "New World", Locke describes how he was constantly engaged in "technical exploration", including making his own paints from unlikely ingredients and conducting experiments "with balata, buckram, tailor's canvas, rice bags, bitumen, concrete and ... clay mixed with molasses."
In 1950 Locke graduated with a Teacher's Certificate.
Locke became a regular contributor to the annual WPAC exhibitions, and for a while was secretary of WPAC, helping to organize exhibitions in different locations. In 1952 WPAC gave him the First Prize Gold Medal Award for his abstract painting "The Happy Family".
He was given a British Council art scholarship in 1954, the last such scholarship to be awarded in Guyana in this period, with which he was able to study ceramics at the Bath School of Art and Design at Corsham, England.
The Guyana Department of Education provided an additional scholarship that funded his third year at Corsham.
He was taught painting by William Scott and Bryan Wynter, pottery by James Tower and sculpture by Ken Armitage and Bernard Meadows.
He graduated in 1957 with a Teaching Certificate in Art Education.
Guyana and United Kingdom.
Returning to Georgetown in 1957, Locke began teaching art at Dolphin Government School and at WPAC.
In 1958 he married Leila Chaplin, a teacher whom he had met at Corsham.
He did not have normal potter's equipment, but was able to make and successfully fire large earthenware pots using an improvised kiln.
In 1959 the Guyanese government gave him a grant to study for a Master's degree in fine arts at Edinburgh College of Art, a school in the University of Edinburgh.
There he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the California Clay Movement to Britain.
For many years his work reflected their influence.
In 1962 Locke obtained a grant from Edinburgh University to go to Florence and Ravenna, where he undertook historical research 
He completed his graduate thesis in 1964 and returned to Georgetown to take a position as Art Master at Queen's College. 
He taught at Queen's College from 1964 until 1970.
He began painting due to lack of facilities for pottery.
In 1969 he obtained a British Council bursary that let him take leave from Queen's College and return to the Edinburgh College of Art for research in ceramic techniques.
In 1970, after a trip to Brazil sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he resigned from Queen's College and moved to London, where he obtained work teaching ceramics.
His work began to incorporate materials such as metal, wood, leather, fur and ceramics. 
He gained a growing recognition for his ceramic work, and in 1972 was invited to exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum in the "International Exhibition of Ceramics".
United States.
Locke visited the United States for the first time in 1976, as guest artist at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Montville, Maine.
In 1979 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Sculpture, and for a year was an artist in residence at Arizona State University.
His first of many bronze sculptures were cast by the Arizona Bronze Foundry in 1980.
He divorced and remarried around this time, and obtained permanent residency status in the United States.
In 1983 he moved to Phoenix, Arizona.
Locke lived in the southwest of the United States for eleven years. During this period he was the Arizona correspondent for "Artspace" magazine, 
for which he wrote a series of articles. He also wrote for the "Phoenix New Times" and for "Arts Magazine".
In 1989 he temporarily abandoned sculpture in favor of painting, and the next year moved to Atlanta, Georgia.
His paintings combined heavy paint, photographs, cloth, wood, metal and found objects mounted on canvas.
In 1992, with a five-year grant for a studio at the Nexus Contemporary Art Center, he returned to sculpture.
Locke taught part-time at Georgia State University and at the Atlanta College of Art, retiring from teaching in 1996.
He continued to write about art. Thus a review by Locke of the "Okiek Portraits" exhibition of photographs of Okiek people in traditional dress appeared in "Creative Loafing" of November 1997.
He contributed a weekly review to this paper for three years. 
He lived in Atlanta for the remainder of his life, with growing recognition from exhibitions of his work in the USA and Europe.
Locke was an outgoing person, with a generous character.
He enjoyed entertaining people at dinners where he did all the cooking.
He loved to talk about art, and was an interesting and engaging speaker.
He has been called "a larger-than-life personality and a wonderful storyteller, as influential in his conversation as he was with his art."
Donald Locke died at home in Atlanta on 6 December 2010.
He was survived by three children from his marriage with the artist Leila Locke: Corinne, Jonathan and Hew.
Hew Locke, born in Edinburgh, is also a well-known artist.
Work.
Locke's work was highly varied. Marianne Lambert, an Atlanta curator and art patron, said, "His expressiveness ran the gamut from frenzied drawings to the spare, clean lines of his sculptures." According to Carl Hazlewood of Newark, associate editor at "NKA, a Journal of Contemporary African Art", "Donald's art grew out of sophisticated European traditions acquired during his studies in Guyana and Great Britain, but it also was infused with the myths and poetic aspects of his Guyana homeland and its folklore."
A prolific artist throughout his life, his earlier modernist work was influenced by other schools.
He came into his own as a unique individual in Atlanta under the influence of local folk artists such as Thornton Dial.
Talking of the influence of the open savannah landscape of Guyana on Locke's early work, one writer said Locke was "concerned with the question of space as it confronts the artist: what to do with nothingness; how to lead the eye of the viewer into a vast expanse through the narrow frame of a single painting."
In the United Kingdom his best known work may be the paintings and sculptures in "The Plantation Series", described as "forms held in strict lines and grids, connected as if with chains or a series of bars, analogous he has said, to the system whereby one group of people are kept in economic and political subjugation by another."
A reviewer commenting on his work "Trophies of Empire 1, 1972–1974" said it "comprise robust disconnected forms that eerily echo the cultures and geographies he had experienced. Heavy metal vessels, solid wood forms and found objects are placed together creating awkward human effigies or challenging abstract assemblages. Their loaded erotic and sometimes violent symbolism bring to mind mournful memories from the past and issues related to slavery, identity and sovereignty. His are sombre images of the world that Locke straddled so boldly."
Exhibitions.
Locke was Guyana's representative at the 12th São Paulo Art Biennial in 1971.
Locke exhibited his "Two Sculptures from a Ritual Fertility Suite" in Hungary in 1975 at the "International Biennale of Sculpture". In 1976 he had his own show at the Roundhouse in London, and in 1977 his work was displayed in Nigeria at the FESTAC Exhibition. His "Trophies of Empire" was first displayed at the "Afro-Caribbean Art Exhibition" in 1978, and was shown again in "The Other Story" at the Hayward Gallery in 1989.
Locke's work and that of other Caribbean artists such as Aubrey Williams and Ronald Moody was featured in the influential 1989 show "The Other Story" at the Hayward Gallery in London, which helped increase public awareness of the quality of work of artists from the region.
The paintings of Sonia Boyce were also shown in this exhibition.
The critic Brian Sewell said that Locke's sculptures in "The Other Story" showed exquisite mastery and extraordinary ingenuity.
Locke went to Ecuador in 1994, where his work was shown in the exhibition "Current Identities" at the Cuenca Bienal of Painting, along with the work of other artists including Whitfield Lovell, Philemona Williamson, Emilio Cruz and Freddy Rodríguez. 
A 2002 exhibition at the Solomon Projects gallery in Atlanta featured rough wax sculptures that represented the sacred symbols of his Guyanese creole heritage.
In 2009 an exhibition of about fifty of his recent sculptures and paintings named "Pork Knocker Dreams" was staged in England. 
"Porkknocker" is the name given to gold prospectors in Guyana: Locke's father had prospected as a young man.
Locke exhibited in many other group and solo shows including São Paulo, Brazil; Medellín, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Faenza, Italy; Victoria and Albert Museum and Whitechapel Gallery in London, United Kingdom; Nottingham, United Kingdom; Aljira Center for Contemporary Art in Newark, New Jersey; Nexus Biennial and the Master Artist Series, Atlanta, Georgia; Studio Museum in Harlem, New York. His gallery shows included Nexus and City Gallery East in Atlanta and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tucson, Arizona.

German submarine U-276

German submarine "U-276" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 24 February 1942 at the "Bremer Vulkan" yard at Bremen-Vegesack as 'werk' 41. She was launched on 24 October and commissioned on 9 December under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Jürgen Thimme.
Service history.
"U-274" served with the 8th U-boat Flotilla for training from December 1942 to February 1944 and operationally with the 1st U-boat Flotilla from 1 March 1944. She was then reassigned to the 31st U-boat Flotilla on 1 July. She carried out three patrols, but sank no ships.
She was 'stricken' in September 1944 at Neustadt and used as a floating electrical generating plant. She was scuttled in May 1945.
She carried out short voyages between Kiel in Germany and Bergen and Trondheim in Norway over February and March 1944.
1st patrol.
The boat departed Trondheim on 22 March 1944 and returned to the Norwegian port fifteen days later on 6 April.
2nd patrol.
Her second sortie was relatively uneventful, apart from two crew members being wounded in an accident with the anti-aircraft gun.
3rd patrol.
By now the boat was based at Stavanger, from where she departed on 8 June 1944. She returned there on the 25th.
The submarine sailed back to Kiel in July 1944.
Fate.
The boat was 'stricken' at Neustadt on 29 September 1944 and re-employed as a floating electrical generator. On 3 May 1945, the U-boat was damaged in a rocket attack by four Hawker Typhoons of No. 175 Squadron RAF. As a result of the damage, she was scuttled later that same day.

Dr. King Charter School

Dr. King Charter School, also known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School for Science and Technology, is a K-12 charter school, in the Lower 9th Ward, in the 9th Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The school was named after Dr. Martin Luther King.
In the 2006-2007 school year King students attended the former Harney School, as King had been damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. At that time, over half of the 450 students attending Harney had attended King pre-Katrina. King, which re-opened in 2007, was the first Lower 9th Ward school to do so after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007 Doris Hicks, the principal, said that over 600 students registered to attend King in the 2007-2008 school year.
In 2009 Darren Simon of the "Times Picayune" said that Dr. King, "one of the city's higher performing schools without admission criteria," "is seen as a symbol of rebirth in the Lower 9th Ward."
A February 2009 State of Louisiana count of the school stated that the school had fewer than 5% special education students, below the 5% number recommended in a state board of education guideline and the 12.3 Recovery School District average. In June of that year Hicks said that the most recent figures sent to the state count the special education population at 6% and that the school is conservative in assigning students special education status, giving them after school tutoring and Saturday school to see if they improve, before labeling them as special education students. The State Authorized Oversight Committee recommended that the school's charter be renewed. In June 2009 the charter was renewed without a plan to increase the numbers of special education students.
In 2012 the school graduated its first senior class.
Student body.
As of 2011 the school had 782 students from Pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade.

Wedding Day at Troldhaugen

"Wedding Day at Troldhaugen" (Norwegian: ) is a musical piece composed by Edvard Grieg. It is the sixth piano piece in the eighth book of his "Lyric Pieces", bearing the opus number 65. There has been some discussion about the quality and proportion of this composition in relation to the whole book.
Description.
Originally called "" (The well-wishers are coming), it was written in 1896 as a memorial of the 25th wedding anniversary of Grieg and his wife Nina. The anniversary celebration had been held in the Fossli Hotel near the Vøringsfossen waterfall in June 1892. Grieg and his wife celebrated their wedding anniversary with Borre and Nancy Giertsen. Nancy was the sister of Marie Beyer, then married to Frants Beyer, Grieg's best friend. She belonged to their closest circle of friends at Troldhaugen. During the occasion a guest book was ready to take contributions from all the guests.
Grieg gave the work its final title in 1897 when he compiled Book VIII, Op. 65, of his "Lyric Pieces". The work's festive first section describes congratulations and best wishes that are given by the guests to the newlyweds; the second section is reflective and subdued.

Komolec

Komolec (; also "Komuc", , also "Komuzen", Gottscheerish: "Komüzə") is a settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. It no longer has any permanent residents.
Name.
There are various theories of the origin of the name "Komolec". According to Simonič, the name is derived from Slovene "komolec", referring to a hill with a steep slope or a rockfall (cf. also "komộłəc" 'hill' in Pleteršnik's dictionary). On the other hand, Petschauer cites a derivation from "Mölzen" 'place with many broken-off branches'. Komolec was also recorded as "Gomülcz", "Gomotzen", or "Prunndorf".
History.
Komolec was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. It was one of the oldest settlements on the Kočevje Rog Plateau, established after external colonization by German settlers had been completed around 1400. In the Kočevje land registry of 1574 Komolec had three full farms that were subdivided into six half-farms. In 1770 the village had 10 or 39 houses. The population of the settlement peaked in 1890, with 162 people living in 30 houses. Agricultural conditions were poor, with a few meadows and pastures, and the economy of the village was primarily based on forestry. The inhabitants were known for making wooden tubs and wagons. Before the Second World War, the settlement had 23 houses. The original residents were evicted on 23 and 24 November 1941. Italian troops quartered themselves in the abandoned houses on 17 July 1942, but were attacked there by Partisan forces the next day. Komolec was burned by Italian troops during the Rog Offensive in late August 1942, leaving only one house. A base and a warehouse for the staff of the 7th Partisan Corps was established here in 1944. The base was burned in April 1945 during German operations to secure the road from Kočevje. Until that time two Partisan hospitals (Mali Ajdovec and Veliki Ajdovec), established in October 1944, also operated in the area. In the 1950s, one house and two barns in Komolec were rebuilt for the needs of a collective farm. Four people were recorded living at the site in 1953 and 1961, but the site was then abandoned and the barns were torn down. A chapel shrine stood at the western edge of the village.

Biography.
Born in Alcamo, the Province of Trapani, Sicily, Di Donato started his career at Campobello di Mazara in 2005–06 Serie D. In mid-season he was signed by another southern Italy side Cosenza, also from Group I. He won 2007–08 Serie D Group I and back to professional league. 
Di Donato was spotted by another Calabria team Vigor Lamezia at the end of season and in July 2008 Serie A club Chievo signed him from Lamezia. Di Donato also remained in Lamezia Terme for 2008–09 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In June 2009, Chievo signed Luca Rigoni outright from Vicenza Calcio. However Chievo did not wish to pay anything to Vicenza. Instead, Vicenza signed Di Donato for an exponential €1 million and Rigoni joined Chievo for €1 million, which the same fee he left 1½ year ago. The deal was a pure financial trick than a logical sports decision.
On 1 August 2009 Di Donato was farmed to Valenzana along with Alessandro Lorello. However, Di Donato ran out of potential and only played 3 times. Di Donato had to play for the reserve in the second half of the season. On 1 July 2010 Di Donato returned to Vicenza and became a ghost player. Vicenza would suffered a great loss if write-down his flopped value immediately on 1 July 2010 (€800,000). Instead, Di Donato remained on the balance sheet (and balance sheet only) for another year. During 2011–12 season Vicenza finally write-down the contract value back dated to 1 July 2011 for €600,000.

Dagobert Frey

Dagobert Frey (Vienna, April 23, 1883 – May 13, 1962, Stuttgart) was an Austrian art historian, responsible for the theft of the most valuable European and Polish collections from the Warsaw and Kraków museums and national art galleries during the Nazi German occupation of Poland.
As professor in European art history from the "Osteuropa-Institut", Frey was wined and dined by the Polish art experts numerous times in late 1930s. He prepared a meticulous list of the most valuable paintings at the National Museum, Warsaw among other locations across Poland. He showed up at the Museum again in October 1939 with the Gestapo, after the capitulation of the Polish capital, and directed the "SS-Untersturmführer" Theo Daeisel to art pieces that needed to be seized and shipped to Germany first, including the "Portrait of a Young Man" by Rembrandt from the collections of the Łazienki Palace ("Pałac Łazienkowski"), and numerous other masterpieces including paintings by Bernardo Bellotto called "Canaletto". The items stolen from the National Museum included 99% of all coins, 100% of historic clocks, 80% jewellery, 63% fabrics, 60% furniture, and 70% ancient manuscripts. The Gestapo headquarters in Warsaw presented "the Rembrandt" as a gift to Hans Frank in occupied Kraków. Frey moved to Kraków the same month, along with his colleague from the SS, dr Joseph Mühlmann. Together, they pinpointed all sorts of treasures at Wawel (architectural detail notwithstanding), directing Frank in a mass looting campaign. On Frey's advice, even the fireplaces were ripped out from the walls. 
Career.
Frey studied architecture in Vienna at the "Technische Hochschule", and in 1911 obtained a job at the Austrian monument conservation bureau. In 1929 he published his controversial book about the Late Middle Ages and in 1931 moved to the Weimar Republic to teach art history in Breslau (Wrocław). After the invasion of Poland, he was selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a "Teutonic land" deliberately with no mention of Jews whatsoever. In 1941 he wrote his infamous book "Krakau" (German for Kraków) – denying this ancient Polish capital its Slavic origins. In 1942 he wrote a guide to the city of Lublin "without" Jews.
After the war, Frey moved back to Vienna and worked at the municipal office for the restoration of relics. In 1951 he moved to Stuttgart in southern Germany, where he obtained the position of professor at a local polytechnic.

The Landing Barge, Kitchen or LBK was a landing craft used to support amphibious landings in North Western Europe during and after the Normandy invasion in the Second World War. Its primary purpose was to provide hot meals to the crews of the many minor landing craft not fitted with galley facilities. Constructed of steel, this shallow-draft lighter had storage and serving space to feed 900 men for one week. The kitchen capacity was able to provide 1,600 hot meals and 800 cold meals a day.
Origins.
In early 1942, the Royal Navy found itself in need of much greater landing capacity in order to provide lift for the Allied 1942 and 1943 invasion plans; Round Up and Sledgehammer. The landing craft construction programme in Britain was incapable of providing sufficient craft so quickly, and US production had not yet come into full swing. Thames lighters were drafted into service to supplement the purpose-built landing craft. Thames lighters were known for their shallow draft and hold capacity, and they were soon fitted with some modest armour protection, engines, and ramps.
These landing barges were not intended for the initial assault, but to support the following build up.
Design.
Gordon Holman, referring to the Landing Barge, Kitchen as an LCK, described it as having "the appearance of a houseboat which somebody had attempted to turn into a factory. Chimneys, with square cowls on them, rose up from all parts of the vessel. But when the L.C.K. made smoke nobody complained.” The LBK was meant to be a floating kitchen. It had oil-fired ranges, automatic potato peelers, refrigerated meat lockers, four ovens in the aft end of its kitchen space, storage for bulk and perishable goods forward, and a 10 ton fresh water storage tank housed in the hold with additional fresh and sea water tanks above decks. It could hold sufficient provisions to feed 900 men for a week.
The LBK’s overall dimensions were 79 feet long, by 21 feet wide. The hull was built of steel (as was the superstructure), with a swim (overhanging) hull at bow and stern. It had all the proportions of a Thames lighter; a broad-beamed, shallow draft (3½ ft.), flat-bottom, and was generally built for wear and tear.
In a deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a blunt rounded prow directly behind which stood two hand winches and just further aft a hatch o the under-deck level. Within 20’ the hull had achieved its full width of 21’ The foremost section of the deckhouse contained the 17’6” servery area (approximately 16’ width), where the cooked food was portioned into containers for distribution. The middle section of the deckhouse was the 25’ the galley (approximately 16’ width). Accommodation for the one officer aft, over the engines. At deck level aft was the steering shelter which, along with the various fuel tanks, was provided with 2.5" plastic armour.
In a below deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a port and a starboard coal bunker, and then, on the portside, a ratings’ washroom. To starboard were two toilets or heads which, having no lower venting to the sea, required emptying by the crew. In the after section of the hull the two Chrysler 65 bhp “Royal” six-cylinder marine petrol engines gave the LBK a maximum speed of 6-7 knots. The estimated endurance was 300 miles at 5 knots on 600 gallons of petrol carried in tanks fitted in the after peak.
A total of ten vessels were fitted out as kitchen barges, while similar lighters were converted to oil (LBO), water (LBW), and engineering (LBE) barges to support the requirements of the small craft of the invasion fleet. 
Manning the LKB.
Soon after the initial campaigns of the war, the Royal Navy’s landing craft and barges were normally crewed by hostilities-only ratings, personnel of the Royal Naval Patrol Service, and officers and ratings of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). Approximately 43,500 hostilities-only and 5,500 RNVR officers and ratings crewed the various landing craft types in 1944. Of these, the Royal Canadian Navy provided 60 officers and 300 ratings, on the condition that they be formed into specifically Canadian companies. None of the LBKs were manned by RCN crews, however. The Royal Marines also provided landing craft crews, but also none crewed LBKs. Although some other Landing Barge types were manned by Royal Army Service Corps water transport units, all of the LBKs were manned by the Royal Navy personnel.
Crew complement was 24 or 25 men including the officer commanding. These officers were Midshipmen or Sub-Lieutenants. The ratings included thirteen cooks, nine seamen and three stokers. The senior cook might be a Chief Petty Officer, but, at the beginning of the Normandy invasion, the majority of the crews would not have had much sea experience. As the LBKs’ duties involved long periods moored, and the cooking staff were often fully employed making meals, the seamen were often drafted in as “spud bashers”.
Service History.
Landing Barge, Kitchens were present in all invasion areas in the Normandy landings.
storage and serving space for enough provisions to feed 900 men for one week. The kitchen capacity was able to provide 1,600 hot meals and 800 cold meals a day. The menu could include roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roast pork or cottage pie, cabbage or peas, and baked potatoes or roast potatoes, followed by stewed apples or other fruit and custard. These meals were placed in heat-retaining containers (insulated tin canisters) for dispatch to the crews of small craft. Also accompanying these containers would be one gallon "safari jars" (vacuum flasks) of soup, coffee, or tea. Among the craft thus supplied would be LCMs, special variants of the LCVP, and supply and repair barges. Larger craft would likely have galleys of their own and LCAs and LCVPs generally had mother ships where LC crews would be fed.
LBK also supported coastal and landing craft flotillas during the Battle of the Scheldt.

Prison Architect

Prison Architect is a construction and management simulation game by the British game developer Introversion Software. It was made available as a crowdfunded paid alpha pre-order on September 25, 2012 with updates scheduled every three to four weeks. With over 337,700 copies sold, "Prison Architect" made over $10.7 million in pre-order sales for the alpha version. "Prison Architect" was an entrant in the 2012 Independent Games Festival.
The game is available on Steam listed as Steam Early Access and a DRM free version although it is still in alpha. Updates are released monthly.
Gameplay.
The game is a top-down construction and management simulation where the player takes control of building and running a prison. The player is responsible for managing various aspects of their prison including building cells and facilities, planning and connecting utilities, hiring and assigning staff, including a warden, guards, workers, and more. The player needs to recruit staff to unlock more aspects of the game. The player is also responsible for the finance, and keeping their inmates content. The player's role is of both architect and governor with sandbox micromanagement themes such as choosing where to put lights, drains and how they connect together. The player is also able to add workshops to the prison as well as reform programs that reduce the specific prisoner's repeat-offender rate. The player tells the prisoners what to do indirectly by setting their schedule. The game takes inspiration from "Theme Hospital", "Dungeon Keeper" and "Dwarf Fortress".
Development.
The game was first made available on September 25, 2012 as an Alpha version. The game was then crowdfunded with pre-orders, making over US$ 270,000 in two weeks with close to 8,000 sales. Developer's co-founder Mark Morris explains that independent crowd-funding has allowed them to have no time limit on the Alpha version, as well as no fees associated with crowd-funding platforms. As of December 2013, the developers have raised over $9M. Since February the game has received 22 major updates, with the latest on June 27, 2014.

Withlacoochee Army Airfield

Withlacoochee Army Airfield and Withlacoochee Bombing & Gunnery Range, was a World War II United States Army Air Forces airfield, located east of Lacoochee, Florida. The airfield closed in 1945 and is now abandoned.
History.
The airfield was built about 1942 as part of the construction of Army Airfields in the Orlando area. It was built as an auxiliary to the Bushnell Army Airfield and Zephyrhills Army Airfield. Its primary mission was to support Chemical Weapons testing in the Bushnell area and as an emergency airfield for the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics fighter training school at Orlando Army Airbase.
In 1943 the Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, Mobile Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) Unit arrived at Bushnell AAF to begin experiments on both persistent and non-persistent chemical agents, setting up the Chemical Warfare Service Experimental Station. The Withlacoochee airfield was used by the CWS Unit as a landing strip for the planes used in the field trials at Withlacoochee Bombing & Gunnery Range. Several military herbicides for defoliation and crop destruction were tested at the airfield.
After World War II ended, the airstrip was abandoned and apparently has not been used ever since. Withlachoochee AAF has been the subject of several cleanup efforts aimed at removing any remaining traces of the chemical weapons previously tested at the site under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program.

Ghanaati

Ghanaati (foaled 28 March 2006) is an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from September 2008 and October 2009 she ran six times and won three races. After winning one minor race as a two-year-old she won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on her first appearance in 2009. She then won the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and was placed in both the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket before being retired at the end of the season.
Background.
Ghanaati is a "big, strong", dark-coated bay mare bred by her owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm at Lexington, Kentucky. Her dam, Sarayir won three races, and as a daughter of the mare Height of Fashion, was a sister of Nashwan, Unfuwain and Nayef. In addition to Ghanaati, Sarayir produced the Cumberland Lodge Stakes winner Mawatheeq. As a descendant of the 1000 Guineas winner Highclere, Ghanaati is also closely related to the Japanese champion Deep Impact. Ghanaati's sire, the 2000 European Horse of the Year Giant's Causeway has, as of 2012, sired the winners of more than 20 Group One/Grade I races and more than £5,000,000 in prize money. He was Leading sire in North America in 2009 and 2010.
Ghanaati was trained by Barry Hills at Lambourn and ridden in five of her six races by her trainer's son Richard. The filly's name is Arabic and means "my love".
Racing career.
Ghanaati began her racing career on the Polytrack surface at Kempton Park in the autumn of 2008. On her debut in September, she started slowly before finishing third in a seven furlong maiden race. Five weeks later, racing over the same course and distance, Ghanaati started 4/6 favourite for a similar event. After starting slowly again, she recovered to take the lead in the straight and drew clear to win very easily by six lengths.
Ghanaati did not race as a three-year-old before contesting the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 3 May. She was not considered a major contender and started at odds of 20/1 in a field fourteen fillies with Rainbow View being made the 8/11 favourite. Richard Hills positioned the filly among the leaders from the start before going to the front in the final quarter mile. Ghanaati quickly went clear and was not seriously challenged, winning by one and a half lengths from the Irish-trained Cuis Ghaire. The previously unbeaten Rainbow View finished fifth, with her connections claiming that she was unsuited by the exceptionally firm ground. The winning time of 1:34.22 was a record for the race and was 1.66 seconds faster than that recorded by Sea The Stars in the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance the previous day. Shortly after the race Barry Hills became seriously ill with blood poisoning and the day-to-day supervision of Ghanaati's training was taken on by his son Charlie Hills.
On 19 June Ghanaati was matched against the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Elusive Wave and the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Again in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ghanaati was made 2/1 favourite with Elusive Wave starting at 4/1. The race was an unusually rough one, with several collisions between the horses early in the straight. Ghanaati survived a bump two furlongs from the finish before taking the lead and winning comfortably by two lengths from Raggane. According to the Racing Post she was "never in danger" and "always in command" in the closing stages. Her winning time of 1:38.42 was a record for Ascot's round mile course. As her owner felt that she had little to prove against three-year-old fillies, Ghanaati was then tried against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July. She started 2/1 second favourite but was well beaten and finished third behind Rip Van Winkle and Paco Boy. After the race, Charlie Hills expressed the view that Ghanaati had run well in what was described as a "vintage" running of the Group One event.
Ghanaati was then rested until October when she contested the Sun Chariot Stakes, over the same course and distance as the 1000 Guineas and started 6/5 favourite. She led the race a furlong from the finish but was overtaken and beaten one and a half lengths by the French-trained four-year-old Sahpresa, who recorded the first of her three wins in the race.
Assessment and honours.
In the 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings, Ghanaati was given a rating of 118, making her the seventh highest-rated three-year-old filly in the world. She was the highest rated three-year-old filly over one mile on turf.
Stud record.
At the end of her racing career, Ghanaati became a broodmare for Shadwell Farms. In her first three years at stud she was covered by the stallions Dansili, Dubawi and Oasis Dream.

James Noel Tetley

Brigadier James Noel Tetley, DSO, TD, DL, LLD (30 December 1898 – 25 December 1971) was a member of a prominent Yorkshire brewing family and a senior officer in Britain's Territorial Army who saw active service in Italy during World War II.
Early life.
James Noel Tetley was born on 30 December 1898 in Headingley, Leeds, to Frank Tetley and his wife Harriett Constance. The Tetley family founded and directed Joshua Tetley & Son of Leeds, one of the largest brewers in the country.
Towards the end of World War I, aged 19, Noel Tetley was commissioned into the Prince of Wales's Own West Yorkshire Regiment (Second lieutenant 19 May 1918). However, the war ended before he could proceed overseas on active service. On the reformation of the part-time Territorial Force after the Armistice, Noel Tetley joined the 7th (Leeds Rifles) Bn, PWO West Yorkshire Regiment. This was the 'family regiment': the original volunteers for the Leeds Rifles in 1859 had come from Tetley employees, and the Commanding Officer in 1919 was Noel's cousin Lt-Col (later Brigadier) Charles Harold Tetley, DSO.
Noel Tetley steadily rose in the Leeds Rifles between the World Wars, becoming Commanding Officer of 7th Battalion with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on 16 February 1938. The following November, the 7th (Leeds Rifles) was converted from infantry to the armoured role, becoming 45th (Leeds Rifles) Bn, Royal Tank Regiment. Soon afterwards the company based in Morley, West Yorkshire, split off to form 51st (Leeds Rifles) Bn, Royal Tank Regiment.
World War II.
Until the outbreak of war, Tetley was engaged in training his Territorial soldiers, and once war was declared his battalion took in new drafts of militiamen (wartime conscripts) for training, even though there were no real tanks to train on until February 1940. In December 1941 a new 34th Army Tank Brigade was created and Tetley was promoted Acting Brigadier to take command of it.
On 3 July 1943 Tetley left 34 Tank Bde to assume command of 25th Army Tank Brigade in Tunisia, whose commander had been wounded during the recent campaign. Among its tank regiments were the North Irish Horse, which had served under him in 34 Tank Bde, and 51 RTR formed from his battalion of the Leeds Rifles (the third regiment was 142nd (Suffolk) Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps).These veterans of the Tunisia Campaign remained in North Africa for many months, training and conducting exercises, until they embarked for Italy and landed at Naples in April 1944. Tetley commanded the brigade through all its operations in the Italian Campaign that year. He was the only TA officer of the RTR to command a brigade on active service during the war.
The brigade distinguished itself in support of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in the assault on the Adolf Hitler Line in May 1944. The North Irish Horse lost 60% of its available tanks and suffered more casualties in men than any other day in its history, and later celebrated 23 May as its Regimental Day. At the request of the Canadian commander, the brigade adopted the Maple Leaf as an additional badge. This badge is still worn by the successors of 51 RTR, the Leeds Detachment (Leeds Rifles), Imphal (PWO) Company, The East and West Riding Regiment.
Later, it was 142 RAC of Tetley's brigade that effected the junction between the British Eighth Army and US Fifth Army at Valmontone on 3 June. Tetley led 25th Tank Bde during the advance to Florence in July and August, and at the forcing of the Gothic Line and Rimini Line in August and September. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in October 1944.
In late November the regiments of 25 Tank Bde were withdrawn from the front line to rest and refit with specialist armoured vehicles. 'No reason was seen why the rest should be extended to the enemy', and Tetley sent the tanks of his Brigade HQ Troop up to the line to bombard the enemy, firing their guns for the first time at the end of a long campaign. As 25 Tank Bde prepared to convert to an Armoured Assault Brigade of the Royal Engineers (RE), Tetley relinquished command of the brigade to an RE officer in December 1944 and returned to the UK. He was granted the rank of Honorary Colonel on 1 March 1945, and later was awarded the Territorial Decoration with four clasps.
Postwar.
In 1948, with the rank of Honorary Brigadier, Noel Tetley was appointed as an Aide-de-Camp to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II (1948–1958). In the same year he succeeded his cousin, Brigadier C.H. Tetley, DSO, TD, as Honorary Colonel of the Leeds Rifles and held the position until 1963. During this period the 45th/51st (Leeds Rifles) RTR once again became the 7th Bn of the PWO West Yorkshires.
Tetley served as President of the Court of Leeds University and was the University's Pro-Chancellor 1956–1965, deputising for the Princess Royal who was the ceremonial Chancellor. (Again, his cousin Charles Harold had preceded him in the office (1926–1946).) He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University in 1951. His portrait in academic robes was painted by Henry Marvell Carr.
Tetley was also President of the Leeds Permanent Building Society, and a Deputy Lieutenant for West Yorkshire.
Brigadier Noel Tetley died on 25 December 1971, leaving a widow, Joyce Carine Tetley, and two children, Richard and Carine.

Sister Carol Gilbert, O.P. (born 1947) is an American Dominican nun and anti-nuclear activist.
Born in Traverse City, Michigan, Gilbert was the elder of two children. She was raised in a middle class setting. At the age of 18, in 1965, she joined a convent of the Dominican Order in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Starting in 1969, Gilbert taught Junior High students at various schools around Michigan. This lasted until 1977 when she started to teach at the Alternative Learning Center in Saginaw, Michigan. After 10 years of teaching, in 1979, she devoted her career to plowshare activism.
In 1998, Gilbert and four other protesters entered Andrews Air Force Base during the annual Department of Defense Open House and air show. The group banged on a B-52 with hammers and poured their own blood on it. For this, Gilbert spent 6 months in federal prison. In 2000, Gilbert and two other nuns, Sisters Jackie Hudson and Ardeth Platte, illegally entered Peterson Air Force Base and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The group was arrested and held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped. In 2002, the same group of nuns entered a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Clad in white jump suits emblazoned with "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," the group drew a cross in their own blood, banged on the silo, and prayed. The nuns were arrested and left on the ground for three hours. Their protest spilled over into their pre-trial hearing. Clad in full habits, the nuns answered the judge with a nod. At their trial, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor. This prevented the nuns from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The nuns were sentenced to between 30 and 41 months in prison. Due to their activism, in 2005 and 2006 Gilbert and Platte were labeled as terrorists by the state of Maryland.

After the disaster at Falkirk William Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland and was replaced by John Comyn, nephew of the exiled Balliol. After Comyn achieved some notable success fighting against the English a quarrel broke out between Comyn and his rival Robert the Bruce over their competing rights to the throne. During a meeting between the two sides at Dumfries in 1306, Comyn was fatally stabbed by Bruce and his supporters and the War of Independence now became a civil war. Because of his fathers long allegiance to King John, Alexander fought under John MacDougall of Lorn against Bruce but was captured by his cousin James Douglas in 1308 and was given a royal pardon. He died circa 1319.

Foster scanner

The Foster scanner, or Variable Path scanner, is a type of radar system that produces a narrow beam that rapidly scans an area in front of it. Foster scanners were widely used in post-World War II radar systems used for artillery and mortar spotting.
Description.
The Foster scanner consists of two parts, a box-shape antenna and the "scanner" itself.
The antenna consists of a thin rectangular section of a parabolic antenna, as if one cut the sides away on a conventional design leaving only the thin strip where the feed horn is mounted. Rectangular plates are placed on either side of the "cut", extending forward in the direction of broadcast. The resulting system has the basic size and shape of a large pizza box with the rear side rounded. The feed to the antenna is via a rectangular slot in a wave-guide running the length of the box in front of the parabolic section.
The scanner itself consists of a section of rectangular waveguide formed into a hollow cone, like an ice cream cone. A second metal cone is placed within the first, leaving a gap between the two that forms a section of waveguide. Small metal "teeth" at the point where the input waveguide meets the cone causes the radar signal to be reflected 90 degrees into the slot between the two cones. Used alone, this system causes the radar signal to travel a different total path length at the narrow end of the cone as opposed to the wide end. This causes the wavefront of the signal to be rotated with respect to the antenna.
The inner cone is not solid, but has a slot cut through the center to form another section of waveguide. Teeth on the outside of this cone pick up the signal from the slot between the cones, reflects it through its center slot, and then a second set of teeth sends it back into the slot between the two cones. The inner cone is allowed to rotate within the outer. As the inner cone rotates, the total signal length changes, more at the wide end than the narrow. When sent to the antenna, this causes the wavefront to scan across the area between the two horizontal plates, "snapping" to the initial position when the inner cone rotates back to the original point.
The scanner allows scans at the rotational speed of the inner cone, which is easily built in a fashion allowing very rapid scanning. Typical angles are +/- 20 degrees.
Typical use.
The Foster scanner was used in a number of post-World War II counterbattery radar systems, the first examples reaching service in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In these systems the scanner was mounted horizontally, in order to produce a signal that scanned back and forth horizontally in front of the radar set. Typical horizontal scanning ranges were between 40 and 50 degrees, with a 1 degree beam width.
In typical systems, the scanner would be mounted so that it could be quickly pointed at two different vertical angles. This could be accomplished by moving the main antenna reflector behind the scanner, or through a variety of electronic means. The system would rapidly switch the scanner between these two angles, while the scanner itself continued to deflect the signal left and right. The location of the shell horizontally was revealed by the timing of the returned signal compared to the rotation of the scanner at that instant. Using traditional pulse timing methods the range of the shell could be determined at the same instant. Simple trigonometry using the range and the known fixed vertical angle of the beam revealed the shell's vertical location. The time it took to cross one beam and then the other revealed the shell's speed.
Early systems included the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two B-scopes. Measurements from the B-scopes were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y location of the launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the "lower" angle setting, while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch was moved to the upper position, and the second return plotted. Ballistic calculation was performed by plotting the two points on an X-Y chart paper, and then moving mechanical cursors over the points. The rest of the calculation was carried out electronically.
History.
The Foster scanner was originally designed by John Stuart Foster while working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory as part of a technical exchange from the Canadian National Research Council. It was quickly adapted for artillery spotting use, particularly for mortars. In this role the scanner would be used to make two or more rapid observations of the shell in flight, and then plotted to calculate the initial position.

Market Warriors is an American reality television series that follows four professional antiquers as they buy assigned items at flea markets and antique shows on a budget. The items are then sold at auction, where the antiquers compete for the highest profit, which is most often determined by the lowest loss. 
"Market Warriors" has a number of connections to "Antiques Roadshow": both are produced by WGBH, Boston, hosted by Mark L. Walberg, and share the participation of appraisers Miller Gaffney, Kevin Bruneau, John Bruno, Bene Raia, and Bob Richter.
Fred Willard was the original host of the show; however, after his arrest for engaging in a lewd act at an adult movie theater, PBS dropped him as host and had Walberg re-voice the episodes Willard had already completed.
On March 13, 2013, PBS announced it was ending production of "Market Warriors", the series that premiered in July 2012 under "Market Wars" as a partner program to longtime ratings hit "Antiques Roadshow", according to a March 14 WGBH, Boston, internal memo to employees.

Robbins' theorem

In graph theory, Robbins' theorem, named after , states that the graphs that have strong orientations are exactly the 2-edge-connected graphs. That is, it is possible to choose a direction for each edge of an undirected graph , turning into a directed graph that has a path from every vertex to every other vertex, if and only if is connected and has no bridge.
Orientable graphs.
Robbins' characterization of the graphs with strong orientations may be proven using ear decomposition, a tool introduced by Robbins for this task.
If a graph has a bridge, then it cannot be strongly orientable, for no matter which orientation is chosen for the bridge there will be no path from one of the two endpoints of the bridge to the other.
In the other direction, it is necessary to show that every connected bridgeless graph can be strongly oriented. As Robbins proved, every such graph has a partition into a sequence of subgraphs called "ears", in which the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle and each subsequent subgraph is a path, with the two path endpoints both belonging to earlier ears in the sequence. Orienting the edges within each ear so that it forms a directed cycle or a directed path leads to a strongly connected orientation of the overall graph.
Related results.
An extension of Robbins' theorem to mixed graphs by shows that, if is a graph in which some edges may be directed and others undirected, and contains a path respecting the edge orientations from every vertex to every other vertex, then any undirected edge of that is not a bridge may be made directed without changing the connectivity of . In particular, a bridgeless undirected graph may be made into a strongly connected directed graph by a greedy algorithm that directs edges one at a time while preserving the existence of paths between every pair of vertices; it is impossible for such an algorithm to get stuck in a situation in which no additional orientation decisions can be made.
Algorithms and complexity.
A strong orientation of a given bridgeless undirected graph may be found in linear time by performing a depth first search of the graph, orienting all edges in the depth first search tree away from the tree root, and orienting all the remaining edges (which must necessarily connect an ancestor and a descendant in the depth first search tree) from the descendant to the ancestor. Although this algorithm is not suitable for parallel computers, due to the difficulty of performing depth first search on them, alternative algorithms are available that solve the problem efficiently in the parallel model. Parallel algorithms are also known for finding strongly connected orientations of mixed graphs.

He was married three times; one of his wives was novelist Regine Normann, from 1906 to 1913. He made his literary debut in 1897 with the historical novel/story collection "I Cancelliraadens dage", a collection of tales from the early 1800s. This book was received with great enthusiasm and earned him an endowment. It is regarded a pioneer work of its kind, and has later been analyzed by several literary historians. Among his other works are the poetry collection "Digte" from 1898, and the novel "Mod kvæld" from 1900.
Andersen suffered from various health problems. He died in Gran in 1920. He has been portrayed by Henrik Lund, Olav Engebrigtsen and Karl Konow. Sculptor Jens Munthe Svendsen made a bronze bust of him in 1920.

Levitt Shell

The Levitt Shell (formerly "Overton Park Shell" and "Shell Theater") is an open-air amphitheater located in Overton Park, Memphis, Tennessee. Elvis Presley gave his first paid concert there on July 30, 1954.
The Overton Park Shell was built in 1936 by the City of Memphis and the Works Progress Administration for $11,935, as part of the New Deal. Designed by architect Max Furbringer, it was modeled after similar shells in Chicago, New York, and St. Louis. The WPA built 27 band shells, the Overton Park Shell is one of only a few that still remain.
During the 1930s and 1940s, the Shell was the site of Memphis Open Air Theater orchestral shows, along with various light opera and musicals. However, on July 30, 1954, Elvis Presley opened for headliner Slim Whitman, and performed what music historians call the first-ever rock and roll show.
In the mid-1960s, the Shell was turned over to the Memphis Arts Center, who planned to raze it in order to build a $2 million theater. However, a campaign led by Noel Gilbert, long-time conductor of the Memphis Concert Orchestra, gathered 6,000 signatures in order to prevent its destruction. Later, in 1972, the Shell was nearly removed in order to build a parking garage, but was again saved by the outcry from the community.
In 1982, the National Conference of Christians and Jews proposed a restoration, and the Shell was renamed in honor of Raoul Wallenberg. However, they could not raise the necessary funds, so by 1984, the previous plan for a parking lot began once again. This time, the Shell was saved by Mayor Richard Hackett. He pledged to fund a renovation if a private group would spearhead an arts program.
In 1985, the Shell lay dormant for the first time in its history. In 1986, a corporation was formed by private citizens named Save Our Shell, Inc. For the following 20 years, Save Our Shell presented hundreds of free programs there.
In 2007, the Shell was renamed Levitt Shell at Overton Park and a large-scale renovation funded by the Levitt Foundation took place. The renovation was conducted by Memphis firm Askew Nixon Ferguson Architects with state-of-the-art audio and visual design. With the completion of the renovations on September 8, 2008, free concerts are now once again held in the Shell. The Shell offers concerts on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights during its spring and fall seasons. In the summer of 2011, Indie Memphis debuted The Concert Film Series, presenting free concert films for the public on weekends during the summer months.

Global Species Database

A Global Species Database (GSD) is a digital catalog of organisms often defined around a conservation purpose for the organisms of interest. GSDs attempt to be globally inclusive of species within their inclusion parameters versus local species databases. GSDs have a defined purpose, SPECIESDAB is a GSD for economically valuable fish species, while FishBase focuses on fin fish regardless of their human potential for exploitation. Attempts have been made to create GSDs for extinct species such as trilobites. A GSD can be broad in taxonomic scope, such as AlgaeBase comprehensively including algae and seagrasses from the entire planet, or narrow such as International Legume Database & Information Service, a GSD for members of a single plant family, the Fabaceae.
A database restricted by geography such as Calflora focusing on California Floristic Province flowering plants and ferns is not a GSD.
The Catalogue of Life links together a number of GSDs of animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms, such as FishBase and AlgaeBase, and integrates these at a high level through a single node facilitating ease of access to global species data.

Stevan Lukačević

Stevan "Saraga" Lukačević (1860-1932) was a Montenegrin politician, merchant and actor. He served as mayor of Podgorica between 1893 and 1895.
He originally immigrated from Serbia to Podgorica. He produced pearl essence from the scales of bleaks. He dried the scales and exported large quantities of his product to Serbia.
Lukačević was one of the founders of the Podgorica Theater Society ("Podgoričko pozorišno društvo").
Lukačević was featured in the play "Maksim Crnojević" (written by Serbian playwright Laza Kostić) in the title role as Maksim Crnojević. The play was performed in Podgorica ca. 5 April 1885 (Orthodox Easter). A writer for the Glas Crnogorca newspaper in Podgorica wrote in his report that despite the barriers of local dialects and the difficulty of fully mimicking everyone's movements, the actors played their roles fairly well. They also noted that foreigners watching the play could not believe that the actors were debutants.
Lukačević was a relative of Montenegrin king Nicholas I and a descendant of Serbian revolutionary Karađorđe Petrović.

Jyotir Math

Jyotir Math or Jyotir Pitha is a monastery located in the city of Jyotirmath, India. Sometimes called "uttarāmnāya matha" or northern monastery, it is one of the four cardinal institutions established by Adi Shankara in the 8th century CE and its appointees bear the title of Shankaracharya. After its occupation by Svāmī Rāmakṛṣṇa Tīrtha in the 18th century it was leaderless for 165 years until the appointment of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati in 1941. Since Brahmananda's death in 1953 there have been several disciples and gurus who have been appointed, occupied or claimed to be the rightful occupant and leader of the monastery.
History.
Background.
Jyotir Math is the "uttaramnaya matha" or northern monastery, one of four cardinal institutions established by Adi Shankara (c. 8th century CE), the reviver of Vedic Sanatana Dharma. Shankara's four principal disciples, Padma-Pada, Hasta-Malaka, Vartika-Kara and Trotakacharya were assigned to these four learning centers in the north, south, east and west of India. The subsequent leaders of each of these four monasteries have come to be known as Shankaracharyas in honor of the math's founder, Adi Shankara. As such they are the leaders of the Dasanami Saṃnyasins who are considered to have custody of Advaita Vedānta These four principle seats of learning are located in Purī (Orissa), Shrngeri (Karnataka) and Dvaraka (Gujarat) with the northern (Uttaramnaya) monastery being located in the city of Jyotirmaṭh (also known as Joṣīmaṭh).
1900 to 1940.
Jyotir Math was occupied by Swami Ramakrishna Tīrtha in the 18th century but the monastery was inactive for 165 years following his death. During that time a number of gurus made claim to the Shankaracharya title and lawsuits representing the claimants and their representatives date back to the 1900s. For a time the head priest, Raval, of the Badrinath temple was thought by some to hold the Shankaracharya title there. However, the formal occupation of the matha only officially began when the leaders of the other three mathas convinced Brahmananda Saraswati to accept the position.
1941 to 1953.
The appointment of Brahmananda in 1941 was made by a group of monks and pandits based in the city of Varanasi with the endorsement of Swami Bharati Krishna Tīitha, the Shankaracharya of Puri and Swami Chandrasekhara Bharati the Shankaracharya of Shringeri. Respected supporters of religious institutions, such as the rulers of the cities of Garhwal, Varanasi and Darbhanga, also endorsed Brahmananda and their recognition helped overcome opposition from previous claimants to the title. Brahmandanda was also perceived by his supporters as the embodiment of the qualifications mentioned in Vedic texts and this assisted in his unhindered ascension to the position a the age of 70.
Brahmananda was charged with reconstructing the temple and institution at Jyotir Math. Through the assistance of the local Deputy Commissioner and parties responsible for his nomination, Brahmananda reclaimed the surrounding land that had been encroached upon by local farmers. Under his leadership a two-story, 30-room building was constructed to serve as the Peeth Bhawan of Jyotir Math. He also supervised the final construction of the Shrine of Purnagiri Devi about 100 yards in front of the new monastery which "the Darbhanga ruler" had begun, but not completed, just prior to his death. Brahmanda's leadership was instrumental in re-establishing the Jyotir Math as "an important center of traditional advaita teaching in northern India" and the monastery was visited by the president of India, Rajendra Prasad in December 1952.
1954 to present.
After the death of Brahmananda in 1953, Swami Hariharananda Saraswati, a now deceased disciple of Brahmananda, was offered the title but refused to accept it. Later it was revealed that five months before his death, Brahamananda had made a will and registered it with the District Registrar in Allahabad. The will named his disciple, Swami Shantanand Saraswati as his successor and Swami Dvarakesananda Saraswati, Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati and Swami Paramatmananda Saraswati as alternate choices. As a result Swami Shantanand Saraswati assumed the Shankarcharya-ship but his authority was disputed by several of Brahmananda's disciples and followers who did not feel that Shantanand met the requirements described in the Mahanusasana texts. Meanwhile others claimed that Brahmananda's death was due to poisoning, and that his will was not authentic, causing civil lawsuits to be filed by concerned parties.
Relevant organizations involved in reviving Jyotir Math, including a committee of pundits from Varanasi, proposed Swami Krishnabodha Asrama as the Shankaracharya despite Shantanand's claim and occupation of Jyotir Math. Asrama died in 1973 and nominated his disciple Swarupananda, a disciple of Brahmananda who had taken Swami Krishnabodha Ashrama as his guru after Brahmananda's death, as his successor. However because Shantananda still occupied the Jyotir Math ashram built by Brahmananda, Swarupananda took residence in a nearby building or ashram, said to be located near the former cave of Adi Shankara disciple, Trotakacharya.
During his tenure, Shantanand was "supportive" of another Brahamananda disciple Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and "often appeared with him in public". However, in 1980, Shantananda vacated the Shankarcharya position in favor of Swami Vishnudevananda Saraswati, an additional disciple that was named in Brahmananda's will as an alternate choice for the Shankaracharya-ship. Author Williamson writes that Shantanand was removed by the other Shankarcharya's due to his "incompetence" and speculates that his relationship with the Maharishi may have been a contributing factor. However, Shantanand's successor, Vishnudevananda, also spoke well of the Maharishi and publicly demonstrated his support by presiding over one of the Maharishi's publicized events in New Delhi in July 1986. Vishnudevananda died in 1989 and Swami Vasudevananda Saraswati succeeded him. Former Shankaracharya, Shantanand, then died in 1997.
Another claimant is Madhava Asrama who disputes the lineage of Vasudevananda and Swarupananda and who was appointed leader of Jyotir Math in the 1960s. He contends that Swaroopananda cannot accept the title of Shankaracharya for both the western and northern mathas in which case the title reverts to a subsequent disciple of Krishnabodha Asrama. Madhava Asrama was reportedly appointed leader of Jyotir Math under the auspices of Shri Niranjana Deva Tirtha who was the Shankarcharya of Puri at that time.
These events have resulted in three separate lineages at Jyotir Math despite Swarupananda being endorsed by other Adi Shankara mathas. These lineages include Swarupananda, the leader of the Dvaraka Math in the West and Madhava Asrama (both disciples of Krishnabodha Asrama) as well as Vasudevananda Saraswati who occupies the monastery built by Brahmananda in 1941.

Hominy Hills

The Hominy Hills are a range of low, gravel-capped hills and upland areas located along the boundary of Colts Neck, Howell and Wall Townships, in Monmouth County, New Jersey, and extending east into the Borough of Tinton Falls, formerly part of Shrewsbury Township. The hills attain heights of over 300 feet (91.44 meters) in elevation, attaining a maximum elevation of 307 feet (93.57 meters) at Throckmorton Hill, which is the highest point in Howell Township.
Geography.
The Hominy Hills extend from west to east, between Freehold and Asbury Park, for a distance of approximately four miles. The greater portion of the range lies within Naval Weapons Station Earle. It forms the divide between the Swimming River to the north, and the Manasquan and Shark Rivers to the south.
Following is a list describing the notable summits of the Hominy Hills from west to east; all are entirely within Naval Weapons Station Earle.
Geology.
A cuesta, the Hominy Hills are composed of layers of unconsolidated sand, mud, and gravel from the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The topmost geologic layer, the Cohansey Formation, is composed of sand, gravel, and erosion resistant ironstone. This layer forms a hard capstone along the highest summits, protecting more easily weathered underlying geologic layers such as the Kirkwood Formation. The scarp of the cuesta faces north while the gentler dip slope faces south.
Flora and fauna.
The Hominy Hills fall within the Pinelands region, and exhibit both pine dominated and oak dominated forests, as well as intermediate forests. Pitch pine ("Pinus rigida") is the most abundant tree. A variety of oaks are also present, including black ("Quercus velutina"), white ("Quercus alba"), post ("Quercus stellata"), chestnut ("Quercus prinus"), scarlet ("Quercus coccinea"), and blackjack ("Quercus marilandica"). These forests tend to be open with widely spaced trees and plenty of sunlight reaching the forest floor.
The understory is thick with shrubs, including black huckleberry ("Gaylussacia baccata") and early lowbush blueberry ("Vaccinium pallidum"). Mountain laurel ("Kalmia latifolia"), and sheep laurel ("Kalmia angustifolia") are also present. Bracken fern ("Pteridium aquilinum") is abundant.
Animals such as whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, chipmunks, red fox as well as a large variety of birds inhabit the hills. Turkey Vultures and Red Tail Hawks are also common.
Recreation.
As much of the Hominy Hills are within Naval Weapons Station Earle no public recreation areas exist. Hominy Hill Golf Course, operated by the Monmouth County Park System, is actually located in the lowland to the north of the Hominy Hills.

Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons

Robert of Bar (1390 – Agincourt, 25 October 1415) was Lord of Marle between 1397 and 1413, Count of Marle between 1413 and 1415 and Count of Soissons between 1412 and 1415.
He was the only child of Henry of Bar and Marie I de Coucy, Countess of Soissons. 
Because his father was the eldest son of Robert I of Bar, Robert claimed the Duchy of Bar. He only renounced his claims after a large financial compensation and the levation of Marle to a County. In 1412 he also became Count of Soissons.<br> 
Robert was one of the many French casualties at the Battle of Agincourt.
Robert married in 1409 Jeanne de Béthune, Viscountess of Meaux (d. 1450), daughter of Robert VIII de Béthune, Viscount of Meaux. They only had one daughter :
