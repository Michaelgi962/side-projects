Jeremiah's Gutter

Jeremiah's Gutter was a canal located on the border of Orleans and Eastham, Massachusetts, the first canal to cut across the peninsula of Cape Cod. It connected Cape Cod Bay in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. It was active for over 100 years, although it gradually fell out of use and was later replaced by the more widely known Cape Cod Canal.
History.
Since the discovery of Cape Cod by Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602, the eastern side of the peninsula has been treacherous to shipping. Since sea levels rose to their present levels, and up until recent times, water has flowed over land in Orleans during times of high tide, allowing for boats to pass between them. During the spring of 1717, the passage between Boat Meadow Creek on the side of Cape Cod Bay and Town Cove, to the east, was deepened, and became known as Jeremiah's Gutter, named after Jeremiah Smith. The canal was very shallow and allowed for a maximum of twenty ton boats when the tides were just right. The canal could cut up to a day off of the trip for ships, who instead of traveling around the arm of the Cape could pass right through it. In 1804, the canal was widened and improved, which allowed for use during the War of 1812. Eventually, proposals for a new canal began to take priority in the late 1800s (although the construction of the railroad around that time might have permanently blocked passage), and the canal began to fall into disrepair. In 1916, the opening of the Cape Cod Canal (between Bourne and Sandwich) created a permanent canal for the Cape.
The only remains of the canal that are still visible are a river and cut through the marsh. Any trace of the canal from the eastern end near Town Cove has been removed by the construction of the road now known as U.S. Route 6 and by the construction of homes.
During his time on the Cape, Henry David Thoreau forded Jeremiah's Gutter.

Gurktal Alps

The Gurktal Alps (, ) are a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps in Austria, named after the valley of the Gurk River.
Geography.
The range is located between the Mur Valley in the north, separating it from the Niedere Tauern, and the Drava in the south, where it borders on the Gailtal Alps and Karavanke ranges of the Southern Limestone Alps. In the west, the Gurktal Alps reach up to the Katschberg Pass and the Ankogel Group of the Hohe Tauern range. In the east, the Neumarkt Pass in Upper Styria separates it from the adjacent Lavanttal Alps.
The highest peaks are located within the Nock Mountains ("Nockberge", from "Nock" meaning "rounded hilltop", cf. Nockerl) subgroup west of Flattnitz Pass, including Mt. Eisenhut, , in Styria. The "Nationalpark Nockberge" along the scenic Nockalm Road in Carinthia since 1987 is a protected landscape area (IUCN V). The Nock Mountains also comprise the major Carinthian lakes like Wörthersee, Millstätter See and Ossiacher See.
The Gurktal Alps together with the adjacent Lavanttal Alps in the east are also referred to as Noric Alps.
Economy.
The extended mountain pastures had been the site of transhumance agriculture since ancient times. The Gurktal Alps were also a mining area for iron and silver, still magnesite deposits are exploited near Radenthein.
Today the local population mainly depends on tourism. In summer, the Carinthian lakes are a popular destination, while in winter, several ski resorts are located around Bad Kleinkirchheim, Turracher Höhe, Krems, and Rennweg am Katschberg.

The International Association of Facilitators (IAF)is a professional association that promotes, supports, and advances the art and practice of professional process facilitation. It was founded in 1994 in the United States and is now a global organization with seven regions - Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and the United States – which holds annual regional conferences and publishes a research journal and newsletters. In 2011, IAF began creating local chapters. The organization is led by a board of directors elected annually and representing all IAF regions.
IAF conferences.
The first annual IAF conference, "The Art and Mastery of Facilitation", attracted 278 people to Denver in January 1995. Forty-five sessions in three tracks included the first sessions on Computer Supported Facilitation. The first IAF General Membership meeting was held and Peggy Bushee Services in St. Paul (Minnesota) was chosen to become the official IAF office.
The second conference, held in January 1996 in Dallas, Texas, attracted 384 participants to take part in 54 sessions in four tracks. Using participatory strategic planning, all participants developed IAF's plan for the next decade. During 1996, the IAF website was created and work began on developing the IAF journal, "".
In the fall of 1996, a conference was held in the Netherlands– the first conference outside the United States – and links began with local facilitator groups that were springing up around the world. More than 400 people attended the third annual IAF conference, "Discovery Along Wisdom Pathways: The Art and Mastery of Facilitation", held January 1997 in Tulsa (Oklahoma). Topics discussed included facilitation as a profession and facilitator competencies, on which extensive work would be done over the next few years.
During 1997, an IAF Europe/Africa Conference was held in London (England), with 70 participants from England, Belgium, Netherlands, Scotland, South Africa, Kenya, and Israel, who shared practices and learned new techniques and models during 17 concurrent sessions. In the spring of 1997, IAF adopted Grp-Facl as its electronic discussion group, allowing facilitators around the world to communicate virtually.

Harold Elsdon

Harold Elsdon (19 February 1921 - 8 May 1995) was an English cricketer. Elsdon was a right-handed batsman who bowled both right-arm fast and leg break. He was born at Lemington, Northumberland.
Elsdon made his debut for Northumberland against the Lancashire Second XI in the 1938 Minor Counties Championship. He made two further appearances for the county before World War II, both in 1939 against Durham and the Yorkshire Second XI. Following the war, Elsdon resumed playing minor counties cricket for Northumberland, playing for the county until 1956, during which time he made 44 further appearances in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Cheshire.
Playing for Northumberland allowed Elsdon to represent a combined Minor Counties cricket team, making one first-class appearance for the team against Yorkshire at Lord's. Yorkshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 231 all out in their first-innings, with Elsdon bowling 24 wicketless overs for the cost of 49 runs. The Minor Counties responded in their first-innings by making 210 all out, during which Elsdon was dismissed for a duck by Allan Mason. In their second-innings, Yorkshire made 250 all out, with Elsdon taking 3 wickets during the innings, finishing with figures of 3/51 from seventeen overs. Set 271 for victory, the Minor Counties could only manage to make 135 all out, with Elsdon ending the innings not out on 12.
He died on 8 May 1995 at Hucclecote, Gloucester, Gloucestershire.

Mordecai Sheftall

Mordecai Sheftall (December 2, 1735 - July 6, 1797) was a Georgia merchant who served as a Colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and was the highest ranking Jewish officer of the Colonial forces. He was born in Savannah to Perla and Benjamin Sheftall, who had arrived in 1733 to the Georgia colony on the William and Sarah from London, England, with a few dozen other Jewish immigrant families. The Sheftalls were founding among the members of Congregation Mickve Israel. He was married to Frances Hart Sheftall (1740-1820).
Revolutionary War.
From the outbreak of the Revolution Sheftall was prominently identified with the American cause. He became chairman of "the Parochial Committee," organized to regulate the internal affairs of Savannah, and composed of patriots opposed to the royal government. As chairman of this rebel committee he was subsequently denounced and persecuted by the British. In 1777 Sheftall was appointed commissary-general to the troops of Georgia and to the Continental troops also; in October of the following year he became "Deputy Commissary of Issues in South Carolina and Georgia"; and he figured as a staff-officer in the Continental line of the Georgia brigade during the war. When the British attacked Savannah in 1778, Sheftall not only took an active part in its defense, but he also advanced considerable sums of money for the American cause. After the city had been taken he was captured, but he resisted all inducements to give up the cause of liberty; as a result he suffered severely from persecution on the part of the British, and was placed on board a prison-ship.
Religious Life.
Sheftall was an observant Jew. For several years the only Jewish place of worship in Savannah was a room fitted up by him in his own house, where services were held until about 1774. In 1773 he deeded a piece of land for the purpose of erecting a synagogue, but the project was abandoned owing to the incipient war with Great Britain. He and his brother Levi also donated the land for the Savannah Jewish cemetery, which was known for decades as the "Sheftall cemetery." In 1782, in Philadelphia, Sheftall helped build the synagogue for the Congregation Mickve Israel.

Topli Vrh, Semič

Topli Vrh (; also "Topli Vrh pri Črmošnjicah", ) is an abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Črmošnjice.
History.
Topli Vrh was a village inhabited by Gottschee Germans. In 1574 it consisted of six half-farms. In 1770 it had 15 houses, and in 1931 it had 25. The original inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. Italian troops burned the village during the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942 and it was never rebuilt.
Church.
The church in the village was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. It had a rectangular nave and an octagonal chancel walled on three sides. A square belfry stood against the south wall of the building. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1689 by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, who referred to it as the Church of "S. Pauli zu Toplaverch." The church was probably built in the 17th century, but architectural features indicate that it may date from a century earlier. The church had a simple stone door casing and small rectangular windows, with quoined corners and decorative painting. The belfry also featured quoining. The nave and the chancel were covered with a tiled gabled roof. The church fell into ruin after the departure of the Gottchee Germans, and the local people removed much of the material, leaving only the belfry, whose roof was repaired in 2004.

The Harischandra Range is a spur of the Western Ghats in Maharashtra, India. It runs in a northwest to southeast direction stretching from northeast of Pune district through Ahmednagar and Beed to Osmanabad district. It lies between the Godavari and the Bhima rivers and acts as a water divide between the Godavari and Krishna river basins. These are low lying hills with an average elevation of only and they gain in elevation towards the northwest. Geologically, these hills are similar to the Deccan Plateau and are composed of basaltic lava deposits. The range derives its name from the Harischandragarh peak, a popular trekking spot and the highest peak of the range. The hills are covered under deciduous forests especially teak but much of it has been degraded due to the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in this region. The city of Ahmednagar is the largest in this region.

Reverend Wendell Mettey

Reverend Wendell Mettey is an American Baptist pastor who has served churches in the Cincinnati area since 1972. He is the founder and president of , a non-profit humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization which ships over 12 million pounds of aid worldwide each year. Mettey and his wife Mickey (Michelle) have three children and 6 grandchildren.
Early life.
Mettey was born on March 2, 1945, to Joseph and Mary Mettey.He grew up in Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio and attended Withrow High School.
After attending the University of Cincinnati on a baseball scholarship and obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics in 1968, Mettey enrolled at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary where he obtained a Master of Divinity Degree in 1972. Later that year, Mettey was ordained as a minister at Walnut Hills Baptist Church.
Mettey served as Pastor at Walnut Hills Baptist Church for 11 years and in 1980 he began a 12 year pastorate at Montgomery Community Church. After making the decision to devote himself to the work of ministering to the poor, Mettey resigned his position at MCC and started Matthew 25: Ministries.
Matthew 25: Ministries.
Matthew 25: Ministries began as the result of a trip Mettey made with a group of doctors and nurses to Nicaragua in 1990.
Seeing the poverty there, Mettey knew he needed to find a way to help the people of Nicaragua. Using his degree in economics, he was able to develop a system to collect and redistribute food, clothing, personal care, cleaning, medical and educational supplies which were no longer useful by US standards. Since 1991, Mettey has developed several programs within Matthew 25 including their print center which produces notebooks for underprivileged children. 
In addition to running the ministry, Mettey also pastored the Church of Matthew 25 for over 10 years. Many members of the church helped Mettey run the organization throughout its early years of existence. 
Through Matthew 25, Mettey was able to establish partnerships with numerous companies including Cintas Corporation. These partnerships have been beneficial not only on a day-to-day basis but especially when natural disasters affect the world. In 1998, Mettey and his Matthew 25 partners sent their first disaster relief to Nicaragua following Hurricane Mitch.
Published Works.
Mettey is the author of numerous devotional & inspirational publications. His book “Are Not My People Worthy? The Story of Matthew 25: Ministries” was released in 2004. His sequel, “What God Desires: The Story of the Center for Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief” was released in the summer of 2008. His third book, “On Which Side of the Road Do the Flowers Grow?” was released in early 2009. In 2012, Mettey released his latest book "Meet Those Who Met The Master," which tells the stories of some of the individuals who met Jesus Christ face-to-face.
Awards and Honors.
In June 2003, Mettey received the Jefferson Award for Public Service from the American Institute for Public Service. Mettey was one of only 5 regional recipients chosen from 14,000 nominees nationwide to attend the national award ceremonies in Washington DC and to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Outstanding Public Service Benefiting the Local Community.

Amazonian pop art

Amazonian pop art (also known as Amazon pop art or wild naive) is a contemporary art movement that emerged in late 1990 in Iquitos. The movement has an intense chromaticism with a great representation of ayahuasca experience psychedelic —a delirious artistic style that is seen strongly in the non-Amazonian pop art works of Pablo Amaringo. Originally, it is an mural art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which could be influenced by American pop art when the era of cable television came to the city, like MTV.
Amazonian pop art grew self-taught. Mainly started in the suburbs of Iquitos, where there was no art market, or some kind of art school, because that too is considered a naive style.
Essentially, the Amazonian pop art originated from various mixes of popular culture Iquitos received through the media, including movie posters, typography of film in Mexico and India. Another important feature is the visual style that originated from music videos. Typically, in most of the Amazonian pop art works is denoted nightclubs, bars and pubs video scene. In several other compositions, it also becomes large presence of the feminine and the erotic.
In the visual, Amazonian pop art is divided into two categories: the "diurnal" works have consistent and complete colors, and the "nocturn" works, the most attractive, are painted with phosphorescent material —often taking infinite forms as a collection of neon lights—, that glow under black light or simple night.
Currently, several artists engaged in decorating the rustic architecture of the city —such as huts and palafittes— in areas such as the Belen District as a method of artistic expression and cultural influence. The cultural impact of art was so attractive that comes up in cemeteries.

With commentary by Dennis Hopper, Johnny Carson, Paul Schimmel and George Herms, the documentary chronicles the executions of two Foulkes paintings "The Lost Frontier" (1997-2004) and "Deliverance" (2004-2007) and also features extended interviews and musical performances on Foulkes one-man band contraption that he calls "The Machine". The documentary premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2013, and Sheri Linden of "The Hollywood Reporter" said, "An irresistible film subject...Foulkes is a joy to watch", while Scott Foundas of "Variety" compared the film to other recent acclaimed artist portrait documentaries "Searching for Sugar Man" and "Cutie and the Boxer". The film will open theatrically in the United States in May 2014.
Her 2011 film "Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life" was based on the children's book of the same name by Wendy Mass, and starred Mira Sorvino and Joe Pantoliano, with music by Edie Brickell and Sing-Sing. Sing-Sing also contributed to Halpern’s previous film "Shelf Life" which Variety called a “whip-smart” film that “taps into a fresh source for American comedy”.
Halpern's short story, "The House Where the Grifters Squat," was written during a funded writing residency at Hedgebrook, and went on to win Sundress Publications' Best of the Net Award in 2010.
Halpern was also a founder of online city guide Citysearch.

Sanatorium (resort)

In Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet Union republics, the term sanatorium is generally used for a combination resort/recreational facility and a medical facility to provide short-term complex rest and medical services. It is similar to spa resorts with medical services.
On the other hand, for most Eastern Europeans including Russians, Ukrainians, Czechs, and other national cultures sanatorium mostly means a kind of hotel with health resort facilities and various available services (such as massage, pools, saunas, aromatherapy, oxygenotherapy, etc.) not covered by medical insurance. It is mostly without any double connotation is a spa resort where relatively healthy business people can rest and recuperate well-being during a regular job vacation. For example, Sanatorium Astória and others located in Karlovy Vary Czech Republic, or Geneva Sanatorium Hotel in Ukraine may serve the purpose. Usually in this case a doctor's prescription is not required. However, a general practitioner is available and recommended for guests to check their health status in the beginning and at the end of their staying in a hotel.
In "How the Universe got its Spots," (pp. 63-70), physicist Janna Levin describes a scientific meeting in a sanatorium near Moscow at the end of 1999. She discusses mathematics and general relativity but mentions no medical care.

Operation OAU

Operation OAU, (September 2 – October 15, 1968), was a battle between Nigerian 3 Marine Commando Division (3MCDO) and Biafran 12 Division in modern day south-eastern Nigeria. Operation OAU was an intermittent battle which may have resulted in over 25,000 deaths on both sides. Although the Biafran soldiers were outnumbered they were able to retain control of Umuahia and eventually recapture the cities of Owerri and Aba.
Prelude.
In April 1968 the Commander of the 3 MCDO Colonel Benjamin Adekunle began drawing up plans to invade the Biafran heartland and capture all remaining major cities. On April 14 the Nigerian 3rd Marine Division under Colonel Adekunle made their way north from their position in Calabar to Ikot Ekpene where they managed to capture the city after a stubborn Biafran defense. For 36 days the 3rd Division pushed their way west through the Niger Delta and reached the area surrounding Port Harcourt on May 19. The Nigerian Army and Navy bombarded the city before carrying out an amphibious assault led by the 31st, 32nd and 33rd battalions. This led to the retreat of Biafran forces. On July 30, 1968 General Adekunle began making plans to capture Biafra's remaining major cities, even boldly stating that he'd be able to capture Owerri, Aba, and Umuahia in 2 weeks. In August 1968 the Nigerian Army set up positions along the Aba-Umuahia road and cut off all food shipments from entering the city. Adekunle's strategy for gaining Aba was to surround the city, cut off food shipments, and starve the city into submission. On August 24 two Nigerian battalions and their Soviet advisers crossed the Imo River Bridge and began making their way towards Owerri. The Biafran 4th Commando Brigade under the South African mercenary Maj. Taffy Williams threw themselves headfirst against the Nigerian attack. For 3 days light machine gun and repeater rifle fire did not stop and neither side gave an inch until the Biafrans ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat to Aba.
Invasion.
On September 2 Nigerian artillery began shelling Aba while ground forces began to enter the city under heavy Biafran fire. For twelve days bloody house-to-house fighting ensued and bodies filled Red Cross hospitals before the final Biafrans surrendered on September 14. On September 13 the Biafran 14th Division came under heavy artillery fire from the Nigerian 16th Brigade under the command of Major E.A. Etuk. On September 18, after a fierce five day stand, the Biafran 14th Division abandoned fighting in Ohoba and Obinze and retreated from the city, leaving Owerri open to Major. Etuk's 16th Division. After Owerri's capture Col. Ogbugo Kalu was made commander of the 14th Division and Col. Lambert Ihenacho was made commander of the 63rd Brigade. In a letter sent from Genralissmao Ojukwu to Col. Kalu he states "Your role in the Port Harcourt disaster is still fresh in the minds of people. You must clear the enemy from Obinze in 24 hours or submit your resignation from the army." Only a few hours later Col. Kalu ordered a Biafran counter-attack and with the assistance of the Ogbunigwe mine the Nigerian advance was halted and Obinze was captured. The 5th, 21st, 22nd, and 44th battalions of the Nigerian 1st Division began making their way northwards towards the Obilagu airstrip from to axes after over-running Biafran positions on the banks of the Imo River. Due to the swiftness of the Nigerian advance the Biafran 63rd Brigade retreated from the Obilagu airstrip on September 22, leaving the bulk of its equipment to the Nigerian 22nd and 44th battalions. That same day the Biafran Maj. Joseph Achuzie attempted a counter-attack at the Obilagu airstrip, but was swiftly repulsed by the Nigerian 22nd Battalion. On September 30 the Nigerian 21st battalion outflanked the defending Biafran 13th Division and captured Okigwe town. In mid-September the French President Charles de Gaulle openly voiced his support for the Biafran cause and began shipping weapons to Biafra. On September 17 the Nigerian 3rd Marine Division began making their way towards Umuahia but were intercepted outside the city by a division of Biafran soldiers, a bloody battle ensued. The terrain around Umuahia consisted of areas of vast jungles and rivers that were littered with mines and Biafran soldiers. For 14 days the two sides exchanged gunfire and artillery, resulting in mass casualties on both sides. Adekunle radioed in that he needed re-enforcements or his entire division would be at risk of annihilation, but they never arrived. Nearly 15,000 Nigerian soldiers had either been killed or wounded in the Umuahia sector and on October 1 the 3rd Marine Division retreated to Port Harcourt while the 16th Division was left isolated in Owerri. Instead of pursuing the retreating Nigerians to Port Harcourt the Biafrans slowly made their way up the Aba-Umuahia road and managed to capture Aba on October 15.
Aftermath.
Although Shuwa's 1st Division successfully captured Okigwe and the Obilagu airstrip the operation resulted in disaster for Adekunle's 3rd Marine Division in which it lost over 20,000 of its 35,000 soldiers, over 2/3 of the entire division, and found itself in short supply of both men and food. While Yakubu Gowon was distracted by the anti-tax riots in western Nigeria the Biafran Brigadier Alexander Madiebo encircled Owerri, trapping the 3,000 man Nigerian 16th Division inside the city. For the next several months attacks were launched by Biafran soldiers on Nigerian defensive positions around the city which allowed them to inch closer to Owerri with every battle. On December 5 the Biafrans launched a two day offensive on Owerri in which 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 300 mortars, 200 howitzer shells, and 20 anti-tank weapons were fired by the Biafrans but the Nigerian 16th Division under Col. Etuk managed to stay put in their original positions. On January 15, 1969 the Biafran 60th Brigade entered Owerri and forced the Nigerians within the city to retreat across the Otamini Bridge. Hungry and half-naked Biafran soldiers discovered the Nigerian's food and clothing supplies and decided to stay and have their fill while the Nigerians regrouped and launched a counter-attack, causing the Biafrans to retreat. By March 31, 1969 the Biafrans had control over 70% of Owerri while the remaining 300 Nigerian soldiers fled the city on April 25.

Edward Bleier

Edward Bleier is a former Warner Bros. president who played a role in the development of cable television and pay TV. He served on the board of directors of RealNetworks and Blockbuster LLC and as chairman of the board of CKX, Inc., owner of the American Idol and Elvis Presley franchises.
Early career.
Bleier's career started in high school on WNEW radio's high school hour and writing for the "Long Island Press". He worked as an ABC News copy boy during summers while attending Syracuse University. He also wrote for the "Syracuse Herald Journal" and several Syracuse radio stations. He managed promotion for the DuMont Television Network and New York's Channel 5.
American Broadcasting Company.
In the early 1950s, he worked in advertising for ABC's New York Channel 7 and was promoted to ABC's Television Network. In the 1960s, Bleier was a senior executive of the American Broadcasting Company, working in daytime and children's programming and sales, general sales management, and marketing, public relations and strategic planning.
His 1967 research and strategic planning for ABC correctly presaged the growth of cable TV. Some other milestones at ABC included the first integration of African-American characters in daytime dramas, helping make women's and children's programming profitable, and managing advertiser support for ABC Sports and ABC News.
Warner Bros. Entertainment.
For Warner Bros. Television, Bleier was President of Domestic Pay TV, Cable & Network Features. As part of this appointment Warner Bros. acquired Bleier's production/ distribution company. He was put in charge of Network Programming and Sales in 1969. He became a Senior Advisor in 2002, and held this position until 2005.
During his 35 years at Warner Bros. he was responsible for annual record-breaking U.S. after-market sales of Warner's TV series and movies, vastly exceeding their theatrical income for the first time. He worked closely with Warner's cable systems, helping develop basic and pay-TV networks (such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and The Movie Channel), pay-per-view, and video-on-demand. He co-created the corporate plan for Warner Home Video and was a pioneer of new digital media markets, particularly to securely deliver content-on-demand via Internet or cable.
He oversaw more than 100 variations of Looney Tunes programming on ten different cable and broadcast networks. He also oversaw combining old and new animation for five movies and 15 TV specials. Warner Animation collaborated with Steven Spielberg on three series: "Tiny Toons", "Pinky and the Brain", and "Animaniacs".
In the mid 1970s, Bleier developed a woman's daytime panel show featuring Julie Nixon Eisenhower, daughter of ex-President Nixon and granddaughter-in-law of Dwight D. Eisenhower. "Ask Julie" never aired.
He helped pave the way for the 1990 Warner merger with Time Inc.
Other accomplishments.
He held posts as chairman of the Center for Communication, president of the International Radio & Television Society, vice-chairman of the International Television Council, chairman of the Academy of the Arts of East Hampton's Guild Hall, board member of the Keystone Center for Science and Environment and the Martha Graham Dance Company, and participated in two United Nations World TV Forums. He has guest lectured at 15 different universities. Pro bono activities include serving as steering committee chairman for 13 "Communications Leaders' Conferences" of the Aspen Institute from 1970 to 1999.
In 2003, Bleier published a book titled "The Thanksgiving Ceremony" through Crown/Random House. The book describes his first-generation celebration of thanksgiving, including an original around-the-table "ceremony" for the Thanksgiving feast. "New York Times" columnist William Safire wrote the book's foreword. "The Thanksgiving Ceremony" jacket received endorsements from Arlene and Alan Alda, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the late Peter Jennings and his wife, Kayce Freed, Quincy Jones, and Steven Spielberg.
Recipient of the Steven J. Ross Humanitarian Award, he co-chaired the Entertainment/Media & Communications division of the UJA Federation for seven years and now serves on the media council of the Paley Center for Media, as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and as a trustee of the Charles A. Dana Foundation.

Ira B. Thompson

Ira Bowman Thompson (April 9, 1889 – August 10, 1973) was a politician, Ku Klux Klan leader, and attorney from the U.S. state of Alabama.
Thompson was born to Albert and Laura (née Crabtree) Thompson at Bay Minette, Alabama in 1889. After attending school in Bay Minette, Thompson attended the University of Alabama and Meridian College in Mississippi, graduating from the latter in 1910. Thompson then entered into military service, eventually becoming Captain of Company B of the 1st Alabama Infantry in 1915. He also served a brief term in the Alabama House of Representatives as a representative for Baldwin County in that same year. He was admitted to the bar in 1916 but he was quickly called into federal military service in 1917 when he was sent to France in 1918 to command a Prisoner of War camp until the prisoners were repatriated back to Germany in 1919. After his return to the United States, Thompson opened a law practice in Luverne, Alabama and arranged Battery A of the 141st Field Artillery in the National Guard, which he would later resign from in 1932. 
Thompson was an active member of the local Ku Klux Klan organization in Crenshaw County and Luverne in the late 1920s, serving as the exalted cyclops of the Crenshaw KKK around 1927 and 1928. In October 1927, Thompson, along with 35 other suspected Klansmen were all indicted by the Crenshaw County grand jury on the basis of their participation of floggings throughout the county. The case, however was dropped later in December by the attorney general's withdrawal on his belief that the state police had assisted the Klan. Less than a year after Thompson's indictment, Governor Bibb Graves appointed him the prosecuting attorney of Crenshaw County.
In 1927, Thompson was appointed solicitor of Luverne, and was re-elected to two more consecutive terms in 1928 and 1932. He was called back to active military service in 1942 when he was a captain in the military police corps. He had previously served as the attorney for Crenshaw County since 1941. He sat once again in the Alabama House of Representatives, this time for Crenshaw County as a Democrat from 1943 until 1951.
Thompson married Eugenia Marie Little in 1917. They had one child, Mary Eugenia. He was an active community member, sitting on the state athletic commission, Luverne's education board, founding the Lurverne Bank and Trust Company, and serving as a member in the local Lion's Club, Red Cross and American Legion. He also taught Sunday school at his church for over 30 years. He died in 1973 in Luverne.

Ripolin

Ripolin is a brand of paint. It was the first commercially available brand of enamel paint.
Ripolin, a brand of commercial ready-mixed paints formulated for architectural, marine and other applications, originated in the Netherlands where it was developed by the chemist Carl Julius Ferdinand Riep. In 1897, the Briegleb paint company, as it was then known, formed a partnership with the French firm Lefranc, a manufacturer of artists’ materials. The merged company was named Ripolin, in honor of Riep, and a Ripolin factory was established in France. Ripolin paints became sufficiently renowned during the period that “ripolin” became synonymous with enamel paints in general and entered the French dictionary as early as 1907. Today Ripolin is the property of PPG Industries.
Picasso and Le Corbusier both used Ripolin in their works. The latter's argument against ornamentation and the promotion of the use of white enamel ripolin was famously documented in his "Law of Ripolin".

Old Vic (horse)

Old Vic (1986 – 2011) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Irish Derby. After retiring from racing he went on to become a top national hunt sire. He was one of the first crop of foals by the influential sire Sadler's Wells.
Racing career.
Old Vic made his racecourse debut in a maiden at Newmarket in September 1988 and finished sixth. He started once more as a two-year-old, winning a maiden at Haydock Park. He easily won the Burghclere Stakes at Newbury on his first race of 1989. He then stepped up in class for the Sandown Classic Trial. He faced only two opponents and won the race by four lengths. He followed this up with a win in the Chester Vase at the May meeting. Old Vic then travelled to France for the Prix du Jockey Club. He quickened clear with two furlongs to run and was never challenged, winning by seven lengths from Dancehall. After this performance, he started the hot favourite for the Irish Derby and won by four lengths despite the presence of a large abscess in the saddle area and the need to have foam pads under the saddle to enable him to run.
Old Vic raced as a four-year-old, beginning at Royal Ascot where he started the 4/5 favourite in the Hardwicke Stakes. He finished third, a long way behind the surprise winner Assatis. Old Vic's final start came in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He led from the start but was overtaken by Belmez with two furlongs to run. Old Vic came back at Belmez again and just failed to win by a neck. The field also included In the Wings and Assatis.
Assessment.
At the end of the 1989 season Old Vic was officially rated as the joint best horse with Zilzal. Timeform gave Zilzal a rating of 137, with Old Vic on 136 and Nashwan on 135. Old Vic was also officially rated the best older horse of the 1990 season.
Stud career.
Old Vic was retired to stud. He failed to produce many top class flat horses, the best being multiple Group 3 winner Orchestra Stall. However he went on to become one of the leading National Hunt sires and was leading sire for the 2007/08 season.
Notable progeny.
"c = colt, f = filly"

Louis Nicollin

Louis Nicollin (born 29 June 1943), is a French entrepreneur and director of the Nicollin Company, which specializes in the collection and reprocessing of household and industrial waste.
Nicollin has also been the chairman of Montpellier Hérault Sport Club, a football team, since 1974.
Biography.
Business and Sports.
Nicollin was born in Valence, capital of the Drôme department. As a young man he worked in the family business of waste collection. He became the manager in 1977 and developed its activity mainly in Montpellier, before spreading the company around France and creating overseas departments. The company has operations in Belgium and Morocco.
In 1974 he became chairman of the amateur football club Montpellier Paillade Sport Club, which played in the division d'honneur. Under his leadership, and the support of Mayor Georges Frêche, the club grew and was promoted to Ligue 1 within 8 years. It took the name of Montpellier Hérault Sport Club ("MHSC") in 1989, the same year Nicollin became the sole shareholder. Under his leadership, the Montpellier has won the championship of Ligue 2 in 1987, the Coupe de France in 1990, and Ligue 1 in 2012.
Nicollin not only invests in football, but also in other sports. In rugby, the Nicollin Company was the main sponsor of the AS Béziers Hérault from 1999 to 2009. Then in 2009, through a holding in his name, Louis Nicollin became a shareholder in Montpellier Hérault Rugby Club. In 2000 he bought Paris Basket Racing and in 2002 Paris Handball. He placed his associates in charge of those teams, such as Varlot Gilbert and Jean-Claude Lemoult. He is also president of the Fédération Française de Joute et Sauvetage Nautique (FFJSN), a regulatory group for water jousting.
His responsibilities and his image in the sports world have raised Nicollin's profile among local officials, which helps him win new waste collection contracts for the Nicollin Company.
He is a member of the Club des Cinquante (Club of Fifty), a fraternal organization, as well as the Masonic Lodge of Montpellier, which is affiliated with the Grand Orient de France. Nicollin is currently the 354th richest man in France.
Personal life.
As a big football fan, he holds one of the largest collections of football jerseys. The collection comprises around 4500 pieces, some of which belonged to football legends.
He is married to Colette, with whom he has two son Oliver (42 years) and Laurent (39), who both work within the company and the club. His youngest son Laurent is the Chairman of Montpellier HSC.
Character.
Louis Nicollin is known in the world of French football for his explosive temperament, marked by frequent verbal blunders and outbursts.
On October 31, 2009, he called Benoit Pedretti, captain of AJ Auxerre (to whom Montpellier had just lost), a highly offensive term for a gay man. Nicollin insinuated Pedretti would be treated badly at the next match between the teams. The next day, the Collective Against Homophobia (CCH) asked the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) for sanctions against Louis Nicollin, who apologized the day after. Subsequently, the National Council of Ethics gave Nicollin a four-month ban from official duties, saying his comments were "discriminatory and threatening".
On May 15, 2010, following the club's qualification for the 3rd qualifying round of the Europa League, he bragged to Canal + "The role of idiot is not for us, it is for Mr. Triaud and Mr. de Tavernost (directors of the Bordeaux football club, Ligue 1 champions 2009), and that, that makes me laugh ".
On December 30, 2011, the newspaper L'Equipe reported Nicollin's comments about Carlo Ancelotti, coach of Paris Saint-Germain. "I prefer Courbis to Ancelotti! [...] The greatest coaches are those who win titles with half-good players. Courbis went up in Ligue 1 coaching half-retarded players."
On April 17, 2012, barely a month after he was awarded the Pierre Guenin prize for working against homophobia, he lost the prize and its reward of 2,000 euros as a result of a homophobic insult said on Radio Monte Carlo.
April 15, 2012, he told TF1 that he would give himself an orange and blue fauxhauk in the style of Jérémy Ménez if his club finished first.
On May 24, 2012, Nicollin dyed his hair orange and blue (Montpellier HSC colors) when Montpellier HSC won the 2012 Ligue 1 trophy.
On July 28, 2012 Nicollin mocked A.C. Milan's Vice president and CEO Adriano Galliani calling him "Kojak" (bald-headed protagonist from the 1970s American cop drama) for offering him a €6 million offer for Montpellier HSC's captain and star player Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa.
He gradually became a charismatic figure and comics illustrate his life : "Nicollin, une vie de foot" (2011) and "Nicollin, poubelle la vie" (2012).

Rashied Doekhi

Mohammed Rashied Doekhi, also written as Doekhie, is a Surinamese politician and a former district commissioner of Nickerie. Because of his popularity in the western rice district, he is nicknamed "the president of Nickerie". He is currently a member of the National Assembly of Suriname, on behalf of the National Democratic Party of Desi Bouterse.
Presidential elections 2000.
In 2000, the Millennium Combination of Desi Bouterse unexpectedly nominated Doekhi as a candidate for the presidential elections of July 2000. Doekhi's opponent in the elections was Ronald Venetiaan. Doekhi lost the elections and Venetiaan was, for the second time, chosen as president of Suriname.
Fight in the parliament.
On 13 December 2007, there was a fight in the Surinamese parliament in which Doekhi was involved. It all started after the suspension of a heated discussion about alleged corruption at the ministry of Ground and Forestry. According to Doekhi then chairman of the parliament Paul Somohardjo was also involved and Doekhi accused him of repeatedly enriching himself and his affiliated foundations with pieces of land from the government. "I know of no Somohardjo who has ever been in prison, but you, Doekhie, go inquire how many Doekhis there are in prison", replied Somohardjo shortly before he suspended the debate and walked away from his chair. Glaringly Doekhi rushed towards Somohardjo and an altercation followed between the two. What was said could not be heard, because after suspension the sound in the parliament gets turned off. MP Ronnie Brunswijk, who noticed the altercation, interfered between the two and shortly after this Doekhi pushed Somohardjo. Brunswijk vigorously pushed Doekhi who subsequently ended up with his back on a table. Brunswijk grabbed Doekhi by the ankles and pulled him to the floor. Thereafter both Brunswijk and Somohardjo gave Doekhi some firm kicks. Through intervention of police and other parliamentarians, the fight ended. The fight was aired live on the television and caused international disgrace for the Surinamese parliament and Suriname as country. Doekhi filed a complaint against Somohardjo en Brunswijk. 
Ironically, Doekhi himself was, on several occasions, allotted large areas of land by the government. Altogether, over a thousand acres of state land was allocated to him.
Wikileaks.
According to U.S. Embassy documents published by Wikileaks, the meeting of Desi Bouterse and Guyanese drug lord Roger Khan was arranged by Doekhi. The cables report that Doekhi introduced Bouterse to Roger Khan on his private land in South Drain, Nickerie. Doekhi replied to the 'disclosures' of Wikileaks by saying that they are all rumors and Doekhi also denied knowing Roger Khan. He said that he knew Roger Khan only from the photographs of him that appeared in the newspapers. The cables also report that Doekhi, Bouterse and Roger Khan plotted to murder then Suriname's minister of Justice Chan Santokhi and Suriname's attorney general Subhaas Punwasi.
Elections 2010.
At the Surinamese parliamentary elections of May 2010 Doekhi had the no. 1 place on the "MegaCombinatie" (a political alliance chaired by Desi Bouterse) voting's list in Nickerie. At the elections Doekhi was re-elected as member of National Assembly of Suriname.
Trivia.
The daughter of Rashied Doekhi, Chantal Doekhi, was shortly after the inauguration of President Bouterse appointed by him as chargé d'affaires of Suriname in the Netherlands. According to the daughter of Doekhi, she was appointed in that function because of her knowledge and experience and not because of the political influence of her father. She said her father reacted very surprised when she told him she would be appointed as chargé d'affaires.

__NOTOC__
The Turbay T-3A was an Argentine twin-engined seven-seater light transport of the 1960s. A single example was built, but no production followed.
Development and design.
In 1957, the Argentine aircraft designer Alfredo Turbay began work on a twin-engined STOL light transport, the Turbay T-3A, with Turbay S.A. formed at Buenos Aires in January 1961 to build the new design. The T-3A was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of all metal construction.

Benjamin Lawsky

Benjamin M. Lawsky (born April 14, 1970) is an American attorney and New York State's first Superintendent of Financial Services and former Acting Superintendent of Banks. Unofficially, Lawsky is in charge to organize the racketeering of European banks by leveraging on U.S. regulation.
The New York State Legislature unanimously confirmed Lawsky on May 24, 2011 as New York State's first Superintendent of Financial Services. From May 24, 2011 until October 3, 2011, Lawsky was appointed, and served as, Acting Superintendent of Banks for the former New York State Banking Department, in which position he led Governor Andrew M. Cuomo's initiative to consolidate the New York State Banking Department and New York State Insurance Department towards a new financial regulator called the Department of Financial Services (DFS).
Lawsky is a graduate of Columbia Law School and Columbia College, and was previously Governor Andrew Cuomo's Chief of Staff. He has also been assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York and a special assistant to then-Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo. As Superintendent of Financial Services, he is paid an annual salary of $127,000.
He investigated Standard Chartered Bank and accused the bank of conducting secret money laundering transactions with Iran, triggering a 23.5% drop in share price. On August 14, 2012, Standard Chartered Bank agreed to pay a fine of $340 million (£220 million) to the New York State Department of Financial Services, conceding that $14 million in financial transactions involving Iranian parties were in violation of U.S. banking laws. On June 18, 2013, the Department announced that Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP (“Deloitte FAS”) was fined $10 million and banned from advising banks in New York for one year after accusing the firm of watering down a report about money-laundering controls at Standard Chartered.
On September 11, 2013, Lawsky's office announced that New York State would opt out of an agreement on new capital reserve standards for the life insurance industry. In a letter to other states' insurance regulators, Lawsky said that recent tests of insurance industry accounting practices had revealed "gamesmanship and abuses" regarding assessment of insurers' liquid reserves and leveraging practices.
He is noted for targeting individuals within the financial sector who commit wrongdoing, and not merely handing out fines to the companies they work for, an approach he explains as follows: "Corporations are a legal fiction. You have to deter bad individual conduct within corporations. People who did the conduct are going to be held accountable."
Other.
Lawsky was born near a Navy base in San Diego, California, but grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a twin sister. He is married to an attorney, Jessica Roth.

<doc id="36668656" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36668656" title="Faizrakhmanist">
Faizrakhmanist

The Faizrakhmanist movement, known in the media as the "catacomb sect", is a sect of Islam based in Tatarstan in Russia. Adherents describe themselves only as "Muammmin" ("believers"). The sect is named after its founder, Faizrakhman Sattarov, a Russian Muslim who calls himself a prophet. The sect is considered illegitimate by mainstream Russian Muslim clergy because orthodox Islam holds that there are no prophets after Muhammad.
Founding and beliefs.
Sect founder Faizrakhman Sattarov, who was at one time a mufti, presented himself as a prophet in the mid-1960s after he encountered sparks from a trolleybus cable and interpreted the sparks as a divine light from God. He established the sect in the 1970s. The sect is relatively small, with about 70 members. Sattarov and his followers are rejected by mainstream Islamic clergy, who hold Muhammad as the final prophet of Allah. 
In 1996, Sattarov moved into a three-storey building in Kazan that he declared to be an independent Islamic state. The sect established a "madrassa" (religious school) in 1997, allowing only its sect members to preach to the students. Instead of using orthodox Islamic scripture, the textbooks used are written and often copied and adapted by Sattarov himself.
Separatism.
The Faizrakhmanists stress their native roots and lack of association with other Russian and worldwide Islamic organizations. The sect is believed to reject the modern Russian state and its laws, as well as mainstream and orthodox Islam. In the first decade of the 21st century, Sattarov led his followers into isolation from mainstream society, pursuing an extreme version of religious separatism. 
Underground compound discovery and raid.
In August 2012, during an investigation of attacks on Muslim clergy in Tatarstan, Russian police found an eight-level complex of underground chambers beneath Sattarov's home in Kazan, occupied by 38 adults and 27 children who lived in dug-out rooms described as being like catacombs. According to Russian authorities, most of the children had never been outside their underground home, but adult members of the sect said the children were able to play outdoors. 
Most sect members were forbidden to leave the compound, although a few were permitted to leave in order to work as traders in a local marketplace. One man who lived in the underground complex with his family told news media that he had defied the restrictions to go to a job outside, escaping by jumping over the gate.
Four members of the Faizrakhmanist sect were charged with cruelty against children. Authorities said the children had been living in poorly ventilated unsanitary quarters and that they displayed symptoms of anaemia and tuberculosis, Sattarov was charged with "arbitrariness", a criminal offence defined in Article 330 of the Russian penal code to mean "unauthorised commission of actions contrary to the order presented by a law or any other normative legal act". The penalty for arbitrariness is up to five years in prison. Sattarov's three-storey brick house, located on a lot, was found to have been constructed illegally and was ordered to be demolished. Sect members said they would combat the demolition by "throw[themselves in front of the bulldozers".
At the time of the discovery of the catacombs, Sattarov was reported to be 83 years old, ill, and confined to his bed in a state of delirium.

Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)

Zion Lutheran Church, also known as the Zion Church of the City of Baltimore (formerly known as the German Lutheran Reformed Church), is a historic Lutheran church located in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The congregation was founded in 1755 in order to serve the needs of Lutheran immigrants from Germany, as well as Germans from Pennsylvania who moved to Baltimore. It has a bilingual congregation that provides sermons in both German and English. In 1762 the congregation built its first church on Fish Street (later East Fayette Street). It was replaced by a bigger building, the current Zion Church on North Gay Street, erected from 1807 to 1808 in a Georgian/Federal-era style. An additional expansion of the church to the west along East Lexington Street to North Holliday Street composed of an "Adlersaal" (Parish House), bell tower, parsonage and a enclosed garden designed of Hanseatic North German architecture was constructed under Rev. Julius K. Hoffman in 1912-1913. In the late 1920s, the entire block south of the church was razed to form a monumental square (known as "War Memorial Plaza" or "City Hall Plaza") opposite the Baltimore City Hall of 1875 on the western side and construction at the eastern end of the War Memorial Building with an auditorium, historical exhibit area and veterans organizations offices. On the south side of the church buildings facing the plaza, a new headquarters for the Baltimore City Fire Department was constructed in a Georgian-Federal style complementing the original Zion Church around the corner.
German-language sermons have been provided for over 250 years at Zion Church, the only church left in Maryland still holding weekly German-language services. The church participates in the annual Maryland German Festival and is a member of the German-American Citizens Association of Maryland.
Zion Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Teeology

Teeology, Inc. is a Los Angeles-based electronic commerce co-founded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez and fashion designer Erica Zohar. Launched on July 12, 2012, the company offers high-end limited edition T-shirts designed by "various artists and designers", as well as a permanent collection of "basics" for men and women. It makes use of new technology and social network tools to "disrupt the traditional retail model".
Foundation and launch.
Teeology was co-founded by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez and fashion designer Erica Zohar. They teamed up with Brian Lee and MJ Eng to design the company's "innovative" shopping portal, which uses new technology and social networking tools to "disrupt the traditional retail model". Of Teeology, Lopez stated that its a "different type of online experience", where "you get to be involved in which designs get made. And it gives us a beeline to what people really like". Lee had previously helped launch the legal document site LegalZoom with lawyer Robert Shapiro and the subscription-based women's shoe site ShoeDazzle with reality television star Kim Kardashian. Lopez, who models for the company, also acts as its chief curator. The website was officially launched on Thursday, July 12, 2012.
Eng explained the creation of the company by stating: "The idea started when we realised more and more customers have become increasingly spoiled with private sale discounts online. We know the markups. So rather than building a brand around cost structures, price points and overhanging inventory that you have to liquidate, why not have a lean model and offer good prices right off the bat?"
Products.
Limited edition designs.
Teeology offers high-end limited edition T-shirts designed by "various artists and designers". Designers can submit their own T-shirts designs, which are then considered by the company's curators. From the designs they are sent, the curators create a shortlist of designs to be included in a poll. Members of the website can then vote for T-shirt designs and the winning designs will go into immediate production.
Basics.
Teeology also offers a permanent collection of "basics" for men and women.
Reception.
Julia Fernandez of Grazia Daily stated that Teeology "certainly adds a more exciting element to online shopping".

Onset Computer Corporation

Onset Computer Corporation is an American company that designs and manufactures data loggers, wireless monitoring devices, and weather stations. Headquartered in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, United States, Onset was founded in 1981 to market data logging products. 
Used worldwide, Onset products include stand-alone data loggers, technology for building wireless sensor networks for both indoor and outdoor applications, and remote weather stations. Additional products include web-based energy management software, energy monitoring and targeting systems, net metering, sensors, and communication networks. These products help researchers and engineers monitor temperature, light, electricity, and other variables. Data collected is used to study and verify green building performance, renewable energy systems, agricultural practices, water quality, and coastal areas.
History.
Onset was founded by Lon and Ellen Hocker, MIT and Harvard professors respectively, in North Falmouth, Massachusetts. The company’s first commercially successful product was a C44 bus. Onset's next popular product, launched in 1981, was a low-power portable data logger called the "Tattletale". Tattletales were used in a broad range of applications, including monitoring ocean parameters on buoys and tracking performance of Indy Cars.
Soon after the Tattletale was launched into the marketplace, commercial and educational organizations requested that Onset design data logging devices for their specific monitoring applications. Onset soon increased its staff to twelve.
Between the years of 2007 and 2012, Onset’s revenue increased steadily. This increase in sales is mainly attributable to growing concerns for climate change. As a result of environmental interests, demand for energy monitoring and green building initiatives has steadily risen across the globe.

The Yankles

The Yankles is a 2009 film directed by David R. Brooks, about a fictitious college-level baseball team made up of students from an Orthodox Yeshiva.
Filmed in Utah with a "predominantly Mormon cast," the film was shown at a number of film festivals, winning a number of festival awards, although it was never theatrically released. However, in 2012 it was picked up by Magnolia Home Entertainment for DVD release.
Plot and title.
The Rosh yeshiva (rabbinical dean) of an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva (theological school) decides that the school should have a baseball team to compete in the college league. Elliot (Michael Buster), one of the students with a background in minor league baseball, is able to convince Charlie Jones (Brian Wimmer), a former major league player who had been imprisoned as a result of DUI convictions—and now has to perform almost 200 hours of community service—to coach the team. As he coaches the team, he gives the players "a new measure of skill and confidence," as they help him regain his self-respect.
The title is the name of the ball team, based on Yankle as the Yiddish language nickname for Jacob, used as a play-on-words with the famous ball team, the Yankees. An additional pun is reflected in the words painted on the school bus the yeshiva ball team uses: "In the Big Inning."
Themes.
According to publicity releases, the film is "not just a funny film about baseball; it's about second chances, reconciliation and forgiveness...about making mistakes and moving on, about living by principles and not passions."
Production.
Co-writers (and brothers) David and Zev Brooks have stated that the idea for the movie came to them when they were discussing movie concepts at their dinner table and the film "The Chosen" brought to mind a movie scene with Orthodox and non-Orthodox students playing baseball. They agreed the image was "visually entertaining" and built the film around that image.
Once the script was completed, the brothers established "DZB productions" and began seeking out investors to fund the film. When it became clear that shooting a low-budget independent film in Los Angeles would be too expensive for them, they made the decision to film the movie in Utah, using many local men and women for cast and crew. According to the film's creators, the decision to film in Utah was made based on a combination of economic factors, the cooperation they would receive from the Utah Film Commission, and the large number of actors and film crew members who lived in that State. Evidently because of the large number of Mormon actors and crew members involved in the production, the film (featured in many Jewish film festivals) was included in the "LDS Film Festival" as well.
While the brothers co-wrote the film, David directed it and Zev produced it. The movie was filmed on a tight schedule, and because the actors were not trained baseball players—and there was no time on the schedule to hold a training camp to improve their skills—the number of actual scenes of ball games were limited.
The script was completed by the two brothers in 1996, and most of the film was completed by 2007, but a post-production lack of funding postponed the film's completion until 2009.
DVD extras.
The DVD includes an 11-minute behind-the-scenes film, 11 minutes of extended musical numbers, and 16 minutes of deleted scenes.
Cast.
The cast includes:
Brian Wimmer and Susanne Sutchy, two of the main stars of the movie, are married in real life.
Awards.

Allmendingen Castle, Bern

Allmendingen Castle () is a castle in the municipality of Allmendingen of the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
History.
The original Allmendingen Castle was built during the High Middle Ages probably for the Lords of Allmendingen or Alwandingen. Between 1239 and 1256 Rudolf von Alwandingen was mentioned in the record. In 1256 the Lords of Allmendingen sold both Allmendingen and the neighboring hamlet of Märchligen to Interlaken Abbey. The castle fell into disrepair and during the 16th century the cartographer Thomas Schöpf referred to it as a "arx disruta" or broken castle. In 1676 Albrecht Kauws mentioned the ruins of Alt-Allmendingen Castle and by 1729 the ruins were still visible. The old castle had walls that were about and was a square with long walls. The south and west side had no windows.
After the Protestant Reformation in 1528, Interlaken Abbey was secularized and its lands, including Allmendingen, were taken by Bern. A new Allmendingen Castle was built near the old castle during the 16th or 17th century. One clue as to the construction date is that a door in the tower bears the year 1607. The new castle was built for the Graffenried family in the Renaissance style. The tower was initially topped with a high pointed roof, which was later replaced with a lower one. In the 18th century, the castle was renovated by the Schultheiss Isaak Steiger and then by his son Franz Ludwig. They expanded the castle with a garden court yard and a connecting arbor.
On 17 September 1946 Winston Churchill visited Allmendingen Castle.

House-Tree-Person test

The House-Tree-Person test (HTP) is a projective test designed to measure aspects of a person’s personality. The test can also be used to assess brain damage and general mental functioning. The test is a diagnostic tool for clinical psychologists, educators, and employers. The subject receives a short, unclear instruction (the stimulus) to draw a house, a tree, and the figure of a person. Once the subject is done, he is asked to describe the pictures that he has done. The assumption is that when the subject is drawing he is projecting his inner world onto the page. The administrator of the test uses tools and skills that have been established for the purpose of investigating the subject's inner world through the drawings.
Generally this test is administered as part of a series of personality and intelligence tests, like the Rorschach, TAT (or CAT for children), Bender, and Wechsler tests. The examiner integrates the results of these tests, creating a basis for evaluating the subject's personality from a cognitive, emotional, intra- and interpersonal perspective.
The test and its method of administration have been criticized for having substantial weaknesses in validity, but a number of researchers in the past few decades have found positive results as regards its validity for specific populations. 
History.
HTP was designed by John Buck and was originally based on the Goodenough scale of intellectual functioning. The HTP was developed in 1948, and updated in 1969. Buck included both qualitative and quantitative measurements of intellectual ability in the HTP (V). A 350-page manual was written by Buck to instruct the test-giver on proper grading of the HTP, which is more subjective than quantitative. In contrast with him, Zoltán Vass published a more sophisticated approach, based on system analysis (SSCA, Seven-Step Configuration Analysis).
Administering the test.
HTP is given to persons above the age of three and takes approximately 150 minutes to complete based on the subject's level of mental functioning. During the first phase, the test-taker is asked to draw the house, tree, and person and the test-giver asks questions about each picture. There are 60 questions originally designed by Buck but art therapists and trained test givers can also design their own questions, or ask follow up questions. This phase is done with a crayon.
During the second phase of HTP, the test-taker draws the same pictures with a pencil or pen. Again the test-giver asks similar questions about the drawings. Note: some mental health professionals only administer phase one or two and may change the writing instrument as desired. Variations of the test may ask the person to draw one person of each sex, or put all drawings on the same page.
Examples of follow up questions: 
Interpretation of results.
By virtue of being a projective test, the results of the HTP are subjective and open to interpretation by the administrator of the exam. The subjective analysis of the test takers responses and drawings aims to make inferences of personality traits and past experiences. The subjective nature of this aspect of the HTP, as with other qualitative tests, has little empirical evidence to support its reliability or validity. This test, however, is still considered an accurate measure of brain damage and used in the assessment of schizophrenic patients also suffering from brain damage. In addition, the quantitative measure of intelligence for the House-tree-person has been shown to highly correlate with the WAIS and other well-established intelligence tests.

Dorothea Ruth Etchells (17 April 19318 August 2012) was an English poet and college principal who spent most of her working life in the University of Durham.
From 1968, she taught in the English Department and soon became Vice Principal of Trevelyan College. In 1979 she was appointed Principal of St John's College, Durham, a notable appointment because this made her both the first lay person and the first woman to be principal of a Church of England college, Cranmer Hall (part of St. John's), that trains clergy, who were in those days only male.
She was a member of the Church of England's Crown Appointments Commission that recommends future appointments of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1992 she was awarded a Lambeth Doctor of Divinity degree.

Leeds Municipal election, 1971

The Leeds municipal elections were held on 14 May 1971, with one third of the councillors up for vote including a double vacancy in Talbot.
Reflecting national patterns, the results were a near mirror-image of the 1968 results, as Labour achieved their highest vote share since 1945, and their greatest number of votes since 1953. It was the Conservatives who sunk to a low-point this time around, setting post-war record lows in both vote percentages and actual votes. However, with the defeat being less severe and the entirety of the council not being elected this time, the Conservatives managed to hold onto control with the superior number of aldermen allotted to them the previous year. Overall turnout across the city was 37.8%.
Starting from such a shrunken base following their overwhelming defeat in 1968, Labour gained over half of seats up for election, as well as holding the seats in the four wards they managed to win previously (City, East Hunslet, Holbeck and Middleton). Labour gained seventeen in total, with all but Castleton from the Conservatives: Armley, Beeston, Bramley, Burley, Burmantofts, Castleton, Gipton, Harehills, Kirkstall, Osmondthorpe, Richmond Hill, Scott Hall, Seacroft, Stanningley, Whinmoor, Woodhouse and Wortley. Castleton was gained from the Liberals, who repeated their success in West Hunslet for the third year running and gained from the Conservatives, leaving their total unchanged.

Julius von Tarent is a dramatic tragedy by Johann Anton Leisewitz. Published in 1774, it is a notable work of the Sturm und Drang era. The play was a favourite of Friedrich Schiller and much acted in Germany. Its central theme is the struggle between the two princes Julius and Guido of Tarent for the affections of commoner Blanca.
Like in Klinger's "Die Zwillinge", "a dynamic but frustrated man of action," Guido, "is opposed to a more pacific, melancholy figure," Julius.
The "Encyclopedia Britannica" describes the play as the forerunner of Friedrich Schiller's famous Sturm und Drang masterpiece "The Robbers" (1781).

Adrian Van de Mosselaer

Adrian Van de Mosselaer (born August 19, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman currently playing with the Ontario Reign of the ECHL.
Early life.
Adrian Van de Mosselaer was born in Terrace, British Columbia in 1990. He was diagnosed with asthma in 2006, and has since taken up the condition as a public cause. In the 2006-07 season he played for the Okanagan Rockets of the BC Hockey Major Midget League after being drafted by the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL in 2005, scoring 5 goals and 21 assists in 32 games, while racking up 102 penalty minutes. He was named to the BC Major Midget League All-Star team that season.
Playing career.
Junior Hockey.
While Van de Mosselaer was originally drafted by the Medicine Hat Tigers of the WHL, he played no games with the team. His first game of junior hockey was played with the Edmonton Oil Kings, with whom he has played his entire junior career wearing the number 2. He scored his first goal in his first career game, playing against the Prince Albert Raiders at home on October 15, 2007. His first career assist came later that season in a game against the Brandon Wheat Kings, playing at home on January 20, 2008. His first career fight occurred in a game playing at home against the Calgary Hitmen on December 11, 2007 near the end of the first period against Hitmen forward Ian Schultz. Over his career with the WHL Van de Mosselaer would engage in 13 regular season fights and one postseason fight.
Van de Mosselaer played from 2007 to 2011 with the Edmonton Oil Kings. He completed the 2007-08 season with 2 additional assists for 4 points and a total of 39 penalty minutes over 53 games. The following season he would improve to 4 goals and 15 assists over 49 games, with 57 penalty minutes, despite suffering a broken leg in January that cut his season short. During the 2009-10 season, he scored 3 goals with 7 assists over 50 games with 92 penalty minutes, which again improved during the 2010-11 season with 7 goals and 15 assists over 66 games, with 137 penalty minutes. During the 2010-11 season, Van de Mosselaer's career games played for the Edmonton Oil Kings became the most in franchise history. Van de Mosselaer also led the team in goals by a defenceman and total penalty minutes during the season and served as assistant captain. He was also awarded the Humanitarian Player of the Year award by the franchise.
In the 2011 WHL playoffs, Van de Mosselaer had 1 assist in the final game of a 4 game sweep by the Red Deer Rebels in the first round. Van de Mosselaer also had 15 penalty minutes over the 4 games. He played more games than any other Oil King this season, but as Van de Mosselaer turned 21 during the offseason, he would not be able to return to the Oil Kings the following season due to the WHL's age restrictions.
Ontario Reign.
On August 16, 2011 he signed his first professional contract with the Ontario Reign of the ECHL for the 2011-12 season. Upon his signing, former Reign Head Coach Karl Taylor said of Van de Mosselaer, "He's going to be a real solid stay-at-home guy ... He's not a guy who's going to fight every day, but he will when it's called for. He brings a lot to the table. With the strength and size he has, he'll be fine." During his rookie season with the Reign wearing the number 18, Van de Mosselaer scored 1 goal and had 9 assists for 10 points over 57 games, with 87 penalty minutes. His first professional goal came on January 31, 2012 playing at home against the Alaska Aces, the same team he had his first assist against playing away on December 17, 2011—one of three he had during the same game. During the 2012 ECHL playoffs, the Reign lost a five game series in the fifth game against the Idaho Steelheads in the first round. Van de Mosselaer received 9 penalty minutes during the series, including a 5 minute penalty for fighting Steelhead Chris Hepp during the second period of the second game of the series.

Sleepytime

Sleepytime (foaled 20 February 1994) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from September 1996 to April 1998 she ran six times and won two races. In two races as a two-year-old she won one race, and finished third in the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot. On her three-year-old debut she was beaten in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury but then won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. On her only subsequent appearance that year she finished third in the Coronation Stakes. After one unsuccessful run in 1998 she was retired from racing to become a successful broodmare.
Background.
Sleepytime, a dark-coated bay filly with a white star, was bred by Charles H. Wacker III and raced in the colours of Wacker's Greenbay Stables. As a two-year-old, Sleepytime was described as having a dragster-like physique, with a "slender, delicate front" and "hugely powerful" hind quarters.
Her sire, Royal Academy won the July Cup at Newmarket and the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1990. At stud, his best winners have included the double Irish St Leger winner Oscar Schindler and the Hong Kong champion Bullish Luck. Sleepytime's dam, Alidiva, who was probably the best horse sired by Chief Singer, won at Listed level and was a half-sister to the Prix d'Ispahan winner Croco Rouge. In addition to Sleepytime produced the Group One winners Taipan (Preis von Europa, Premio Roma) and Ali-Royal (Sussex Stakes). As a descendant of the broodmare Bourtai, Sleepytime and Alidiva came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 9-f which produced Big Spruce and Coastal.
Sleepytime was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in four of her six races by Kieren Fallon.
Racing career.
Sleepytime made her racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Sandown Park in September. Her reputation had already been established by her performances in training and she started at odds of 30/100 against fourteen opponents. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery, Sleepytime took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew away to win by five lengths in what the Racing Post described as a "very impressive" victory. Eleven days later, Sleepytime was moved directly into Group One class for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot and started 6/4 favourite. Sleepytime finished third to her stable companion Reams of Verse after being unable to obtain space for a clear run in the straight. Reams of Verse went on to win the Epsom Oaks in 1997.
In early 1997, Sleepytime was a clear favourite for the 1000 Guineas, after avoiding the respiratory infection which had affected many horses in Cecil's stables. Her training gallops had been highly impressive, making her the choice on many Newmarket experts and insiders. On 18 April, Sleepytime started 4/7 favourite for her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial for the Guineas. The race produced an upset, with Sleepytime, ridden for the first time by Kieren Fallon, finishing fourth behind the 16/1 outsider Dance Parade. Two weeks later, Sleepytime was one of fifteen runners for the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. She started at odds of 5/1, the third choice in the betting behind Pas de Reponse the European champion two-year-old filly of 1996, and the Godolphin challenger Moonlight Paradise. Fallon restrained the filly in the early stages before moving forward three furlongs from the finish. After briefly looking unlikely to find space for a clear run, Fallon sent Sleepytime through a gap to take the lead inside the final furlong. The filly accelerated clear of the field to win by four lengths from Oh Nellie and Dazzle. After the race, Cecil, who was winning the classic for a fifth time, said that "Everything has gone against her but we know how good she is and she proved it today". He also expressed the view that while Sleepytime was likely to improve further, she would not stay beyond a mile and a quarter. In June, Sleepytime started 5/6 favourite for the Group One Coronation Stakes, in which her rivals included the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Classic Park. After travelling well for much of the race she failed to quicken in the closing stages and finished third to the 25/1 outsider Rebecca Sharp. Sleepytime did not run again in 1997. Fallon reportedly felt that the ground had been too firm for the filly to show her best form.
Sleepytime remained in training as a four-year-old and reappeared in April at Newmarket in the Earl of Sefton Stakes. Racing against colts for the first time she was made 5/6 favourite but weakened badly in the closing stages and finished tailed-off last of the seven runners. Sleepytime returned from the race with injuries to her rear fetlocks and was retired from racing.
Assessment.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sleepytime an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Sleepytime became a broodmare for Charles H. Wacker's breeding operation. She has produced several winners including Gentleman's Deal, a colt sired by Danehill, who won nine races including the Winter Derby in 2007.
2001 Gentleman's Deal (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 23 April, by Danehill (USA) - won 9 races (£143,109) including G3 Winter Derby, Lingfield; LR Ladybird Stakes, Kempton; LR Quebec Stakes, Lingfield in England 2004-7
2004 Spanish Harlem (IRE) : Brown colt, 13 February, by Danehill (USA) - won 1 race and 2nd G3 Gallinule Stakes, Curragh in Ireland 2006-7
2009 Lashyn (USA) : Chesnut filly, foaled 16 April, by Mr Greeley (USA) - won 1 race from 4 starts in England 2012

Early life and education.
Zazou was born in 1954. He holds a bachelor of arts degree in commerce from Ain Shams University in 1980.
Career.
Zazou began his career in the City Bank Group for five years in Cairo. Then he helped to establish a tourist agency in the US focusing on the Egyptian market and began to work in the tourism field. From 2004 to 2007, Zazou served as the chair of the Egyptian Tourism Federation.
Political career.
During the Mubarak era, in 2009, Zazou served as the first deputy of the minister of tourism. After the Egyptian uprising, he served as senior assistant to former tourism minister Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour. On 2 August 2012, Zazou began to serve as tourism minister in the cabinet of Hesham Qandil. Although Zazou submitted his resignation on 1 July 2013, it was announced by the state news agency MENA on 15 July that he would continue to serve as tourism minister in the cabinet of interim prime minister Hazem Al Beblawi. Zazou sworn in on 16 July.
Statement on tourism following attack in Sinai.
Following a fatal attack in the Sinai Peninsula in August 2012, in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by armed men who subsequently infiltrated into Israel and were killed by the Israel Air Force, Zazou denied that there was a negative impact on tourism following the attack, and said that tourism agencies did not cancelled reservations and that he was personally calling them to make sure. Zazou stressed that tourists should feel secure in Egypt.
Resignations.
In June 2013, Zazou submitted his resignation in protest at President Morsi's appointment of a member of the Construction and Development party as governor of Luxor - this party being associated with the Jama'a al-Islamiya group, which had killed 62 tourists and local tourism-industry workers in the 1997 Luxor Massacre. Zazou's resignation placed him at the head of a mass protest from all quarters of the Egyptian tourism industry, a main source of foreign currency that is vital to the country's economy. Prime Minister Hisham Qandil "refused the resignation and asked him to stay at his post to review the situation". A few days later the new governor resigned instead.
However, he and four other ministers resigned from office on 1 July due to government's reaction to mass demonstrations in the country. Then prime minister Qandil refused to accept Zazou's resignation, however, and asked him to remain in the post.

Christian Lara (film director)

Christian Lara (born January 25, 1939, in Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) is a Guadeloupean/French film director, writer, cinematographer and producer. Having shot more than twenty feature films in the Caribbean, France, Canada, Africa, he is regarded by many as ""the Father of French Antilles cinema"".
Life and career.
Christian Lara began his professional career in Paris (France) as a journalist for "Le Figaro", a French daily newspaper. As of 1973, he turns film-maker, directing his first movie, "Jeu de dames" (en: "Dames play"), starring Georges de Caunes. That same year, following a then Parisian trend for erotic films, Christian Lara directed "Les Infidèles" (en: "The unfaithfulls"), from a screenplay written by French erotic films director Daniel Daërt (born Jacques Godaert). The two men renewed their collaboration a year after, Lara working as camera operator on Daërt's ninth porn film, "Cours du soir pour monsieur seul" (en: "Night classes for lonely men"). 
He produced a more personal project with French actor Jacques Weber and new-comer Anne Parillaud: "Un Amour de sable" (en: "Sandy Love"), released in 1976.
Aware of the lack of visibility of his fellow Creole people on French movie screens, Lara soon engaged in creating a truly Antillean cinema. In this, he was following the advice legendary cinematographer Ingmar Bergman once gave him, at the time of a three-month stay in Sweden: ""Only film what you truly know!""
For the first feature of his series of "Guadeloupean films", Christian Lara wrote a storyline set during election time in his home island, calling upon Guadeloupean actors Greg Germain (at the time the new star of "Médecins de nuit", a French medical drama television series) and Robert Liensol (an experienced movie actor) to star in the film. Overcoming ambient scepticism and the many difficulties attached to its production, "Coco la Fleur, candidate" was released on February 14, 1979, and received acclaim both in continental France and its overseas dependencies.
Several movies followed, among them "Mamito", the portrayal of a grandmother caught in the social inadequacies of a former French overseas colony that became a full-fledged department of France. Released in 1980, the movie was already raising issues that would be brought up 30 years later during Guadeloupe's 2009 general strike.
Christian Lara was deliberately striving to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Oruno Lara (1879-1924), who was Guadeloupe's first historian of African descent, in featuring the history of the Caribbean, as is apparent from Christian Lara's subsequent historical feature films. 
First, in "Vivre libre ou mourir" (en: "Live Free or Die Hard"), Oruno Lara is credited as original screenwriter. Secondly, Lara himself acknowledges his grandfather's heritage in 1998 when "Sucre amer" (en: "Bittersweet") is released; and again in 2004, when "1802, l'Épopée guadeloupéenne" premiered in France on May 10, the very day of the National Celebration of the Abolition of Slavery.

MV Derrycunihy (1943)

MV "Derrycunihy" (MTS T72) was a British cargo ship impressed as a military transport during World War II. She was sunk off the Normandy beaches with great loss of life in 1944.
Construction.
"Derrycunihy" was general purpose cargo ship of 10,200 tons built (yard number 275) by Burntisland Shipbuilding Company for McGowan & Gross of London. Because of critical shipping requirements during World War II she had been built at great speed: her keel was laid on 22 June 1943, she was launched on 11 November the same year, and was delivered on 26 February 1944. She immediately came under the overall control of the Ministry of War Transport as Motor Transport Ship (MTS) T72, and guns were fitted fore and aft (manned by Army gunners).
Disaster off Normandy.
Shortly after D-Day the ship was selected to transport one of the regiments required for the build-up of troops in the Normandy bridgehead. On 18 June 1944 HQ, A and C squadrons of the 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment ('43 Recce') embarked at West India Docks, London, aboard the "Derrycunihy". She joined a convoy off Southend-on-Sea and arrived off Sword Beach on the evening of 20 June. High seas and enemy shelling prevented unloading for three days and it was decided to move T72 to Juno Beach for disembarkation. As the ship started engines at 07.40 on the morning of 24 June it detonated an acoustic or 'Oyster' mine dropped by one of the nightly Luftwaffe raiders. The mine exploded under the keel, splitting the ship in two, and the after part, packed with sleeping men of 43 Recce, sank rapidly. Worse still, a 3-tonner ammunition lorry caught fire, and oil floating on the water was set alight. Landing craft and the gunboat quickly came alongside and picked up survivors, most of whom were evacuated to SS "Cap Touraine", a former French liner.
When all the survivors had been taken off, Captain Richardson of the "Derrycunihy" and the commanding officer of 43 Recce, Lieutenant-colonel Francis Lane Fox, argued over who should be last to leave the half-sunken ship.
The Regimental War Diary records that 'Great gallantry was displayed by all troops in the two aft holds' and lists 183 men of the regiment lost and about 120 others evacuated wounded. In addition, 25 of the ship's crew (including Army gunners) died in the disaster, which represented the biggest single loss of life off the Normandy invasion beaches.
Aftermath.
In the days following the sinking, most of 43 Recce's vehicles were landed from the beached fore part of the "Derrycunihy", and reinforcements were sent from England, but 43 Recce was not fully up to strength until the end of July 1944 and was unable to assist its parent division in the bitter Battle for Caen.
The sunken after part of the "Derrycunihy" remains as a wreck site off Sword Beach. Another ship built at Burntisland for the Ministry of War Transport, the "Empire Calshot" (1945) was bought by McGowan & Gross after the war and renamed "Derrycunihy".

Anthony Thompson is a Gaelic football wing back. He plays with his local club Naomh Conaill and is a member of the Donegal senior inter-county team.
Thompson's virtuoso performance in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was highlighted by "The Irish Times" which noted how he "seemed to shepherd the play exactly to his liking and moved through the fare in that unhurried, three-quarters pace style of his", at one stage "loitering in front of David Clarke's goal, a "de facto" full forward doing what good front men do: keeping quiet as a church mouse and waiting to be spotted".
Playing career.
Club.
Playing alongside John Gildea in midfield, Thompson scored 3 points, including 2 frees, in the final as Naomh Conaill won their first ever Donegal Senior Football Championship in 2005. He was sent off in the final of the 2009 Donegal Senior Football Championship, which his team lost to Saint Eunan's. His club won the 2010 County Final and went on to reach the final of the 2010 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, knocking out Cavan champions Kingscourt, Monaghan champions Clontibret and Tyrone champions Coalisland along the way.
Inter-county.
With Donegal, Thompson won the 2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship, and played in the final against Derry. He played again when Donegal returned to the final in 2012. Normally a quiet member of the team, in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat of Kerry at Croke Park on 5 August 2012, he knocked teammate Patrick McBrearty out the game with his head. He played in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Mayo. Though nominated for an All Star he was not successful, but was selected as a replacement All Star for the Football Tour of New York.

Ami Miron

Ami Miron is an American Israeli entrepreneur and technology developer specializing in consumer electronics, the Internet, and television. He developed and patented the first Picture In Picture (PIP) for Philips Electronics. Miron also worked to solve the problem of ghost images on television and led the development of the first high-definition television (HDTV) system in the U.S. He received two Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards for these last two innovations.
In his professional career, he has worked for Dutch electronics giant Philips and General Instrument Corporation (acquired by Motorola and now part of Google). In 1997, he founded MoreCom, a software networking company which was sold to Liberate Technologies in 2000.
Miron currently serves as the president of Philadelphia-based AM Partners, which he founded.
Early life and education.
Miron was born and grew up on Kibbutz Ruhama in southern Israel. Miron served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), graduating first in his class from the IDF Officers Academy. He served as an artillery commander on the Sinai front in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and was recognized for his distinguished service as a captain. Miron credits his military experience for helping advance his professional career: "The military let me, at age 20, be in charge of a battalion, where I had to be responsible for all the needs of my unit in war and peace. This background helped my leadership, organizational skills, and my confidence in achieving stretched goals."
Following his military service, Miron earned a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in electrical engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa. He went on to receive a master's degree in electrical engineering (MSEE) from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University and a professional degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University. Miron later completed an executive management program at Babson College.
Career.
Philips Electronics.
After working for Dutch electronics giant Philips in the Netherlands, Miron came to the U.S. in 1981 to work for Philips in America. Miron developed and patented the first Picture in Picture (PIP) system for Philips. He subsequently developed a system to solve the problem of ghost images on television. The FCC selected this Ghost Canceling System as the U.S. standard, which won Miron a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award. Miron won his second Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for leading the development of the first high-definition television (HDTV) system in the U.S., which the FCC then selected as the U.S. standard.
General Instrument Corporation.
In 1993, Miron joined Horsham, Pennsylvania-based General Instrument Corporation (later Motorola and now Google) as vice president to lead advanced technology and new products for the cable television, consumer and telecommunication markets.
MoreCom.
In 1997, Miron left General Instrument to found MoreCom Inc., a software networking company based in Horsham that provided digital entertainment and Internet content to televisions. In 2000, Liberate Technologies acquired the privately held MoreCom in an all-stock deal.
Miron believed that selling the privately held MoreCom was a better option for the company than taking it public, stating, "We are in a world where there is room at the top for three players, and I want to make sure we are part of those players. In many ways, a merger is more powerful than an IPO... Many companies have gone public and not been able to sustain their existence."
Current ventures.
Miron is the founder and president of Philadelphia-based AM Partners, which works with entrepreneurs, start-ups, venture capital, and universities. He serves on the board of Ben Franklin Technology Partners and on the advisory board of Emerald Stage2 Ventures. Miron also serves as a senior advisor at the Wharton Small Business Development Center and an advisor to the Columbia University Entrepreneurship program. He is on the Upper Dublin School District Strategic Planning Committee in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and is a member of several other community organizations.
Personal life.
Miron resides in Dresher, Pennsylvania and is the father to four children.

Royal Corps of Colonial Troops

The Royal Corps of Colonial Troops () was a corps of the Italian armed forces, in which all the Italian colonial troops were grouped until the end of World War II in Africa.
Structure.
Since the beginning of the colonial conquest the Kingdom of Italy created military units with colonial soldiers. The main units included as parts of the "Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali" were:
All these military units underwent a reorganization in the 1930s, but remained active until 1943, when Italy was defeated in WWII.
Structure after 1936.
The Italian Army started to modernize the colonial units in the mid-1930s. During the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and at the beginning of World War II, it also created some Infantry Divisions manned by colonial troops:
In those years, there were also special units composed mainly of colonial troops such as the Maletti Group, the Libyan paratroopers (Ascari del Cielo) and the Italian Africa Police.
History.
These troops were deployed on all fronts in Africa from the First Italo-Ethiopian War, the Italian-Turkish war, the conquest of Ethiopia, until World War II. The colonial soldiers always showed courage and in some cases (like the Eritrean Ascari) fought with heroism.
The colonial troops were commanded by Italian officers and NCOs, while soldiers were drawn from the Italian colonial territories (and to a smaller extent also from neighboring Yemen).
In 1940, 256,000 Askaris in the Italian Royal Army were present in the local Italian colonies. Of these, 182,000 had been recruited in Italian East Africa (Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia) and 74,000 in Libya.
Honours.
The Royal Corps of Colonial Troops has been awarded 4 Gold Medals of Military Valor ("Medaglia d'oro al valor militare"):
Two Gold Medal of Military Valor:

John Newman (singer)

John William Peter Newman (born 16 June 1990) is an English singer and musician. He is best known for the track "Love Me Again" which peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2013 as well as being a featured artist on Rudimental's 2012 singles "Feel the Love" and "Not Giving In", which peaked at number one and number fourteen on the chart, respectively. He was one of the most successful and praised British singers in 2013. He was nominated for three Brit Awards, including for British Male Solo Artist, at the 2014 BRIT Awards. As of February 2014, Newman has sold over 1.3 million records in the UK alone.
Early life and career.
Newman grew up in Settle in the Yorkshire Dales and attended Settle College. When Newman was six, his father left the family, leaving his mother Jackie, his older brother James, and him with a pound a day. In his youth Newman was influenced by Motown and Stax that he heard via his mother. He was also influenced by the Northern Soul sound, which also influenced his dance style. Many over 30s from Settle would leave on a weekend to go to Northern Soul nights all over Yorkshire. He started playing guitar and writing his own songs at the age of 14 and soon learned how to record and produce himself, even making his own house tracks and DJing.
At the age of 16 Newman moved to Leeds and it was here that he developed his voice and sound. It was whilst he was in Leeds that two of his best friends (both involved in professional downhill mountain biking) died in a car crash. Newman said, "In that first year of moving to Leeds, instead of being sat with books all over the library desk and studying music, I actually studied it in a totally different way... because of what I was going through, and I was getting smashed every night and enjoying the student life but then sitting with a guitar and crying all night writing music." It was whilst in Leeds that he also found other people who appreciated Motown and Stax music and a time that Newman said "matured me in a musical way so much, I was writing pop music and now I feel like I'm writing music that I love and can really attach to."
At 20, Newman moved to London, started a band, played live and was signed to Island Records. While working at The Silver Bullet bar, he made friends with Piers Agget, one fourth of Rudimental. He released "Cheating" as a download song and plays an acoustic version of the track at gigs. 
Music career.
2012: Breakthrough.
In May 2012 John Newman featured on Rudimental's single "Feel the Love". The single peaked to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in early-June 2012, the song was also a Top 5 hit in Australia, Belgium, Netherlands and New Zealand. The song has since been certified Double Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The song was also featured in the 2012 video game "" and is used in 2013 promotional advertising for Foxtel Australia. The song used the promo of MTV Latin America The Pauly D Project. In November 2012 he featured on Rudimental's follow-up single, "Not Giving In", which peaked at number fourteen on the UK Singles Chart, the song was also a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand. It came in at number 16 in the 2012 Triple J Hottest 100, announced on Australia Day 2013. It was featured in the first episode of season three of "Teen Wolf".
2013–present: "Tribute".
In June 2013 John Newman released his debut single "Love Me Again" as the lead single from his debut studio album. In an interview with "Digital Spy", Newman was asked if he sensed that the song had something special about it in the studio. He said, "Yeah. The guy I wrote it with, we turned around and had massive grins on our faces thinking, 'There's something good here'. But you just never know how good it is, you know?". Newman was also asked if it was hard to write the lyrics about love and break-up, he said, "No, it's the only place where I really open up to somebody, through my music. I'm producing album and writing it, it's good. I like to keep a hold of everything". The song peaked to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, the song was also a Top 10 hit in more than 10 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland. It has also featured on the soundtrack of the popular videogame FIFA 14. In mid 2013 the remix of "Love Me Again" was remixed by DJ/producer "Kove", and received major airplay on EDM channels including Sirius XM's BPM. On 6 October 2013 he released "Cheating" as the second single from his début studio album. The song peaked to number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, the song has also charted in Belgium and Ireland. His début studio album "Tribute" was released on 14 October 2013. Talking to Digital Spy about the album he said: "I was going through a pretty bad break-up while I was making the album and I felt the title really needed to resonate. This record is a culmination of my life to this point, it's who I am and I wanted to thank everyone who has helped, supported, loved me and been an inspiration to me. I'm so proud of this album, it expresses me as a producer, as a songwriter and an artist, and I can't wait for people to hear it." On 20 October 2013 the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1. Talking to the Official Charts Company Newman said: "It’s such an amazing thing for an artist to have a Number 1 album, especially on a début. It means so much to me and I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported me and helped make this happen. Can't wait to see everyone on tour next week!" In December 2013 he released "Losing Sleep" as the third single from the album. Newman made several appearances on Jools Holland's Hootenanny in 2013, performing solo, with Rudimental, and with Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. Also in December 2013, "Love Me Again" entered the Top 40 charts in Canada and the United States. He was nominated for three Brit Awards, including British Male Solo Artist and British Single of the Year, at the 2014 BRIT Awards.

Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2012

The Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2012 took place in August and September 2012. The party has elections every two years for Leader and Deputy Leader roles and this is the third election since the party decided to switch from having principal speakers to having a leader and a deputy leader, or co-leaders. In May 2012, Caroline Lucas announced that she would not seek re-election, hoping that instead other talented individuals could rise to the top of the party. This was an unexpected development for most Green Party members, and is remarkable in being the only time in recent British political history that a party leader has stepped down voluntarily and without pressure from inside the party.
Subsequently, four candidates announced that they would seek to take over from Lucas. These are: <br>
Pippa Bartolotti - current leader of Wales Green Party from Newport; <br>
Natalie Bennett - former editor of Guardian Weekly from Camden, London; <br>
Peter Cranie - a lecturer from Liverpool; <br>
Romayne Phoenix - former teacher & Chair of the Coalition of Resistance from Lewisham, London.
The incumbent Deputy Leader, Adrian Ramsay, who was widely expected to contest the election for Leader of the party announced that would not stand in that election, nor for re-election as Deputy Leader. Four candidates were successfully nominated for the election for Deputy Leader, these being:<br>
Caroline Allen - a vet from Islington, London;<br>
Will Duckworth - a local councillor & former teacher from Dudley; <br>
Richard Mallender - a local councillor & local council worker from Nottingham;<br>
Alexandra Phillips - a local councillor & teacher from Brighton and Hove.
All members of the party were sent ballot papers in the post with their copy of the party's magazine, 'Green World' at the beginning of August 2012 and had to be returned before 31 August 2012. The result was declared at 11am, Monday 3 September 2012. Natalie Bennett was elected Leader. Will Duckworth was elected Deputy Leader.
Results.
The results were as follows:
Election of Deputy Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales

Single net lease

In United States real estate business a N Lease is one of the less widely utilized net lease structures in which the tenant takes responsibility for some of the property's real estate expenses in addition to their business' operating expenses. "N" stands for "Net", is pronounced "Single Net" and represents the property tax expense, which the tenant is responsible for paying in addition to operating expenses, in a single net lease. Unlike double and triple net leases, the landlord/lessor remains responsible for paying any insurance and maintenance expenses (i.e. in a single net lease the rent the landlord receives is net of property taxes, but not insurance and maintenance).

Dave Bickers (17 January 1938- 6 July 2014) was an English former Grand Prix motocross racer from Coddenham, Suffolk. He won two European motocross championships, and was a member of British motocross teams that won two Motocross des Nations events as well as two Trophée des Nations events. Bickers was awarded the Motorcycle News 'Man of the Year' award in 1960.
In the early 1960s, Bickers was one of the top motorcycle racers in the sport of scrambles, which eventually became more popularly known as motocross. He began competing in motorcycle scrambles at the age of sixteen and was so successful that he was rewarded with a sponsorship from the Dot motorcycle company. His riding talent got him noticed by Greeves factory rider, Brian Stonebridge, who then recommended that Bickers be hired by Greeves in 1958. He won two consecutive 250cc European motocross championships in 1960 and 1961 for the Greeves factory racing team. The European championship was considered to be the world championship at the time, as the sport of motocross had yet to develop outside of Europe.
Bickers was a member of British teams that won the Trophée des Nations event in 1961 and in 1962. He also helped British teams win the Motocross des Nations in 1966 and 1967. As one of the first European riders to race in the United States, Bickers helped to introduce Americans to the sport of motocross. He also competed in the Trans-AMA motocross series in 1971 and 1972.
After retiring from competition, Bickers started a company manufacturing stunt equipment used in the film industry. He also appeared as a stunt double for Roger Moore in "Octopussy" and "Escape to Athena" among other film work.
Bickers died after a stroke on 6 July, 2014.

Point-No-Point Bridge

Point-No-Point Bridge is a railroad bridge crossing the Passaic River between Newark and Kearny, New Jersey in the New Jersey Meadowlands.The swing bridge is the fourth from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it.A camelback through truss bridge, it is owned by Conrail as part of its North Jersey Shared Assets and carries the Passaic and Harsimus Line used by CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern.
A crossing of the Passaic at Point No Point was originally built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in the early 1890s to bypass its mainline and thus shorten the distance to its railyard at Harsimus Cove. At the time the railroad crossed the Passaic at the Centre Street Bridge (no longer in existence) near its Newark station, at the site of today's New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The new "Pennsylvania Cut-off" diverged from the line (now today's Northeast Corridor) at Waverly Yard, crossed the Newark Ironbound and the Passaic to the Kearny Meadows and then crossed the Hackensack River on the Harsimus Branch Lift Bridge. It rejoined the main line at the Bergen Hill Cut, but diverged again using the Harsimus Stem Embankment to reach its freight yards on the Hudson River waterfront north of its passenger terminal at Exchange Place. The PRR also used the Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge to reach its car float operations at Greenville Yard on the Upper New York Bay. 
The Point-No-Point Bridge's creosote-covered piers caught fire in 2000.
While the lower of the 90-mile (140 km) long Passaic River below the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable, commercial maritime traffic upstream of the Point-No-Point Bridge is constricted by the width between its piers when the moveable span is open. Rules regulating the drawbridge operations determined by the US Coast Guard require a 4-hour notice for it to be swung open.

Afton Station Packard Museum

Afton Station Packard Museum, a privately owned automotive museum on U.S. Route 66 in Afton, Oklahoma, is situated in a restored 1930s Eagle D-X filling station. It houses a showroom, 18 Packards & other vintage automobiles plus a collection of Route 66 memorabilia, including items from the now-demolished Buffalo Ranch Trading Post.
A restored set of historic D-X fuel pumps stands in the old station's forecourt and the red and white on blue "Approved Packard Service" dealership logo is proudly displayed atop a signpost.
As a Route 66 information stop for travelers, who come from as far afield as Europe, Australia, and Asia, the station/welcome center distributes maps, guidebooks and memorabilia as well as word-of-mouth information about The Mother Road.
History.
Afton, established 1886 and named for River Afton in Scotland by a railroad surveyor, was once home to a railroad repair facility, turntable and roundhouse. The locomotive repair facility closed in the 1930s, soon after the 1926 designation of U.S. Route 66 in the area. The Eagle D-X station opened in 1933 and has sold various brands of fuel under different owners over the years. In its 1940s heyday, it was one of three stations in a four-block section of US 66. A 1981 photo shows the station as a tin-roof structure with three modern D-X fuel pumps in the forecourt. It was the first 24-hour filling station on Route 66.
The town depended on Route 66 as its economic lifeblood until the construction of Interstate 44 in Oklahoma in 1957 sent the community into decline. Various motels and cafés closed their doors forever; the Buffalo Ranch Trading Post closed upon its owner Aleene Albro's demise in 1997 and was demolished in 2002.
Laurel and David Kane purchased the former D-X station in 1999 to be restored and used to house an existing Packard memorabilia collection. The once-vibrant town, long bypassed by the Interstate highway system, had been reduced to 800 people and a handful of local stores.
Afton Station was recognised as the "Route 66 Business of the Year" at the 2009 International Route 66 Festival in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Sydney state by-election, 2012

A by-election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Sydney was held on Saturday 27 October 2012. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of independent MP Clover Moore due to the preventing dual membership of state parliament and local council. 
Following the 2012 local government elections in which Moore was re-elected for a third term as Lord Mayor of Sydney, Moore resigned from NSW Parliament. Laws passed through NSW Parliament in 2012 ceased dual state parliament and local council representation.
Alex Greenwich, an independent candidate backed by Moore easily won the seat.
Background.
Moore was first elected to the marginal seat of Bligh at the 1988 state election. Her largest primary vote was 43.7 percent in 1991, while her largest two-candidate preferred vote was 64.7 percent in 2003. The seat became Sydney at the 2007 state election, where Moore retained the seat with a primary vote of 39.6 percent (+7.2) and a two-candidate preferred vote of 66.6 percent (+1.6) against Labor. At the 2011 state election, Moore retained the seat with a primary vote of 36.3 percent and a two-candidate vote of 53.1 percent against the Liberals with a primary vote of 36.2 percent (+14.6), the Greens on 12.8 percent (–2.8), and Labor on 11.3 percent (–8.7). In two-party preferred terms, the seat had a Liberal vote of 65.5 percent (+22.4) against Labor.
There was a 16.3 percent two-party preferred swing away from the Coalition government at the 2011 Clarence by-election. The Coalition did not contest the 2012 Heffron by-election which Labor retained with an increased margin. Labor strategically chose not to contest the Sydney by-election.

Medal of John VIII Palaeologus

The medal of John Palaeologus VIII is a portrait medal by the Italian Renaissance artist Pisanello. It is generally considered to be the first portrait medal of the Renaissance. On the obverse of the medal is a profile portrait of the penultimate Byzantine emperor, John VIII Palaeologus; the reverse contains an image of the emperor on horseback before a wayside cross. Although the date of the work is not clear, it was likely to have been some time between 1438-39 when John visited Italy to attend the Council of Ferrara (later moved to Florence) with the aim of uniting the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. It is not known whether the emperor himself or his Italian hosts commissioned Pisanello to make the medal, but Leonello d’Este, the heir apparent to the marquisate of Ferrara, has been suggested as the most likely candidate. Several drawings by Pisanello are closely associated with the medal and these include sketches on leaves now held in Paris and Chicago.
The medal embodies the synthesis of a large number of diverse elements from Classical, Byzantine and Northern Renaissance culture. Its impact on subsequent art was significant: it extended beyond numismatics and the proliferation of outstanding Renaissance medals to influence sculpture and painting. Renaissance artists subsequently used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type to represent exotic or antique figures. This can be seen, for example, in the work of Piero della Francesca who used the image of John in his "Flagellation of Christ" and Arezzo frescoes.
Description.
A number of specimens exist of Pisanello's medal of John; many of these are bronze or lead casts. The bronze example in the British Museum measures 10.3 centimetres in diameter. The obverse of the work portrays a bust of the emperor looking to the right. His hair hangs in corkscrew curls and he sports a moustache and pointed beard. The emperor’s back is curved, giving the suggestion of a slight stoop. He is dressed in a high-necked shirt with an open jacket, with discernible buttons on both garments. The most striking aspect of the portrait is the emperor’s hat: this large garment occupies around half the pictorial space of the obverse. The hat is sharply peaked and its crown is tall, domed and vertically ribbed. Extravagant hats were typical of Byzantine officialdom and many were drawn by Pisanello. At the summit of the hat is a jewel which intrudes into the space of the Greek inscription encircling the portrait. The inscription reads: Ἰωάννης Βασιλεύς καί Αὑτοκρἀτωρ Ῥωμαἰων ό Παλαιολόγός (‘John, king and emperor of the Romans, the Palaeologus’). This style of hat is similar to that which had often been used to represent Mongols in earlier European painting. 
Unlike some of Pisanello's other portrait medals, such as those of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.
Historical context.
The Council of Ferrara.
Pisanello's medal was created in response to John's visit to Italy. The emperor had been invited to attend the council in Ferrara by pope Eugenius IV to address the question of unifying the Latin and Greek churches. One of John's chief motivations for unification was to secure help from the western powers in order to meet the constant threat to his crumbling empire from the Turks. The emperor arrived in Venice in February 1438 where he was met by Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Niccolò, with his sons Leonello and Borso, accompanied the emperor as they rode into Ferrara on the 4 March. Following its first magnificent opening public session on 9 April 1438, the Council was repeatedly postponed until the 8 October to allow the many different representatives of the European rulers to arrive. 
During this lengthy period of waiting for the representatives, the emperor relocated outside of Ferrara because of an outbreak of plague in the city. He occupied himself with hunting: John was a keen huntsman, and his enthusiasm for the sport was such that Niccolò was forced on two occasions to make unsuccessful representations to the emperor requesting that he restrain his hunting activities because of the damage to the local game population and surrounding properties. John was also criticized by the contemporary Greek chronicler Syropoulos (who was possibly Patriarch Sophronius I of Constantinople when a young cleric) for spending "all his time hunting without bothering in the slightest with ecclesiastical affairs."
In order to encourage John's attendance to the Council, the pope offered to pay the expenses of the Greek delegation. Eugenius found this offer extremely difficult to honour, particularly as John's entourage numbered around seven hundred. In January 1439, however, the Council removed to Florence upon the invitation of Cosimo de' Medici to whom the pope was heavily indebted. In Florence contentious points of theology were resolved, particularly the Filioque, which had contributed significantly to the Great Schism. The Decree of Union was signed in Florence in July 1439. When John and his delegation returned to Constantinople, however, the Decree of Union was strongly rejected by the clergy and lay population there. 
Although the exact date of Pisanello's medal is not known, most writers hold that it is more likely to have been made in Ferrara rather than Florence. One reason for this is the existence of a letter dated 12 May 1439 in which Pisanello is promised payment from a church in Mantua, near Ferrara.
Drawings.
Some notable drawings and sketches are associated with Pisanello's medal. One is a highly finished pen drawing of a saddled and harnessed horse from the front and the back (The Louvre, Vallardi, 2468, fol. 277). The horse from the back is clearly the same horse as that of the emperor's squire on the reverse of the medal. The horse is very likely to have come from a Byzantine stable because of its slit nostrils. It was believed in some oriental countries that slitting the nostrils of horses enabled them to breathe easier under exertion. A similarly maltreated horse is depicted in the centre of the Paris sheet of sketches of John and members of his retinue.
The sketches of John on sheets held in Paris and Chicago are the only drawings by Pisanello that can be securely dated and provide firm evidence of his presence in Ferrara. The figure on the horse in the recto of the Paris leaf (Louvre MI 1062) is undoubtedly the emperor because of the Italian inscription above the figure, part of which reads: "The hat of the Emperor should be white on top and red underneath, the profile black all around. The doublet of green damask, and the mantle of top crimson. A black beard on a pale face, hair and eye-brows alike." Pisanello's references to colours on this sheet suggests that the artist intended to do a painting of the emperor.
Scholars differ as to the circumstances of the production of the Paris and Chicago sheets and what they depict. It has been argued that Pisanello made his drawings at the opening of the first dogmatic session on 8 October 1438 when the emperor, in a characteristic insistence on punctilio, required that he be allowed to proceed on horseback to his throne in the council chamber. While the emperor and his retinue waited outside for this impossible demand to be accommodated, Pisanello therefore had the opportunity to sketch the emperor and members of his delegation, including perhaps Joseph II. Contrary to this position, however, is the argument that every figure (except the standing figure in the centre of the Chicago recto) is a drawing of the emperor. This view argues that the Paris and Chicago leaves show Pisanello’s early attempt to formulate the composition of the medal by sketching the emperor in diverse poses wearing different hats and robes.
Influences on the creation of Pisanello's medal.
Humanism and Ancient Rome.
It is probable that the Pisanello's portrait medals were cast with the intention of reviving the form of ancient coins. Pisanello’s medal of John can be firmly located within a period when the court at Ferrara was witnessing an escalation in the appreciation of classical learning. Niccolò III d’Este was the first lord of Ferrara to be educated by a Renaissance humanist and in 1429 he invited the humanist scholar, Guarino da Verona, to tutor his son Leonello. Leonello cultivated a strong admiration for writers like Cicero. During his reign in the 1440s he resolved to revitalise the "Studium" of Ferrara by recruiting more humanist scholars to work there. Part of this appreciation gave rise to the study of ancient coins: these were the most enduring and abundant artefacts available from antiquity and Leonello himself was an enthusiastic numismatist. Pisanello’s own personal interest in Roman coins is vividly apparent from his drawings of them, and his successful development of the portrait medal as a medium of sculpture can be explained in part to its similarity to coins. The medal evoked a powerful link to antiquity which made it very appealing to patrons.
It has been suggested that Leon Battista Alberti may have played a significant role in Pisanello's conception of the medal of John. Alberti attended the Council in Ferrara as a member of the papal Curia and could therefore have encountered Pisanello. Between 1430-35, Alberti cast a bronze, self-portrait plaque in a style that was clearly influenced by Roman imperial portraits. Alberti's plaque was the first labeled self-portrait of an artist.
Franco-Burgundian culture.
In Northern Italian city-states like Ferrara, the literary culture of high society in the early fifteenth century was more French than Italian, hence there was a strong culture of chivalry in these areas. Pisanello's medal reflects this culture in its portrayal of John as a huntsman. Hunting was regarded as a noble activity in Italy and was a central ingredient in medieval Romance literature. Franco-Burgundian art in particular celebrated the hunt and certain images of animals by Pisanello are thought to have derived from miniatures from the canonical version of the "Livre de Chasse" by Gaston Phoebus.
The reverse of the medal is similar in many respects to Pisanello's "Vision of St Eustace". This painting also presents a huntsman on horseback arrested by the sight of a cross. This painting itself contains animals that seem to have derived from illuminations in French hunting treatises.
The similarity between John and St Eustace in Pisanello's respective representations could signify the artist's attempt to present John as a modern St Eustace.
Constantine and Heraclius medals.
Two important prototypes for Pisanello's portrait medal were copies of the medals of the emperors Constantine and Heraclius. It is believed that Jean, duke of Berry commissioned the medals to be copied from originals, now lost, during the period 1402–1413. The original Constantine medal was purchased by the duke from a Florentine merchant in 1402, which closely associates the medals with the visit of John’s father, Manuel II Palaeologus, to Paris from 1400 to 1402. The Heraclius medal was likely to have been acquired at the same time. Jean’s acquisition of the medals could have been intended as gifts for the Byzantine emperor in response to a group of relics Jean received from Manuel. The political context in which Jean de Berry’s medals were purchased was therefore similar to that in which Pisanello cast his medal of John: Manuel II, like his son after him, also visited the west in an attempt to secure protection for Constantinople from the Ottomans. The context of their purchase and the lack of any numismatic precedent for the medals suggests the originals may well have had Byzantine "enkolpia" as their model: these were sacred objects "worn about the neck and endowed with spiritual efficacy’.
The Constantine and Heraclius medals were widely circulated in Italy and the Heraclius medal was recorded in an inventory of Niccolò d’Este’s treasures in 1432. Pisanello’s familiarity with both medals seems unquestionable because of their similarity in size and design to the medal of John VIII. Pisanello appears to have merged various elements from both medals to produce a single piece. The obverse of the Constantine medal, for example, is an equestrian portrait, and that of the Heraclius medal is a profile portrait. Like Pisanello’s medal, the obverse of the Heraclius medal shows the emperor with a servant and contains text in both Greek and Latin. Both emperors were associated with the True Cross, which is portrayed on their obverses. The ownership of the True Cross relic was something of which the Palaeologus dynasty was very proud, making these highly appropriate models for Pisanello to use. It is not known whether Pisanello believed the medals to have come from antiquity or if he was aware of their more recent French background. It is certainly plausible that he observed their similarity of style with that of French illuminated manuscripts and therefore hoped to harness, through his medal, their associations with the culture of chivalry rather than antiquity. The bold yet refined technique and style of Pisanello's medal is nevertheless clearly different from that of the more overtly intricate Constantine and Heraclius medals.
Impact on art.
The success of Pisanello's medal is evident from the flow of commissions that the artist received from patrons including Filippo Maria Visconti and Francesco Sforza. It initiated the creation of a new art form in which Pisanello set the highest standards that later medallists found hard to equal.
The success of the medal is also clear from the number of Renaissance sculptors, illuminators and painters who used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type for figures from distant lands or times. Piero della Francesca is perhaps the most celebrated artist in this respect. In his fresco of Constantine leading his troops into battle by the Milvian Bridge in the The History of the True Cross series of frescos in Arezzo, the portrait and headgear of Constantine is clearly modeled on Pisanello's medal. Piero also used Pisanello's portrait of John to depict Pontius Pilate in his "Flagellation of Christ".
Other notable artists who were either directly or indirectly acquainted with Pisanello's image of John include Filarete, whose bronze doors for St. Peter's Church in Rome from 1445 depicts the journey home of John from the Council of Florence, and Gozzoli who used John's image as a model to depict one of the magi in his Magi Chapel.

Islamic Center of Murfreesboro

The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro (ICM) is an Islamic community organisation located in the town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, United States. Established in the early 1980s, the ICM supports about a thousand congregants, drawn from local permanent residents and students at Middle Tennessee State University.
By 2009, the ICM's growth made the existing mosque and community center in central Murfreesboro inadequate for the number of worshippers using those facilities. The ICM bought a vacant lot on the outskirts of Murfreesboro and submitted plans to build a new community center and mosque on the site. Although the plans were approved unanimously by the local county planning commission, they sparked intense opposition from some local residents and anti-Islamic activists. Rival demonstrations were held in the town to express support for and opposition to the mosque project.
During the following two years, the mosque site was subjected to vandalism and arson, and the ICM was accused by a number of politicians, commentators and activists of supporting terrorism and of plotting to overthrow the US Constitution and impose Sharia law. Opponents of the mosque project sued to block its construction, arguing that Islam was not a religion. A local judge rejected that claim and found that the planning commission did not act improperly in granting approval, but found that public notice of the planning commission's hearing on the action was inadequate. The court therefore prohibited the issuance of a certificate of occupancy necessary to use the building. In August 2012, a US federal court lifted the county court's prohibition, and the building was allowed to open in time for the end of Ramadan.
Background.
Murfreesboro is a town of about 100,000 people located in Middle Tennessee about 30 miles south of the state capital, Nashville. Although the area's population is dominated by white conservative Christians, in recent years the foreign-born population of the Nashville metropolitan area (including Murfreesboro) has grown considerably. Between 2000 and 2008, the immigrant population jumped from 58,539 to 107,184 – an 83.1 percent rise, the fourth-largest percentage increase in the United States over that period. At the same time, the white population of the area fell by 7.5% while the percentage of ethnic minority inhabitants rose to 20% of Rutherford County's population. The local Muslim population has likewise increased and now numbers about 25,000 people. The rise has been driven in part by the arrival of refugees from Somalia and Kurds from Iraq, who were resettled there by the federal government upon fleeing the repression of Saddam Hussein after the first Gulf War. Middle Tennessee now has the largest population of Iraqi Kurds in the United States. A significant number of foreign-born Muslims have also moved to the area to study at Vanderbilt University or Middle Tennessee State University.
Established in 1982, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro (ICM) formerly occupied a building of located on Middle Tennessee Boulevard near Middle Tennessee State University. Its congregation consists of about 250-300 local families and 400-500 Muslim students from the university – in total, about 1,000 people. By 2009, the congregation had outgrown the space available. Prayers were held in a poorly ventilated room while women, who worship separately from men, had to use a converted garage nearby to watch the proceedings on closed-circuit TV. Many worshippers frequently had to stand in the parking lot during prayers.
The ICM began looking for a new location in March 2009. Members raised about $600,000 to fund the construction of a new complex that would include a mosque, school, swimming pool, and cemetery. In November 2009, the ICM purchased an area of undeveloped land at the intersection of Bradyville Pike and Veals Road on the outskirts of Murfreesboro, about from its existing facilities in the town center, at a cost of $320,000 cash. A sign advertising the "Future Site of Islamic Center of Murfreesboro" was put up on the vacant lot but in January 2010 it was vandalized during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day weekend when someone spray-painted the words "NOT WELCOME" on the sign. The local newspaper, "The Daily News Journal", condemned the vandalism as "a sign of stupidity" and commented that "for someone to paint such an idiotic message on the center's billboard is a clear sign that we have some backwards nuts in our midst." The sign was replaced but was subsequently ripped up and destroyed.
Planning controversy.
In April 2010, the ICM sent the Regional Planning Commission of Rutherford County a request for the approval of the construction of a complex on the Veals Road lot. Prior to its next meeting the commission ran an advertisement in "The Murfreesboro Post" newspaper. The main local newspaper, "The Daily News Journal", also published a small news story on the day of the meeting. The commission unanimously approved the ICM's plans at its monthly meeting on May 24, 2010. County law did not require public hearings on religious construction projects and took a "use-by-right" approach, under which all that was needed for approval was a satisfactory set of plans, the approval of the commission at one public meeting, and the advertisement of that meeting in advance in a local newspaper. Other local religious buildings, such as the World Outreach Church, had been approved on a similar basis. Additionally, federal and state law made it all but impossible for local government bodies to deny building permits for religious institutions.
Although the application process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke out after the ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had only become aware of the plans after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: "Everybody knows they are trying to kill us. People are really concerned about this. Somebody has to stand up and take this country back."
Other residents complained that the new mosque would have a harmful effect on traffic and housing values, noting that it was located in a primarily residential area. Commission officials rejected the criticism, stating that the plans met zoning requirements and that the law did not allow them to reject a project on religious grounds. The tenor of the opposition attracted criticism, with some residents calling the dispute "one of the ugliest displays of religious intolerance in the county's history." Rabbi Rami Shapiro of Middle Tennessee State University blamed misinformation and misplaced fears, commenting that "there are some who are just anti-Muslim and will do anything to keep a mosque out of their neighborhood. They really feel that Islam is a threat to America and American values." Essam Fathy, an ICM member, said: "We have nothing to hide. We do not have a hidden agenda. We're not affiliated with anyone. Where is the tolerance?" The mosque's imam, Ossama Bahloul, said that he had told a child that the hatred faced by the center was "just a misunderstanding, miscommunication. I told him to love the people because one day they can love you, too."
The controversy gained national currency soon afterwards when it was taken up by Lou Ann Zelenik, a Tennessee Republican Party candidate for the vacant representative's seat in Tennessee's 6th congressional district. In a statement issued on June 24, 2010, Zelenik denounced the planned mosque as "an Islamic training center" that was not a "bona fide" religious institution but a political one "designed to fracture the moral and political foundation of Middle Tennessee". She declared: "Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to open our society to any of them." Ben Lemming, a Democrat candidate for the same seat, was one of the few Tennessee politicians to support the mosque project, stating: "The Americans that want to build this mosque are already our neighbors. They live next to us and they are a part of our community. They are not the enemy."
Another Republican, Ron Ramsey, the Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, questioned whether Islam is "actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult or whatever you want to call it" and described it as resembling "a violent political philosophy more than peace-loving religion." His comments, made in the runup to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who called them part of "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what "The American Prospect" described as "one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country", authorizing the state attorney general to designate "Sharia organizations" and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, though the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam. Hedy Weinburg of the American Civil Liberties Union's Tennessee branch saw the controversy as part of a trend; she told "The American Prospect" that "[you don't have to dig too deep to see and hear the very rampant xenophobia and anti-Muslim voices."
In mid-July 2010, supporters and opponents of the mosque organised rival marches to the Rutherford County courthouse. Around 800 people turned up, with about the same number on either side. Supporters organised by a group called Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom promoted slogans such as "Freedom of religion means freedom for all religions", while opponents circulated a petition asking the planning commission to overturn its decision and expressed concerns that the mosque's members wanted to overthrow the U.S. government and impose Islamic law. The mosque's opponents wore "Vote for Jesus" t-shirts, carried signs with slogans such as "Keep Tennessee Terror Free", chanted "USA! USA!", conducted Christian group prayers and heard anti-mosque pastor Dusty Ray of the Heartland Baptist Church telling them, "Lord, we're trying to stop a political movement."
Televangelist Pat Robertson weighed in during August 2010, telling his TV audience, "You mark my word, if they start bringing thousands and thousands of Muslims into that relatively rural area the next thing you know they're going to be taking over the city council." Murfreesboro's mayor, Ernest Burgess, called Robertson's claims "so ridiculous they do not deserve a response." Opposition was also fanned by a local newspaper, the ultra-conservative "Rutherford Reader", which published numerous anti-Islamic articles that eventually resulted in some of its advertisers boycotting the newspaper after protests from readers. As the barrage of criticism from right-wingers continued, the ICM received a series of threatening and offensive anonymous telephone messages.
Reviewing the controversy, the Nashville daily newspaper "The Tennessean" noted that in 1929 another faith group which was controversial at the time had faced opposition, led by the Ku Klux Klan, to its establishment in Murfreesboro. The building of the Roman Catholic church of St. Rose of Lima had prompted a march by angry residents to the town courthouse to highlight their fears that the project would endanger their security and way of life, amid claims that "suspicious outsiders" were funding it. The church was built to serve recently arrived Irish, German and Italian immigrants.
The newspaper highlighted four factors driving the opposition to the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a "swell of fear and hatred" prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being "the wrong kind of Christians", and it was now the turn of Muslims to feel the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, a lot of people have very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue."
Litigation and attacks against the ICM.
The Planning Commission gave final approval to the building plans in early August 2010 and on August 20, contractors broke ground on the site. Only a week later, on August 28, an arsonist doused four excavators with an accelerant and set one on fire, destroying it. The incident was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a $20,000 reward was announced for "information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators". Although the attack did not substantially delay the construction project, it had the effect of worsening local tensions. Tennessee's governor, Phil Bredesen, responded to the incident by calling on state residents to "please have great respect for anyone's religious preferences and their rights to practice those in the United States" while Republican Sue Myrick, a North Carolina member of the United States House of Representatives, called the attack "un-American". Two days after the fire, 150 local residents attended a candle-lit vigil on the steps of the Rutherford County Courthouse to protest the arson attack. Many Christians, some of whom had sons fighting in Afghanistan, sent messages of support to the ICM which posted them on a "wall of support" in its existing building. One local resident said that the planned mosque didn't "bother me because everybody has a right to practise their religion. They've been here, they're quiet. They haven't bothered anybody."
The planning commission's September 16, 2010 meeting was dominated by supporters of the mosque, who said that they represented the majority opinion in Murfreesboro and expressed concern that the controversy was hurting the town. One of the most influential supporters was Ernest Burgess, the Republican mayor of Murfreesboro and an elder at the North Boulevard Church of Christ, who argued that it was a matter of principle to uphold the constitutions of the United States and the state of Tennessee. However, the following day, several opponents of the ICM filed a lawsuit against the county to block the mosque's construction.
The litigation was spearheaded by a local lobbyist, Laurie Cardoza-Moore, who demanded that the Rutherford County sheriff investigate a supposed conspiracy linking the mosque with Islamic militants in Somalia and Gaza and told a Christian television station that the mosque was part of a plot to take over Middle Tennessee. Cardoza-Moore led a group called Proclaiming Justice To The Nation (PJTN) which funded the lawsuit via donations, many coming from individuals whom the plaintiffs called as witnesses in the hearing. One witness admitted that PJTN had paid him thousands of dollars to read to the court extracts from anti-Muslim Internet websites.
Kevin Fisher, an anti-mosque activist who had led the July protest march, was one of the three plaintiffs. He claimed that the planning commission had improperly rushed the application process in an attempt to avoid a panic among the local population - a claim that was dismissed by the director of the commission. He had walked out of the planning commission's meeting the previous day, telling the "Murfreesboro Post" newspaper, "All I heard was this socialist garbage being spewed by the pro-mosque crowd. It was too much. The things that they represent offend me."
The plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order to halt construction and called for the construction permit to be nullified, arguing that the planning commission had broken state law by not giving adequate notice of the meeting at which the ICM's building plans had been approved. They also claimed that the project put local residents at risk because "there was considerable evidence of elevated risks to the public safety of citizens of Rutherford County from the proposed ICM compound." The plaintiffs sought to justify their lawsuit with the claim that they "have been and will be irreparably harmed by the risk of terrorism generated by proselytising for Islam and inciting the practices of sharia law," which, they claimed, "advocates sexual abuse of children, beating and physical abuse of women, death edicts, honour killings, killing of homosexuals, outright lies to Kafirs (those who don't submit to sharia law), Constitution-free zones, and total world dominion."
The Anti-Defamation League intervened in the case, "Estes v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission", to support the mosque on the grounds that the plaintiffs were seeking to unjustifiably interfere with the builders' religious freedoms. The ADL's amicus brief pointed out that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) requires courts to "apply a strict standard for reviewing laws that substantially burden religious exercise." The United States Department of Justice also submitted an amicus brief to support the county's position. As well as reiterating the requirements of RLUIPA, the Justice Department's brief affirmed that Islam was protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and emphasized that mosques should be treated no differently from churches or synagogues. The local U.S. Attorney, Jerry Martin, commented that the suggestion by the plaintiffs that Islam was not a religion was "quite simply ridiculous." He told a press conference that "ll three branches of government have repeatedly recognized Islam as a religion. Presidents, as far back as Lincoln and Jefferson and as recent as President George W. Bush, have, indeed, publicly recognized Islam as one of the world's largest religions."
Despite this, the plaintiffs' lawyer spent six days trying to convince the court that Islam should not be considered a religion and that the mosque was not entitled to religious land use zoning regulations "because these are the same people who flew jets into the World Trade Center on 9/11." The lawyer, Joe Brandon Jr, called a series of non-expert witnesses including anti-Islam activist Frank Gaffney, accused the ICM of being linked to terrorism, and claimed that its members wanted to impose Sharia law on the United States. The proceedings were criticised by the county's attorney as a "circus". The media compared the case to the Scopes Monkey Trial, held in Tennessee in 1925, at which evolution was effectively put on trial, while "Miami Herald" columnist Leonard Pitts characterised the mosque's opponents as a "clownish band of bigots".
On November 17, 2010 Rutherford County Chancellor Robert Corlew refused to halt construction, and finding that the county had not "acted illegally, arbitrarily or capriciously" in approving the plans. He said that there were some legitimate concerns about the county's public notice requirements and suggested that they should be reviewed, but found that the ICM's members did not adhere to extremist religious ideas. In his ruling, he dismissed the plaintiffs' claims that "Kevin Fisher, an African American Christian, would be subject to being a second-class citizen under Sharia law; Lisa Moore would be targeted for death under Sharia law because she's a Jewish female; Henry Golzynski has been harmed because he lost a son fighting in Fallujah, Iraq, by insurgents pursuing jihad as dictated by Sharia law."
Controversy over the mosque continued despite the failure of the lawsuit. In July 2011, Herman Cain, a former pizza tycoon and candidate for the 2012 U.S. Republican Party presidential nomination, told Fox News viewers that communities including the residents of Murfreesboro should have the right to block mosques being built in their areas, arguing that in the case of Murfreesboro "it's not a mosque for religious purposes". His remarks were strongly criticised by commentators. His comments "demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the U.S. Constitution", according to Stephen Fotopulos of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, while the ICM's imam Ossama Bahloul said it was "sad to hear these words coming from a GOP presidential candidate, who is not only supposed to believe in but should also uphold the US constitution. Mr. Cain is encouraged to educate himself about the first amendment and learn more about our peaceful and productive Muslim community in Murfreesboro."
The ongoing controversy had an impact both on the building project, with some contractors becoming hesitant to help, and on local community relations. According to Professor Saleh Sbenaty of Middle Tennessee State University, a board member of the ICM, "kids asking their mothers who have head scarves not to go to the malls because they're scared of seeing their mom being harassed" while adults had become "afraid to come to the mosque and pray." One contractor told ICM officials that although he needed the work, "I don't want to get on bad terms with my preacher." The ICM had to pay significantly more for the project because of contractors' reluctance to work on it, as well as having to hire a security guard to protect the Veals Road construction site and installing a security system in its existing building.
Although Corlew had rejected the claims that the county acted improperly is permitting construction of the mosque, in September 2011 he granted the plaintiffs permission to challenge whether the county's approval of the mosque had violated open meeting laws. A few days later, an anonymous caller left a bomb threat on the ICM's voicemail, accompanied by "extreme profanities and derogatory remarks toward Muslims." Federal authorities later arrested and charged Javier Alan Correa, a 24-year-old resident of Corpus Christi, Texas. Correa was charged with violating the civil rights of mosque members by infringing on their religious freedom and faces up to 30 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted.
Further litigation and federal intervention.
In the fall of 2011, seventeen plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Rutherford County alleging that it had violated Tennessee's open-meetings law. Their attorney also tried to argue that the approval of the mosque violated their constitutional rights on the grounds that "mosque members were compelled by their religion to subdue non-Muslims." This was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, leaving the question of whether there had been sufficient public notice for the planning commission's meeting of May 24, 2010 as the only remaining issue to be decided. Nonetheless the plaintiffs' attorney tried to expand their case to cover wider issues, seeking to compare the mosque unfavourably to a neighboring Baptist church: "Are you aware of any information linking Grace Baptist Church to organizations that call for the killing of Americans?" Because the Islamic Center was not named as a defendant, its members were unable to defend themselves in court against such accusations. If the case went against them, they would be forced to seek fresh approval in a climate that had become intensely hostile towards them. Saleh Sbenaty, a Syrian-born spokesman for the ICM, called the attacks "draining" and said that he had "left my country over 30 years ago to get my freedom over here, and now that's being threatened. My First Amendment rights are under fire."
The issue of whether adequate notice had been given was complicated by the fact that Tennessee law did not define what would count as adequate, and the issue had never been satisfactorily settled in court. The county contended that the notice that had been given – an advertisement in the Sunday edition of the local free newspaper and on that paper's website – met the requirements of the law. Its attorney, Josh McCreary, noted that the approval of the mosque had been a routine matter that had not been controversial at the time, and that the public controversy had been stirred up by the plaintiffs after the fact to make the situation "notorious". He told the court: "In this instance, everything they are relying on to prove this is a matter of pervasive public importance came after the lawsuit was filed".
Chancellor Corlew ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on May 29, 2012, finding that the county had not given adequate public notice to the planning commission's meeting. The ruling found that only about 196 copies of "The Murfreesboro Post" newspaper, in which the meeting was advertised, had been distributed in unincorporated areas of Rutherford County, where a third of the county's population lived. The county had also failed to advertise the meeting on its website or local cable channel, which officials acknowledged had been an oversight. Corlew stated in his opinion that because of the great public interest in the mosque, the county should have taken extra steps to make the public aware of the meeting. Although the ruling voided the planning commission's approval, the judge noted that the commission was free to reconsider the issue and come to a fresh decision as long as it was taken for "non-discriminatory reasons."
The judge did not order a halt to the mosque's construction, which was by that point nearly finished, but its opponents returned to court to ask for the construction to be suspended. Their bid was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, who ruled that a separate motion would need to be filed. The opponents' subsequent motion to halt construction was denied by Corlew on June 13 but he ruled that the county could not issue the ICM with an occupancy certificate because he had previously voided the approval of the site plan. On June 22, the county appealed the judgment and requested that the court lift the injunction on issuing an occupancy certificate. The request was turned down on July 2, meaning that the full court process – taking up to a year – would be required.
On July 18, however, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging that the county violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. The ICM also filed suit in the same US District Court. The Justice Department's filing criticized Corlew for treating the mosque unequally by imposing a heightened requirement of notice of a kind to which other religious organizations had not been subject. Judge Todd Campbell issued a temporary restraining order requiring the county to conduct a final inspection and to issue a certificate of occupancy if the inspection showed that the structure complied with the building code and applicable regulations. In response, Chancellor Corlew stayed his own actions under the doctrine of Federal preemption but made it clear that he had been preparing to order the full cessation of construction had the federal authorities not stepped in. The mosque's opponents filed a motion in the federal district court, claiming that Judge Campbell had accepted "false allegations" and once again questioning whether Islam was a religion.
The local US Representative, Republican Diane Black, and her primary opponent, Lou Anne Zelenik, both issued statements criticizing the federal intervention. Black said: "Christians' rights to freedom of religion are violated frequently and the Obama Justice Department doesn't come rushing to our aid, but they will meddle in a local zoning matter to promote Islam." The mosque's imam, Ossama Bahloul, told the media that the ruling was a victory for religious freedom: "We are here to celebrate the freedom of religion and that the concept of liberty is a fact existing in this nation. The winner today is not an individual, the winner today is our nation and the fact that our Constitution prevailed." Luke Goodrich of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a national civil liberties organization, said: "No congregation should have its right of religious liberty curtailed solely because some of its neighbors disapprove of its religious beliefs. No religion is an island. When the rights of one faith are abridged, the rights of all faiths are threatened. All faiths have the right to worship God in freedom and in peace."
Opening.
After final safety checks, the new mosque finally received a temporary certificate of occupancy on August 7, 2012, during Ramadan. The building opened on August 10 for Friday prayers. Although there were concerns about public safety in the wake of recent violence against Sikhs and Muslims elsewhere in the country, the occasion passed off peacefully. A single opponent turned up in an "I Love Jesus" hat and told reporters that he was there to "represent the Christians".
Shortly before the opening, members of the neighboring Grace Baptist Church erected 13 white crosses in a field across the road from the mosque "to make a statement to the Muslims about how we felt about our religion, our Christianity. We wanted them to see the crosses and know how we felt about things." Ossama Bahloul of the ICM told worshippers, "This day is a day of forgiveness. We want to say that we have nothing bad in our heart against anyone." "The New York Times" praised the forebearance of the ICM's members in an editorial published on August 19, noting that "ith patience and dignity, the Islamic Americans of Murfreesboro learned the hard way the endless American lesson that constitutional rights don't come guaranteed."
The mosque received its permanent certificate of occupancy on August 23 after the county completed its inspections of the new building. However, the litigation continued as the mosque's opponents sought to intervene in the federal case and the county continued its appeal to a higher state court against Chancellor Corlew's May decision.

Episode 14 (Twin Peaks)

"Episode 14", also known as "Lonely Souls", is the seventh episode of the second season of the American mystery television series "Twin Peaks". The episode was written by series co-creator Mark Frost and directed by series co-creator David Lynch. It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Ray Wise and Richard Beymer; and guest stars Frank Silva as Killer Bob, Hank Worden as The Waiter and David Lynch as Gordon Cole.
"Twin Peaks" centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, during the ongoing investigation into Laura's death, FBI special agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) and Sheriff Truman (Ontkean) continue to search for her killer, the demon Bob, who has possessed a human host. Aided by Mike (Al Strobel), Cooper and Truman arrest Benjamin Horne (Beymer), believing him to be inhabited by Bob. Later that night, Cooper is warned by The Giant (Carel Struycken), while Bob's real host, Leland Palmer (Wise), murders Madeline Ferguson (Lee).
"Episode 14" was first broadcast on November 10, 1990, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 17.2 million households in the United States, about 20 percent of the available audience. The episode was well received, garnering positive reviews after its initial broadcast and in subsequent years, but it has been criticized for unduly prolonging the revelation of Laura's killer. Academic readings of the entry have highlighted the theme of duality and use of cinematography in the revelation scene.
Plot.
Background.
The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate, and has come to the realization that the killer was possessed by a demonic entity—Killer Bob (Frank Silva). Mike (Al Strobel), a similar spirit, has spoken to Cooper and his FBI superior, Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch), explaining the nature of their existence.
Meanwhile, Madeline "Maddy" Ferguson (Lee), Laura's cousin, has arrived in Twin Peaks from Missoula, Montana, and helps Laura's friends Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and James Hurley (James Marshall) investigate the killing. Donna finds Harold Smith (Lenny Von Dohlen), one of Laura's friends to whom she had given a secret diary, and Donna and Maddy attempt to steal it from him.
Events.
Cooper, Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) and Mike visit The Great Northern hotel in an attempt to find Bob's human host. Upon their arrival, Mike goes into a spasm, indicating that Bob has inhabited someone nearby. Meanwhile, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) visits the residence of Harold Smith and finds that he has committed suicide. Hawk contacts Cooper and Truman, and they arrive at Smith's residence and discover Laura Palmer's secret diary among his belongings. Meanwhile, Maddy announces she is leaving Twin Peaks to return home.
Elsewhere, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) discuss their financial concerns regarding Shelly's catatonic husband Leo (Eric Da Re). Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) confronts her father Ben (Richard Beymer) over his ownership of One Eyed Jacks, a casino and brothel on the Canada–United States border. When Audrey asks him whether he killed Laura Palmer, he denies it but confesses that he and Laura had a sexual relationship and that he loved her. Later, Shelly arrives for work at the Double R Diner and announces to its owner Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) that she is resigning to care for Leo full-time. Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and his wife Nadine, who is experiencing amnesia and adrenaline-induced strength, enter the diner. Nadine, believing she is eighteen years old, speaks to Norma, but the waitress, along with Ed, puts on a façade and conceals the truth. Meanwhile, Bobby and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) break open the sole of Leo Johnson's shoe, discovering a microcassette.
Cooper examines the remains of Laura's diary at the police station, finding repeated references to Bob's long-running molestation of her. Cooper also learns that Bob is a friend of Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), and finds an entry that seemingly implicates Ben Horne. Audrey then enters and tells Cooper about Ben and Laura's affair. After she leaves, Cooper tells Sheriff Truman about The Giant's message "without chemicals, he points". Cooper recalls when Mike—who becomes active when his human host, Philip Gerard, is not on drugs—spasmed in The Great Northern's lobby when Ben entered. Cooper concludes that Ben is Bob's human host and arrests him.
Later that night, Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) crawls across her living room floor and has a vision of a white horse. Cooper and Truman visit The Roadhouse at the behest of the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson). While a band performs, Cooper has a vision of The Giant, who tells him "it is happening again" twice. The Giant sees Leland Palmer fixing his tie, while his reflection in the mirror shows Bob. Maddy comes downstairs and sees Bob standing over Sarah's unconscious body. Bob's visage shifts back and forth between Leland's and his own. He chases Maddy up the stairs, brings her to the living room and repeatedly strangles, punches, taunts and kisses her before ramming her head into a glass picture frame, killing her. Bob places a letter "O" under her fingernails, as he had done with other letters on past victims. Cooper's vision ends, and The Waiter (Hank Worden) tells Cooper he is sorry. Donna and James cry during the band's final song.
Production.
"Episode 14" was written by series co-creator Mark Frost, who had written six previous episodes and directed the first season finale, "Episode 7". Frost co-wrote three further installments—"Episode 16", "Episode 26" and "Episode 29". This episode was directed by Lynch, the fifth such episode of "Twin Peaks"; he later directed "Episode 29", the series' finale. It was rated TV-14 in the United States during its original television broadcast; it was later re-rated to TV-PG. Lynch has later stated that he feels he was able to show more on screen in the episode than he expected the network's standards and practicies office to allow. He credits this to the unusual imagery used, adding "if it's not quite standard it sneaks through, but it could be that the 'not quite standard' things make it even more terrifying and disturbing".
The cast of "Twin Peaks" did not know who would be revealed as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland would not be the eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said "Ray, it was you, it was always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was "beautiful", and that it left him and his character "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel "The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer".
Lynch has mentioned that he tried to avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series "The Fugitive", which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated "each week, you know, they writers for "The Fugitive" hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".
Cinematography.
The climactic murder of Madeline Ferguson in the episode features extensive use of jump cuts to portray Leland Palmer's spirit possession, switching rapidly between actors Ray Wise and Frank Silva. The scene is unusually long for a murder on television, lasting over four minutes. Some of its elements, including the insertion of a paper letter under Ferguson's fingernail and the use of jump cuts to events in the Roadhouse bar, are intended to echo similar aspects of "Pilot".
Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, in their book "The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions", have drawn attention to the use of mise en scène early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's "bric-à-brac". This technique draws attention to the painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on "the famous homecoming queen shot" of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the "emotional claustrophobia" felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.
Themes.
The revelation scene, in which Bob is shown to have inhabited Leland Palmer, has been noted for its sense of duality, a common theme throughout "Twin Peaks". In "Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks", David Lavery wrote that upon The Giant's appearance to Dale Cooper, "The Giant has transmuted the public place into something private". Lavery added that the murder scene is "in the living room, the public within the private". He summarised that the ambiguity between the public perception and the private perception—"the outer and the inner"—"reverberates" throughout the scene. In his view, Maddy Ferguson was Laura Palmer's "double" and Leland is "doubled" by Bob. However, Lavery referred to the duality of Leland and Bob as a "subjective formation" and added that the use of jump cuts "could be Maddy's view of Leland just as much as Leland's view of himself".
This scene has also been noted by critic Sue Lafky from the "Journal of Film and Video" as one of several in the series that suggest incest and necrophilia. She speculated that "Leland/Bob may have raped the dead or dying Maddie", comparing this to the "necrophilic fantasies" that Laura Palmer's corpse evokes, and Ben Horne's unwitting brush with incest when he encounters his daughter Audrey at a brothel.
Broadcast and reception.
"Episode 14" first aired on the ABC network on November 10, 1990. The initial broadcast was viewed by 17.2 million households in the United States, making it the fifty-first most-viewed broadcast episode for the week. These viewing figures represented 20 percent of the available audience and 10.4 percent of all households in the country. This represented a significant rise in viewing figures compared to the preceding episode, "Episode 13", which was seen by 11.3 million households. However, the following episode, "Episode 15", suffered a drop in viewing figures, attracting 13.3 million households.
The episode was well received critically. Writing for the "Chicago Sun-Times", Richard Roeper noted that fans and critics had begun to lose interest in the series by this point, but felt that "even at its most strained and obtuse, ["Twin Peaks"] displays more imagination and effort than almost everything else in TV land". He added that viewers may have been put off by the series' frame of time, explaining that only two weeks of narrative time had elapsed since "Pilot", a slow pace contrasted with the "fast-forward, instant payoff philosophy of most television". AllRovi's Andrea LeVasseur described the installment as "pivotal", noting that it "answers some of the series' long-running questions".
Writing for "The A.V. Club", Keith Phipps rated the episode an "A", adding "it's not like there's any shortage of action". He felt that the effects used in the episode were effective and frightening while still seeming low-key. In his view, the episode's blending of surrealism and horror was similar to scenes from Lynch's 2001 film "Mulholland Drive". Phipps described the climactic murder as "one of the most disturbing moments in the Lynch filmography", adding that it was a recurring Lynchian theme to represent the end of innocence as an actual death. IGN's Matt Fowler included the murder at number 16 in a list of the "Top 20 Creepiest Moments on TV", describing it as "nightmare fuel". Fowler felt the depiction of the killing was "savage" and unusually long for a television scene; however, he added that the rampant speculation as to the identity of the killer meant that whoever it was revealed to have been, it would be "somewhat expected".
Keith Uhlich, writing for "Slant Magazine", described the episode as "quintessential Lynch, perhaps his finest work", noting that the climactic murder scene was more powerful because of its necessary use of implication and suggestion. However, Uhlich felt that the installment was "a tough act to follow", arguing that the only subsequent installments that competed with it were the series' finale and the 1992 psychological thriller film "", which is based on "Twin Peaks". DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich described the installment as "a violent, disturbing revelation". Rich felt that the entry's supernatural elements assured the audience that there was "a grander scheme to the Laura Palmer story", elevating the series' long-running murder plot beyond "just a random night partying with drug dealers gone wrong".

The 105th Aviation Brigade () was formed out of the disbanded Yugoslav 105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment in the spring of 1993 by the Military of Serbian Krajina at Udbina Airport. Its accurate organization is unknown, and it's not exactly clear whether the brigade was part of Republika Srpska Air Force, because the aircraft had same roundels.
It consisted from at least one combat squadron nicknamed "Kobre" ("Cobras" - same as former 249th Squadron) and 56th Mixed Helicopter Squadron.
The brigade was equipped with 12 J-21 Jastreb light ground-attack aircraft, at least two G-2 Galeb trainer jets, 4 Soko Gazelle helicopters and 4 Gazelle Gama anti-tank helicopters, two Mil Mi-8T transport helicopters, one Antonov An-2 and number of Utva 66, Utva 75, J-20 Kraguj and Zlin Z-526 aircraft.
Aircraft from Udbina airport have took part in both wars in Croatia and Bosnia due the Republika Srpska Air Force aircraft at Banja Luka airport were enable to take of under the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In several combats Gazelle Gama anti-tank helicopters were very effective destroying Croatian army tanks.
At the time of the Croatian Operation Storm most of aircraft in flying condition have retreated to Banja Luka. Transport helicopters have performed their last evacuation flights. By the fall of the Republic of Serbian Krajina in summer 1995 and the defeat of Military of Serbian Krajina the 105th Aviation Brigade ceased to exist.
Commander of brigade was Ratko Dopuđa.

Kristian Løken

Kristian Rikardsen Løken (31 July 1884March 1961) was a highly decorated Norwegian military officer who served in the Belgian "Force Publique" from 1907 to 1917, fighting German colonial forces in East Africa from 1914 to 1917, and went on to command a Norwegian Army infantry brigade during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign of the Second World War.
In 1943, Løken was one of 1,100 Norwegian officers arrested and sent as prisoners-of-war to Germany, only being released after the German capitulation in 1945.
Early life and education.
Kristian Løken was born in the town of Elverum in Hedmark county, Norway. He was the son of smallholder Rikard Løken (1845–1909) and Gurine Syversen (1852–1902). Kristian had an older brother, Halvor (born 8 March 1876), who also sought a military career. He attended the upper section of the Norwegian Military Academy from 1903, graduating in 1906. That same year he took his examen artium.
After graduating, Løken was posted as a first lieutenant to the 1st Akershus Brigade. In 1910 he achieved a permanent position in the Norwegian infantry. He was transferred to the 5th Brigade in 1911 and to the 2nd Brigade on 1 October 1912.
Belgian service and the First World War.
Løken was granted leave from the Norwegian Army in 1907, and entered the service of the "Force Publique" in the Congo Free State.
Løken was among a sizeable number of Norwegian junior officers who sought foreign service after being unable to gain paid officers positions in Norway. The Norwegian Armed Forces had trained a large number of officers in the lead-up to the 1905 dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, officers that were no longer required once the crisis between the two countries had settled.
Along with other Norwegian officers, Løken was shipped out of Kristiania in March 1907. His brother, then army captain Halvor Løken, bid him farewell at the docks with the words "It's a comfort to know that ill weeds never wither" (Norwegian: """"), in reference to the unhealthy and dangerous conditions then to be found in the Congo Free State.
Løken's group of officers first underwent a three-month colonial training course in Brussels, Belgium, before being shipped to the Congo. While in the Congo, Løken would periodically receive renewed permission from the Norwegian authorities to remain in "Force Publique" service. Initially given command of a "Force Publique" company, Løken eventually became a battalion commander in the Belgian Congo. Løken was one 21 Norwegians to attain the rank of "Commandant" in the "Force Publique".
He remained in "Force Publique" service after Leopold II of Belgium gave up his personal control of the territory in 1908 and transferred it to the Belgian state. During his years in the Belgian Congo, Løken saw action as a battalion commander in the First World War East African Campaign, fighting the German colonial forces commanded by General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.
Kristian Løken left the "Force Publique" and the Congo in 1917 and returned to Norway. Due to his years spent in the Congo he was affectionately nicknamed "Kongo-Løken" by his Norwegian friends and colleagues. During his final years of life, Løken received a pension from the Belgian state for his "Force Publique" service.
Inter-war years.
Returning to regular Norwegian Army service, Løken was promoted to the rank of captain in 1918. The same year he assumed command of the 4th Company of Infantry Regiment 4, a command he continued to hold until 1930. In 1918 he attended a hand grenade course, in 1919 the Norwegian infantry shooting school, in 1921 a machine gun course and in 1928 a tactical command course. From 1926 onwards he served on occasion as an instructor at the shooting school. From 1929 to 1931 he commanded the First Company of the Norwegian Royal Guards. In the period 1932–1933 he led the Norwegian Military Academy. He attained the rank of Major in 1933, and Colonel in 1939.
In addition to his military career, Løken worked for the Office of the Auditor General of Norway from 1920 to 1923. After his years at the Auditor General, Løken spent a year in France in 1923–1924, teaching Norwegian students at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille in Rouen, Normandy. He had been an state authorised French language translator in Norway since 1920.
In 1931, Kristian Løken married Guldborg Noer (born 3 July 1886), the daughter of forest owner Arne Noer and Thea Hokaasen.
Second World War.
By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Løken was in command of the 14th Infantry Regiment in Nordland county, a position he had held since 17 January 1939, when he replaced Colonel Carl Gustav Fleischer, who went on to command the 6th Division with the rank of major general.
On 16 December 1939, Løken assumed command of Norwegian 6th Brigade, after Colonel Wilhelm Faye had been appointed chief of defence for Finnmark county following the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. Colonel Løken was also appointed chief of defence for the mainland of Troms county in Northern Norway. In this command Løken carried out brigade-sized field exercises to prepare his troops for potential combat operations. Løken was replaced as commander of the 14th Infantry Regiment by Lieutenant Colonel Thoralf Nummedal. By April 1940, Løken was temporarily in command of the 6th Division's officer cadets, while these were deployed on winter exercises. Løken's headquarters were located at Bardu in Troms.
Norwegian Campaign.
Following the invasion of Norway and the German attack on Narvik on 9 April 1940, by 3rd Mountain Division troops led by "Generaloberst" Eduard Dietl, Løken was responsible for carrying out the Norwegian mobilization in Troms. The first task Løken carried out, in addition to the mobilization, was using the forces initially available to him to block the German forces at Narvik from advancing into Troms. Maintaining control of the central army base Setermoen was vital for the Norwegian mobilization. The forces under Løken's direct command when the Germans invaded were an infantry battalion, a mountain artillery battalion and assorted support troops. In the evening of 8 April, Colonel Løken had been ordered to send his infantry battalion and a motorized artillery battery to Narvik to defend the town, but the transfer of forces was pre-empted by the German landing. In maintaining a defensive posture with almost his entire force during the mobilization stage, Løken came into disagreement with the top leadership of the 6th Division, which wanted a swift counter-attack against the Germans as soon as possible. Despite not mounting an immediate counter-attack, Løken did move troops forward to blocking positions further south than planned, as he saw it as important to stop the German advance in the Gratangen area. Colonel Løken's more cautious approach to warfare lead to a deterioration of his relationship with the more offensive division commander, Carl Gustav Fleischer. On 19 April, Løken reported that the morale of the opposing German forces seemed to be faltering, and that most of the Germans appeared to be "below average" at skiing.
After completing the mobilization in his area of responsibility and stopping the German advances into Troms, Colonel Løken was in overall command of the early counter-attacks carried out in late April 1940 by the 6th Brigade against the German forces in the Gratangen area. During this time, Løken first had his headquarters at Kroken in Salangsdalen in Troms, before it moved forward to Fossbakken in Lavangen. Løken personally commanded the central axis of the failed first Norwegian advance at Gratangen. During the attack the 6th Brigade greatly outnumbered the German defenders, with two infantry battalions with artillery support mounting a direct attack against the German positions on Lapphaugen, while another two battalions made a flank march to cut off the defenders. The frontal attack failed after Løken had hesitated in attacking and sent his units against strong German positions in a disorganized and uncoordinated manner. While the main attack failed, the flank march of the 1st Battalion, Infantry Regiment 12 was counter-attacked by the Germans, the Norwegians suffering heavy losses and being routed. After the failed initial offensive, Løken severely criticized the commander of the 1st Battalion, Infantry Regiment 12, Major Nils Christoffer Bøckman, for having bypassed Løken's brigade command in order to receive permission to advance directly from the 6th Division, exposing his unit to counter-attack.
On 29 April 1940, the 6th Division was reorganized into two weak brigades, the three-battalion strong 6th Brigade under Colonel Løken and the slightly smaller 7th Brigade under Colonel Wilhelm Faye. While the 6th Brigade was to follow a generally mountainous advance route against the Germans, the 7th was to attack along the coast in cooperation with French expeditionary forces. The 6th Brigade carried out a hard-fought mountain campaign over the coming weeks, pushing the Germans southwards along the Swedish border.
During the advance ski patrols reported in late April to Colonel Løken that the mountainous Kuberg Plateau, in the advance route of the brigade, was unoccupied by the Germans. Failure on the part of Løken to act on this information and seize the plateau allowed the Germans to occupy and fortify the feature on 7 May 1940, requiring heavy fighting a week later before they were dislodged.
In May 1940, Løken was relieved of command of the 6th Brigade, being replaced by the Lieutenant Colonel Ole Berg. Colonel Løken was instead appointed temporary chief of the 6th District Command (covering Northern Norway) on 7 May 1940, replacing Colonel Lars Mjelde, who had taken sick. The appointment was formally confirmed by royal resolution on 31 May 1940, at a meeting of the King and Cabinet at Storsteinnes in Balsfjord, Troms. According to General Otto Ruge's memoirs, the replacement of Løken as a field commander was motivated by a wish on the side of the commander of the 6th Division, General Carl Gustav Fleischer, to have a "young and aggressive" brigade commander. Following his appointment, Lieutenant Colonel Berg led the 6th Brigade in successful offensive actions against the Germans.
The main task of the 6th District Command, which Løken led for the remaining month of the Norwegian Campaign, was to coordinate the efforts of the civilian authorities in Northern Norway in support of the needs of the Norwegian front line forces. During Løken's time in command, the 6th District Command was initially based in Harstad, then later at Moen in Målselv, Troms.
On 10 June 1940, the forces in Northern Norway capitulated, a ceasefire having been in place since 24:00 on 9 June. Despite having been on the offensive until 8 June, the Norwegian troops were ordered to capitulate after the Allies had pulled out of Norway. Before releasing the Norwegian officers from captivity, the Germans demanded that each gave their word of honour not to participate in further resistance. Following the Norwegian capitulation, Colonel Løken worked on maintaining order and calm in Northern Norway in the transition phase to German occupation.
Imprisonment.
In August 1943, the German occupying authorities carried out mass arrests of 1,100 Norwegian officers, suspecting the officer class of supporting the Norwegian resistance movement. Colonel Kristian Løken was arrested on 16 August 1943 and given prisoner number 913.
He was first imprisoned at Oflag XXI-C in Schildberg in the German-annexed "Reichsgau Wartheland". While interned at Oflag XXI-C, Løken shared a room with Colonel Johannes Schiøtz, with whom he had attended the Norwegian Military Academy close to four decades earlier. Løken and Schiøtz were room mates at Oflag XXI-C from 6 January 1944 to 19 January 1945, when the Norwegian prisoners were sent on a one-week forced-march on foot and by train to Oflag III-A in Luckenwalde, Germany. On 24 January, five days into the journey, Løken was transferred to a hospital train carriage, suffering from ill health. The Norwegian prisoners of war remained interned at Oflag III-A until their German guards abandoned the camp on 21 April 1945, with Soviet forces arriving the next day. On 10 May 1945, two days after the end of the war in Europe, the Norwegian prisoners left Luckenwalde, reaching Norway in several groups in late May/early June 1945.
Post-war life.
From 1946 to 1954, Løken worked with the General Inspector of the Infantry, and until 1952 as a French language teacher at the Norwegian Military Academy.
In 1947, Løken also held the position as second in command of District Command North in Northern Norway. According to the Norwegian military intelligence officer Christian Christensen, Løken's relationship with the commander of District Command North, General Arne Dagfin Dahl, was poor. Løken was, according to Christensen, completely relegated from any meaningful tasks by General Dahl. Several years previously, during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, Løken had been Dahl's commanding officer.
Colonel Kristian Løken was the vice chairman of the reconstituted Norwegian Congo Veterans' Association (, ). He remained a member until the association was finally disestablished in 1960, being awarded the society's 50 year medal (commemorating the disestablishment of the Congo Free State in 1908) in 1958.
By 1948, he lived in Oslo, Norway. Kristian Rikardsen Løken died in March 1961, aged 76.
Honours and awards.
For his services in the Congo, the Belgian authorities awarded Løken a total of 14 decorations. Among his Belgion honours, Løken was made a Knight of the Royal Order of the Lion and a Knight of the Order of the Crown with palm, as well as being awarded the Croix de guerre with palm, the Order of the African Star, Silver Medal and the 1914–1917 African Campaigns Commemorative Medal.
After the end of the Second World War, Colonel Løken was decorated by the Norwegian government with the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch, the second highest Norwegian war decoration. He also received the Defence Medal 1940–1945 and the Haakon VII Jubilee Medal 1905–1955. The French government made him an of the and awarded him the .

Waterfront Workers History Project

The Waterfront Workers History Project is a program of the University of Washington, which serves to document the history of workers and unions active on the ports, inland waterways, fisheries, canneries, and other waterfront industries of the western United States and Canada, specifically, California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia. In collaboration with the Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects, and sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, the Project is a collective effort to organize and present historical data covering significant events from 1894 to the current day.
Project history.
Established in 2010, the Waterfront Workers History Project began with a team of research associates and financial support from the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies. The Project was established in partnership with the Unions Reexamined Working Group, an organization that studies the affect of union governance and organizational culture on solidarity and political commitments. The Project represents a collaborative effort between professors, students, labor unions, and community members.
Overview.
The Project provides access to a vast collection of digitized historical documentation and photographic resources for educational purposes. The image and document repository is available for study at the University of Washington and through an extensive Internet database portal on the university Web site. The online repository is organized by industry, with separate sections for longshore workers, maritime workers, cannery workers, and shipyard workers. Each section includes brief summaries, indepth research reports, historical documents, newspaper articles, and rare photographs. The sections depict everyday life and labor on the West Coast waterfront as well as strikes and other dramatic struggles for workplace rights. A particular focus is given to the influential International Longshore and Warehouse Union. A detailed special section examines the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike that spurred the union's formation, and includes newspaper articles published during the strike, a day by day narrative of major events and a collection of archival photographs. Another section looks at the life of longtime President Harry Bridges, including footage of his testimony at a deportation hearing in 1950. 
The Project includes more than 20 oral histories with longshore leaders, cannery workers, and labor history experts examining the tradition of dissent on the West Coast waterfront and the struggle of Filipino cannery workers for democratic unionism. Other industrial sections shed light on less-studied aspects of waterfront labor, including the trailblazing racial progressivism and integrationist efforts of the Marine Cooks and Stewards and the Ship Scalers Union.
Historical collections.
Donations to the Project include historical collections from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) archives, offered by Union historian Gene Vrana. The ILWU donation includes rare digitized copies of the "Waterfront Worker", the labor newspaper that served as a catalyst to address workers rights on the waterfront in the early 1930s, eventually leading to the 1934 strike and the creation of the ILWU.
The Ronald E. Magden is an historian, author, and professor at Tacoma Community College. In 1977, Local 23 of the ILWU began preparing a grant proposal in response to a request by the Washington Commission for the Humanities. At this time, the Union asked Magden to assist them with writing and editing the documentation. The history that he uncovered about the waterfront workers initiated a 30-year involvement in researching the history of longshoremen on the Pacific Coast. The Ronald E. Magden Collection in the University of Washington Special Collections Library includes an extensive presentation of archival materials, from which researchers have created a database of thousands of documents, books, films, and nearly 200 digitized photographs of waterfront workers from the 1880s to the present.

Frequency Changing Station

The Frequency Changing Station in Spokane, Washington is a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built by the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad in 1908 to house electrical equipment used by the electric railway. Power was generated at the Nine Mile Falls dam and transmitted to the Frequency Changing Station. The station provided direct current to the streetcar network within the city of Spokane. To provide power to the rail network outside Spokane, the station converted a portion of the power to alternating current and fed it to a series of electrical substations spaced about on the operating line. The substations then converted power back to direct current for the streetcars, but also sold power at 110 volts AC to the communities.
The main station houses four motor-generator sets, four 1250 kilowatt transformers, three 375 kilowatt transformers, and three 75 kilowatt transformers. The east wing of the station contained a 550-volt, 275-cell storage battery. All of this electrical equipment was removed around 1939, when the owning railroad sold the property.
The railroad connected the cities of Colfax, Washington and Moscow, Idaho to Spokane, and the electric railway figured heavily in the rapid development of the area where it passed.

Les Gold

Les Gold (born Leslie Gold on June 20th, 1950) is a pawnbroker, reality TV star, author, and public speaker. He is known for his role on truTV's reality series, "Hardcore Pawn".
Early life and career.
Les Gold is the grandson of a pawnbroker who once owned Sam's Loans, a now-defunct pawnshop on Michigan Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Sam's Loans was where Gold made his first sale, at age 7. (The Sam's Loans building is in the process of being remodeled into a pawn shop-themed restaurant, to be called "Gold Cash Gold".)
Gold began his first business at age 12, buying pizzas and reselling them by the slice to fellow students at Hebrew School. 
Gold opened his own pawn shop, American Jewelry and Loan, in 1978, at the Green Eight Shopping Center on 8 Mile Road in Oak Park. In 1993 he moved it to its present location on Greenfield Road in Detroit near 8 Mile - a 50,000 square foot building that was formerly a bowling alley. The business now employs about 50 people and serves about 1,000 customers a day.
"Hardcore Pawn".
Gold, his family, and his pawn shops are central to the truTV series "Hardcore Pawn."
In 2008, independent producer Richard Dominick saw Gold's TV ads which ran during the local commercial breaks of "The Jerry Springer Show", which Dominick was working on at the time. He saw potential in Les and his business as a reality TV show and approached the Gold family with this idea. Les's son, Seth, was initially reluctant, but Les overruled him and agreed to let the cameras in. The pilot aired in late 2009. Dominick is now the series co-executive producer with Mike Gamson. Les and Seth Gold were also credited as Executive Producers, beginning with the third season.
The series premiere (August 16, 2010) attracted two million viewers, thus setting a record as truTV's most-watched premiere. As of June 2013, the viewership exceeded 3 million.
The shows are controversial especially with regard to whether they are truly unscripted or "salt-scripted," and the way customers are treated. The series frequently draws critical comparison with "Pawn Stars".
Publications.
Gold's autobiography, "For What It's Worth: Business Wisdom from a Pawnbroker", was published on June 1, 2013 by Penguin/Portfolio. The book deals with his personal experience in establishing a successful pawn shop, and gives details on how he did it, and how anyone in any field can "think like a pawnbroker". Writing for Forbes, fellow entrepreneur Josh Linkner explains how he has learned from Gold's advice.
The book ranked #4 on The New York Times Best Seller list in the "Advice, How-to, and Miscellaneous" category for the week of June 30, 2013, and #8 in the "Hardcover Business Books" category for the month of July 2013.
Gold, the book, and his "three simple steps to successful negotiation" were featured on ABC's "Good Morning America" on June 18, 2013.
Philanthropy.
Gold supports The Heat And Warmth Fund ("THAW Fund"), which helps local families pay their heat and electricity bills. In February 2013, a fund-raising party dubbed "Hardcore THAW" and held after-hours in his store raised more than $40,000 for the organization.

Ryan Broekhoff

Ryan Broekhoff (born August 23, 1990) is an Australian professional basketball player. He played college basketball at Valparaiso University in the United States, where he was named an All-American in 2012, and has represented Australia in several international competitions.
College career.
Broekhoff, a 6'7" swingman from Frankston, Victoria, played at the prestigious Australian Institute of Sport, where he caught the attention of Valparaiso University Assistant Coach, Chris Sparks. Broekhoff chose Valparaiso in Valparaiso, Indiana. After playing a support role in his freshman season (2009–10), Broekhoff entered the starting lineup as a sophomore, scoring 10.3 points and collecting 5.2 rebounds per game. He led the Horizon League in three-point field goal percentage at 44.8% and placed sixth in the conference in blocked shots with 1.1 per contest.
As a junior in 2011–12, Broekhoff became one of the top players in the Horizon League. He averaged 14.8 points, 8.6 rebounds (first in the Horizon League) and 2.3 assists per game and led the Crusaders to the conference regular-season title and a National Invitation Tournament bid. At the end of the season, he was named Horizon League Player of the Year and an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press.
In Broekhoff's final season at Valparaiso, he averaged a college career high 15.7 point per game while averaging 7.3 rebounds per game and 2.3 assists per game. Although he produced monstrous numbers, he fell short in the MVP race to Detroit's Ray McCallum. Broekhoff led his team to a 26–7 record and the top seed in the Horizon League tournament. With less than 10 seconds remaining in the semifinal game against Green Bay-Wisconsin, Valpo was down 2 and Broekhoff drove the ball up the court and threw up a miracle shot. While landing on his back near the scorer's table, the ball went straight threw the net sending Valparaiso to the title game. Valpo won the title game against Wright State and clinched a NCAA Tournament berth. Valparaiso drew Michigan State for their first game and fell short 65–54. Broekhoff scored 8.
Professional career.
Broekhoff went undrafted in 2013 NBA draft. On August 5, 2013, Broekhoff signed a one-year deal (with the option of a second) with Beşiktaş of Turkey.
International career.
Broekhoff was a member of Australia's entry in both the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Auckland, New Zealand and the 2011 Summer Universiade in Shenzhen, China. He continued his career with the national basketball program in 2012 as he was invited to the trials for the Australia's 2012 Olympic team. Broekhoff was one of the last cuts on the squad, making the final 14 before being released.
In 2013, Broekhoff competed in the 2013 Stanković Cup and World University Games, winning gold and silver respectively. In August 2013, he was named in the Boomers' 2013 FIBA Oceania Championship squad to take on New Zealand in a two-game series.

<doc id="36670297" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36670297" title="MV Dromus (1938)">
MV Dromus (1938)

MV "Dromus" was a 1930s British oil tanker owned by Anglo-Saxon Petroleum, a British subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. She was launched in September 1938 by Harland and Wolff at Belfast in Northern Ireland. She was one of a class of 20 similar tankers built for Anglo-Saxon.
In 1951 "Dromus" suffered an explosion and fire that killed 22 of her crew and five oil terminal staff, after which she was extensively repaired. In 1958 she rescued 24 members of the crew of a British tanker that had been sunk by the CIA. Shell retired "Dromus" from service in 1962 and she was scrapped that year.
1951 explosion in Singapore.
In August 1951 "Dromus" was in Singapore, and on 18 August she took on a new crew for a voyage to the Philippines. On the night of 19–20 August "Dromus" was loading at Wharf Number 6 of the oil terminal on the island of Pulau Bukom off Singapore. During the process of topping up one of her forward tanks there was an overflow of oil from her foredeck and at about 1250 hrs she suffered an explosion and fire that took hold from her forecastle as far aft as her central superstructure.
"Dromus" crew and Pulau Bukom's fire-fighting squad fought the fire. "Dromus" Master, Henry Watkins had her stern mooring cables cut to help get her away from the wharf and for more than an hour, efforts were made to distance "Dromus" from the oil terminal to prevent the fire from spreading. Two Singapore Harbour Board fire-fighting tugs, and "Tarik", came to assist, along with five water-boats belonging to Hammer and Company based on Pulau Bukom. The explosion woke hundreds of Shell employees living away. They came to the terminal to help fight the fire, while their wives went to Singapore General Hospital to help to receive the injured.
There was a second explosion about 20 minutes after the first, probably caused by "Dromus" flexible hose parting company. Survivors leapt into the sea and swam to safety under petrol that had spilled onto the water around the ship. The fire worsened until about 0230 hrs.
The disaster killed three European officers and 22 Chinese and Malayans, including the ship's carpenter who was rescued but died in Singapore General Hospital of his injuries. The hospital treated at least eight other injured, including two officers. Two crew initially listed as missing were later found safe: late on the afternoon of 20 August "Dromus" terrified bosun and quartermaster were found sheltering behind bushes on the far side of Pulau Bukom, from the disaster scene. Most of the dead were from "Dromus" crew, but five staff of the Pulau Bukom oil terminal were also among those killed. It took days to find the bodies of some of the missing, and 11 victims' bodies were so badly injured that they were never identified. For the first few days there was some confusion to the total number of dead and missing.
Despite the explosion, "Dromus" still contained a cargo of 8,000 tons of benzene and 2,000 tons of fuel oil that survived the fire. After the fire was put out and the ship made safe, the cargo was discharged at Pulau Bukom.
Aftermath.
In the days immediately after the disaster the Port of Singapore's Deputy Master Attendant (equivalent to a Deputy Port Master) held an initial enquiry that was completed on 29 August. In September 1951 the Governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson, ordered a Commission of Enquiry. The report of the Commission's findings was published in February 1952. Captain Watkins and his Chief Engineer, Kenneth Armstrong, were found to have acted correctly and fire precautions taken during loading were found to have been adequate. The officer of the watch was found to have failed to keep a close enough eye on the topping up process, but he was among the dead and so could not be interviewed or called to account. The report speculated, though without any actual evidence, that a member of the crew could have caused the accident by emerging from the crew quarters while smoking.
The three officers killed were the Chief Officer Edward Dyer, Second Officer Samuel Pilling and Third Officer Edwin Hearth. All three were buried at Bidadari Cemetery on 21 August. Ten of the Chinese victims were buried at the Chinese cemetery in Bukit Timah Road. In September 1951 Anglo-Saxon and Shell presented an organ to the Seafarers' Chapel in Singapore as a memorial to those killed on "Dromus". The Bishop of Singapore, the Rt. Rev. Henry Baines, dedicated the organ and paid tribute to the services of the Merchant Navy and Royal Navy to Singapore's development and defence.
In July 1952 five people were honoured for their bravery in response to the explosion and fire. Queen Elizabeth II made "Dromus" Master, Henry Watkins and Chief Engineer, Kenneth Armstrong MBEs. British Empire Medals were awarded to three Malay firemen of the Pulau Bukom fire-fighting squad: Sergeant Baharun bin Mat, Corporal Rahman bin Mohammed and Corporal Mohammed Din bin Abdullah.
The fire gutted "Dromus" forecastle, forward tanks and bridge. In 14 September 1951 she was drydocked in Singapore to begin a refit estimated at S$2,000,000. "Dromus" was fully repaired and in due course returned to service.
1958 rescue in Borneo.
On 28 April 1958 at Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo, a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, attacked the Shell oil terminal there. The Invader bombed and sank Eagle Oil and Shipping's and made an unsuccessful attack on Anglo-Saxon Petroleum's .
Immediately after the attack "Daronia" left Balikpapan for the safety of Singapore, taking with her 26 of "San Flaviano"s rescued crew. A few days later "Dromus" assisted by taking a further 24 of "San Flaviano"s crew from Balikpapan to Singapore. Shell also evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore and suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan.
Withdrawal and scrapping.
"Dromus" remained in Shell service until 1962, when she was scrapped at Yokosuka, Japan.
Successor ship.
In 2004 Shell chartered the oil tanker "Maersk Prime" from the Danish shipping company Maersk and renamed her "Dromus". "Maersk Prime" is a 110,000 ton oil tanker that was built in Dalian, China in 1999. In March 2010 her charter ended and she reverted to her original owners and name.

Ellington Is Forever Volume Two is an album by guitarist Kenny Burrell featuring compositions associated with Duke Ellington recorded in 1975 and released on the Fantasy Records label. Originally released as a double album set in 1977 it was rereleased on CD in 1994.
Reception.
Allmusic awarded the album 4½ stars stating "Burrell's initial plan was to release a volume in tribute to Ellington once a year, but this record and the one that preceded it were the only two albums in this proposed series that were ever made. One can only imagine what could have been if Burrell had continued. Alternately, and more positively, one can be glad that the only records that were released were as beautiful and as close to perfection as these two".

Johann von Berenberg-Gossler

Baron Johann von Berenberg-Gossler (born 13 February 1839 in Hamburg, died 8 December 1913 in Hamburg; né Johann Gossler), known as "John," was a German banker from the city-state of Hamburg and owner and head of Berenberg Bank from 1879 until his death.
He was a member of the Hanseatic Berenberg/Gossler family and the son of banker Johann Heinrich Gossler (1805–1879), grandson of banker and senator Johann Heinrich Gossler and great-grandson of banker Johann Hinrich Gossler. His uncle was First Mayor and President of the Senate (head of state) Hermann Gossler. His mother was Mary Elizabeth Bray (1810–1886), a granddaughter of Samuel Eliot and a member of the Eliot family from Boston.
Known as "John Bi" (B pronounced in English) by his friends, he was a "Schöngeist". He loved music and the theatre, and wanted to study languages, literature and history. But his father had destined him to become a banker. After apprenticeships in England, France, North and South America, he became an "associé" of his father's bank in 1864. After the death of his father in 1879, he became head of Berenberg Bank.
In 1880, the Hamburg senate granted him the name of Berenberg-Gossler in recognition of the fact that he was the owner of the Berenberg Bank (the Berenberg family became extinct in the male line in 1773, but the Gosslers were descended from the family through the family's last member Elisabeth Berenberg married Gossler, who died in 1822). In 1888, Johann Berenberg-Gossler was ennobled in the Kingdom of Prussia (although he was a citizen of Hamburg and not of Prussia) and conferred the title of Baron in 1910. The ennoblement was controversial within his family and Hamburg high society, as nobility (which did not exist in Hamburg) was frowned upon by the staunchly republican Hamburg grand burghers. His sister Susanne, married Amsinck, exclaimed "Aber John, unser guter Name!"
Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was less inclined to take risks than his father, and closed the bank's branches in New York City and Boston in 1880 and 1891 respectively. At the time of his death, he was the second richest person in Hamburg.
He was the father of Senator and Ambassador John von Berenberg-Gossler (1866–1943) and banker Baron Cornelius von Berenberg-Gossler (1874–1953). His son John von Berenberg-Gossler became a politician despite his father's wish that he would succeed him as head of the bank, and therefore had to give up his shares in the company. He was succeeded as head of the bank and as Baron of Berenberg-Gossler (a title tied to the ownership of Gut Niendorf) by his younger son Cornelius von Berenberg-Gossler.

Bendix Hyde carbine

The Bendix Hyde Carbine is a light rifle concept made by George Hyde, while he was the chief gun designer for the Inland Division of General Motors during World War II. The weapon design is similar to that of the Thompson submachine gun, except that it is gas operated.
Variants.
The Bendix Aviation Corporation submitted the rifle, designed by George Hyde to the United States. It was a gas-operated design, and the only entry to use a pistol grip. It was 33.6 inches long with a 15.75 inch barrel and weighed 5.3 pounds, including sling and 5-round magazine. The gun went through the trial well, with excellent performance in dusty conditions, excellent accuracy, light recoil, and simple disassembly and maintenance. The committee recommended that it be modified with a stronger recoil spring and mechanism to allow the bolt handle to be used to force the bolt closed (the original design could only pull the bolt open). It was also recommended that the stock be changed.
A modified version of the Hyde carbine was submitted to the second set of trials on September 11, 1941. Five prototypes were manufactured by Inland (which would later produce M1 Carbines) in conjunction with Bendix. This second version had a total of 60 components, and no longer had a provision for full automatic fire and lacked the pistol grip found on the first model. It also now had a bolt handle directly connected to the bolt. This new version was heavier, at 5.8 pounds with a sling and 5-round magazine. It was overall considered inferior to the first Hyde carbine. Functioning was not as good, field stripping was more difficult, and the barrel was inferior to the original gun.

Julian King (recording engineer)

Julian King is a Grammy Award-winning recording engineer, mix engineer, record producer and musician based in Nashville, Tennessee. In one capacity or another, he has been involved with records that have sold more than 100 million units (see listing below). King has worked with some of the most notable artists in country music, such as George Jones, George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers and Merle Haggard. Other artists he has worked with include Tim McGraw, Vince Gill, Charlie Daniels, Hank Williams, Jr., Clint Black, Martina McBride, Randy Travis, Brooks & Dunn, Toby Keith, Alabama and The Judds. His credits also extend to some of the hottest young acts in country music today, such as Sugarland, Chris Young, Kellie Pickler, Lauren Alaina and Casey James.
King earned a Grammy as the recording engineer of Faith Hill's multi-million-selling, pop-crossover album "Breathe".
History.
Raised by school principal parents in Charlottesville, Virginia, King attended nearby James Madison University as a music major, with a plan to become a session trumpet player, but his true calling was tied to using technology to reproduce music. In 1987, during his junior year at college, he landed an internship working as “an assistant to the assistant” engineer at recording sessions for producer Jimmy Bowen. King learned quickly and was told a job would be there for him when he graduated the following year. Working under producer Bowen, King was instantly in sessions with such country superstars as George Strait. While working on an album with Charlie Daniels, King was teased by the star for being a trumpeter. Eventually, Daniels not only asked King to play trumpet on the record, he paid for King to join the American Federation of Musicians union.
In time, King became a favorite of top producers James Stroud and Byron Gallimore. Some of the earliest Number One hits King engineered were the career-launching singles by Tracy Lawrence and Clay Walker. One of his favorite projects from those early years is the 1992 John Anderson CD "Seminole Wind". In 1993, he was tapped to engineer the disc debut of the then-unknown Tim McGraw. King has engineered every Tim McGraw album since that time. He also helped create the sound that kick-started Toby Keith's career.
King was behind the board for "", an album that won the CMA Award as Album of the Year for 1994. Stroud brought him on board as a co-producer in 1998, and King delivered "I'm Yours" as a hit for Grammy-winning singer Linda Davis. In the following year came Faith Hill's "Breathe", which earned King his own Grammy Award. Noting his increasing prominence, "Mix" magazine profiled Julian King in 2001. 
Since then, King has produced "I Should Be Sleeping" and "Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)" as 2001–2002 hits for Emerson Drive. In 2007, King reunited with Tracy Lawrence and co-produced the star's CMA Award-winning hit "Find Out Who Your Friends Are". He has also continued to work constantly as an engineer, notably on Lee Ann Womack's 2005 CMA Album of the Year "There's More Where That Came From" and on the multi-million selling discs of two-time CMA Group of the Year, Sugarland. King engineered the two most recent albums by Chris Young which produced a string of five consecutive #1 hits, as well as albums by Kix Brooks (formerly of Brooks & Dunn) and "American Idol" finalists Kellie Pickler, Lauren Alaina and Casey James. 
Most recently, King has been involved in producing Tyler Farr's debut album for Sony/BNA.

ProFTPD

ProFTPD (short for "Pro FTP daemon") is a FTP server. ProFTPD is Free and open-source software, compatible with Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows (via Cygwin).
Along with vsftpd and Pure-FTPd, ProFTPD is among the most popular FTP servers in UNIX-like environments today. Compared to those, which focus e.g. on simplicity, speed or security, ProFTPD's primary design goal is to be a highly feature rich FTP server, exposing a large amount of configuration options to the user.
History.
ProFTPD grew out of the desire to have a secure and configurable FTP server, at a time where the most common FTP server was wu-ftpd, which was not very feature rich and had a poor security history. Since it appeared inefficient to the developers of ProFTP to integrate new features in wu-ftpd and increase its security profile, which would have made necessary a complete redesign of wu-ftpd, they decided to start their own project from scratch: ProFTPD.
The exact project launch date is uncertain today; the currently available news notes reach back to version 1.2.Opre9 dated 1999-10-27.
Configuration and features.
ProFTPD includes a number of options that are not available with many other ftp daemons. The configuration of ProFTPD is performed in a single main configuration file called /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf. Due to its similarities to the configuration file of Apache HTTP Server it is intuitively understandable to someone who uses this popular web server.
Some of the most noticeable features are:
Graphical user interface.
ProFTPD comes with a Command-line interface (CLI) only, but there are several third party Graphical user interfaces (GUI) existing for ProFTP for users who prefer this to the CLI, or like to use a combination of both. Especially when it comes e.g. to real time monitoring of current user actions and file transmissions, a GUI can be very helpful and superior to the CLI. Some existing GUIs for ProFTPD are (selection):

The Small-eared Rat ("Taeromys microbullatus"), is an extant species of Old World rodent that inhabits the south-east of Sulawesi, an Indonesian island. Following the identification of "Taeromys microbullatus" in 1935, the species was associated with the "R. xanthurus" in 1941, "P. dominator" from 1949, and later "T. callitrichus" from 1970. In "Mammal Species of the World", a more contemporary record suggests that "T. microbullatus" is closer to "T. callitrichus" than other species within the "Taeromys" genus.

El-Hobagi

El-Hobagi is an archaeological site in Sudan. It lies approximately southwest of Meroe on the west side of the Nile, near the sixth cataract. A number of large tumulus were found at El-Hobagi from the period after the fall of the Meroitic kingdom, but before the Christianization of Nubia. The site, which is dated to the 4th century, is situated near a post-Meroitic cemetery. Grave mounds excavated by a French team revealed an absence of rich gifts, instead containing weapons such as swords, spears, axes, arrows and bows. The dead lay on a bed and were surrounded by numerous vessels. There was also a bronze bowl, which contains one of the last known Meroitic inscriptions; it is decorated with agricultural scenes and the word "Qore" ("King"). This suggests that local kings were buried here in the wake of the Meroitic kingdom. Some findings suggest that the King's court was moved to the area of el-Habagi in the 4th century AD, though no village of that era has been found here. Tumulus III at El Hobagi is believed to date to the early Postmeroitic period of the late 4th century.

Robert Thomas, Jr. (percussionist)

Robert Thomas, Jr. is an American jazz percussionist and hand drummer. He is known as an innovator in Be-bop and hand drumming, and has been nominated for two Grammy awards. He is also a visual artist, working as a painter.
Life and career.
Robert Thomas, Jr., was born in Miami, the eldest of seven children, and grew up in North Miami Beach. He was encouraged by his fifth-grade teacher to play music, and not having an instrument, Thomas learned to play percussion on his desk. He sang in the choir at Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church, and at age sixteen, began playing percussion with the Broomfield Family, a local group that performed in churches and nightclubs. He joined the ensemble as a roadie, but after playing percussion with the group at a private party, went on to play in the band. Although still under-age, he played with the group at such venues as the Castaway Hotel's Wreck Bar.
After graduating from high school, Thomas studied at Miami-Dade Community College. During this time, he discovered jazz, and began to play with saxophonist Jet Nero at the Gold Dust lounge and other artists including Ira Sullivan, Billy Marcus, Zoot Sims, Thad Jones, Monty Alexander and Mel Lewis. In the late 70s, Thomas played at a benefit with Jaco Pastorius in Miami Springs. Soon afterward, Thomas auditioned with Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter's jazz fusion group Weather Report at a live performance in New Haven, Connecticut. Thomas said afterward that they were looking for someone to play Be-bop, rather than Latin-style percussion. He settled in France, and continued to play with Weather Report until 1986. After the group disbanded, Thomas resettled in Miami, and shortly afterward issued a solo CD of his own music "In the Dreamtime" on a local label. He continued to work with Zawinul until 1994.
Besides Weather Report, Thomas played with The Zawinul Syndicate, Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth band, and individual artists including Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Carlos Santana, Eddie Harris, Branford Marsalis, Herbie Mann, Ahmad Jamal and Roberto Perera. World artists he has played with include sitar player Amitava Chatterjee, and African artist Vinx. Thomas maintains an extensive discography and has issued several solo CDs. on which he plays an eclectic mix of instruments including conga drums, wind instruments, guitar and the African bow harp.

Concurrent object-oriented programming

Concurrent object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm which combines object-oriented programming (OOP) together with concurrency. While numerous programming languages, such as Java, combine OOP with concurrency mechanisms like threads, the phrase "concurrent object-oriented programming" primarily refers to systems where objects themselves are a concurrency primitive, such as when objects are combined with the actor model.

Brandon Community Sportsplex

The Brandon Community Sportsplex is a multipurpose recreation facility located in the city of Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. 
The Sportsplex was built by the City of Brandon in the mid 1970's as a venue for the 1979 Canada Winter Games. It features an indoor ice hockey arena, a 50 metre swimming pool, racquetball courts, and track and field facilities. Since the 1979 Winter Games, the Sportsplex has been made available to the public for recreational use.
The hockey arena is one of four indoor arenas that serve the city of Brandon, the other three being located within the Keystone Centre. The Sportsplex is home to the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Midget 'AAA' Hockey League and is also used by the city's minor hockey, speed skating, and figure skating programs.
The Sportsplex was once again used as a venue for the Canada Games in 1997 when Brandon hosted the Summer Games. In preparation for the games, its facilities received extensive upgrades.
The swimming pool was slated for closure in 2011, but after public pressure to keep it open, Brandon city council decided not to close the pool As a result, the city now has two pools, the other being at the local YMCA.
The swimming pool was deemed inadequate by the Canada Games Council in Brandon's bid for the 2017 Canada Games. City council was unwilling to fund the expansion of the Sportsplex or another new indoor aquatic centre, leading to the city's rejection as a host city.

Mole hole

Mole hole, officially the Readiness Crew Building, is a type of structure built by the Strategic Air Command at United States Air Force bases around the country.
History.
Due to aircraft being parked at the Christmas tree being on constant alert duty, the Strategic Air Command realized that they needed specialized buildings to house crews who rotated alert duty. In 1958, Leo A Daly, an architect from Omaha, Nebraska was hired to design buildings that would respectively hold 70, 100, and 150 men. These standardized structures would eventually be nicknamed "mole holes" due to the fact that the men would run out onto the Christmas tree through corrugated steel tunnels attached to the building when the Klaxon sounded. The buildings would house readiness crews. The concrete buildings contained thick concrete exteriors, bathrooms, a briefing room for crew members, dormitories, several classrooms, and a kitchen. 
Crews on alert duty would typically be on alert for seven days out of a 21 day period, while being on rotational alert duty. During their alert duty, they would fly no training missions, as they were to be kept always ready for an operational launch on a nuclear strike. 
During an alert, the men would run out to the Christmas tree, where they would travel to the five or so aircraft that were waiting to launch. At this point, the aircraft would perform an elephant walk to the runway, where a potential MITO would be performed.
Over the course of their construction, 10 facilities to house 150 people were built, 10 for 100 men, and 45 for 70 men. The facilities replaced various facilities that housed crew members earlier, including house trailers which sat next to the aircraft.

Gilbert S. Meem

Gilbert Simrall Meem (October 5, 1824 – June 10, 1908) was a brigadier general in the Virginia militia, who served along with the Confederate States Army in northwestern Virginia at various times during 1861 and early 1862 in the American Civil War. Meem's men participated in Stonewall Jackson's attacks on the towns of Romney and Bath, later Berkeley Springs, now in West Virginia in early January 1862. After the brigade went into winter quarters in Martinsburg, now West Virginia, Meem resigned his commission on February 1, 1862, apparently under pressure. He served in the government in Shenandoah County, Virginia during the war.
Meem served two years in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1852 to 1854 and four years in the Virginia Senate between 1871 and 1875. He was a noted breeder of livestock before and after the war. In 1892, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he was appointed postmaster by President Grover Cleveland.
Early life.
Gilbert S. Meem was born in Abingdon, Virginia on October 5, 1824. His parents were John Gaw Meem, a Lynchburg, Virginia banker, and Eliza (Russell) Meem.
Gilbert Meem attended Edgehill Seminary, a prep school for Princeton University, but quit school to manage the Steenbergen estate near Mount Airy, Virginia, which his father had purchased in 1841. He became an accomplished lifestock breeder as well as a planter. He married Nannie Rose Garland, which resulted in future Confederate States Army Brigadier General Samuel Garland and Lieutenant General James Longstreet becoming relatives. Meem served in the Virginia House of Delegates as a Democrat in 1852–1854.
American Civil War service.
Gilbert S. Meem was a brigadier general of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division of Brigadier General James Harvey Carson in the Virginia militia at the outbreak of the Civil War. Along with Carson's men, Meem's brigade was part of the garrison at Harpers Ferry after it was captured by the pro-Confederate Virginia force in April 1861. Meem's brigade guarded Winchester, Virginia when then Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston's men moved to support Confederate forces at the First Battle of Bull Run. At least part of Meem's brigade remained on duty throughout 1861.
In November 1861, Meem's men were called by Stonewall Jackson for training at Winchester, Virginia and duty in the Valley District. In early January, Jackson moved against the Union held towns of Romney and Bath (Berkeley Springs) and occupied those towns. Meem's men advanced with Jackson's main body. They performed poorly at Bath, falling back under fire and failing to block the Union force's route of retreat as Jackson drove them out of town from the other side. After Jackson took possession of the two main towns in the area, which overextended him and which he could not maintain after a few weeks, Meem's men were sent south and east to Martinsburg, Virginia, now West Virginia, to guard the rear of Jackson's army and to go into winter quarters.
On February 1, 1862, Meem resigned his commission. The resignation appears to have been under pressure after General Robert E. Lee received reports that Meem's habits and daily condition, apparently alcohol abuse, made him unfit for command. Meem returned to his estate and also held various positions in the Shenandoah County, Virginia government for the remainder of the war.
Later life.
After the war, Meem continued to manage his estate in the Mount Airy area of Shenandoah County, Virginia. He received recognition for his breeding operations which helped introduce and improve fine cattle and sheep into the Shenandoah Valley. Meem served in the Virginia State Senate from 1871 to 1875. He published a booklet titled: "Catalogue of short horned cattle, on exhibition and for sale at the National Fair, Washington, D.C." New Market, Henkel and Co., printers, 1888, .

Now &amp; Never

Now & Never is the 6th studio album by the Canadian rock band Platinum Blonde. It is notable as their first album of new material in the 25 years since 1987's "Contact". The first single from the album, "Beautiful" was released on June 18, 2012.
Background and writing.
After their last official cross-Canada tour ended in 2000, Platinum Blonde's frontman Mark Holmes released a solo album and worked as a DJ at the The Mod Club in Toronto, Ontario. In 2010, Holmes decided the time was right to renew the band: "All the bands that I was doing remixes for lately seem to sound like Platinum Blonde. So I thought it might be the right time for a dose of the real thing." 
In 2010, Holmes invited bassist Rob Laidlaw (known for his work with Honeymoon Suite) to join the band and hooked back up with co founding member Sergio Galli (Guitar). This is the lineup that is touring the new material in 2012.
Holmes was inspired by MacLean during the development of the album: "He may not have been writing or doing those backing vocals, but when I think of backing vocals, I think of him. Close my eyes, think what would he do? I try to do it."
Release and promotion.
On August 20, 2012 the band appeared on CityTV's "Breakfast Television" in Toronto to promote the new album. They performed "Beautiful" and their classic hit "It Doesn't Really Matter" live in the studio. The album was released on August 21, 2012.

Johann Heinrich Burchard

Johann Heinrich Burchard (26 July 1852 – 6 September 1912) was a Hamburg lawyer and politician who served as senator (from 1885 until his death) and First Mayor and President of the Senate of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (in 1903, 1906, 1908–1909 and from 1 January 1912 until his death).
Burchard was born in Bremen, a member of the Hanseatic Burchard family, the son of banker Friedrich Wilhelm Burchard (1824–92) and Marianne Gossler (1830–1908), a granddaughter of Senator and banker Johann Heinrich Gossler and a great-granddaughter of Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg. His father was a merchant in Bremen, who in 1853 became a partner of the Berenberg Bank (Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co.) owned by his wife's family. The family then relocated to Hamburg.
As a typical Hanseat, he rejected noble titles and any form of awards.
A portrait of Burchard by Max Liebermann is displayed at Hamburg's representation (embassy) in Berlin.
In 1877, he married Emily Henriette Amsinck (1858–1931), a daughter of Wilhelm Amsinck (1821–1909). His oldest son, Wilhelm Amsinck Burchard-Motz, was also a Hamburg senator and Second Mayor.
Johann Burchard died in Hamburg, aged 60.

Panevėžys Cathedral

The Cathedral of Christ the King () in Panevėžys, Lithuania, is a Roman Catholic cathedral, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Panevėžys.
History.
In 1860, bishop Motiejus Valančius began preparations for construction of a new church in Panevėžys. However, after the Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies, including the Lithuanian press ban and suppression of the Catholic Church. The authorities forbade construction of any new Catholic churches and closed the Piarist church leaving only the Church of Saints Peter and Paul to service the Catholic inhabitants of Panevėžys. A permission for construction was obtained in 1904, but the work was delayed by the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905 until 1908. Until World War I, a rectory and a temporary chapel were completed while church's walls rose up to the windows. The church was to be named after Saint Stanislaus the Martyr.
After the war the construction was abandoned until April 1926 when Pope Pius XI established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Panevėžys. Architect Rytis Steikūnas and engineer Aleksandras Gordevičius redesigned and expanded the church as it now was to serve as a cathedral. The unfinished cathedral was blessed by Jonas Mačiulis (better known as Maironis) on Saint Casimir's Day (March 4) in 1930. For that occasion Maironis wrote a hymn dedicated to Christ the King. Four bells from Apolda, Germany, were blessed in 1931. The largest, weighing , is dedicated to Christ the King. The organ, produced by Bruno Goebel in Königsberg, has three manuals. The cathedral was consecrated during a Eucharistic Congress on June 30, 1933, by Juozapas Skvireckas, Archbishop of Kaunas. The interior was decorated by local painter Povilas Puzinas in 1938–1939.
Architecture.
The cathedral is eclectic combining features of Baroque and Neoclassicism. The façade is dominated by the rectangular tower topped with an octagonal dome. Two high sculptures of Pope Pius XI and Jurgis Matulevičius, founders of the diocese, stand on the corners of the roof. The pediment of the portico is decorated with cartouches: the top one features a royal crown while the lower has the coat of arms of the bishop. The cathedral has three naves with groin vaults built of reinforced concrete. Chapel of Saint Casimir occupies a large hall under the presbytery, which is also known as the catacombs. The monstrance was gifted by Pope Pius XI. The church tabernacle is made of gilded oak. Two small angels, made by Joseph Rifesser from Urtijëi, are kneeling on each side. Above it there is a white sculpture of Christ the King by Juozas Zikaras. The richly decorated baldachin of the altar rests on four white columns, surrounded by sculptures of angels.
The ceiling of the apse is decorated by a fresco by Jonas Mackevičius depicting Saint Casimir appearing to Lithuanian soldiers during the 1518 Siege of Polotsk. The fresco was restored in 2002. The walls of the apse depict ten churches of ten deaneries of the diocese. The side aisles end with oak altars produced by Joseph Rifesser. The left altar features a copy of the "Sistine Madonna" and a painting of Saint Casimir surrounded by sculptures of Albert of Riga and Saint Monica. The right altar features a sculpture of Saint Francis of Assisi helping crucified Jesus, modeled after a painting by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and a painting of Saint Stanislaus. Puzinas painted the ceiling vaults with frescoes of angels in the clouds while ceiling of the chapels was decorated with images of the Four Evangelists. He also created eight large paintings that hang in the naves.

New Spanish Baroque

New Spanish Baroque refers to Baroque art in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. During this period, artists of New Spain experimented with expressive, contrasting, and realistic creative approaches, making art that became highly popular in New Spanish society.
Among notable artworks are polychrome sculptures, which as well as the technical skill they display, reflect the expressiveness and the colour contrasts characteristic of New Spanish Baroque.
Two styles can be traced in the architecture of New Spain: the "Salomónico", developed from the mid-17th century, and the "Estípite" which began in the early 18th century.
A model of the Cathedral of Puebla represents the architectural magnificence of New Spain. A choir book and a harpsichord of the 18th century highlight the importance of music for the colonial society of the Baroque period in Mexico.
Painting.
In the realm of painting, New Spanish baroque had great artists whose works are in museums such as the Museum of the Viceroyalty in Tepotzotlán, El Carmen Museum in San Ángel, Santa Mónica Museum in Puebla, and Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City. 
Among the most distinguished artists were:
Simón Pereyns.
Simón Pereyns lived in Antwerp circa 1530 then Mexico circa 1600. He was a Flemish painter and in 1558, he moved to Lisbon and then to Madrid, where he worked as a court artist.
In 1566, he went to New Spain, achieved fame with his paintings in Mexico. Many works are attributed to him, but most of them have been lost; among those conserved are the ten tables of the altarpiece of Huejotzingo (1586), which revealed the influence of Dürer and his work on Saint Christopher (1585).
Pereyns was put on trial on religious charges. His beliefs were inherited from his ancestors, specifically his father, who was a Lutheran. While he was in prison, he painted a picture called "Our Lady of Atonement", hoping to win a pardon. He was released and donated the painting to the Archbishop of Mexico, whose successors mounted it on the Altar del Perdón at the Metropolitan Cathedral.
Juan Correa.
Juan Correa (1646-1716) was a Novohispanic painter active between 1676 and 1716. His painting covers topics both religious and secular. One of his best works is considered to be the "Assumption of the Virgin" in the Cathedral of Mexico City; several of his works depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe found their way to Spain. He also made paintings of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Rome in 1669.
Cristóbal de Villalpando.
Some of Cristóbal de Villalpando's (c. 1649-1714) early work dates from 1675 with the high altar of the Franciscan convent of St. Martin of Tours in Huaquechula, where there are 17 of his paintings; but that is not necessarily the beginning of his career. It is likely that the painter was born in Mexico City in 1649. Little is known about his childhood and adolescence, the earliest documented date being his wedding in 1669. He married María de Mendoza, with whom he had four children.
Undoubtedly, Villalpando was one of the foremost painters of Mexico City during the latter part of the 17th century, as evidenced by the collection of triumphal paintings that were commissioned by the council of the Cathedral of Mexico, for decorating the walls of the sacristy of the church. The canvases prepared for that commission were: The Triumph of the Catholic Church, The Triumph of St. Peter, St. Michael's victory (known as Woman of the Apocalypse) and the appearance of St. Michael on Mount Gargano. Unfortunately, due to structural faults in the vaults of the building, Villalpando was unable to complete the intended set of six paintings; they were completed by Juan Correa.
Due to this hindrance to his work at Mexico City, Villalpando moved to Puebla de los Ángeles where he carried out similar work at the Cathedral there. He produced a well-known oil painting titled "Glorification of the Virgin", in the dome of the Chapel de Los Reyes located in the end wall of the church. It is also worth noting the amount of his work found in the church of the Profesa in Mexico City. His importance was recognized by the painters' guild, of which he became leader on several occasions. He reached old age with a great reputation, and he was recognized as an important stylistic influence on later generations. He is considered one of the last exponents of Baroque painting in New Spain: after his death New Spanish plastic art took a different path.
Miguel Cabrera.
Miguel Cabrera (1695-1768) was an extraordinarily prolific artist, specialising in depictions of the Virgin Mary and other saints. He is regarded as the leading colourist of the 18th century.
His paintings were very much in demand: many requests for pictures came from convents, churches, palaces, and noble houses.
Writing and Philosophy.
A wide range of poets and writers fell within the New Spanish Baroque tradition.
Gutierre de Cetina.
Gutierre de Cetina (1520 - 1557) was a Spanish poet of the Renaissance and the Spanish Golden Age. He was born in Seville, Spain and died in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Of a noble and wealthy family, he lived for a long time in Italy, where he was a soldier under the command of Charles I. Spending much time in the court of the Prince of Ascoli, to whom he dedicated numerous poems, and also associated with Luis de Leyva and distinguished humanist and poet Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. He adopted the nickname "Vandalio" and composed a song in the Petrarchan style to a beautiful woman named Laura Gonzaga. To such a woman was dedicated the famous madrigal that has been included in all anthologies of poetry in the Spanish language:
<poem>
Eyes clear, calm,
Since you are praised for your tender gaze,
Why, when you look at me, do you look angry?
</poem>
In the same songbook there are many sonnets whose pattern was essentially the rendering of a loving thought of Petrarch or Ausiàs March in the quartets, and a further, more personal development in the tercets. 
In 1554 Cetina returned to Spain and in 1556 went to Mexico; he had previously been there between 1546 and 1548, with his uncle Gonzalo Lopez, who had gone there as chief accountant. He fell in love again, with Leonor de Osma, and was mortally wounded in 1557 in Puebla de los Angeles by an envious rival, Hernando de Nava.
Juan Ruiz de Alarcón y Mendoza.
Juan Ruiz de Alarcón y Mendoza (c.1581 - 1639) was born in Taxco. He was a Novohispanic writer of the Golden Age who developed various forms of drama. His works include the comedy "La Verdad Sospechosa" (Suspicious Truth), which is one of the most important works of Spanish American Baroque theater, comparable to the best pieces of Lope de Vega or Tirso de Molina. 
Little is known about the early life of Ruiz de Alarcón. It is known that his maternal grandfather was Jewish and his paternal grandfather was the son of a priest of La Mancha and a Moorish slave. It is probable that he came from a family well connected with the Castilian nobility. He studied from 1596 to 1598 in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. About 1600 he set off for the University of Salamanca, where he studied civil law and specialized in canon law. 
While in Salamanca, Alarcón rose to prominence as the author of dramas and stories. In 1606 he went to Seville in order to practice commercial and canonical law. There, he met Miguel de Cervantes, who was subsequently influenced by his works, including "La Cueva de Salamanca" (The Cave of Salamanca) and "El Semejante A Sí Mismo" (Like unto Himself).
In the first months of 1607 he returned to New Spain. Two years later he obtained a bachelor's degree in law and several times tried unsuccessfully to gain a university chair. His next move was to Madrid, where he began the most fruitful period of his literary output. His early works were "Las Paredes Oyen" (Walls Have Ears) and "Los Pechos Privilegiados" (Privileged Breasts), both meeting with some success. He soon came to be recognised in literary circles in Madrid, but never established close relations with any of their members. Indeed, he earned the hostility of others. We know of many satirical quatrains and disguised allusions to Alarcón, who was always ridiculed for his physique - he was a hunchback - and his American origins. He, in turn, responded to the vast majority of personal attacks and never stopped writing. 
It has been suggested that he may have collaborated with Tirso de Molina, one of the most famous writers of his time and the one who most influenced his works. There are no written evidence of such a collaboration, although it is thought that at least two of the comedies of Tirso, published in the second volume of his works (Madrid, 1635), were in fact written by or with the collaboration of Alarcón.
With the accession of Philip IV, in 1621, the theater achieved an important place in the royal court. Alarcón soon struck up a useful friendship with the son-in-law of the powerful Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, Ramiro Felipe de Guzmán, under whose patronage he grew better-known as a poet. Between 1622 and 1624 he wrote "La Amistad Castigada" (Punished Friendship) and "El dueño de las estrellas" (The Owner of the Stars) as well as the vast majority of his plays. From 1625 he served on the Council of the Indies, thanks to the intercession of his friend Ramiro Felipe de Guzmán. 
During the first months of 1639, Alarcón's health began to deteriorate. He stopped attending the council's meetings and was replaced in his position as rapporteur. In August he dictated his will, making provision for all his debts and debtors. He died on August 4, 1639 and was buried in the parish of San Sebastián.
Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora.
Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora (1645 - 1700) was the youngest son of eight children and was related to the famous Baroque Culteranismo poet Luis de Góngora. His father was a tutor to the royal family in Spain; after he emigrated to the New World he joined the bureaucracy of the viceroyalty. 
In 1662, Sigüenza entered the Jesuit college of Tepotzotlán to begin his religious studies, which he continued in Puebla. In 1667 he was expelled from the order for indiscipline. He returned to Mexico City and entered the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. In 1672 he took the post of professor of mathematics and astrology, the position that Diego Rodríguez had occupied thirty years before. Sigüenza held this position for the next twnety years. In 1681, he wrote a book, "A Philosophical Manifesto", concerning comets, in an attempt to calm the superstitious fears arising from this cosmic phenomenon. A Jesuit, Eusebio Kino, strongly criticized this text from an Aristotelian and Thomistic point of view; but, far from being intimidated, Sigüenza responded by publishing his work "Libra astronómica y philosóphica" (1690). Here he rigorously justified his view of comets, referring to the most current scientific knowledge of his time; against the Thomism and Aristotelianism of Father Kino he quoted authors like Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Kepler and Tycho Brahe.
Until recently it had been thought that another of his works, "Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez" (1690), describing the adventures of a Puerto Rican named Alonso Ramírez, was a mere fiction invented by the famous Mexican intellectual. It has now been shown to be a historical account. article on Siguenza y Gongora
The heavy rains of 1691 flooded the fields and threatened to flood the city; the wheat crop was devastated by a disease. Sigüenza used a precursor of the microscope to discover that the cause of this disease in wheat was the Chiahuiztli, an insect like the flea. As a result of this disaster, the following year there was a severe shortage of food which caused large-scale rioting. Mobs looted Spaniards' shops and caused numerous fires in government buildings. Sigüenza managed to salvage the city library from the fire, avoiding a great loss. Sigüenza estimated that about ten thousand people took part in the riot. As the royal cosmographer of New Spain he drew hydrologic maps of the Valley of Mexico. In 1693 he was sent by the viceroy as a companion of Andrés de Pez in an exploration trip to the north of the Gulf of Mexico and in particular the peninsula of Florida, where he drew maps of Pensacola Bay and the mouth of the Mississippi River. This experience may have inspired him to write about marine adventure in the "Misfortunes of Alonso Ramirez".
In his later years he spent much time collecting material for a history of ancient Mexico. Unfortunately, his untimely death interrupted the work, which was not resumed until centuries later when criolla self-awareness had developed enough to be interested in the identity of their nation. Sigüenza had directed that upon his death, his valuable library with more than 518 books would be donated to a Jesuit school, and his body handed over to medical research in order to find a cure for the disease that caused his death.
Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.
Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651 - 1695), known as the "Tenth Muse", was born on 12 November 1651 in San Miguel Nepantla and died in Mexico City on April 17, 1695. She was one of the greatest writers during the Golden Age. Her passion for literature began in childhood, but as a woman, she could not get into university, so she started to write poetry, pieces of music, sonnets, ten-line stanzas and books. She first entered the Carmelite order, but decided to change to the Jerónimas in the Convento de San Jerónimo (Mexico City), which is now University of the Cloister of Sor Juana.
Her works included "Redondillas" and "Al que ingrato me deja" (To the one who ungratefully leaves me). She composed a poem which became a Christmas carol called "¡Ah de las mazmorras!" (Ah dungeons!). She was on the verge of condemnation by the Spanish Inquisition, because at that time women were not thought fit to philosophize. There was presumed to be a lesbian relationship between Sor Juana and Viceroy María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga yet there was no certain evidence. It was also alleged that she was a feminist, citing her accusations against men and her poems such as those mentioned above.
Sor Juana eventually retired from writing and poetry to devote herself to religious work. She became characterized by a famous phrase: "I, the worst of all." In 1695, an epidemic of plague affected the capital of New Spain, including the Convento de San Jerónimo. Sor Juana helped care for the sick until she contracted the plague and died.

Favorite Poem Project

The Favorite Poem Project was founded in 1997 by Robert Pinsky shortly after he was appointed 39th Poet Laureate of the United States by the Library of Congress. During the one-year open call for submissions, 18,000 Americans wrote to the project volunteering to share their favorite poems. Submissions came from Americans ages 5 to 97, from every state, of diverse occupations, education and backgrounds.
The project has prompted hundreds of Favorite Poem readings in cities and towns across the country. These readings gather individuals from different corners of a single community to share their favorite poems with each other, revealing personal ties to specific poems.
With the Boston University School of Education, the project has hosted five week-long summer poetry institutes for educators. Led by Pinsky, the institutes emphasize vocal and personal connections as a starting point for more intense study of poems. Additional faculty have included Frank Bidart, Mark Doty, David Ferry, Louise Glück, Gail Mazur, Heather McHugh and Rosanna Warren .
The Favorite Poem Project's archives include original letters, e-mail printouts, and both raw and edited versions of audio and video recordings. The archives are housed by Boston University's Mugar Library, at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. These materials, along with the project's database of nearly 25,000 letters written by American readers, are used by scholars and researchers. Final versions of the fifty Favorite Poem Project videos are kept at the Library of Congress Archive of Recorded Poetry & Literature.

Rhode Island gubernatorial election, 2014

The 2014 Rhode Island gubernatorial election will take place on November 4, 2014, to elect the Governor of Rhode Island. Contested Democratic and Republican primaries will take place on September 9, 2014. Incumbent Democratic Governor Lincoln Chafee is eligible to run for re-election to a second term but has decided to retire.
Background.
In the 2010 gubernatorial election, Republican incumbent Donald Carcieri was term-limited and unable to seek a third term in office. The Republicans nominated businessman John Robitaille and the Democrats nominated State Treasurer Frank T. Caprio. Also contesting the election were Moderate Party nominee Ken Block and Lincoln Chafee, who served as a Republican U.S. Senator from 1999 to 2007. After losing a bid for re-election in 2006, Chafee left the Republican Party and became an Independent, running for Governor as such. After a close three-way race between Chafee, Robitaille and Caprio, Chafee won the election with a plurality, taking 36% to Robitaille's 34%, Caprio's 23% and Block's 6%.
After constant speculation during his term, Chafee officially joined the Democratic Party on May 30, 2013. He had previously indicated that he may run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat. In the face of low approval ratings, polling showing him trailing in both the Democratic primary and the general election, and with weak fundraising, Chafee announced on September 4, 2013 that he would not run for re-election. Chafee is thus just the fourth Governor in the history of Rhode Island to decline to seek a second term, after Byron Diman in 1847, Royal C. Taft in 1889 and William S. Flynn in 1924.

1994–95 Australian region cyclone season

1994-1995 Australian region cyclone season was a moderately active Australian cyclone season. It was also an event in the ongoing cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It ran from 1 November 1994 to 30 April 1995. The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a "tropical cyclone year" separately from a "tropical cyclone season", and the "tropical cyclone year" ran from 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995.
Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane; and TCWC Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
Storms.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Annette.
Annette formed on 12 December 1994. The storm moved southeastward while intensifying to a Category 4 cyclone. Annette made landfall at Mandora Station on 18 December. There was considerable damage to homes and crops and about a 1,000 cattle were lost in the storm.
Tropical Low Heida.
Tropical Low Heida developed on 3 February and existed the basin on the next day.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Bobby.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Bobby, a Category 4 cyclone with estimated winds up to 270 km/hour near the centre, crossed the Western Australian Pilbara coast to the east of Onslow between midnight and 0100 on the 25 February 1995. Seven lives were lost when two fishing trawlers were sunk off the coast from Onslow. A bulk ore carrier also ran aground in the cyclone. There was very minor property damage reported from the Karratha area and approximately 20 houses in Onslow suffered superficial roofing damage. Cyclone Bobby also brought heavy rains and extensive flooding to the south of the Pilbara area, which damaged roads, bridges and crops and seriously affected mining production. A motorist was drowned inland from Carnarvon while attempting to cross a flooded creek.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Violet.
Violet lasted ten days.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Warren.
Warren last four days.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Chloe.
The third major cyclone to strike Australia. Cyclone Chloe reached Category 4 status before making landfall in the uninhabited section of the coast of the Kimberley region of Western Australia on 7 April 1995. The storm dissipated well inland.
Tropical Depression 20P.
Tropical Depression 20P existed from 3 April to 4 April.
Severe Tropical Cyclone Agnes.
Anges formed on April 15, only to dissipate over a week later.

Pantheon of Asturian Kings

The Pantheon of Asturian Kings in a chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo, Spain. It is the burial place of many of the rulers of the medieval kingdoms of Asturias and León.
The name "Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto" ("Our Lady of the Chaste King") alludes to Alfonso II of Asturias, know as ""the Chaste"", considered the founder of the cathedral. The original royal pantheon was located in the 9th-century Church of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto on the same site. On the initiative of Tomás Reluz, Bishop of Oviedo, that pantheon and the church were demolished in the early 18th century due to their poor state of conservation. Both were rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1712.
The primitive Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo.
In the 9th century Alfonso II of Asturias, king of Asturias, ordered the erection of a church of Our Lady in his new capital of Oviedo, with the intention of establishing a royal pantheon as a final resting place for himself and his wife, queen Berta. This church later became know in his honor as the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto ("Church of Our Lady of the Chaste King").
The primitive Pantheon of Kings was located in the narthex of the church. Rather than the church being entered through the narthex as is customary, the main entrance was through doorway in the southern arm of the church, with the narthex being dedicated entirely as place of entombment for Asturian monarchs.
The primitive pantheon was a small oblong room wide (the same width as the principal nave of the church), deep, and somewhere between and in height. The ceiling was of wood, and over the pantheon was the upper choir of the church, which, as in the churches of San Miguel de Lillo and San Salvador de Valdediós, was located in the narthex. On either side of the royal pantheon, were small closet-like rooms, one of which contained the staircase to the choir upstairs. The other small room may have been for storage of items used during religious services. The pantheon was connected to the main sanctuary of the church through a wide door near the main altar of the church; a small window also connected the pantheon to the sanctuary. Both, according to the chroniclers of the time, were closed with heavy iron bars that nearly prevented any sunlight from entering the pantheon.
Humble in appearance, the royal pantheon received the bodies of numerous members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family over the course of several centuries. According to the chroniclers of the period, the tombs were quite close together, to the point where it was not possible to walk between them; for lack of space, some members of the royal family were entombed elsewhere in the church. Not all of the bodies were entombed in the walls or in freestanding tombs; some were buried in the floor, their graves covered by unadorned slabs of stone, in most cases without inscriptions.
Near the staircase connecting the church to the upper choir was a tomb that was much venerated in the 16th century, owing to the widespread belief that saints were buried there. Nonetheless, chronicler Ambrosio de Morales believed that by that time the bodies that had been buried there had been removed to another place. The tomb was covered with a marble slab. A worn and nearly illegible Latin inscription read ""Adepti...Regna Celestia potiti"". It is impossible to know exactly what the inscription may have originally said, but "Regna Celestia" is "the Kingdom of Heaven" and "adepti" and "potiti" both mean "obtained" or "attained".
In the royal pantheon, near the entrance, some above the floor, was a tomb covered by a roughly worked lid without adornment or inscription. Nonetheless, tradition and the preeminent location of the tomb led to general agreement among historians that it was the tomb of Alfonso II, founder of the church and of the royal pantheon.
Several other members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family were entombed elsewhere in the primitive Church of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto, outside the royal pantheon:
The campaign of Almanzor.
At the greatest extent of Muslim power in Iberia, during the military campaign of Almanzor in the year 986 against the kingdom of León, king Bermudo II of León ("the Gouty") ordered that royal remains be gathered from León, Astorga and other places to the Church of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto to prevent their profanation by the Muslim armies. These remains were placed in seven wooden boxes and brought to the city of Oviedo. There not being sufficient space for them in the royal pantheon, they were placed in the church. The seven boxes contained the remains of the following individuals:
After the death of Almanzor, and of his son Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar, king Alfonso V of León repopulated the city of León, and moved there the greater part of the remains that his father Bermudo II had brought to Oviedo. Nonetheless the remains of kings Alfonso III and Fruela II and queens Jimena, Munia, Elvira Menéndez, Urraca Sánchez and Teresa Ansúrez remained in the royal pantheon in Oviedo.
The new Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo.
History.
Toward the end of the 17th century, the pantheon of kings was basically intact but in a poor state of conservation, as was the primitive Church of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto, of which it was part. On May 15, 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a royal decree dedicating all benefices derived from Tanes and Brañalonga to the Cathedral of Oviedo with the intent of contributing to the maintenance and restoration of the primitive church. Some years later, in 1705, the council in charge of the cathedral sent a memorial to the king, indicating the continued poor condition of the church and of the royal pantheon; bishop Tomás Reluz sent an accompanying letter recommending the demolition of the primitive church. The proposal was accepted.
Reluz was the principal instigator of the early 18th century construction of the new chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto. The new pantheon was located between the pillars of the left nave (known in Spanish as the "nave del evangelio", "the nave of the Gospel"), enclosed by an iron grate, with light entering though an oval. This disposition has been interpreted as a loss of importance for the function of the royal pantheon to the church, favoring instead the function of the church as a Marian sanctuary. Nonetheless, the location of the new royal pantheon at the foot of the left nave allowed a wider central nave for the new structure.
The contract to construct the new chapel was signed November 10, 1705 by Bishop Reluz and master builder Bernabé de Hazas. Construction costs were estimated at 24,000 ducats and the time for construction at three years. On August 2, 1709, the dome of the new Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto, still under construction at that time, collapsed, causing several deaths. The chapel was completed in 1712, although it was not until 1717 that the picture of the Virgin was moved from the Chapel of Santa Barbara in the Cathedral to the new chapel.
Description.
The Royal Pantheon occupies the last section of the northern side of the chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of Oviedo. It is the most sumptuous part of the cathedral complex, richly decorated in carvings of plants and heraldic emblems.
In six niches, among other funerary urns, are the remains of many members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family. A tablet on the chapel wall gives the names of those entombed there, although it contains some errors.
The gratings of the royal pantheon and the church were made by Andrés García Casielles and were put in place in 1713. The grating that closes off access to the Royal Pantheon is adorned with the coat of arms of king Philip V of Spain; a similar grating, but without the royal seal, adorns the Chapel of the Annunciation of the cathedral.
In the center of the Royal Pantheon is a sarcophagus covered by a Fifth century marble tombstone. It is the only surviving tomb from the primitive pantheon. Some studies indicate that this sarcophagus was used to transport the remains of the Asturian king Alfonso III ("the Great") and his wife Queen Jimena from the city of Astorga to Oviedo. The sepulchral urn is of ordinary unadorned stone. The overlying cover is marble, coffin-shaped, wider at the head than the feet, and entirely covered in reliefs. A sculpted epitaph in somewhat obscure Latin that appears to state that it contains the body of one "Ithacius"
"INCLVSI TENERVM PRAETIOSO MARMORE CORPVS AETERNAM IN SEDE NOMINIS ITHACII"
At least one possible reading of this is "I have enclosed a tender body with precious marble in the eternal resting place of the family of Ithacius," but there are various other possibilities (including "…of the fame of Ithacius" and "…by the name of Ithacius"). This tomb was reused in the Royal Pantheon, although the specific identity of the body currently located within it is unclear.
Kings and queens entombed in the Royal Pantheon.
The following members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family entombed in the baroque urns of the Pantheon, according to various historians:

Rafael "Red" Lopez was born in northern Mexico about 1886. His father was Martin Lopez, who would later become a general in Pancho Villa's army, and his mother was an Indian. One of Lopez's uncles was Pablo Lopez, another Villista general, who was responsible for the Santa Isabel Massacre in 1916.
As a teenager, Lopez and his younger brother were sent to New Mexico Territory to work in the mines with some of their relatives. In New Mexico, Lopez became a skilled equestrian and marksman. He usually worked in the mines, but by 1913 he was employed by Buffalo Bill Cody in his Wild West show.
Utah.
On November 21, 1913, Lopez shot and killed a fellow miner named Juan Valdez in Bingham, Utah. According to differing accounts, Lopez and Valdez had gotten into an argument over a woman, but Kerry Boren says that Lopez was actually exacting revenge for Valdez's alleged murder of the former's brother years before. Either way, Lopez had no intention of surrendering to the authorities so he fled across snow covered mountains on foot to a ranch located near Utah Lake and the present-day town of Saratoga Springs.
A four-man posse was soon on Lopez's trail and they caught up with him at about 4:30 P.M. on the same day. Unfortunately for the officers, they rode their horses right into an ambush. As the possemen were approaching the ranch house, Lopez opened fire on them from a nearby ditch with a Model 1895 30-06 Winchester rifle. At a distance later determined by the "Salt Lake Tribune" to be 118 yards, Lopez struck the Bingham police chief, John William Grant, in the back and killed him instantly. Next Lopez hit Deputy Nephi Jensen in the pelvis and Deputy George Witbeck in the right side of his chest. Jensen died almost immediately, but Witbeck survived for about twenty minutes. Deputy Julius Sorenson was saved only by a defective bullet. He was also the only one of the four lawmen to return Lopez's fire and though the bullets did not take effect, Lopez retreated as result. 
News of the shootout quickly spread. Lawmen from all over Utah assembled to participate in what would become the state's largest manhunt in history. Altogether, the new posse consisted of about 200 men, both civilians and lawmen.
Meanwhile, Lopez went to hide in the Minnie Silver Mine outside of Bingham, stopping along the way at the home of a friend, Mike Stefano, to relieve him of his Model 1894 30-30 Winchester. A few days later, the police were informed of Lopez's whereabouts and they proceeded to block off the entrances to the mine with armed guards. On November 29, the posse tried to smoke Lopez out by sending two deputies in with an ore car full of hay to start a fire, but Lopez killed them both. Deputy James Douglas Hulsey was shot in the right shoulder blade and the bullet exited through his chest. He was also hit in the heel of one of his feet while his partner, Deputy Thomas Manderich, was hit in the upper right part of his back. The remaining possemen then attempted to starve Lopez into submission, but he survived due to the efforts of sympathetic miners, who left food in the tunnels. The posse also tried pumping smoke and fumes into the place, but it did not work either. Finally, Lopez escaped the mine into Bingham Canyon and got away. The posse called off the search on January 3, 1914, the day after finding the mine empty.
Lopez was never again seen in Utah and the case remained open for the next ninety years. The tragedy on November 21, 1913, remains the deadliest shootout in the history of Utah law enforcement.
Texas.
Lopez fled to Texas and became the leader of an outlaw gang. According to Kerry Boren, many of Lopez's men were former members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. For the next several years, Lopez plundered banks and trains along the Rio Grande and between 1915 and 1916 he fought in the Mexican Revolution with his father.
The bloodiest of Lopez's raids occurred in 1914. Somewhere near the international border, Lopez and his men derailed a train, robbed it, and executed nineteen of the twenty American passengers on board. In response to the massacre, the Texas Rangers began pursuing Lopez, but they failed to catch up with him for years.
Kerry Boren says that Lopez died in 1916 during a battle between American and Villista forces, but most evidence suggests that he was killed by Frank Hamer in 1921.
In October 1921, Frank Hamer was in command of Company C, Texas Rangers, when he was told by an informant of an upcoming meeting near the Rio Grande, which Lopez was to attend. Hamer decided to ambush the meet with some of his men by taking up positions in an irrigation ditch and firing on the outlaws as they came riding across the river border. However, after moving into place, Hamer suspected that the informant had led him into a trap so he had his men hide the horses and reposition themselves on a low ridge thirty yards away, which overlooked the irrigation ditch. Sure enough, just as the sun bgean to set, the rangers spotted about twenty armed men sneaking up to the rear of the ditch on foot. Hamer later said that at this time he could see both the treacherous informant and Lopez, who was wearing his ""trademark clothing;"" a red bandana and overalls. Hamer then stood up from his concealed position and shouted ""Halt! Were officers of the law!"" in Spanish. Instantly Lopez ""whirled around"" and fired at Hamer with a rifle, grazing him on the cheek. Hamer then opened fire with his .35 caliber Remington Model 8. His first bullet struck Lopez in the chest between the straps of his overalls and he died instantly. Hamer then aimed for the informant, but, before he could fire, one of the other rangers shot the man down. The fighting lasted about thirty minutes and, according to Gene Shelton's "Manhunter: The Life and Times of Frank Hamer", the last shot fired was from a ranger dispatching a wounded bandit. Eleven bandits were killed that day while none of the rangers were hurt, except Hamer, who was grazed at the beginning of the engagement. Hamer also took a gold watch off of Lopez's body, which was covered in blood and had been damaged by one of the former's bullets. Hamer gave the watch to his brother, Harrison, who hung it on a wall in the customs house in Laredo. The watch remained on display for several years afterward.
Although Lopez was dead and his gang defeated, the Texas Rangers never informed the people of Utah about their victory so the case remained open until January 24, 2003. After years of investigating on his own time and money, Salt Lake County Deputy Sheriff Randy Lish confirmed that the Lopez of Utah and the Lopez of Texas were the same man.

Cherangani Hills Forest

Cherangani Hills Forest (Cherangany Hills Forest) is a collection of thirteen forest reserve blocks in western Kenya, located in the Cherangani Hills on the western ridge of the East African Rift. The forested area is about , of which has been gazetted into forest reserves. These forest reserves form the upper catchments of the Kerio and Nzoia and Turkwel rivers.
The three western blocks, Kapkanyar, Kapolet and Kiptaberr, are larger and more consolidated and constitute about 20% of the Cherangani Hills Forest. Most of the rest of the forests are fragmented, cut by grasslands, bushlands, and croplands. The forests themselves are quite varied in composition. To the west, the lower elevations are "Aningeria-Strombosia-Drypetes" forest, grading into mixed "Podocarpus latifolius" forest on the higher elevations. To the east are "Juniperus–Nuxia–Podocarpus falcatus" forest, particularly on south facing slopes. On the eastern slopes these are interspersed with "Podocarpus falcatus" forest, much disturbed by human activities. sizeable remnants of "Juniperus–Maytenus undata–Rapanea–Hagenia" forest can be found in the high valleys. In some of the stream valleys tree ferns such as "Cyathea manniana" can be found as well as small patches of the bamboo "Arundinaria alpina". 
Blocks:
Issues.
The Cherangani Hills Forest is threatened by increased pressures from a growing local population, as well as by pressure from downstream inhabitants. The problems range from overgrazing, to conversion of the forest to cropland, to excessive use of forest products in making charcoal and providing local lumber.
