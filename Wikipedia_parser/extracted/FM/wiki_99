Quest Crew

Quest Crew is an American hip-hop dance crew from Los Angeles, California who were declared winners of the third season of "America's Best Dance Crew". They made their first few appearances individually on shows like "So You Think You Can Dance" and at events such as Kollaboration 8 and World of Dance.They are currently helping with choreography for well known artists such as LMFAO and touring with them as well.
History.
The name "Quest Crew" reflects the support that the Quest Learning Center, located in Artesia, California, has had on growth within the team and individually. Quest Crew won the title of America's Best Dance Crew on the third season of the show and consists of ten members. Team members originally performed with the "SickStep" dance troupe, but later disbanded to recreate and include dancers to form Quest. D-Trix and Victor Kim are also part of the b-boy crew Fallen Kings, formally known as Flexible Flave, which won Freestyle session.
The entire crew appeared in the Far East Movement music video "Dance Like Michael Jackson" and LMFAO's "Party Rock Anthem", "Champagne Showers", "Sexy And I Know It" and "Sorry for Party Rocking". Quest Crew also performed on "Idol Gives Back" in 2008, and toured with Gloria Estefan and Sheila E.
So You Think You Can Dance.
Five out of the ten active members of Quest Crew have appeared on "So You Think You Can Dance". Ryan and Hok auditioned for season one with another member of their former crew Sick Step; crew member Ryan 'Ryanimay' Conferido appeared on the first season as a finalist and Hok did not make it. Ryan was eliminated in the fourth week of season one. Steve Terada, Victor Kim, and Hokuto 'Hok' Konishi had all auditioned for the second season (this being Hok's second time). Steve and Victor were both eliminated in the choreography rounds. Hok nearly made it to the top 20, but was only in the United States on a student visa, and was ineligible to be employed which led to his dismissal from the program. After obtaining a work permit, Hok had returned for the third season along with Dominic 'D-Trix' Sandoval. This time, both made it to the top 20. Hok was eliminated during the fifth week of competition and D-Trix was eliminated in the seventh week. Both D-Trix and Hok went on tour with the rest of the top 10 dancers with D-Trix as a featured dancer and Hok serving as a substitute/swing dancer. In 2008, Victor auditioned again for the fourth season but was cut early on in the choreography rounds.
America's Best Dance Crew Season 3.
In 2009 Quest Crew became the winners of season three of "America's Best Dance Crew". The seven members who competed were Hok, Feng, D-Trix, Brian, Victor, Steve, and Ryan. Lydia Paek, who is also a member of Quest Crew, decided to perform with the Boxcuttuhz due to the show's 7 member limit rule, meaning she could not dance with Quest. Aris Paracuelles and Andy Luo did not compete due to the seven member limit. Quest Crew originally auditioned for season one but were unable to take part of the show because crew members D-Trix and Hok's original contract with "So You Think You Can Dance".
Week 1: Sudden Death Challenge.
During the , Quest Crew performed to their own master mix featuring Hero by Nas. They received overwhelmingly positive comments from the judges and were saved from elimination. Kid Rainen, a member of the JabbaWockeeZ served as a guest judge in place of JC Chasez. He complimented D-Trix's double halos and shoulder halos b-boy moves. Lil' Mama complimented Ryan on performing a highflip and landing on his head (describing him as 'crazy'). Shane Sparks also praised them, and said, "The battle is on."
Week 2: Fit Test Challenge.
During the , Quest Crew was given the challenge of Kickboxing. This challenge was performed to a master mix of Kevin Rudolf ft. Lil Wayne's "Let It Rock." Steve is a martial arts instructor, and he took them through all the basic punches and kicks. The crew relied on him to deliver those heavy blow ups. JC said they had great moments but thought the performance seemed a little too "Tae Bo" and said they had too much posing. Lil Mama agreed. However, Shane Sparks thought there were many moments in their performance where they killed the show and praised them. Nevertheless, they were saved from elimination that night.
Week 3: Britney Spears Challenge.
During the , the Britney Spears song that Quest Crew received was "Toxic". For this challenge, they had to perform a portion of their routine blindfolded.
Their performance was given positive remarks from the judges with judge JC Chasez calling it his favorite performance of the night. Shane Sparks, stated that the crew "killed the stage" when they incorporated a little feminine vibe into their routine. Shane Sparks also complimented Ryan on his "Shablam," and calling him 'crazy' for doing that. Originally, Dominic was supposed to do the solo, performing fouettes into airflares, but injured his shoulder in rehearsal. At last minute, Ryan created the back flip "Shablam" but ironically, after the episode he injured his knee. After the airing of the episode, Dominic and Ryan both commented that the Britney Spears Challenge was cursed on account of both getting injured.
Week 4: Whack Track Challenge.
During the , Quest Crew got You Got It (The Right Stuff) by New Kids on the Block as their whack track.
The crew chose to do the crotch grab pendulum and their routine featured Hok looking like he was on his hands but in reality he had switched his clothes around and eventually changed back into regular attire. The performance was again praised due to Quest's creativity and getting Hok in and out cleanly.
After this performance, there were controversies by some fans of the show throughout the internet. It was pointed out that the move done by Hok had been performed by Korean B-Boy crew, Project Seoul. Quest was accused of being "biters", however D-Trix soon issued an apology through a bboy forum.
Week 5: Illusion Challenge.
During the , Quest Crew had to put an object through their body. The crew chose to perform to a master mix of Got Money by Lil Wayne feat. T-Pain. In their performance, Feng "stabbed" Brian Hirano with a coat rack and broke it off.
JC criticized their performance by pointing out that there was too much posing. JC also criticized Quest on their transitions. Some fans in the audience did not approve of JC's comments and responded with 'boos.' However, Lil Mama responded by instructing the fans in the audience not to boo because that would not enable Quest to listen to their "Words of Wisdom." Shane Sparks also stated to Quest that "Beat Freaks are on y'all butts", with Victor jokingly looking behind him and responding backstage saying "I'm honored that they're on our butts. I like them there, actually."
Week 6: Battle of the Sexes Challenge.
During the Battle of the Sexes Challenge, it was between two male crews, and two female crews. Quest Crew had to dance to the song "Forever" by Chris Brown. The crew decided they would imitate the smooth moves and gliding from the video. The judges complimented their performance and Shane complimented D-Trix (Dominic Sandoval) on having the cleanest air flares on the show.
Week 7: Hip-Hop Decathlon and Last Chance Challenge.
During the , Quest was put into the bottom two for the first time against Fly Khicks. The crew had to incorporate five styles of hip hop into their routine: threading, krumping, housing, tutting and waving. Hok was familiar with tutting and Ryan Conferido knew how to thread so the crew depended on them to work on those sections. Songs performed in the Hip Hop Decathlon were: Poker Face by Lady Gaga (Threading), Love Lockdown by Kanye West (Tutting), I'm in Miami trick by LMFAO (Waving), Closer by Ne-Yo (Housing), and Get Up by 50 Cent (Krumping). The performance received a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The judges highly praised the crew. D-Trix performed elbow airflares, which received compliments from Shane Sparks, Hirano receiving compliments for being buff - since he ripped his shirt off during the krumping section - and Steve Terada performed a backflip from a sitting Indian-style position. Victor Kim performed threaded handhops, and Hok Konishi choreographed the tutting section. JC praised Hok in his tutting by calling him a true Egyptian and stating that Hok should be called "King Tut".
The second challenge involved creating their own song, much like season 1 and season 2's last chance challenge. Quest's song was titled "orQUESTra". The song included Ryan Conferido's own piano piece. Ryan actually played the piano during the middle of the performance while D-Trix performed headspins to the alternating tempos on top of the piano. After a box split and locking solo by Hok, Victor Kim performed a hollowback into an invert. At the end of the performance, D-Trix pushed Steve Terada who was in the middle of a vertical back flip sideways over Hok and Victor, and ended with the Quest Crew Salute. This performance is number two on Randy Jackson's list of top 10 performances of all time.
ABDC Finale.
For the finale Quest performed in a dance collaboration with Strikers All Stars and Dynamic Edition. This group which was chosen by Shane Sparks had to dance to the song "Right Round" by Flo Rida. Later that same night Quest performed a routine with fellow finalist Beat Freaks to a mastermix "Beggin'" by Madcon. After nearly 20 million votes were cast, Quest was declared the winners of "America's Best Dance Crew" season 3. Their victory dance was to "On Top of the World" by T.I. ft Ludacris.
Special: Champions for Charity.
On April 15, 2010 America's Best Dance Crew held a special charity episode featuring the winners of the first five seasons. Each dance crew was partnered with a charity organization. Quest Crew supported the DoSomething.org volunteer organization which inspires young people into action to better their community. Quest spent time with Jordan Coleman, the fourteen-year-old from Hackensack, NJ, who developed and released the film “Say It Loud” to promote the importance of education. Hok held the honor of presenting Jordan with a donation check worth $10,000. They performed to "Sing, Sing, Sing" by Swing Kids.
ABDC Season 6 Finale.
On June 5, 2011, Quest Crew performed on the sixth season finale of MTV's America's Best Dance Crew. The crew performed to "Party Rock Anthem" by LMFAO. This was the first performance where D-trix did not dance with Quest Crew on ABDC.

Parc Borély

Parc Borély is a public municipal park in the city of Marseille, in France. It is classified by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Notable Gardens of France. The park is 17 hectares in size. It adjoins the Jardin botanique E.M. Heckel.
Description.
Parc Borély has three different gardens; a Garden à la française, facing the bastide, composed of a two lawns, a circular basin and a rectangual basin, and double rows of trees, between the avenue du Prado and the gates of the park:
An English landscape garden, on the west side of the park, surrounding a lake, and decorated with statues, fountain, a cascade, and a playground. It also features a miniature of the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde.
A recently renovated race track. The other two parts of the garden connect to the sea by a promenade and to the neighboring botanical garden.
History.
The park was created in the 17th century by a French ship owner and merchant, Joseph Borely, who bought land for a country house, the Château Borély, in the area of Marseille called Bonneveine. The estate was enlarged in the 18th century by Joseph Borély, who constructed a bastide, or Provençal country house, on the domaine. When Louis-Joseph Borély inherited the domaine in 1770, he commissioned the landscape architect Embry to create a Garden à la française.
In the middle of the 19th century, the land passed first to Paulin Talabot, director of the new PLM railroad which connected Paris to Marseille; and then the land was acquired by the city of Marseille. The city commissioned landscape architect Adolphe Alphande to design a park with three distinct parts; a French garden, an English landscape park, and a track for horse racing by the side of the sea. A number of wooden pavilions were constructed; just one remains, the former pavilion by the lake, which had also served as a botanical laboratory of the Institut Colonial.
From 1880 until 1915, the park was the site of a botanical garden, which moved to a different site adjoining the park. In 2002, a promenade of two hectares was laid out between the park and sea.

National Network

The National Network (or National Truck Network) is a network of approved state highways and interstates for commercial truck drivers in the United States. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 authorized the establishment of a national network of highways designated for use by large trucks. On these highways, Federal width and length limits apply. The National Network (NN) includes almost all of the Interstate Highway System and other, specified non-Interstate highways. The network comprises more than 200,000 miles of highways.
Definition.
§658.9 National Network Criteria
The National Network listed in the appendix to this part is available for use by commercial motor vehicles of the dimensions and configurations described in §658.13 and §658.15. For those States with detailed lists of individual routes in the appendix, the routes have been designated on the basis of their general adherence to the following criteria.
The National Network was most "recently" defined by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Information on these routes are taken from §658 Appendix A. Some states such as Indiana, Arkansas, and Ohio allow truck traffic on all "numbered" state or U.S. highways. Other states, such as New York and California, have a specially defined set of highways which are recommended for trucks. The law allows for "reasonable access" to and from the NN for terminals, deliverires, trucks stops, repairs, and other reasons. The NN is recommended for "through" truck traffic (e.g. traffic that is passing through the area), and trucks are allowed to operate on truck-restricted roads if they have no other means of access to their destination.

Nujood Ali

Nujood Ali (نجود علي) (born 1998) is a central figure in Yemen's movement against forced marriage and child marriage. At the age of ten, she obtained a divorce, breaking with the tribal tradition. In November 2008, U.S. women's magazine "Glamour" designated Nujood Ali and her lawyer Shada Nasser as Women of the Year. Ali's courage was praised by prominent women including Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice.
Ali's lawyer Shada Nasser, born in 1964, is a feminist and specialist in human rights, whose involvement in Ali's case received much acclaim.
Biography.
Nujood Ali was nine when her parents arranged a marriage to Faez Ali Thamer, a man in his thirties. Regularly beaten by her in-laws and raped by her husband, Ali escaped on April 2, 2008, two months after the wedding. On the advice of her father's second wife, she went directly to court to seek a divorce. After waiting for half a day, she was noticed by a judge, Mohammed al-għadha, who took it upon himself to give her temporary refuge, and had both her father and husband taken into custody.
Shada Nasser agreed to defend Ali. For the lawyer, it was the continuation of a struggle begun with the installation of her practice in Sana'a, which she opened in the 1990s as the first Yemeni law office headed by a woman. She built her clientele by offering services to female prisoners.
She of course did not want to be a part of the tribe at this point in her life. Until that day she was sanctioned.
Yemeni law allows girls of any age to wed, but it forbids sex with them until an indefinite time when they are considered "suitable for sexual intercourse." In court, Nasser argued that Ali’s marriage violated the law, since she was raped. Ali rejected the judge's proposal of resuming living with her husband after a break of three to five years. On April 15, 2008, the court granted her a divorce.
After the trial, Ali rejoined her family in a suburb of Sana'a. She returned to school in the fall of 2008 with plans to become a lawyer. Ali's memoirs were published in 2009, and royalties from international sales of the book were intended to pay for her schooling; but she did not attend school regularly. Because of negative world press coverage about Yemen resulting from the case, Ali's passport was confiscated in March 2009 and she was prevented from attending the ceremonies for the Women's World Award in Vienna, Austria. Media reports also questioned whether proceeds from the book were in fact coming to the family.
In 2010, Ali's family was living in a new two-story residence bought with the help of her French publisher and running a grocery store on the ground floor of the building. At this time, Ali and her younger sister were attending private school full-time. Because the publishers were not able to pay Ali directly under Yemeni law, they agreed to give $1000 a month to her father until she was 18 to provide for her and her education.
The English-language version of the memoir was published in March, 2010. Introducing the work, "New York Times" op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof praised the work done to raise awareness regarding such societal problems as terrorism, associated with polygamy and child marriage, saying, "little girls like Nujood may prove more effective than missiles at defeating terrorists." Indeed, publicity surrounding Ali's case is said to have inspired efforts to annul other child marriages, including that of an eight-year-old Saudi girl who was allowed to divorce a middle-aged man in 2009, after her father had forced her to marry him the year before in exchange for about $13,000.
In 2013 Ali reported to the media that her father had forced her out of their home, and has withheld most of the money paid by the publishers. Her father has also arranged a marriage for her younger sister, Haifa.

Savassi

Savassi is one of the most famous neighborhoods in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It is located at the Central-South zone of the city and is very well known for its large number of bars, pubs, clubs, cafés, bistros, diners, restaurants, nightlife and a highly busy and developed shopping commerce, regarded as one of the most prestigious and sought-after areas in Belo Horizonte. It used to be a region inside the traditional and wealthy Funcionários neighborhood, but in 2006, it was dismembered by the Town House before the meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, which was to happen that same year in the city.
Savassi takes its name from an Italian family, which owned a bakery in the central square, the Praça da Savassi, that time, Praça Diogo de Vasconcelos ("Diogo de Vasconcelos Square"), around the mid-1930s, and the bakery was named after the family's last name. Then, the square got known as Savassi, and later the entire region was known as well. Currently, Savassi is bounded south by the Contorno Avenue, where is located one of the trendiest and most upscale shopping malls in the city, the Pátio Savassi; east, by the Afonso Pena Avenue; north by Brasil Avenue; northwest by the Praça da Liberdade ("Liberty Sqaure"); west by Rua da Bahia. Savassi is neighbors with some of the most affluent areas of Belo Horizonte, like Funcionários, at the northeast; Boa Viagem, at the north; Lourdes, the wealthiest and most expensive residential district in the city, at the west; and Santo Antônio, São Pedro, Carmo and Cruzeiro, at the southern border.
Some major streets in Savassi are: the Afonso Pena Avenue, Getúlio Vargas Avenue, Cristóvão Colombo Avenue, Brasil Avenue, Rua da Bahia and Contorno Avenue. The neighborhood is a CRECI A List area in Belo Horizonte, and has one of the most expensive square-feet in town. It is home to many of the most prestigious and selective private schools in the city, most of them Catholic Schools, like the Colégio Santo Antônio, Colégio Sagrado Coração ("Sacred-Heart School"), Colégio Marista São José, Colégio Padre Machado, and others. There is also the Architecture School of UFMG, the Social Sciences School of PUC-Minas and the campi of many other top-rated Brazilian universities and colleges. The elite comes to Savassi to shop, to attend the several art galleries, exhibitions, fairs and public parties; to sit at the ever-full cafés and bars; dance at the most-wanted private parties and clubs; to see and to be seen. The area is also known for being the most straightforward in town, being home for every single type of culture. Hipsters, emo and rockers are around in large numbers. The Human Development Index in the neighborhood is one of the highest in Southeast Brazil, as well as its per-capita income, and Gross Enrolment Ratio.
Praça da Savassi is one public square of this neighborhood.

Renal oncocytoma

A renal oncocytoma is a tumour of the kidney made up of oncocytes, a special kind of cell.
Presentation.
An oncocytoma is an epithelial tumor composed of oncocytes, large eosinophilic cells having small, round, benign-appearing nuclei with large nucleoli with excessive amounts of mitochondria.
Pathophysiology.
Renal oncocytoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of collecting ducts of the kidney. It represent 5% to 15% of surgically resected renal neoplasms. Ultrastructurally, the eosinophilic cells have numerous mitochondria.
Diagnosis.
In gross appearance, the tumors are tan or mahogany brown, well circumscribed and contain a central scar. They may achieve a large size (up to 12 cm in diameter). 
The main differential diagnosis of renal oncocytoma is "chromophobe renal cell carcinoma oncocytic variant", which like the renal oncocytoma has eosinophilic cytoplasm, but has perinuclear clearing and, typically, some degree of nuclear atypia.
Symptoms.
Most cases of renal oncocytomas are asymptomatic, discovered incidentally (by chance) on a tomography or ultrasound of the abdomen. Some of the possible symptoms are: hematuria, flank pain, abdominal mass.
Treatment.
Renal oncocytoma is considered benign, cured by nephrectomy. There are some familial cases in which these tumors are multicentric rather than solitary. However, they may be resected to exclude a malignant tumor, e.g. renal cell carcinoma.

"Note: This ship should not be confused with the fourth USS "Resolute" (SP-3218) or fifth USS "Resolute" (SP-3003), which were in commission at the same time."
The third USS "Resolute" (SP-1309) was a tug that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
"Resolute", was built as the commercial wooden-hulled salvage tug SS "Sarah E. McWilliams" during 1916 by Great Lakes Engineering Company at Ashtabula, Ohio. She had been renamed SS "Resolute" by the time the U.S. Navy purchased her for World War I service from her owner, Merritt and Chapman Company of New York City on 8 August 1918. She was commissioned on 10 September 1918 as USS "Resolute" (SP-1309) with Lieutenant, junior grade William E. Marcyes, USNRF, in command.
"Resolute" was based at the Central District Salvage Station at Stapleton on Staten Island, New York, throughout her U.S. Navy career. She performed local towing duty, took part in several salvage operations, and assisted in patrolling the local anchorages.
Decommissioned on 15 May 1919, "Resolute" was sold to her former owner the same day and returned to mercantile service. She remained in mercantile service until scrapped in 1955.
During early 1942 "Resolute" again served the U.S. Navy, operating for several months as a commercial tug under a charter to perform salvage work on the United States East Coast.

Syed Masood

Syed Masood is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Marc Elliott, and first appeared on screen on 21 April 2009. Syed is a British Pakistani and is the eldest son of Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia), and brother of Tamwar (Himesh Patel) and Shabnam (Zahra Ahmadi) and Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia). Syed's storylines have seen him fall in love with a man, Christian Clarke (John Partridge), and his eventual acceptance that he is gay. Syed initially marries girlfriend Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas) but later comes out, and enters a relationship with Christian, despite the pressures of his family and his Muslim faith. Syed also became the first British soap character to marry both a man and a woman during his time on the show.
In 2009, it was announced actor Marc Elliott would be joining the "EastEnders" cast. In an interview with Digital Spy, Elliott described his arrival: "It is so exciting to join the cast of EastEnders and to be working with actors such as Nina Wadia and Nitin Ganatra who I have admired for many years. "The Masood family have really made a name for themselves in the Square and it will be interesting see how Syed plans to stir things up!"
In September 2012, it was announced that Elliott would be leaving "EastEnders" alongside John Partridge. He departed on 15 November 2012.
Storylines.
Backstory.
Syed is a British Pakistani and is the eldest son of Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia), and brother of Tamwar (Himesh Patel) and Shabnam (Zahra Ahmadi). Prior to the Masoods' arrival in Walford, Syed was estranged from his family for four years. He stole from the family business, almost bankrupting them. His father took the blame, but exiled Syed from the family. Syed moved to the north of England and worked in the property industry.
2009–12.
Syed resumes contact with his family when he experiences financial difficulties. Although Masood reveals his previous theft, Zainab forgives her son, and invites him to move into the family home when he is evicted for failing to pay his rent. Syed introduces his family to his girlfriend, Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), who soon moves to Walford to be near him. He begins working for his parents' catering company, and develops an attraction to his colleague, Christian Clarke (John Partridge). The two have sex, and Syed admits that he has had one-night stands with men before. Conflicted by his Muslim faith, Syed proposes to Amira. He continues to see Christian, whose niece Lucy (Melissa Suffield) sees them kissing and blackmails him. Christian and Syed declare their love for one another, but when Masood is involved in a car accident, Syed believes he is being punished and terminates their relationship. A hurt Christian tries to move away from Walford, but is unable to forget about Syed, and returns in an attempt to deter him from marriage. On his wedding day, Syed admits to Christian that he is gay and in love with him, but feels unable to come out because of his family and faith. Zainab discovers the truth, but implores Syed to go through with his marriage. He does so, but is initially unable to consummate it. He tells his mother that the thought of sex with Amira makes him feel physically sick. He wishes to confess his sexuality, but Zainab warns him against shaming the family and threatens to disown him. Syed attempts to commit to his marriage; he has sex with Amira, and suggests starting a family.
Despite his intentions, Syed resumes his relationship with Christian. Amira becomes pregnant but it was her misunderstanding and not real (but finally she will at the time she leaves, although she will not tell it to Syed). Syed intends to continue the affair, to Christian's displeasure. Syed accidentally ends up revealing to Amira that he is gay. Amira's father Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) becomes very mad at him. Amira terminates their relationship and leaves Walford. Christian is attacked by Qadim, and rejects Syed when he visits him. He calls him a coward for trying to appease his family. Syed is later told to find a new mosque to attend, and implored to leave Walford by Christian's best friend Roxy (Rita Simons). He takes an overdose, and regains consciousness to hear Zainab telling him it would be better if he was dead. She burns his belongings and attempts to evict him from the family home, but is stopped by Masood. Syed begins attending therapy which he believes will cure him of his homosexuality, though it proves unsuccessful. Syed knows Christian still has feelings for him, but when he visits Christian, he rejects Syed again. The following day, Syed tells Christian he chooses him and needs his help, and that he is both gay and Muslim. The two move in together, and Syed is disowned by his parents.
Syed becomes Christian's personal assistant and finds a new mosque. His parents help him escape from a fire, but they return to ignoring him in the aftermath. Trying to move on with his life, Syed starts his own massage business. He discovers that his father almost had an affair, and threatens to tell his mother, but decides against it. He is hurt when Christian kisses another man at a party, but is able to forgive him. They decide to have a child, although Syed is at first against the idea. A drunken Roxy offers to be the surrogate mother and although Syed tells Christian that it is happening too quickly, Roxy has already impregnated herself with Christian's sperm. The insemination is unsuccessful however. Syed rents a room at Roxy's salon for his massage therapy business, but steals her client list and plans to go into business with Roxy's manager, Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner). He and Christian attend Tamwar's engagement party together, much to the disgust of his parents. The roof of their restaurant collapses and knocks Syed unconscious, Christian and Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) come to his aid. Zainab is led to believe his condition is critical and visits him in hospital, but rejects him once he is discharged. Zainab visits Syed after being urged to by Yusef, but she leaves after a while admitting it was a mistake. However, when Masood lets Zainab down, she contacts Syed and they meet in a café. Masood discovers them but Syed says he cannot stop them seeing each other. Syed confronts Zainab and Masood in The Queen Victoria, telling them that if they do not accept Christian as Syed's lover then there is nothing more to say. Syed calls Masood a hypocrite for gambling and tells Zainab that they are in no position to judge him. He then tells them to live their lives and he will live his. Eventually, Syed and Zainab make amends. Christian and Syed try to pursue an adoption and Christian finds a new flat for them. However, Syed almost changes his mind and the couple split up until Syed realises that he does want a child. Syed tells his family he and Christian are engaged at a family meal, but they do not take the news well.
Syed decides to find Amira so he can get a divorce, but has trouble finding her and Christian worries about Qadim getting involved in their lives again. It is revealed Amira is practically being held hostage by her father and that she had Syed's baby, a girl called Yasmin. Eventually Amira comes to Walford and wants Syed to be part of Yasmin's life as long as Christian is not part of it. Syed and Christian agree that their relationship comes first and they will go through the courts to gain access. However, when Christian is asleep, Syed sneaks out to meet Yasmin. Syed continues to secretly see Yasmin and Amira, but when Christian learns of this, he confronts Syed and declares that Syed has to choose between him and the baby. However, he relents and gives Syed his blessing to see his child. Once Zainab knows about Yasmin, she and Amira both try to manipulate Syed into spending more time with his daughter, at the expense of Christian. Christian reveals that he had a paternity test performed, which proves that Syed is not the father of Yasmin. Syed is devastated, but Amira continues to claim that he is the father. Syed doubts Christian, believing that he may have falsified the test. However, it emerges that it was Yusef who falsified the paternity test. Syed and Christian then let Amira and Yasmin stay with them, as they have nowhere else to go. When Christian is falsely accused of touching 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), Syed doubts Christian again, leading to Christian breaking up with Syed and leaving Walford. Amira tells Syed that she has a business opportunity in Pakistan, and invites Syed to join her and Yasmin there. Syed is initially reluctant, but after Christian's sister Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) says that Christian is unlikely to reunite with him, Syed considers the move. Christian returns to Walford at Christmas, and when he sees Syed and Amira, he mocks them for behaving like a couple. However, Syed is determined to win Christian back and insists on a divorce, though Amira refuses, so he brings Qadim back to convince her. Christian and Syed then reunite, and Amira agrees to a divorce, but tells Syed that she will not leave Walford with Qadim. Amira then starts a brief relationship with Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas), and Syed and Amira start their business. However, Amira soon tires of Walford without her husband, and leaves. Syed is relieved when Christian finally reconciles with the Masood family, and Zainab invites Christian to a family dinner and to the mosque.
Syed's business ventures fail and he is in debt to a supplier. When Zainab puts Syed in charge of Tamwar's restaurant, he forges Tamwar's signature on a cheque to pay off his debt, but leaves the restaurant in debt with the mortgage unpaid. Syed meets Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), and they are attracted to each other. Syed invests money with Danny and borrows £500 back, but eventually the investment falls through, and Zainab also lends Syed money, taken from Kamil and Tamwar's trust funds. Syed and Danny kiss, but Syed regrets it and goes on to marry Christian in a civil ceremony after confessing the kiss. However, after the wedding, which takes place in the restaurant, bailiffs arrive as four months' mortgage is overdue. Syed tries to leave but eventually decides to stay, revealing that the debt is his fault and the money taken from the accounts was for him. Christian stays with him, saying they can sort the debts together. Syed is, however, under pressure from Danny to return the £500. Christian sees texts from Danny on Syed's phone and meets Danny, and Danny tells Christian he had sex with Syed. Christian punches Danny. Syed later sees Christian covered in blood and bruises. Christian lies that it was a homophobic attack, and Syed calls the police without Christian's knowledge. However, Christian is arrested for the assault on Danny. Danny tells Syed he will only retract his police statement if Syed returns £500 he owes. However, Masood threatens to tell the police about Danny's dodgy investments, so Danny withdraws the allegations. Christian asks Syed for his reassurance of their love and marriage or he will end their relationship. Syed cannot give it, so Christian moves out. Amira returns, wanting to take Yasmin to live with her and her new fiancé in Birmingham. Syed allows Amira to take her, not telling Christian, who is angry when he finds out. Christian plans to move to America to live with Jane. Syed discovers this through Masood, and brands Christian a hypocrite. Zainab and Lucy lock the pair in the Masoods' restaurant where they reunite. Refusing to leave without Syed, Christian has Jane book them both tickets and they leave together to go to America, planning to live closer to Amira and Yasmin once they return to the UK.
Creation.
Syed had been mentioned regularly since the Masoods arrived in Walford in 2007, but was not introduced on-screen until April 2009. Elliott was cast in the role after a successful reading with Ganatra and Wadia. Eliott was told he had been successfully cast just before Christmas 2008.
In an interview with entertainment and media website Digital Spy, Elliott commented on his casting, and the "responsibility" with regard to playing a character that viewers already had preconceived images about: "I hope I'm what everyone expects! I was given a biography when I got the part [...]. It's a process all characters go through to decide what they'd do in certain situations, given certain choices and basic things, for example who they'd like or dislike on . That helped to cement the character in my head [...]. He's such a complex character. It's such a collaborative experience. I'm discovering things about Syed at the same time as the rest of the team." To prepare for the role, Elliott watched documentaries such as "A Jihad for Love" which focus on the ways in which gay Muslims reconcile their faith with their sexuality.
Characterisation.
Elliott's character is apparently a smooth-talking natural charmer who knows how to get ahead in business. He is also described as "handsome, suave and sophisticated". Executive Producer Diederick Santer described Syed as "Entrepreneurial, reckless, dashing and complicated, set to bring surprises and chaos to the Masood family." Elliott revealed that the character is driven by money: "It's all about the cash. His drive is to be successful and there's nothing really Machiavellian about him — well, there potentially is — but he just wants the money because he believes he can use it to make more. [Syed's very cocksure and confident about himself but the absurd thing is that he hasn't learned from his past mistakes." He also says that "Syed manipulates people to his own ends. He's charming, confident and reckless." Wadia described the character as a "dark horse", saying, "What I like about the way they've introduced him is that you get to see the gentle side of him first — the repentant side. Then you see what he's really like over the subsequent weeks."
Development.
Shortly after his arrival, Syed's girlfriend, Amira Shah, was introduced played by Preeya Kalidas. Elliott has described the relationship between the characters and Syed's motivation: "Well, she's a rich daddy's girl and it's hard not to make the association between Syed and money. There's certainly an honest attraction there and I think he does love her. But the money that her father has might be an additional aspect of their relationship. Amira comes in and ruffles a few feathers, especially Zainab's. Obviously with Syed being a mummy's boy, she has to have her say. I don't think Zainab would be happy with anyone that Syed's with — they'd have to be absolutely perfect. Mummy Masood will be doing a lot of meddling and locking horns with Amira."
In June 2009, Syed begins an affair with gay character Christian Clarke, played by John Partridge, a storyline that will see Syed "torn between his feelings and faith". The storyline is said to be controversial, as homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam. However, Santer explained that the storyline will not be a moral tale, but one of human interest, adding: "In this regard, it's not dissimilar to the story we told when Dot Cotton's deeply-held Christian beliefs came into conflict with her desire to alleviate Ethel's suffering [in a euthanasia plotline. To all intents and purposes, Syed is a 'good' Muslim man: he doesn't drink, smoke or engage in sex before marriage. But he struggles with his sexuality when he finds himself drawn to Christian and he believes this goes against his faith. This is not a story about Syed and Christian's physical relationship — we don't see anything beyond one kiss. It's more about the inner turmoil and conflict Syed endures trying to remain true to his faith while questioning his sexuality. Syed has already been ostracised from his family and community once and if he's true to his heart he risks losing his family again." Santer also said that "EastEnders" always tries to "reflect modern life in multicultural Britain and social issue stories relevant to [its diverse audience," and that "The dynamics of Muslim relationships and families are not radically different from any others but the importance that Muslim culture places on family and married life can make the same issues more charged." Elliott commented on the storyline, saying: "I think "EastEnders" would be doing the programme a disservice if they didn't give a voice to various communities. I think that's really important because I think London is a very ethnically diverse multicultural place, and "EastEnders" has a job to reflect that in the story lines it gives people and the characters they have on board." This plot was researched with help from academics, gay Muslim support groups and members of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, and will contain a "balance of opinions" from various other characters, including Syed's mother Zainab.
When asked in a BBC interview in September 2009 if Syed is gay or bisexual, Elliott answered: "I think at this stage there's confusion about his sexuality. He knows he likes Christian but it hasn't really been stipulated. He wants to settle down and have children with Amira because that's what's expected of him, but he finds himself unavoidably attracted to Christian so that's what's going on in his head." He went on to say that Syed is still attracted to Amira but only because "that's what he’s meant to do", adding that "he's probably conning himself." Christian's friend James Mackie, played by Paul Keating arrives and when Syed refuses to break up with Amira, Christian starts a relationship with James to forget Syed. Elliott says that this is the moment when Syed realises his feelings for Christian go beyond sexual attraction. Elliot explains that Syed and Amira have never been intimate, in theory because of their religion, but adds that Syed is probably scared to get intimate with her and is merely hiding behind his religion.
In December 2009, Santer was asked what his favourite story line of the year had been. He replied "I'm really pleased with the Christian/Syed story line. It's bold and we thought long and hard before we did it to make sure we got it right and I'm really proud with what we've done. Marc and John [Partridge have absolutely stepped up to the plate and like all good "EastEnders" stories, we're not even half done with it yet. There's miles to go."
Syed and Amira's wedding takes place on screen on 1 January 2010. They have a traditional Pakistani wedding featuring horses, drummers and dancers. Scriptwriters researched by watching videos of a real British Pakistani wedding. BBC Asian Network reporter Shabnam Mahmood also advised on the wedding. The wedding and its build-up were filmed over a two-week period and Elliott required three two-hour riding lessons before he could film the horseback scenes. He revealed: "I was quite proud of myself, though, as I managed to canter although I don't do that around the Square as it's not that big. During rehearsals the horse, Storm, was really well behaved and it all went fairly smoothly. But as soon as it came to the actual filming and all the drums and banners came out, it wasn't so easy. I think she walks sideways for quite a bit of the time. But I'm just pleased that I didn't end up impaled on the railings in Albert Square. I think avoiding that was quite an achievement." John Partridge choreographed the dance scenes and Elliott took six weeks to learn the dance, saying: "I couldn't have done it without him . He had me practising in every spare moment, even in the hallways by myself as he wanted to see a marked improvement on my routine. Preeya kept getting occasional glimpses of me practising in the hallways and she didn't look too impressed with what she saw. Johnny did a great job with that routine, although I added in the back flip myself! By the end of it, I ate, slept and dreamt that dance."
Before the wedding, Syed's affair with Christian is revealed to his mother Zainab and he admits to her that he is gay. She urges him to go ahead with the wedding and only a small number of people know about Syed and Christian. Elliot said he was pleased that the affair came out this way, as "it's far more realistic this way". He added that the writers would have "done the story a disservice" if Syed and Christian had ended up with their 'happily ever after', saying "they need to show the life after the wedding and show how Syed will cope living with a wife who he loves, but not in the way he loves Christian. He has to live with the fact that he's not being true to himself over his sexuality." Elliott noted a change in Syed's personality, saying "Syed's starting to show signs of being quite a cruel character but it's only through his own bitterness and resentment that he starts acting the way he does – it's the way he deals with it. Poor Amira's none the wiser, so Syed's not acting right and she has no idea why."
In 2011, a same-sex parenting storyline which sees Christian and Syed finding a surrogate mother was reported by the "Daily Mirror". If true, it will form one of the year's biggest plots, expected to controversial and a ratings hit. In March 2011, it was reported that a Syed would be among characters sustaining injuries when the roof of his parents' restaurant, The Argee Bhajee, collapses. The scenes, to air in April 2011, were filmed in February, and a spokespoerson said "Despite the ill-feeling between him and his parents, Syed is in the building when the disastrous party takes place. But what the accident could mean for the family feud remains to be seen." The plot could see Syed and Christian share more screentime with the rest of the Masood family, as Partridge commented that the issues may start to be resolved, though not necessarily leading to the outcome viewers will want.
A scene showing Syed and Christian naked in bed together prompted over 100 complaints to the BBC. "EastEnders" executive producer Bryan Kirkwood was forced to defend the scenes. The mixed response from viewers to the scenes confirms the findings of a BBC survey last year, which showed that gay relationships are still a divisive issue. On the other hand, some other viewers praised the BBC for showing "the fabulous portrait of the relationship between Syed and Christian". The viewer said the gay bed scene was a "big step towards equality". The BBC stated in response The BBC’s statement said: "EastEnders aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities".
Civil partnership; Danny Pennant.
It was confirmed that newcomer Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy) would be romantically linked to Syed, who is embroiled in a serious relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge). Elliott revealed Danny would return, saying: "He returns - he can't be punched in the face in the Argee Bhajee and leave without his dignity! He's got to come back and get some sort of revenge, and he does." Elliott also stated that Christian would get involved with the city banker, stating: "Christian becomes involved in a storyline with him, which involves the police and possibly arrests." Finally Elliott expressed his happiness on his parents accepting his relationship with Christian, explaining: "I think that's been really important. Obviously there's been a three and a half year build to them getting married, and I think there has been a huge shift. But then I think when we started the story, we were surprised by how accepting the audience was and how ready they were to see something like that. It's been brilliant."
Departure.
On 7 September 2012, it was announced that Syed and Christian would be departing in November 2012 in an explosive storyline that bosses did not reveal at the time. Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: "Marc and John have been a fantastic part of the show and their characters have been a huge success. Their storylines have broken boundaries that have not been seen in a soap before and the love for them by the viewers can be seen in their 'Chryed' fans. When Marc announced he had decided to move on, we had a tough decision to make. After numerous conversations, which included John, it was decided that there is only one outcome for Syed and Christian. We wish them both all the best for the future."
Reception.
Critically, both Syed's gay storyline and Marc Elliott's acting were well received, with Elliott winning Best Newcomer at The British Soap Awards in 2010. From its inception, however, Syed's gay storyline was criticised by Asghar Bokhari of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee, who said "The Muslim community deserves a character that represents them to the wider public because Islamophobia is so great right now. There's a lack of understanding of Muslims already and I think "EastEnders" really lost an opportunity to present a normal friendly Muslim character to the British public." One British Muslim fan of "EastEnders" reportedly told the Al Arabiya news channel that the storyline "is not a true reflection of the majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom." Another British Muslim said "I think it's bad, it is going to give a bad impression about Islam. The type of people that watch "EastEnders" are going to be very naïve about such a portrayal of Muslims," but added that Muslims probably would not boycott the show as "generally practicing Muslims don't really watch "EastEnders"."
Diederick Santer responded to the criticisms of Muslim viewers by saying "It's really important that [...] we give the Masoods big stories. Sometimes there's a danger of being too careful with black or Asian characters that we might go into territories that might offend. But it seems to me if we steer away from any controversy, they don't stand a chance of being a great "EastEnders" family — they'll just be in their kitchen unit making curries for years and years and that's not going to be very interesting." Yusuf Wehebi from LGBT Muslim advocacy group Imaan said: "It is high time that the invisible minority became a visible minority. It is entirely possible to be Muslim and gay and there many of us in Britain today. It is great that the BBC have had the courage to raise such an important social issue in our society today." The kiss between Syed and Christian was watched by 7.9 million viewers. Anila Baig of "The Sun" wrote that the kiss was a "damp squib" and "unconvincing". Elliott told "Soaplife" magazine that he has received no negative feedback from the show's fans for the storyline.
The 1 January 2010 episode in which Syed marries Amira in a Pakistani wedding received overnight ratings of 11.64 million viewers, an average audience share of 39.3%. The ultimate five minutes of the episode, in which Christian and Syed share an emotional goodbye, received a peak of 12.34 million viewers. The wedding was criticised by a writer for Asian Image, who said "With so much resources at hand they couldn't even get a Muslim wedding right. It was colourful and noisy but the priest couldn't speak the lingo properly and the wedding vows were all wrong. What was the priest doing sat between the bride and groom? At least attempt to make it as realistic as possible. It was Indian and then Pakistani – what on earth was going on! For a prime-time show which was watched by millions at least try to get as close to a real Pakistani Muslim wedding as possible. The whole thing reminded me of one of 1960s botched jobs put together by some middle-aged white man who 'thought it happened this way so it must!'" A Channel Five retrospective on soap weddings in 2010, however, deemed the "dramatic Bollywood-style wedding" to be "spectacular".
In July 2010, viewers complained after Syed was seen dropping his Qu'ran in frustration. The BBC responded by saying "It was not intended to be a disrespectful act, rather a totally spontaneous one, symbolic of Syed's utter confusion and frustration at what feels like an impossible situation. It wasn't our intention to cause any offence." Additionally, Ofcom received 23 complaints from viewers who said the gay Muslim storyline was offensive to their faith. In the same month, the Syed-Christian storyline was commented on in Stonewall research, which found that positive and realistic gay characters appear in just 0.6% of broadcast television. Stonewall noted the romance storyline was a predominantly violent and unhappy one. Among readers of "Inside Soap", Syed and Christian came second in a poll of characters favoured to marry on-screen in 2011.
In January 2011, Elliott was nominated for Serial Drama Performance at the 2011 National Television Awards for his portrayal of Syed but did not make it to the shortlist. "Inside Soap" readers voted Syed their favourite member of the Masood family. Kate White from "Inside Soap" ran a feature on what Christmas presents she would give to soap characters. White said she would buy Syed a backbone in the hope he would stand up for himself, as his "lack of will power" drove Christian away. Following the storyline where Syed causes his family to lose their restaurant, "Heat" called him "clinically stupid".
Response from previous cast members.
Syed, along with the rest of the Masood family, was criticised by actor Deepak Verma, who played Sanjay Kapoor between 1993 and 1998. He said that "EastEnders" had failed to portray Asian families in a realistic manner, branding the family "two-dimensional and ill-conceived". A BBC spokesperson responded by saying "It's a shame Deepak feels that way but that's clearly his personal opinion. The Masood family have proved to be hugely popular with "EastEnders" viewers." During Syed's gay storyline, actor Jimi Mistry, who played gay Asian character Fred Fonseca in "EastEnders" between 1998 and 2000, expressed surprise in October 2009 at another gay Asian storyline in the programme. Mistry said "It's amazing, isn't it? It was ten years ago when we did it and they're still going down that path. I can't really comment though. I did my stint and I did see they were going along that road again but it's their choice. They must think that people have forgotten the last time they did it, so maybe they're just redoing it in a different way."

Frank Wilfred Vining (February 29, 1924 – October 27, 1989) was an influential teacher of pottery who founded and, for over thirty years, led the ceramics course at Cardiff College of Art.
Vining was born in the south Wales mining village of Aberfan, in a house later swept away in the great tip disaster of 1966. He originally studied pictorial design and illustration at Cardiff School of Art under Ceri Richards, who was Head of Painting there from 1940 to 1944, but later turned to pottery. He joined the staff of Cardiff College of Art in 1950 and taught there until his retirement in 1982 during which time the ceramics course had become well known and highly regarded in the UK and abroad, with both undergraduate and postgraduate awards being established. He lived in Cardiff from 1954 where he set up a small studio pottery in the late 1950s, producing modernist stoneware vessels and forms which he exhibited widely in the period 1961-1968. His pottery is represented in the collections of the National Museum Cardiff, Aberystwyth University and Camberwell/ILEA Collection of Design and Craft, and is illustrated in Hamer.

Albert Pynegar

Albert Pynegar (24 September 1895 – 1978) was an English footballer who played at inside-forward for Eastwood Rangers, Sutton Town, Leicester City, Coventry City, Oldham Athletic, Port Vale, Chesterfield, and Rotherham United. He helped Port Vale to the Third Division North title in 1929–30, and then fired Chesterfield to the same honour the following season.
Playing career.
Pynegar played for Eastwood Rangers, Sutton Town, Leicester City, Coventry City and Oldham Athletic, before joining Port Vale in January 1929, in a deal where he and £1,300 were exchanged for Stewart Littlewood. He had been the "Latics" top-scorer in the 1926–27 and 1927–28 seasons with 19 and 18 goals respectively. He scored a hat-trick in an 8–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion at The Old Recreation Ground on 9 March, and then four goals in a 5–0 win over Bristol City on 4 May. Despite these comprehensive victories, and his record of ten goals in 18 games, Vale were relegated out of the Second Division at the end of the 1928–29 season. In the 1929–30 season, Pynegar scored 22 goals in 33 games, whilst strike partner Sam Jennings claimed 27 goals, to help the club win the Third Division North title. This tally of Pynegar's included a hat-trick against New Brighton on 9 September. In the 1930–31 campaign he scored three goals in nine games, before he was dropped from the first team. He put in a transfer request which was granted when he was transferred to Chesterfield in October 1930; apparently there developed a rift between him and Jennings. The "Spireites" won the Third Division North title in 1930–31, finished 17th in 1931–32, and were then relegated out of the Second Division in 1932–33. He then moved to Rotherham United in a player-exchange for Jimmy McCormick, and scored three goals in 17 Third Division North games in the 1933–34 season.

Davis v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts

Davis v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 167 U.S. 43 (1897), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States sustained a conviction of a man for making a speech on Boston Common in violation of an ordinance that forbade the making of a public address there without a permit from the mayor.
Facts of the case.
Section 66 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Boston (1893) reads as follows: 
'Sec. 66. No person shall, in or upon any of the public grounds, make any public address, discharge any cannon or firearm, expose for sale any goods, wares or merchandise, erect or maintain any booth, stand, tent or apparatus for the purposes of public amusement or show, except in accordance with a permit from the mayor.'
It was alleged by the prosecution that Davis made a speech on Boston Common without a permit. Davis was brought before the Municipal Court of the City of Boston and convicted of violating section 66.
Prior history.
The proceedings were removed to the Superior Court of the county of Suffolk, where Davis renewed a motion which he had interposed in the municipal court to quash the complaint. There were seven reasons argued to support the motion; among these was the assertion that the ordinance violated the rights alleged to be secured to the accused by the constitution of the state, and by the Fourteenth Amendment. The motion to quash being overruled by the Superior Court, Davis was tried before the court and a jury.
At the trial the government put in evidence the ordinance heretofore referred to, and called the attention of the court to sections 35 and 39 of chapter 448 of the acts passed by the legislature of Massachusetts in the year 1854. Davis was convicted and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.
Decision.
Davis' conviction was upheld by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.

Further sub-60-minute performances came in the men's race in 2010, but it was women's winner Elvan Abeylegesse who was the most impressive runner at the fourth edition: her time of 1:07:07 was not only the fastest ever for a debut half marathon run, but it also placed her as the sixth fastest ever woman over the distance. The race saw its first women's world record performance in 2011, as Mary Keitany became the first female under the 66-minute mark with her winning time of 1:05:50.
The 2013 saw a race first with three men under 59 minutes, while winner Geoffrey Kipsang was two seconds off the course record. The women's race re-wrote the all-time rankings as Lucy Kabuu ran the second fastest time ever to win in 66:09 minutes and Priscah Jeptoo and Rita Jeptoo (second and third) both entered the top five all-time fastest.

Pruritus vulvae

Pruritus vulvae is pruritus of the vulva, which is the counterpart of pruritus scroti, and may have many different causes. Patch testing may be used to diagnose the cause.
Causes.
This condition is a symptom of an underlying condition more often than it is a primary condition. 
Vulva irritation can be caused by any moisture left on the skin. This moisture may be perspiration, urine, vaginal discharge or small amounts of stool. 
It may be caused by vaginal infections, vulvitis, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) infection, anal incontinence, Bowen's disease, or dietary irritants (caffeine, tomatoes, and peanuts). 
Treatment with antibiotics can lead to a yeast infection and irritation of the vulva.
Some diseases increase the possibility of yeast infections, such as diabetes mellitus or HIV infection. 
Chronic inflammation of the vulva predisposes to the development of premalignant or malignant changes.

E18 Album

E18 Album is the debut album by the band Detektivbyrån released by the Japanese label P-Vine under license from the band's own label Danarkia. It may also be viewed as a compilation album as it mainly contains all the songs from the EP Hemvägen and the single "Lyckans Undulat". Also included on the album is the song "Laka-Koffa" that had previously only been released on the vinyl "Detektivbyrån - Hemstad". The song "Home Sweet Home", which is a variant of "Hem Ljuva Hem", was previously unreleased.
The album name "E18 Album" is a likely homage to the European route E18 that passes through the city of Karlstad, Värmland where the band members grew up.

Gillian Cooke

Gillian Cooke (born 3 October 1982) is a Scottish track and field athlete and bobsledder.
Biography.
Gillian Cooke was born and brought up in Edinburgh. Educated at George Watson's College, she began her sporting career in track and field with Edinburgh Southern Harriers. In 2001, she took fourth place in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Youth Games, and set a Scottish junior record for the pole vault. She set three Scottish senior records in the pole vault in two months in 2002, and was selected to represent Scotland in that event at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.
In 2003, she also began competing in the long jump, and took the silver medal at the AAA championships. She began concentrating on the long jump in 2004, earning GB selection in that event in 2005. She represented Scotland in the long jump at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, finishing eleventh. She also topped the Scottish 100 m sprint rankings and British 60 metres rankings.
Following a foot injury which delayed her track and field training, Cooke joined driver Nicola Minichiello in the two-woman bobsleigh as brakewoman following a trial in October 2008. Minichello and Cooke won the gold medal in the two-woman event at the FIBT World Championships 2009 in Lake Placid, New York. The pair finished seventh at the same event in St Moritz in 2010, despite some difficulty with Cooke's prototype racing suit, which split open seconds before the start of her bobsleigh run. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, they crashed out during the third run of the two-woman event and did not start the final run as a result.
Following Minichiello's retirement from the sport, Cooke became brakewoman for Paula Walker, Minichiello's successor as British no. 1 driver. Rebekah Wilson replaced Cooke as Walker's partner and took the GBR1 slot for Sochi in 2014.
Cooke's brother Stephen Cooke is a semi-professional footballer and has played for Elgin City.

Barnstormers Spasm Band

The Barnstormers Spasm Band, also known as the Original Barnstormers Spasm Band, were a jazz band active from 1956 to 1961. The band was almost unique in remaining a semi-professional group for the entire duration of their existence.
History.
The friends John Gunn and James Robinson created the band in 1956 when they met in a hospital, then later they recruited John and Peter Wadley. In mid 1957 were joined by Brian Rust, a respected jazz journalist, writer and erstwhile washboard player. In late 1957 the banjoist John Denning completed their line-up. They applied and subsequently auditioned for Hughie Green's 'Opportunity Knocks' and were turned down. This spurred them on to produce a demonstration disc (at Oriole Records) which they sent to Rex Harris at the BBC who played it on his show. The jazz guitarist and agent Neville Skrimshire either heard the broadcast or was given the demo and recommended them to Parlophone where they recorded several sides. 'Whistling Rufus' was moderately successful and accordingly the Barnstormers appeared in a number of television shows and also appeared at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1958 the multi-instrumentalist John R T Davies briefly replaced Brian Rust after the BBC; his employer, citing conflict of interests, refused him permission to appear on TV. Rust rejoined the band soon after, until eventually leaving for good in late 1960. In January 1959, they transferred to Decca Records' Tempo label and made probably the last 78rpm record to be issued in the UK. Several recordings were subsequently made at Levy's Sound Studios - Oriole in 1960 but were never (to my knowledge) released.
The Barnstormers disbanded in 1961.

Punjabi stageshow

Introduction.
As in any society, Urdu language theatre or stage show was one of the defining characteristics of the society. Originating from the city of Karachi, it was famous through the sub-continent and with immigrant population of South Asians through the Globe. However, in Pakistan, there was an emphasis on full comedy shows, usually implementing insult comedy. By the mid-90s, Urdu stage shows started seeing their numbers dwell and it quickly went out of the scene. However by the beginning of the 2000s, the industry shifted to Punjab. Originating in the city of Lahore, and eventually being staffed by comedians from Faisalabad, the Industry saw a sudden boom. This was fueled by 'Dances', where similar to an Urdu/Punjabi/Hindi movie a song would start in the middle of the scene. Shown throughout Lahore on Cable operators, it quickly spread to the rest of Punjab and eventually the world wide immigrant Punjabi population, through the medium of Compact Dics and increasingly DVD.
Format.
Punjabi Stage Shows can be best described as semi-improvisational insult comedy. With a loose but complete story, comedians often go out of character while indiscriminately insulting the rest of the crew. Very often jokes and replies are made on the stage, leading to the crew bursting in laughter. There is even interaction with the audience at time.
Actors.
amanat chan and sohail Ahmed are few of the very artists who do not believe in doing vulgar dramas.

Edward J. Schulte

Edward J. Schulte (1890–1975) was an architect who designed a number of mid-twentieth-century churches notable for their blending of a modern idiom with traditional function. Inspired by an encounter with Ralph Adams Cram, he devoted himself to building church buildings, designing over 88. He served as president of the Cincinnati chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
Schulte had a sole practice after 1912, then practiced with Robert E. Crowe from 1921–1923, and practiced alone after that to 1967.
Early life and education.
Edward Schulte displayed a talent for drawing early on and was encouraged to pursue it by the nuns in the parochial school he attended as a child. His father, a building contractor, wanted him to take up architecture instead, suggesting him to the firm of Werner and Adkins, who had designed a Carnegie library for Norwood. (Schulte’s father was one of three trustees to build it.) Schulte began working for Werner and Adkins during the day while attending classes at the Art Academy at night, eventually becoming a valued member of the firm with a special skill for watercolor renderings of proposed projects for client presentations. Before long, however, Werner and Adkins began to suffer from financial problems, temporarily loaning Schulte out to another firm before bringing him back upon securing a new partner – H.E. Kennedy – and several new commissions, among them an office building for New Orleans.
Early career.
Kennedy was awarded the commission to design the Harris Theater in downtown Pittsburgh and had Schulte design it – a task that required him to spend long nights in the library researching precedents for the relatively new building typology. Among the draftsmen for the project was Robert E. Crowe, who would later become Schulte's partner and most important collaborator. Upon the success of the Harris Theatre project, Kennedy moved his office to Pittsburgh, bringing Schulte along with him. It was during this time that Schulte attended a candlelit lecture by Ralph Adams Cram at the Hall of Architecture in the Carnegie Museum, inspiring him to focus on churches over the remainder of his career.

Wermland (album)

Wermland is the second album by Detektivbyrån released on the band's own label Danarkia. In contrast to the band's debut/compilation album E18 Album, "Wermland" features only new content. Prior to the album being available for purchase, the band made the songs "Om Du Möter Varg" and "Neonland" available on their website. During the autumn of 2008 the album reached the third place in the Swedish charts of album sales.
Critical Reception.
As the band was active in Sweden the album was predominantly reviewed by Swedish newspapers and magazines.
Olle Sjögren of Norrländska Socialdemokraten begins his review of Wermland
by noting that the album's "shining gold-metallic artwork with measured
typography [...] could have been part of a luxury PR-campaign from 
Louis Vuitton." He also notes that "Detektivbyrån separate themselves 
from other folktronica artists by allowing the folk music to play a big part".
Olle concludes the review by writing "Detektivbyrån's Wermland is so far the
prettiest approach to integrating Swedish folk music with modern electronic
elements, without coming close to the awful Nordman and 
Sarek."
The review in Norran by Per Strömbro beings with "An improbable debut,
improbably good that is." About the genre he writes "they offer intrinsically
Swedish instrumental music with particularly contagious accordion and synth
melodies." Per concludes his text with "One of this year's big
debuts."
Nancy Baym of Scandinavian music journal "It's a trap" provides one of few
English language reviews where she notes that "the sheer fun of their sound has
won them and an enthusiastic following. 'Wermland' [...] is fun." She also
writes "it demonstrates impeccable melodic pop sensibility." And closes with
"This serious contender for album of the year will sounds just as good decades
from now."
In the Swedish music magazine Groove, Per Lundberg GB wrote "With Wermland
Detektivbyrån continues to embrace the melancholy. [...] While on their way
they meet up with Cougar and Aphex Twin. Wermland is
cabaret, pop and folk music in one package."
Some reviews were not entirely positive. Helsingborgs Dagblad referred to
the album as "pre-school pop" that "too often veer into accordion-circus-music
on drugs". Still the review stressed that "the joy of the music is contagious"
and that the best part of the album is its "melancholic, french sound". The
review summarized the album as "a 40 minute long lullaby for three year olds".
Personnel.
played drums, accordion, vibraphone, case, drawing pin piano, glockenspiel, klicker, mellotron, music box, pen, scissors, shoes, synthesizer, tele cables, traktofon. Additionally the band composed, produced, mixed, mastered and recorded the album.

74th Troop Command (United States)

The 74th Troop Command is a brigade-level command of the District of Columbia Army National Guard that provides logistical and administrative support for nonorganic deploying MTOE units in the District that are not structured under another formation headquarters (HQ). It is the largest direct reporting unit in the District of Columbia Army National Guard. The Command is a subordinate of Joint Force Headquarters, District Area Command.
Current mission.
As a separate STARC headquarters detachment in accordance with National Guard Regulation 10-2, the primary mission of the 74th Troop Command is to command, control, and supervise Army National Guard units attached to the troop command and to provide manned, trained and equipped units capable of immediate expansion to war strength and available for service in time of war or national emergency or when appropriate to augment the active army.
History.
Comprising some of the most acclaimed units in the Army's rich history, the Command has heritage dating back to the DC Militia of the 18th century and its Revolutionary War roles. The command's subordinate units trace their roots back to the Civil War.
World War I to World War II.
The DCNG's all black 1st Separate Infantry Battalion was one of World War I's most trusted fighting units. This unit became a part of the 372d Infantry Regiment, which fell under the French 157th "Red Hand" Infantry Division, and saw extensive combat in World War I. The 1st Separate Infantry was hand selected to be a part of the Red Hand Division because they were known as extremely loyal. It was the only element of the DCNG to actually see combat during the war.
DC National Guard units also joined the neighboring 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia and Maryland National Guards throughout battles in World Wars I and II. DC's 121st Engineer Combat Battalion came ashore on Omaha Beach during the WWII D-Day invasion. There were no DCNG men in the unit by the time of the invasion. 
The Cold War Era.
The 715th Truck Company was the only unit to go to Korea and participate in combat operations during the Korean War. Naming their company orderly room "Blair House," they flew a DC flag over the Korean peninsula on 8 December 1951. 74th Troop Command heritage continued to deploy overseas to every major conflict in support of the United States Army throughout the Cold War era.
The Global War on Terror.
Each MTOE unit within the 74th Troop Command has deployed, in some capacity (either as an organic element in its entirety, or in the form of a forward detachment), to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility in support of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF).
All eleven individual units within the Command's current force structure have deployed more than half of their soldiers in support of OEF/OIF, making it the most deployed force in the DC National Guard.

Jody Lehman

Jody Lehman (born July 1, 1975 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada) is a Canadian-British professional ice hockey player, currently playing for Aalborg in Denmark's highest league, the Oddset Ligaen.
Playing career.
He began playing for the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League in 1991-92, and stayed there until the 1995-96 season when he moved to the Brandon Wheat Kings (also of the WHL).
Following this season he moved on to the Wichita Thunder of the Central Hockey League, before his move to the South Carolina Stingrays for the 1998-99 season. This was a successful spell for Lehman, who in his 4 seasons for South Carolina won a Kelly Cup (2000–01) and also received a call up to the Rochester Americans of the AHL.
But following the 2001-02 season Lehman moved across the Atlantic to play for the British side the Coventry Blaze. His first season was very successful as the Blaze won major honours, winning the league and the playoffs (the team went unbeaten winning the playoffs).
The next season the Blaze and Lehman moved into the newly formed Elite Ice Hockey League(EIHL) finishing 3rd in its inaugural season. The next season (2004–05) was a highly successful season for both Lehman and the Blaze as they dominated the league backed by the outstanding netminding of Lehman who had his best season for the Blaze. They went on to win the Grand Slam, winning the league, playoffs and the challenge cup. The goaltending of Lehman had been a key to this success, which was demonstrated in the playoff finals, where the Blaze won a tight game in overtime beating the Nottingham Panthers.
Following the Grand Slam season, Lehman decided to move to fellow EIHL side the Sheffield Steelers.
His first two season there were far less successful both stats wise and in terms of trophies (collecting just the British Knockout Cup, after beating the Blaze over two legs).
Things turned around in the 2007-08 season as the Steelers made a late challenge for the League title, only to fall just short after a tremendous late season surge in results. They did, however, go on to win the Playoff championship. In the quarter-finals they beat the Manchester Phoenix 9-8 over two legs to qualify for the Playoff finals weekend. Here Lehman played some of the best hockey of his career, first holding the Cardiff Devils to a single goal, and saving a penalty shot in a 2-1 win. Then in the final, the Steelers beat the League champions the Coventry Blaze (2-0), with Lehman shutting them out in a tremendous performance, particularly in the closing stages as the Blaze poured on the pressure. 
After speculation that Lehman would sign with another European side, he eventually re-signed for his fourth season with the Steelers. After a shakey start to the season, in which they were knocked out of both the Challenge Cup and Knockout Cup early, the Steelers settled down.
After a long season, the Sheffield Steelers won the Elite League for the first time in 5 years, thanks largely to Lehman's outstanding performances throughout the season. At the Steelers' final home game of the season on March 21, 2009, Lehman broke the British ice hockey goaltending record for most shutouts in a season. The 4-0 shutout of Basingstoke Bison was Lehman's 9th of the season.
In April 2009, Lehman announced that he felt he had achieved everything possible in the British game, and saw his move to Denmark as a fresh challenge.
Lehman now resides in his hometown of North Battleford, Sask., with his wife and children.

Prurigo simplex

Prurigo simplex is a term for a chronic, itchy, idiopathic skin condition.
Prurigo simplex is a pruritus disorder of the skin characterized by extremely itchy skin nodules and lesions. Typically, there is no known direct cause of prurigo simplex, but some factors are known to trigger or aggravate it. This condition falls between chronic and acute, sometimes transitioning into a chronic condition. Many people experience a recurrence of the condition after periods of remission. Middle-aged patients are the most prone age group to this condition.
The most common prurigo simplex symptoms are skin nodules resembling insect bites that are intensely itchy. These nodules are frequently scratched open, becoming lesions that continue to itch. Sometimes the skin thickens and becomes discolored around the nodules. The scalp, arms, legs and trunk of the body are the most frequent sites of the bumps and lesions. Itching can become severe and habitual, worsening the condition and possibly causing infections in the open sores.
Sometimes the nodules become less itchy and eventually disappear leaving a discolored area or scar tissue. The same nodules can persist for months or even years, though, without healing. Patients may experience a remission but then relapse with new nodules forming. The condition might also become chronic, with no periods of improvement and relief.

Jonathan Gibralter

Dr. Jonathan C. Gibralter was named the 14th president of Frostburg State University in March 2006.
Dr. Gibralter earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from the State University of New York at Binghamton, his master of arts degree in counseling psychology from New York University, and a Ph.D. in human development from Syracuse University.
After earning his bachelor’s degree, Dr. Gibralter worked in the mental health field as he advanced his education. After about a decade working in a variety of mental health venues, he followed his interest into academics, becoming a faculty member at the State University of New York at Morrisville. Morrisville was also where he discovered an interest in higher education administration, becoming associate dean of the school of liberal arts. He eventually progressed through a series of increasing administrative positions at New York colleges, culminating in his presidency at Farmingdale State University of New York, part of the SUNY system, where he was president from 2001 to 2006.
His leadership at Farmingdale was critical to gaining funds for a number of projects, many related to the development of the Broad Hollow Bioscience Park, a collaborative effort between Cold Spring Harbor and Farmingdale State to grow the bioscience industry on Long Island. They include $20 million in New York state funding for construction of the Bioscience Incubator facility and $2.5 million through the New York Senate Ge*NY*sis program for the purchase of laboratory equipment. He also acquired $2.7 million to purchase a new fleet of aircraft for the Farmingdale Professional Pilot Program on the Farmingdale campus.
Also at Farmingdale, Dr. Gibralter initiated a major gifts campaign and developed a comprehensive strategic plan. These efforts, as well as a marketing and enrollment plan and a student retention program, resulted in the highest increase in applications and enrollment in the SUNY system for that period while simultaneously increasing admission selectivity. Six new bachelor degree programs were instituted in his tenure.
On Aug. 2, 2006, Dr. Gibralter took the helm at Frostburg State University, where he oversees a campus community of nearly 5,000 students and 260 full-time faculty members and a budget of more than $80 million. His priority of increasing and stabilizing enrollment, aided by the Enrollment Management Committee, a task force of campus and community constituencies, resulted in FSU welcoming its largest freshman class in history in the fall of 2007.
He was instrumental in bringing to Allegany County a grant of $2.5 million for site work for the first building in the Allegany Business Center at Frostburg State University, a technology park on the FSU campus. He has also begun addressing regional workforce development and the revitalization of Frostburg’s historic Main Street.
In addition, he established the Office of Communications and Media Relations with the goal of raising the institution’s profile beyond Western Maryland, and he is focusing on the development of a $15 million capital campaign.
He has also put his own energies behind the movement at FSU and elsewhere to address issues of climate change and sustainability. He is a charter signatory and member of the Leadership Circle of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment,and he was appointed by Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to the Greenhouse Gas and Carbon Mitigation Working Group, a sub-group of the Maryland Climate Change Commission [http://www.mdclimatechange.us/index.cfm. In September 2009, under Dr. Gibralter’s leadership, FSU submitted a Climate Action Plan to the ACUPCC, which provides strategic steps and actions for the campus community on how to reduce carbon emissions. In April 2010, Dr. Gibralter was named to the Second Nature’s National Transportation Policy Task Force [http://www.frostburg.edu/news/searchnewsdt.cfm?id_number=6108], which is composed of college and university presidents with the goal of combining institutions that are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and national transportation policy.
In September 2008, Dr. Gibralter was honored with the national Presidential Leadership Award [http://www.outsidetheclassroom.com/news-events/news/press-releases/07pla.aspx] from a group of seven major higher education organizations for his efforts in promoting a campus climate that de-emphasizes alcohol and for his leadership in fighting binge-drinking at colleges and universities across the country.
He has served in a number of roles in higher education organizations, including serving as a Commissioner for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education [http://www.msche.org/about_commissioners.asp] and as the representative for Maryland on the American Association of State Colleges and Universities’ Council of State Representatives.

Autotrain

The Autotrain was a type of passenger train used in the early 20th century, where the steam locomotive could be remotely controlled from the rear of the train. This meant that the engine would not have to run-around at the end of a journey before returning. These trains were also known as motor trains or railmotors at the time, but the term railmotor is now used to refer to trains where the steam engine was integrated into the coach.
A driving cab in the rearmost coach has controls to allow the driver to operate the regulator, brake and whistle when driving the train 'in reverse'. The fireman would remain on the engine in order to stoke the fire and to take off the brakes as the driver could only apply them.
Autotrains were being used by most rail companies in Great Britain by the 1920s, and were particularly common on branch line services. They remained in widespread use until the 1950s and 1960s, when they were replaced by diesel multiple units (DMUs).

Board of Indian Commissioners

The Board of Indian Commissioners was a committee that advised the federal government of the United States on Native American policy and it inspected supplies delivered to Indian agencies to ensure the fulfillment of government treaty obligations to tribes. 
History.
The board, established by Congress on 10 April 1869, authorized the president to organize a board of not more than ten persons “to be selected by him from men eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy, to serve without pecuniary compensation.” It remained an all-Protestant, male body until 1902, when President Theodore Roosevelt appointed two Roman Catholics to fill vacancies.
Grant's Indian peace policy.
Beginning in 1869, and in concert with the board, President Ulysses S. Grant attempted to formulate a new humane policy towards Native American tribes that was free of political corruption. Known as the "Peace Policy", it aimed to place Native Americans on reservations where, in collaboration with Christian Church organizations, the Office of Indian Affairs would provide Native Americans with moral and competent Indian agents, establish churches and schools, teach agriculture and civilized pursuits and provide high-quality supplies at reasonable prices. 
In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received fourteen; the Orthodox Friends ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Roman Catholics seven; the Hicksite Friends six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; Christians two; Unitarians two; American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions one; and Lutherans one. The distribution caused immediate dissatisfaction among many groups who claimed that they had been slighted or overlooked. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Among the Roman Catholics, this dissatisfaction led to the establishment of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions in 1874. 
The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881, when the government heeded the protests of religious organizations whose missionaries had been removed from reservations on which they had not been assigned.

Papuloerythroderma of Ofuji is a rare disorder most commonly found in Japan, characterized by pruritic papules that spare the skinfolds, producing bands of uninvolved cutis, creating the so-called deck-chair sign. Frequently there is associated blood eosinophilia. Skin biopsies reveal a dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, eosinophils in the papillary dermis, and increased Langerhans cells (S-100 positive). Systemic steroids are the treatment of choice and may result in long-term remissions.

Tragic Hero (film)

Tragic Hero (Cantonese Yale: Ying hung ho hon) is a 1987 Hong Kong action-crime film directed by Taylor Wong, and starring Andy Lau, Chow Yun-Fat and Alex Man. The film is the sequel to Rich And Famous but was released first due to its appeal as an action movie.
Summary.
The movie begins in 1980. Li Ah Chai (Chow Yun Fat) has slowly become passive with his focus on family life. Meanwhile, Yung (Alex Man) is now out of jail and is now a rising power within Chu Lo Tai's gang. They run into each other at a gangster's funeral. Ah Chai shakes his hand and Yung reminisces sarcastically about how he was once taught a lesson by Ah Chai.
Yung's sister, Wai Chui (Pauline Chan) picks up their father, who is going to visit with his stepson Kwok (Andy Lau) in Malacca. Kwok is now married to a local woman and has adopted many children. His father tells Kwok that Ah Chai might be in danger of being killed by Yung. 
Ah Chai meets with Chu Lo Tai (Ko Chun Hsiung), his previous rival, now his business partner. Ah Chai warns Chu Lo Tai that perhaps Yung is becoming too powerful. Chu Lo Tai acknowledges this threat and plots to have Yung assassinated. Chu Lo Tai and his gang meet for dinner and Chu confronts Yung angrily after another one of Yung's rude outbursts. Two of Chu's men draw their guns at Yung. Yung reaches for an oyster shell. At that signal, most of Chu Lo Tai's gang turn against him and Yung stabs Chu Lo Tai to death with a broken bottle. Yung now leads Chu's gang.
Ah Chai's wife Po Yee (Carina Lau) goes to the mall with her son where she runs into Yung and his men. Yung flirts with Po Yee, who refuses his advances. He then orders his men to attack Number 6 (Shing Fu-On) and Chuan (Ng Hong-Ning), who valiantly fight against 8 men and lose. 
Ah Chai arranges to have a meeting with Yung at a club. The meeting goes badly for Chai as Yung takes opportunities to insult him, while he realizes their mutual police ally is not totally on his side against Yung. Yung provokes Ah Chai into splashing water into his face. 
Later that evening, Ah Chai and his two lieutenants, Number 6 and Big Eye (Lin Chung) discuss what to do about Yung. They both note the need to take action and strike first. Ah Chai says that he will call a meeting with the other remaining gangs to wipe Yung out. Ah Chai is then interrupted and told that his son is ill and that he will need to take him to the hospital. His two lieutenants are disappointed that their boss has grown soft. 
Yung is then unexpectedly visited by Kwok who begs for Yung not to kill Ah Chai. Yung humiliates his step brother by forcing him to beg for forgiveness and serving him tea on one knee. Yung then stops the embarrassment and hugs Kwok, telling him that he will oblige as long as Ah Chai does not attempt anything first.
The following morning, Kwok is driven to the airport by his step sister Wai Chui and Kwok has Wai Chui swear to secrecy that no one knows that he has come to talk to Yung. She promises to. Kwok then jokes that Wai Chui is now almost 30 and still works for Ah Chai and that she should settle down. Wai Chui admits that she loves Ah Chai too much and cannot bear to leave his side. Kwok jokingly promises to keep that a secret but says that if she doesn't move on after 2 years that he's going to tell Ah Chai about it.
The scene switches back to Number 6 as he decides to take matters into his own hands. Big Eye tells him to be careful, while Number 6 notes that a fortune teller told him that he would live past 70. Number 6 puts on a bulletproof vest and proceeds with his plot to assassinate Yung. That afternoon, Number 6 masquerades as a window washer at an office building. He hangs outside an office where Yung is practicing putting golf balls. Yung pretends to ignore him. Yung's men then come into the room with flowers, and suddenly draw guns and shoot Number 6 many times. Number 6 is badly wounded but then bursts through the window and almost kills Yung before his men shoot Number 6 multiple times in the neck and face. Yung taunts the dead Number 6 and is enraged. He is hell bent on killing Ah Chai and disregards his step brother's request.
Ah Chai receives the news that Number 6 is dead. He tells Wai Chui that it was due to Big Eye's betrayal, and he can hardly trust anyone besides her. Chai and Big Eye get in the car to go to the meeting with other gang leaders. The driver, Chuan, purposely causes a flat tire and they pull over. Ah Chai questions Big Eye about how Yung's men knew about Number 6's assassination plot. He says that Big Eye must've betrayed Number 6 to Yung since Number 6 is very tight lipped and he would only tell Ah Chai or Big Eye of his plans. Big Eye admits to his betrayal and Ah Chai shoots him in the arm. Big Eye explains that Ah Chai growing soft over the years has doomed them all and he was only trying to save himself from the same fate. Ah Chai realizes Big Eye is right and spares him. Big Eye attempts to get out of the car and is killed by the driver Chuan with a knife. Chai looks despondently at Big Eye sprawled against the window as he is sad to see his old friend die, but then is dismayed to realize, as Big Eye's body slumps down against the car, that Big Eye had pulled a gun and wanted to kill him even after Chai forgave Big Eye.
Ah Chai goes to his meeting, but he realizes they've been betrayed, their plans having been tampered with the Big Eye. The other gangsters have all brought illegal weapons and now they hear police sirens coming to raid them. They are completely trapped and one of fellow gang leaders attempts to run to the car to get Ah Chai out of there. The gang leader is wounded badly and Ah Chai gathers all their weapons. He walks out to surrender to the police, claiming all the guns are his, and demand the police to get an ambulance there for the wounded. Ah Chai is driven away in police custody. Yung drives by the police car and taunts Ah Chai that he no longer has any allies on either side of the law. 
Ah Chai's wife Po Yee comes to the police station to visit Ah Chai. Yung takes this opportunity and meets with her in one of the rooms. He then attempts to force himself onto her until she bites his lip and he backs off. He tells her that she was his woman and that he gave her to Ah Chai.
After Ah Chai gets out of custody, he arranges a meeting with his longtime police ally to find out how his meeting got busted. Wai Chui is suspicious and lurks about outside the window with a gun. The police ally notes that Ah Chai is a nobody now and that everybody wants to bring Ah Chai down. They argue, with Chai threatening to testify against the corrupt policeman in court. He handcuffs himself to the wall and uses a blade to cut himself. Having staged what looks like an attack, he then shoots Ah Chai. Wai Chui shoots the police ally and then jumps in to check on Ah Chai. The police ally shoots Wai Chui in the back of the head and kills her. Ah Chai, in a fit of rage, gets up and shoots the police ally to death, not before taking 2 more bullets himself. He then escapes out the window to a boat with the help of Chuan as the police coming pouring in to shoot at Ah Chai.
Ah Chai and his family escape to Malacca and visit Kwok. They reminisce about the past and he tells Kwok about Yung's actions. Ah Chai and Kwok seem content in Malacca until Yung decides he needs to finish the job. He sends assassins to Malacca to leave a bomb in the house. Ah Chai and Kwok are barbecuing away from the house. Kwok and Yung's father is lured away from the house to the airport. A bomb kills everyone inside, including Kwok's wife, his adopted children, and Ah Chai's family. Chai and Kwok are filled with anguish and swear revenge on Yung.
Yung is then called into the police station in regards to the killings. Inspector Cheung (Danny Lee) tells Yung that he is the number one target of the police. He then receives a phone call from Chai and dismisses Yung. Ah Chai apologizes for the way that he treated Inspector Cheung in the past, having arranged for his demotion to a faraway post. He praises Cheung for his principles and notes that Yung's lawyers will protect him too well from the justice system. Chai says he has returned to Hong Kong to destroy Yung, intending to go down together with him. He asks Cheung to keep the police out of the way and to take his body away when he's done. Inspector Cheung agrees.
Meanwhile, Yung is celebrating now that he rules supreme. He has one of his lackeys keep tabs on his father in the event that Ah Chai and Kwok attempt revenge. His lackey reports that Yung's father has gone crazy, crying endlessly at his daughter's grave, sitting and mumbling for hours at the docks and has no contact with his step son, Kwok. Yung is anxious and asks whether his father has been seen cohorting with Ah Chai and Kwok. The lackey does not know. The father shows up and confronts Yung about whether he killed Ah Chai and Kwok's family in Malacca. Yung denies it and then lies to him that someone else did it. Another lackey then reports that Yung's father was seen in the same area as Ah Chai and Kwok. Yung is enraged that his father has openly betrayed him and admits to the killings. His father attacks him and Yung tells his lackeys to beat his father. The lackeys hesitate but do so and throw him out of the house. 
Yung's father gets in a waiting taxi. A lackey approaches the back of the car and is shot in the face. Ah Chai and Kwok jump out of the car and kill everybody in the vicinity. Chuan gets out and grabs a large of bag of heavy weaponry. They reach the mansion and it is quiet. Chuan goes out to inspect the pool area and is shot to death. A number of men show up and Ah Chai and Kwok are completely surrounded. They quickly pull out their heavy weaponry and blow up the mansion with grenades and rockets. They rush into the house and kill many of Yung's men. At one point, Ah Chai is wounded by Yung's right hand man and they become trapped in the fire at the house. Yung kills his right hand man for suggesting the idea of retreating. Yung has gone completely mad. He wounds Ah Chai more and has a gun pointed at his face. Kwok charges out and knocks Yung over. Yung attempts to shoot Ah Chai and Kwok takes the bullets and is seriously wounded. Again, Yung has Ah Chai at gunpoint and suddenly Yung's father appears and shoots Yung. Yung shoots his father down. Ah Chai gets up and beats up Yung to the point where Yung is now hanging onto the edge. Ah Chai taunts Yung and throws Yung into the fire below. Yung blows up due to all the ammunition he had strapped onto his vest. Ah Chai falls down in exhaustion and Inspector Cheung shows up to save them. Chai tells Cheung that he alone killed all those people, and that Kwok and Kwok's father are innocent onlookers. Cheung says he will try to help Kwok at trial. Ah Chai and Kwok are carried out on stretchers as the movie ends.

USS Resolute (SP-3003)

"Note: This ship should not be confused with the third USS "Resolute" (SP-1309) or fourth USS "Resolute" (SP-3218), which were in commission at the same time."
The fifth USS "Resolute" (SP-3003), also referred to by the designation ID-3003, was a motorboat that entered service in the United States Navy as a ship's tender in 1918.
"Resolute" was built as a private motorboat during 1913 at the yard of Robert Jacob at City Island, New York. The U.S. Navy acquired her on 21 January 1918 from her owner, George A. Cormack of New York City, for use during World War I, placing her in service as USS "Resolute", designated either SP-3003 or ID-3003, the difference in reported designation occurring perhaps because the U.S. Navy sometimes used the "SP" and "Id. No." designations interchangeably for civilian vessels procured for World War I service.
"Resolute" served her entire U.S. Navy career as a ship's tender for the transport USS "Mount Vernon" (ID-4508), and was carried aboard "Mount Vernon" for use at "Mount Vernon"s various ports of call.
Records of "Resolute"s career otherwise are lacking. "Mount Vernon" was decommissioned in September 1919, and it is likely that "Resolute" was disposed of, perhaps by sale, around that time.

TaSang Dam

The TaSang Dam (Tar-hsan) is a planned multi-purpose dam on the Salween River in the Shan State, Burma. The TaSang dam’s location will be northeast of Rangoon and west of Mongtong. The TaSang Dam will be the first dam on the Salween River and will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Burma and the tallest dam in Southeast Asia if completed. The TaSang will cost more than $6 billion USD and is planned for completion in 2022. The groundbreaking ceremony was in March 2007, but construction has been stalled, and there has been little activity at the dam site as of 2008.
Substantial domestic and international controversy surrounds the TaSang Dam project. The TaSang dam is one of five dams the Burmese Government plans to build on the Salween River.
Background.
Since the late 1990s, the Burmese Government proposed to build the TaSang dam but was unable to implement the construction plan until this decade because of civil unrest. Nippon Koei, a Japanese company conducted studies for the dam in 1981 and subsequent studies were done in 2002. Thailand’s MDX Group agreed in 2002 to develop the project. Thailand is the main investor in the dam project and the trade of the TaSang’s electricity is expected to help relations between Thailand and Burma. 85% of the hydro-electricity produced is expected to be transmitted to Thailand.
Design.
The TaSang concrete-faced rockfill dam is designed to be 228 meters tall and house a hydro-power station with a 7,110 MW capacity to produce 35,446 GWh annually. TaSang’s reservoir will cut the majority of Shan State in half, preluding serious social and environmental problems.
Construction.
Construction on the dam is being led by the Thai MDX Group along with the China Gezhouba Group Co., Sinohydro Corporation, China Southern Power Grid Company, China Three Gorges Project Corporation and the British Malcolm Dunstan & Associates. The groundbreaking ceremony for the dam was in March 2007, but since the ceremony, actual construction of the dam has been stalled, and there has been little activity at the dam-site.
Social Impact.
Since 1996, as many as 300,000 villagers, mostly Shan people have been displaced to make room for the TaSang Dam’s reservoir. Thousands more relocations are expected as construction progresses. The dam’s reservoir will dissect Shan State in half –almost to the Chinese border – and will negatively impact the local communities and ecosystems. Burma’s Junta is responsible for the relocations and there have reports of serious human rights violations including executions.

Lambert Daneau

Lambert Daneau (c. 1535 – c. 1590) was a French jurist and Calvinist theologian.
Life.
He was born at Beaugency-sur-Loire, and educated at Orléans. He studied Greek under Adrianus Turnebus, and then law in Orléans from 1553. He moved to Bourges in 1559; he was particularly influenced by François Hotman, and by Anne du Bourg, who was executed in that year for heresy.
He went to Geneva first in 1560, and then became a pastor in Gien. After eight fruitful further years in Geneva from 1572, he made a reputation as preacher and theological writer. He left for a position in the University of Leiden. He taught also in Ghent, Orthez, Lescar, and Castres.
Views.
He wrote a book on witchcraft, "Dialogus de veneficiis" (1564). His views on the topic of hunting witches caused trouble for him in Leiden. It was translated, in its 1574 edition, into English by Thomas Twyne as "A Dialogue of Witches" (1575).
His "Physica christiana" (1576) argued for a Scriptural basis for physics. It was translated by Twyne as "The Wonderfull Workmanship of the World" (1578).

Liluah

Liluah(also spelled Lillooah) is a town near Bally municipality in Howrah district, West Bengal, India. It has a railway junction, which is the first station after Howrah station under the Eastern Railway (India). and is an educational hub with a number of schools dotting the town.
Geography.
It is located at at an elevation of 13 m from MSL.
Location.
Liluah is 2 km north of Kolkata and 5 km north of Howrah.
Transportation.
Air.
Nearest airport is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport at Kolkata.
Road.
Liluah is well connected with round the clock buses and auto-rickshaws.
Railway.
Liluah railway station is part of the Kolkata Suburban Railway. It also has a Railway Carriage and Wagons Workshop: one of the three in the Eastern Railways. The other two being at Kanchrapara and Jamalpur. The Liluah Railway station has 5 platforms with 3 mainly being used for the Howrah-Bardhaman Main Line and the other two for the Howrah-Bardhaman Chord Line. The Belur Math Line branches off between Liluah and Belur, There is also a line connecting Liluah and Andul in the South Eastern Railways. It is used by goods trains.
Its takes 8 minutes to travel from Howrah to Liluah (a distance of 5 km) by a suburban local train.cost of ticket is Rs.5 one-way. But the same journey takes 15 minutes when going from Liluah To Howrah due to bulk railway traffic coming in and out of the Howrah station which is the biggest railway junction in India.
Governance.
Most parts of Liluah fall within the Howrah Municipal Corporation while the remaining parts come under the Bally Municipality.
The Town.
The railway line divides Liluah into 2 parts.Since 2008 both these parts were joined by a flyover constructed over the Liluah railway station.
History.
Liluah, or Lillooah as it was then written, was the depot of the former East Indian Railway . The case of unfortunate shipwreck bringing EIR's first loco and mis-despatch of ship carrying EIR's first coaches for inauguration of first railroad in Eastern India led the E.I.R. authorities to consider manufacture of rolling stock in India.(read the history of ER).
Initially EIR had set up in 1853 a Locomotive and Carriage Workshop near the Howrah Station (somewhere near the salt gola) with the idea of maintenance of assets after inauguration in 1854 and was later shifted to its present site in the year 1900 as the site did not meet the requirement in terms of magnitude of work. The Locomotive portion was shifted to a new and much bigger workshop at Jamalpur in 1862 and the Howrah works was upgraded to a Carriage and Wagon Workshop in 1863. As the Howrah location was found unsuitable for further expansion, the facility was finally shifted to its present site. The Liluah Carriage and Wagon Workshop is located in the suburbs of Howrah about 7 km. from Howrah. It is the largest combined Carriage & Wagon Workshop of Indian Railways.
The prime responsibility of this workshop was to manufacture rolling stock. This excluded locomotives . Only Carriages and Wagons were initially manufactured. During the last century Liluah had efficiently discharged the duties. Manufacturing of coaches were done till 1972 and Liluah has 3000 coaches to its credit. Wagon manufacturing was however discontinued in the post independence era and Coach manufacturing was also stopped when sufficient infrastructure was built throughout the country to cater for the ever-growing demand.
Another interesting fact which is less known is that apart from rolling stock manufacture Liluah made immense contribution to the war machinery of Allied Forces during the Second World War. Apart from rolling stock required for transport of military equipment Liluah also produced hundreds of Ambulances, Water Cars, tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries. Ammunitions were also produced for the British Army, the Indian Army and Royal Air force. Minor items like tent pegs etc. were also in thousands.All the above illustrates the technical expertise and skill developed within the work shop. An essay published in 1945 in East Indian Railway Magazine by D.K.Whitworth describes how great a job was done by railwaymen at Liluah between 1938 and 1942.
Like other leading Indian railways, the EIR provided a full regiment for the Railway Units of the Auxiliary Force (India). Liluah, or Lillooah as it was written then, was the home of the 1st Bn., the East Indian Railway Regiment.
Recreation.
The recently opened RD mall houses Inox Multiplex, Domino's Pizza Parlour, Cafe Coffee Day, Subway, a gaming arena, and Big Bazaar among many other retail stores.
Nearby.
Belur_Math is 2 km north-east of Liluah Railway Station.

The Allison T38 (company Model 501) was an early large turboprop engine developed by Allison Engine Company during the late 1940s. The T38 became the basis for the very successful family of Allison T56 turboprop engine.
Design and development.
The T38 started life with a 19-stage axial compressor, eight can type combustion chambers, a 4-stage turbine driving the compressor and the extension shaft to the reduction gearbox.
Initially rated at the T38 first ran in 1947 and flew in the nose of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress test-bed on 19 April 1949, rated at . Problems with gearbox vibration and combustion were dealt with during the test programme and were mirrored by problems in the T40 programme. The engines fitted to the Convair CV-240-21 Turboliner were rated to 2,750shp.
Although the only aircraft slated to receive the T38 as a production engine, the Convair T-29E, was cancelled, the T38 did power a converted Convair CV-240 (the CV-240-21 Turboliner, a project that would be abandoned due to engine problems), and was fitted in the nose of the McDonnell XF-88B to drive experimental supersonic propellers. Further development of the T38 provided the power sections for the Allison T40 as well as forming the basis for the Allison T56/Model 501 and the projected Allison T39.

Compatible system of ℓ-adic representations

In number theory, a compatible system of ℓ-adic representations is an abstraction of certain important families of ℓ-adic Galois representations, indexed by prime numbers ℓ, that have compatibility properties for almost all ℓ. Prototypical examples include the cyclotomic character and the Tate module of an abelian variety. A slightly more restrictive notion is that of a "strictly" compatible system of ℓ-adic representations which offers more control on the compatibility properties. More recently, some authors have started requiring more compatibility related to "p"-adic Hodge theory. Compatible systems of ℓ-adic representations are a fundamental concept in contemporary algebraic number theory.

Zolochiv Castle

Zolochiv Castle was a residence of the Sobieski noble family on a hill at the confluence of two small rivers in the south-eastern part of Zolochiv, Galicia (now part of Ukraine's Lviv Oblast). 
The rectangular fort was built in 1634-36 by Jakub Sobieski using the labor of enslaved Crimean Tatars. The Sobieski castle comprised solid walls in a then current Dutch style, with four pentagonal towers at each corner, and the so-called "grand palace". The Chinese Palace, a diminutive mauve-colored rotunda flanked by one-storey wings, was added later in the century as Jan III's gift to his French-born wife, Marysieńka.
In 1672, the castle was taken after a 6-days siege by the Turks under Kapudan Pasa.
Three years later, it survived a new siege by the Ottoman army. After Jakub Ludwik Sobieski's death in 1737, the castle passed to the Radziwill princely family and then (in 1801) to Count Łukasz Komarnicki whose heirs sold it to the Austrian crown in 1834.
In the 19th century, the castle was adapted for use as a hospital and barracks. It was turned into a prison in 1872 and continued in use after the September Campaign. There's a chapel commemorating the victims of the NKVD on the grounds of the castle.
Since 1985 the complex has been supervised by the Lviv Art Gallery and under restoration. Recently it began to open its grounds for visitors. Exhibits include more than 25 European coats of arms, dinosaur bone chandeliers, and a replica of a typical royal crown from the 13th century, that could be similar to that of Daniel of Galicia.

Jacob Moritz Blumberg

Jacob Moritz Blumberg (27 June 1873–1955) was a German Jewish surgeon and gynaecologist and inventor and namesake of the Blumberg sign.
Life and work.
Blumberg was born in the Province of Posen and educated at the University of Breslau (Wrocław) where he received his doctorate in 1896. He went on to complete further training with Polish surgeon Jan Mikulicz-Radecki at the surgical clinic in Breslau, under German physician Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser, the discoverer of "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", at the dermatological clinic, and under German physician Albert Fränkel at the women's clinic. He also trained with Paul Zweifel at the women's clinic in Leipzig.
Blumberg began his professional career in Berlin where he specialised in gynaecology and surgery. Early in his career he invented the Blumberg sign to indicate peritonitis. Investigating methods of sterilisation of the surgeon's hands resulted in his invention of a type of rubber glove that was widely adopted by his medical colleagues. World War I required him to fight with the German army and he successfully brought a typhus epidemic in a Prisoner of War camp under control by delousing 10.000 Russian POWs in a few days. He was awarded the Iron Cross and received decorations from several other countries.
After the war, Blumberg resumed his surgical practice and organised many prenatal care clinics in Berlin, one of which was the Beulah Clinic which Blumberg personally directed. He also began working in the new fields of radiology and radium therapy and founded an X-ray and radium institute in Berlin. With the rise of the Nazi Party he left Germany
and moved to Belsize Park, London, England where he successfully continued his medical work and where his portrait was painted by the renowned artist Arthur Pan. In 1935 he had obtained a quantity of radium from the Curie Institute, founded by Marie Curie in Paris, to help set up his elder son Ernst Friedrich Blumberg's practice in London. This work resulted in Ernst writing the treatise "Health through radium therapy" in 1950.
Blumberg married Charlotte Haas and they had two sons. The elder son Ernst Friedrich Blumberg M.D. (1908–1973) was also a notable surgeon, gynaecologist and radium therapist who married the Canadian artist Marion Harding in 1960, London, England.

<doc id="21641546" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21641546" title="Cyclone Fanele">
Cyclone Fanele

Cyclone Fanele was the first cyclone of tropical cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior. It formed on January 18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately turned toward the southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January 23.
The cyclone caused heavy damage near where it moved ashore and along its path, resulting in ten deaths. Fanele struck Madagascar just two days after Tropical Storm Eric brushed the northeastern portion of the country. The two storms affected over 50,000 people, of which at least 4,000 were left homeless. Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequentially relief efforts were hindered.
Meteorological history.
For several days in the middle of January 2009, a very weak low-level circulation persisted in the Mozambique Channel, accompanied by intermittent and disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. By January 17, an area of convection persisted about west-southwest of Antananarivo, Madagascar. Early on January 18; the circulation rapidly consolidated and organized while the thunderstorms developed into tightly-curved rainbands. Environmental conditions favored further development; an anticyclone formed over the disturbance, an approaching trough provided favorable outflow, and the system benefited from both light wind shear and warm water temperatures. At 0600 UTC on the 18th, the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 07, noting its intensification as it drifted southwestward.
Six hours after being declared a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, and the agency predicted the system would eventually reach peak winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected to follow that of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric. Late on January 18, the system briefly became disorganized, only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January 19; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it "Fanele". Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents. Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature, and late on January 19 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening under very favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150 km/h (95 mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph).
Early on January 20, Cyclone Fanele began a northeast motion, tracking along the eastern periphery of a ridge located over Mozambique. Later it turned southeastward under the influence of another ridge further to the east. The thunderstorms organized further around the eye, and at 1200 UTC on January 20 the MFR estimated Fanele attained peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) about west-northwest of Morondava along the Madagascar coast. At the same time, its atmospheric pressure was estimated at 927 hPa (mbar), and peak wind gusts were estimated at 261 km/h (162 mph). The JTWC also assessed peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). As it approached the coast, the cyclone became slightly less organized, with weaker convection and a less distinct eye; the weakening was due to an eyewall replacement cycle. At around 0215 UTC on January 21, Fanele made landfall on the western Madagascar coastline, to the southwest of Morondava.
Cyclone Fanele weakened quickly over land; within four hours of moving ashore, its winds decreased to 150 km/h (95 mph), and its wind field expanded. The eye feature dissipated as the system weakened to tropical storm status, and increased wind shear contributed to further weakening. By January 22, the poorly defined circulation moved over open waters, by which time its winds weakened to about 45 km/h (30 mph). Upon reaching the ocean, convection began to reform near the circulation, and Fanele re-attained tropical storm status. Cooler waters caused convection diminish near the center, which began the process of extratropical transition. Late on January 22, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm. By January 23, Fanele completed the transition into an extratropical storm as it accelerated toward the south-southeast. It persisted as a distinct tropical cyclone until later that day.
Impact.
Though the cyclone developed quickly, authorities were prepared for the storm; earlier in the year, Madagascar's National Office for Natural Disasters Preparedness implemented a plan for localized storm warning. Officials deployed warnings via radio to citizens in the path of Fanele, as well as to fishermen who were told to avoid leaving port.
Cyclone Fanele made landfall on western Madagascar in Menabe Region, where it destroyed many buildings, flooded large areas, and left thousands of people isolated. In the city of Morondava near the landfall location, the cyclone flooded 80% of buildings and damaged about half of the houses, leaving 3,000 people homeless. Throughout the region, the winds damaged 158 classrooms attended by 9,000 children. Further inland, the cyclone damaged bridges and roads, leaving some areas isolated. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy rainfall in the northwest portion of the country, resulting in flooding that left about 250 people homeless in Sofia Region. The passages of Cyclones Eric and Fanele affected 54,802 people, leaving 4,102 without shelter. At least 28,000 people were affected directly by Fanele, and the cyclone killed a total of ten people. The cyclone disrupted work to rebuild areas that were affected by Cyclone Ivan in February 2008.
Cyclone Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87 metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13 MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January 25 with various supplies. In the days after the storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.

History.
In March 2001, Citrix Systems agreed to purchase Sequoia Software for $185 million. The following year, former Sequoia CEO, Mark Wesker, along with other ex-Sequoia employees created Artifact Software. Artifact’s first product, CodeJack was a code sharing gateway for development teams to collaborate around their software artifacts and projects. CodeJack was eventually abandoned. In 2004, Artifact Software began developing its flagship product, Lighthouse, aided in part by a $5 million Series A financing shortly thereafter in July 2005. The first version of Lighthouse was launched in February 2007 with both a free and for fee version. 
On September 21, 2009 Artifact Software changed both its company name and product name to workspace.com to better align its name with its product offering.
Development.
Workspace.com is a project management tool offered as a service. It does not enforce any particular software development methodology. Unlike many other similar tools, it does not integrate into version control systems or integrated development environments; instead it acts as standalone software.

He was accompanied by his sons, Ghazi Khan, Fatih Khan, and Ismail Khan.
This move is seen as the establishment of Baloch presence in the Punjab, as Dodai was followed by fellow Baloch mercenaries. Shah Hussain encouraged them by offering them lands extending from Kor Karor to Dhankot (present-day Muzaffargarh).

2008–14 Irish financial crisis

The 2008–14 Irish financial crisis, stemming from the financial crisis of 2007–08, is a major political and financial crisis in the Republic of Ireland, considered partially responsible for the country's fall into recession for the first time since the 1980s.
The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) general index reached a peak of 10,000 points briefly in April 2007 and fell to 1,987 points, a 14-year low, by 24 February 2009 (the last time it stood under the 2,000 level was the middle of 1995). In September 2008, the Irish government—comprising a coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party—officially acknowledged that the country had entered recession, with a severe rise in unemployment occurring in the following months. Ireland was the first state in the eurozone to enter recession, as declared by the Central Statistics Office. The numbers of people living on unemployment benefits rose to 326,000 in January 2009—the highest monthly level since records began in 1967—and the unemployment rate rose from 6.5% in July 2008 to 14.8% by July 2012. The weakening conditions drew 100,000 protesters onto the streets of Dublin on 21 February 2009, amid further talk of protests and industrial action. With the banks "guaranteed", and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) established on the evening of 21 November 2010, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed on live television that the EU/ECB/IMF troika would be involving itself in Ireland's financial affairs.
Amid the crisis, which coincides with a series of banking scandals, support for the ruling Fianna Fáil party crumbled; it fell to third place in one opinion poll conducted by "The Irish Times"—an unprecedented event in the nation's history—placing behind Fine Gael and the Labour Party, the latter rising above Fianna Fáil for the first time. On 22 November, the Greens—junior members of the ruling coalition—called for an election the following year. The 2011 general election replaced the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition with the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition. This coalition continues with the same austerity policies of the previous coalition as the country's larger parties favour a similar agenda.
Official statistics show a drop in most crimes coinciding with the economic downturn. Burglaries have, however, risen by approximately 10% and prostitution has more than doubled since 2007.
Background and causes.
The economy of the Republic of Ireland expanded rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1994–2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry). This led to an expansion of credit and a property bubble which petered out in 2007. Irish banks, already over-exposed to the Irish property market, came under severe pressure in September 2008 due to the global financial crisis of 2007–2010.
Irish banks' foreign borrowings rose from €15bn to €110bn in 2004-08. Much of this was borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects that would not be sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result was a classic asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the Irish bank guarantee the banks were said to be illiquid (but not insolvent) by €4bn, which turned out to be a huge underestimate.
Impact.
The economy and government finances began to show signs of impending recession by the end of 2007 when tax revenues fell short of the 2007 annual budget forecast by €2.3 billion (5%), with stamp duties and income tax both falling short by €0.8 billion (19% and 5%) resulting in the 2007 general government budget surplus of €2.3 billion (1.2% of GDP) being wiped out. An imminent recession became clear by mid-2008. Subsequently, government deficits increased, many businesses closed and unemployment increased. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) fell and many immigrant workers left.
Anglo Irish Bank.
Anglo Irish Bank was exposed to the Irish property bubble. A hidden loans controversy in December 2008 led to a further drop in its share price. The ISEQ dropped to a 14-year low on 24 September 2009, probably triggered by the unexpected resignation of former Anglo Irish Bank director Anne Heraty from the board of the Irish Stock Exchange the night before.
Growth and unemployment.
The Irish economy entered severe recession in 2008. 
Ireland entered into an economic depression in 2009. The Economic and Social Research Institute predicted an economic contraction of 14% by 2010. In the first quarter in 2009, GDP was down 8.5% from the same quarter the previous year, and GNP down 12%. Unemployment is up 8.75% to 11.4%. The economy exited recession in the third quarter of 2009, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the quarter, but GNP continued to contract, by 1.4%. The economy grew by 1.9% in Q1 and by 1.6% in Q2 of 2011 but contracted by 1.9% in Q3.
The unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% as of February 2012.
Property market.
Due to the ending of the bubble, the residential and commercial property markets went into a severe slump with both sales and property values collapsing.
Developers such as Liam Carroll began to fall behind on their loan repayments. Due to the financial crisis, banks such as ACC pushed for their revenue recovery and requested liquidation of the development firms.
Emigration.
The Central Statistics Office estimated that 34,500 people left the country from April 2009 – 2010, the largest net emigration since 1989. However, only 27,700 of these are Irish nationals, an increase of 12,400 since 2006. It's also notable that more people went somewhere other than the UK, EU or US, traditional destinations for Irish emigrants, than any other destination.
2008: Cowen administration, bank guarantee, rise of FEE, pensioners revolt.
Following the May 2008 appointment of Brian Cowen as Taoiseach, the ruling Fianna Fáil party had been polling close to their 41% levels of the 2007 election but the party began to fall in the polls from September 2008. Their support fell to third place for the first time ever behind both leading opposition parties in a national opinion poll published in "The Irish Times" on 13 February 2009, polling only 22%. A 27 February poll, indicated that only 10% of voters were satisfied with the Government's performance, that over 50% would like an immediate general election. They gained about 24% of the vote in the June 2009 local elections and continued to languish as the crisis intensified during the remainder of the year, reaching a new low of 17% support in September 2009. During the 2009/2010 period opposition calls for an early election intensified and some of their own TDs resigned from the party supporting the calls and reducing the Government majority to single digits. The Government was urged by the courts to hold a long-delayed Donegal South by-election. By December 2010, following the IMF intervention, their support reached a further record low of 13% and their coalition partners, the Green Party, announced that they would withdraw support from Government in January 2011 once the 2011 budget had been passed. The Government announced that an election would take place in Spring 2011 but the intended date had to be brought forward to 25 February 2011 following a widely criticised cabinet reshuffle. Taoiseach Cowen was replaced as party leader by Micheál Martin. At the election, Fianna Fáil received 17% of the vote and their seats collapsed from 71 outgoing to a record low of 20. The Fine Gael and Labour opposition secured record seat gains but no overall majority and formed a coalition government.
Government emergency budget of October 2008.
Ireland officially declared it was in a recession in September 2008. Before this declaration, the Irish government announced, on 3 September 2008, that it would bring forward the 2009 government budget from its usual December date to 14 October 2008. In a statement, the government claimed that this was largely due to a decrease in the global economy. The budget, labelled "the toughest in many years", included a number of controversial measures such as a proposed income levy which was eventually restructured, and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland.
An unexpected public outcry was invoked over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the threatened return of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on the Irish parliament at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin. Some of the pensioners were even seen to cheer on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin. Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops who were assured by O'Keeffe that religious instruction would be unaffected by the budget changes.
Rebellion within the ranks of the ruling coalition government led to a number of defections of disenchanted coalition members. County Wicklow TD, Joe Behan resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes after suggesting that past taoisigh Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass "would be turning in their graves at the decisions made in the past week". Independent Deputy Finian McGrath then threatened to withdraw his support for the government unless the plan to remove the overs 70s automatic right to a medical card was withdrawn completely. Taoiseach Brian Cowen postponed a planned trip to China, sending Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe ahead to lead the delegation. Behan, alongside McGrath and former government minister Jim McDaid, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government's majority of twelve by one quarter.
A supplementary budget was delivered in April 2009 to address a fiscal shortfall of over €4.5 billion.
Bank guarantee.
On 29 September 2008 the government issued an unlimited bank guarantee in favour of 6 banks that was to cost much more than the government estimated. It was approved at the time by the European Commission. This was to result in the EU-IMF intervention in late 2010 (see below).
Comment by the American embassy.
Despite the bank guarantee in September, by December 2008 the American ambassador was reporting to Washington that no clear plan was in place, after an interview with John McCarthy of the Irish Department of Finance and two other officials. McCarthy was quoted as saying that "forecasting anything in the current uncertain environment is almost impossible" and that the government could "only react given the fast pace of the downturn”. The interview was published in 2011 as a part of the wikileaks disclosures.
2009: NAMA, strikes and industrial unrest.
Sit-ins and strikes.
On 5 January 2009, Waterford Wedgwood entered receivership. On 30 January, workers at the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry were told they would be losing their jobs. A statement issued by the receiver, Deloitte's David Carson, confirmed that, of the 670 employees, 480 of them would be laid off. The workers responded angrily to this unexpected decision and at least 100 of them began an unofficial sit-in in the visitors' gallery at the factory that night. They insisted they would refuse to leave until they had met with Carson. Following the revelations, there was a minor scuffle during which the main door to the visitors' centre was damaged. Local Sinn Féin Councillor Joe Kelly was amongst those who occupied the visitors' gallery. A meeting held the following day did little to resolve the conflict, with the sit-in continuing for almost two months until 22 March.
On 18 February 2009, 13,000 civil servants voted for industrial action over a proposed pension levy. They effected this action on 26 February.
Days earlier, as many as 120,000 people, had protested on the streets of Dublin on 21 February. This was followed by a further march through the capital by gardaí on 25 February and a lunch-time protest by 10,000 civil servants on 19 March 2009. This was followed by two separate taxi drivers' protests in Dublin on 20 March 2009.
Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said at the time that a national strike would serve the country no good.
National Asset Management Agency.
In April 2009, the government proposed a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to take over large loans from the banks, enabling them to return to normal liquidity to assist in the economic recovery. NAMA's first appraisal was in September 2009, fortuitously timed just before the issue of the second one-year bank guarantee.
Increasing debt spiral.
The costs of the bank rescues, NAMA and government deficits over the period look set to push Irish National Debt up to a ratio of 125% of GDP by 2015.
However, there have been a number of misleading estimates of debt statistics relating to the Irish financial crisis. Ireland, like Luxembourg, is home to a disproportionately large number of international financial services providers. Many statistical calculations include the debts of all banks located in Ireland without separating foreign owned banks from Irish banks. The liabilities of the Irish banks represent a figure equivalent to approximately 309% of GDP, the third highest in the EU.
Croke Park Agreement.
The Irish Government and Irish Public Sector unions, including IMPACT, negotiated the Croke Park Agreement which provided for increased productivity, flexibility and savings from the public sector in exchange for no further pay cuts, and no lay offs.
2010: Bank bail-outs, student protests, March for a Better Way.
EU-IMF intervention.
In April 2010, following a marked increase in Irish 2-year bond yields, Ireland's NTMA state debt agency said that it had "no major refinancing obligations" in 2010. Its requirement for in 2010 was matched by a cash balance, and it remarked: "We're very comfortably circumstanced". On 18 May the NTMA tested the market and sold a €1.5 billion issue that was three times oversubscribed. By September 2010 the banks could not raise finance and the bank guarantee was renewed for a third year. This had a negative impact on Irish government bonds, government help for the banks rose to 32% of GDP, and so the government started negotiations with the ECB and the IMF.
On the evening of 21 November 2010, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a request which was welcomed by the European Central Bank and EU finance ministers. The request was approved in principle by the finance ministers of the eurozone countries in a telephone conference call. Details of the financial arrangement were not immediately agreed upon, and remained to be determined in the following weeks, though the loan was believed to be in the region of €100 billion, of which approximately €8 billion was expected to be provided by the United Kingdom. the Green Party leader John Gormley signalled that his party would seek a General Election in January 2011, with the implicit threat being that they would pull out of Government; with the addition of a number of Independent government TDs declaring that they would not continue to support the Government and speculation mounting, Brian Cowen called a press conference in which he announced that the Government intended to introduce and pass that year's Budget, and its constituent parliamentary bills, before having the 2011 election.
However, on 23 November, rebel members of Brian Cowen's ruling Fianna Fáil party and opposition leaders sought no-confidence vote for the Government and dissolution of the Oireachtas before a crucial budget vote on 7 December 2010, that should open the way for adopting the rescue package.
On 28 November, the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the Irish state agreed to a €85 billion rescue deal made up of €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), €22.5 billion from the IMF, €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), €17.5 billion from the Irish sovereign National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.
Eurogroup President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the deal includes €10 billion for bank recapitalisation, €25 billion for banking contingencies and €50 billion for financing the budget.
Protests against austerity.
2010 saw several notable protests against austerity in Ireland.
2011: Government collapse, occupations, junk status, broken promises.
Collapse of the Cowen administration.
On 6 February 2011, it was revealed that Ireland had received a first €3.6 billion of the rescue package from the EFSF. This is a slightly higher amount than was previously expected mostly due to the better than expected auction of the EFSF bonds in January 2011. Later that month the coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party lost the 2011 general election and were replaced by a coalition made up of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.
In April 2011, despite all the measures taken, Moody's downgraded the Irish banks' debt to junk status. Debate continues on whether the new government will need a "second bailout". By August 2011 the largest of the six state-guaranteed banks, Bank of Ireland, had a market capitalisation of €2.86 billion, but loans to the six by the ECB and the Irish Central Bank were about €150 billion.
Student actions.
As the year went on students became increasingly concerned about the honesty and integrity of the pledge signed by Ruairi Quinn before the election that the Labour Party would oppose increased tuition fees.
On 16 November 2011, thousands of students, their parents and families, descended on Dublin from around the country and marched on Government Buildings amid concerns about the reintroduction of third-level fees. A small group also engaged in a sit-down protest outside the Fine Gael office on Dublin's Upper Mount Street.
At around 16:00 on 29 November 2011, three student union presidents (of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, University College Cork and IT Carlow) under the leadership of Union of Students in Ireland (USI) President Gary Redmond occupied a room at Department of Social Protection on Dublin's Store Street as part of a continued effort to have the Labour Party clarify its position on tuition fees. Police broke down the door of the room in which they were stationed and led them away. The students came armed with a chemical toilet and supplies of food that could have lasted them weeks. Ten student union presidents also attempted to occupy a room at the Department of Enterprise on Kildare Street for the same reasons.
Nine FEE students, also seeking clarification on the government's view on third-level fees, participated in a peaceful sit-down protest by occupying the constituency office of Fine Gael TD and former mayor Brian Walsh in Bohermore, Galway, around midday on 30 November 2011. They unfurled a banner on the roof with the message, "FREE EDUCATION NOTHING LESS". They were imprisoned by the police and released a short time later.
On 2 December 2011, eight students from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM), including the university's student union president Rob Munnelly, began occupying the Naas constituency office of Fine Gael TD Anthony Lawlor. They did so with sleeping bags, clothes, a chemical toilet and a week's supply of food and were supported by other students on Facebook and Twitter. During the occupation Munnelly debated with Lawlor live on Kildare TV, USI President Gary Redmond visited the revolting students and a banner with the slogan "SAVE THE GRANT" was erected at Lawlor's entrance.
Other protest actions.
The closure of the Accident & Emergency Department at Roscommon hospital led to continued protests by the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee.
Occupy Dame Street began on 8 October 2011, a Saturday afternoon.
On 26 November 2011, thousands of people marched against austerity in Dublin.
On 1 December 2011, Roscrea District Court solicitors staged a walkout over the courthouse's closure.
Hundreds of people from County Donegal converged on Buncrana on 3 December 2011 to protest against austerity and to tell the government that "Inishowen and Donegal says no to further cuts and austerity".
The Vita Cortex sit-in began in Cork on 16 December 2011.
There was also rebellion within the ranks of government. On 15 November 2011, Willie Penrose resigned as Minister of State for Housing and Planning due to his opposition to the Government's decision to close the army barracks in Mullingar. He also resigned the Labour parliamentary party whip. Tommy Broughan TD was expelled from the Labour Party on 1 December 2011 after voting to reject a government amendment to extend the bank guarantee for another year. Later that month, Patrick Nulty, another Labour TD, also voted against the government.
2012.
In January 2012, Taoiseach Enda Kenny denied Ireland would need a second bailout but admitted “very significant economic challenges” were ahead.
Industrial Action.
The Vita Cortex sit-in continued in Cork.
On 27 March, 2,104 jobs were lost as video games retail company Game closed 277 stores. Staff began a sit-in.
Occupy.
Occupy Dame Street continued in Dublin. In January, Occupy Cork occupied a building in the city, while Occupy Belfast took over the Bank of Ireland in the city.
Protests.
While attending a buffet at a Letterkenny hotel on 24 February 2012, Transport Minister Leo Varadkar was heckled and booed by local residents who repeatedly shouted "Shame on you" at him. On 25 February 2012, demonstrators protesting against the downgrading of schools in Bunbeg, County Donegal, marched on the office of their local TD, Fine Gael Junior Minister Dinny McGinley. There were also protests in County Mayo on the same day.
On 31 March, Ireland was reported by international media to be facing a popular revolt after government figures indicated less than half of the country's households had paid the new property tax by that day's deadline as thousands of people from across the country marched on the governing Fine Gael party's Ard Fheis at the Convention Centre Dublin. The previous evening, Justice minister Alan Shatter was involved in controversy after telling those who objected to the government's Household Charge to "get a life", remarks made on his way into the Fine Gael annual conference at the Convention Centre.
In April 2012, the ruling Labour Party held its centenary conference in the Bailey Allen Hall at NUI Galway. Gardaí used pepper spray to hold back anti-austerity demonstrators after they broke through a Garda barrier while protesting against government.
In October 2012, the ministerial car of Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore was subjected to eggings and kickings by protesters against cuts in Dublin.
Referendum of Fiscal Stability Treaty.
In 2012 the government sought to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The Attorney General advised that a referendum was required to ensure consistency with the constitution. Consequently the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed on 31 May with 60.3% in favour on a turnout of 50%. This enshrined the Fiscal Treaty into Article 29 of the constitution.
2013.
Liquidation of IBRC.
On the night of 6–7 February 2013, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) was dramatically liquidated after the Fine Gael/Labour coalition passed emergency overnight legislation through the Oireachtas while President Michael D. Higgins was flown home from the three-day official visit to Italy upon which he had embarked that very morning. This was the night before the Irish Supreme Court was due to hear an appeal by a Dublin business man, David Hall, against the High Court's ruling that he did not have the standing or locus standi to challenge the legality of the €3.06 billion promissory note payment that was due at the end of March. Hall's original argument before the High Court was that the payment of the €31 billion in promissory notes in respect of the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank was illegal as their issuing in 2010 was not approved by a Dáil vote. Every IBRC employee had their employment terminated with immediate effect, with many learning of this as it was announced on national television station TV3.
Overview.
Dáil Éireann was called into session for 22:30 on 6 February 2013. The Opposition did not have a copy of the proposed legislation to debate with five minutes before this. They had received copies by 22:32 and the Dáil session was then delayed until 23:00. Fine Gael TD Jerry Buttimer tweeted a photo of the Bill at 22:35.
Minister Michael Noonan blamed the rush on a leak to foreign media. Ursula Halligan said on TV3 that the “leak came from Frankfurt's end.”
The proposed legislation eventually passed in the Dáil by 113-35 at 03:00. In Seanad Éireann it passed by 38-6. President Michael D. Higgins rushed home from his visit to Rome and signed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Bill 2013 into law at Áras an Uachtaráin early on 7 February 2013.
Opposition.
The Opposition criticised the suddenness with which the legislation was rushed through. Many deputies did not have time to read it. Opposition TD Richard Boyd Barrett said: "Only 2 hours 15mins to read & vote with no details of broader deal in Europe" and noted that Ireland was bankrupted in 2008, when legislation was rushed through in a similar manner overnight. John Halligan said: "This legislation is madness". Vincent Browne called it "lunatic stuff" on TV3. Joe Higgins called it "a chaotic and grotesque way to run a state, by any standards".
Thomas Pringle said: "We learned more from Twitter tonight than the government told us in its contribution. That's the level that democracy, under your watch, has sunk to. Come out and tell us what the deal is, and what risks make this Bill necessary. What is certain is that the ECB will get every penny of the promissory notes. The best that we can hope for is that we get a reduction on the 8% interest rate and extend it out for 40 years." Pringle also questioned what the Taoiseach meant by saying this deal was ending a “dark chapter in our history” and wondered if the Taoiseach got his speeches mixed up.
Mick Wallace said: "How does this look to the people of Ireland watching tonight? It doesn't take care of their concerns, but those of the financial markets. Tonight will not bring financial comfort to the Irish people." Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said: "This Bill is nothing but cover to move the promissory notes from this supposed ‘bank’ to the ECB. It will, if ye vote for it, crystallise this as national debt. It will facilitate the situation whereby you will be able to turn something that is not our debt into a long-term mortgage. We were told by stalwarts Ruairi Quinn and Brian Hayes that our debt was not sustainable and something needed to be done about it. How much is this going to save? … If our debt was unsustainable before this, how the hell does this make it any more sustainable? [...] The problem started with joining the Euro. People like Anthony Coughlan said it would end in tears – you set up a Frankenstein currency, with interest rates controlled by Germany, never suited us. Anthony Coughlan was laughed at that day; today what he said has come true. By voting for this, you start the process of putting a debt on our backs and our children's backs that ye didn't get a mandate for."
Catherine Murphy said: "I'm trying to visualise how this would be if this debate was held in tandem with a deal that didn't include a debt write-down. The Minister wanted to do this in tandem with a deal: will he give us a commitment that he'll bring that finalised agreement for our approval here? Or will Section 17 gives him the power to issue new bonds and notes be a monster that gives immense power to an individual that can act in the absence of any oversight? [...] Any deal that does not include a write-down of the debt is not an acceptable deal. it is not our debt. Burden-sharing should not be between us and the generations to come." Mattie McGrath described it as a "farce" and said: "You're here tonight goading the opposition. [...] This gives far too much power to people who are unelected. [...] You're giving "carte blanche" to a new type of receiver. NAMA is like a wild animal in the woods, and you’re now feeding it."
According to Independent TD Stephen Donnelly in a speech addressed to Minister Noonan in the chamber, Donnelly also warned that Section 17 of the Bill "could be ruled unconstitutional" and described the Bill and the manner of its attempted introduction as "very, very dangerous" and "a fundamental erosion of parliamentary democracy." He suggested that Noonan withdraw the bill and return to the Dáil "before the courts open for business in the morning, with the minimal legislation needed to protect state assets."
Media coverage.
Ireland's mainstream media overwhelmingly supported the legislation. On 7 February, RTÉ lunchtime newsreader Sean O'Rourke described it as a “breakthrough in Ireland's attempt to lift the debt burden”. The 8 February edition of "The Irish Times" contained a section dedicated to the issue, which was described as resembling "a press release from the Department of Finance." Much of the media focused on the funny little tweets which members of the public contributed to the #promnight hashtag, with some saying they had, in common with many of the politicians in the Dáil, fallen asleep.
On 17 February 2013, the Chief Financial Officer of Anglo Irish Bank, Maarten van Eden, tendered his resignation writing that ""I have no confidence whatsoever in the ability of government to do the right thing for the financial sector."" and describing the government's actions on the prommissory note as ""pure window dressing"".
Exit from bailout.
Ireland officially exited from the Troika bailout in December 2013. To mark the end of the bailout, Taoiseach Enda Kenny gave an address, saying that the country was moving in the right direction, and that the economy was starting to recover. The significance of the exit to the Irish economy was questioned by others, many of whom viewed it as a cosmetic public relations exercise.

Cavelord

Cavelord is an action-adventure computer game released in 1985 by Axis Komputerkunst.
Overview.
The player controls the hero Telos on his winged horse Pegamis and has to explore two caves within a large scrolling playfield. While exploring the caves the player is threatened by flying creatures called "Nemesides" that appear occasionally. The player must also avoid obstacles such as striking lightning, exploding volcanoes, and falling rocks. If the player runs into any of these obstacles strength points are deducted. The player can replenish strength by collecting strength symbols. Dangling vines slow the player's movement, but not that of the Nemesides. The player can shoot and destroy Nemesides, but this is optional. The game doesn't award any score.
To advance, Telos must collect and use different items in the caves. The ultimate goal is to collect three crown pieces which are scattered around the caves and bring the completed crown to King Arud near the game's starting point.
In one-player-mode, it's only possible to shoot in the most recent direction moved, whereas in two-player mode one player moves the hero and the other player shoots. The game has three difficulty levels which differ in the amount of strength deducted when running into adversaries and in the frequency of the appearance of Nemesides.
The game is notable for the large number of animated objects on the screen: Vines, waterfalls, lakes and rockfalls all animate continuously using the technique of character graphics indirection.

Acetyl bromide

Acetyl bromide is an acyl bromide compound. As is expected, it may be prepared by reaction between phosphorus tribromide and acetic acid:
As usual for an acid halide, acetyl bromide hydrolyzes rapidly in water, forming acetic acid and hydrobromic acid. It also reacts with alcohols and amines to produce acetate esters and acetamides, respectively.

Gerry Droller

Gerard "Gerry" Droller (1905? - 1992) was a CIA officer involved in the covert 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état and the recruitment of Cuban exiles in the preparation of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. 
Biography.
Gerard Droller was born in Germany. He worked with Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Maquis in France during World War II. 
In September 1949 he was recruited into the Central Intelligence Agency, and became the CIA desk officer for Switzerland. One unspecified report said he was responsible for the reorganization of West Germany "and the consequent strengthening of German-American relations". Later he worked in Formosa where he helped Chiang Kai-Shek "organize his government and army".
In 1954 Droller helped organize the CIA operation to overthrow Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz. Others involved in this project code-named Operation PBSUCCESS included Frank Wisner, Richard M. Bissell Jr., Tracy Barnes, E. Howard Hunt, David Atlee Phillips, David Sanchez Morales, Jake Esterline, William "Rip" Robertson and William Pawley.
On 21 April 1959, Droller had a three-hour meeting with Fidel Castro in a hotel room in New York after the latter's visit to Washington. 
In early 1960, Droller became involved in Operation 40, formed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to eliminate Fidel Castro.
In June 1960, Droller was sent to Miami, as Chief Political Action (C/WH/4/PA) under Jacob Esterline to help organize the overthrow of Fidel Castro in Cuba. Adopting the name "Frank Bender", he posed as a wealthy steel tycoon. His main task was to recruit and organize the political leaders of anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the Miami area, assisted by E. Howard Hunt alias "Eduardo". He recruited Manuel Artime who became the leader of Movimiento de Recuperación Revolucionaria (Revolutionary Recovery Movement), (MRR), and later Brigade 2506. During 1960 and 1961, Droller organized the setting up of training camps for Cuban exiles at Useppa Island, Florida, and at Retalhuleu, Guatemala by arrangement with Guatemalan president Miguel Ydigoras. He helped recruit Cuban exiles into a paramilitary force subsequently named Brigade 2506 that, with considerable finance from the CIA, carried out the abortive invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs on 17 April 1961. He did not speak Spanish, and he was not universally liked by the Cuban exiles.

Palais Longchamp

The Palais Longchamp is a monument in the 4th arrondissement of Marseille, France. It houses the city's musée des beaux-arts and natural history museum. The surrounding park (the Parc Longchamp) is listed by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Notable Gardens of France.
History.
The Palais Longchamp was created to celebrate the construction of the Canal de Marseille, which was built to bring water from the Durance River to Marseille. Although the foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Orleans on 15 November 1839, the building took 30 years to complete, partly because of the enormous expense and partly because of difficulties with local regulations. Designed by the architect Henry Esperandieu, the building was centered on the structure and elaborate fountain known as the "chateau d'eau" ("water castle").
Description.
The Palais Longchamp has three main parts:
The park.
Parc Longchamp was opened in 1869, at the same time as the palace; in addition, the art and natural-history collections, which had been housed elsewhere, moved into the palace at this time. The park also contained a zoo, which was run by the city from 1898 until 1987, when, because of public disaffection with traditional zoos, it was closed.
At the summit of the fountain are sculptures of four large bulls and three women—a central figure representing the Durance flanked by one who represents grapes/vines and one who represents wheat/fertility. Behind the women, within the central structure of the palace, is a manmade stone grotto decorated with carved stalactites and nymphs. From beneath the three women and from the bulls, water flows into a secondary basin, and then into an artificial pond. The water drains out of the pond into underground pipes, from which it emerges in a waterfall-like structure, and in twelve ornate bronze fountains lined alongside it, flowing into a second, larger pond.
The central feature of the garden behind the palace is a classic garden "à la française", which is known as the "Jardin du plateau". The garden also includes an English landscape garden, with winding alleys and many notable trees, including a 150-year-old plane tree and an oak and a Siberian elm that are both 120 years old.
The area that was occupied by the 19th-century zoo still contains many of its picturesque buildings in fantastic styles, including oriental pavilions for the giraffe and elephant, cages ornamented with Turkish tiles, and bear cages and seal dens decorated with "rocaille", or rock-work.

Pumila

Pumila novaceki is an extinct iguanid that lived in what is now Palm Springs, California, from the Blancan to Irvingtonian stages of the Pliocene to Early Pleistocene.
It is currently known from a partially crushed skull. Features of the skull show both basal iguanian features, and characters very similar to the extant "Iguana", suggesting that the living animal may have resembled a juvenile Green iguana.
Etymology.
The genus name, Pumila, means "diminutive" in Latin, in reference to how the living animal would have resembled a very small iguana. The specific name honors Michael J. Novacek, a colleague and friend of the describer, Mark Norell.

Doris (singer)

Doris Svensson (born July 1, 1947 in Gothenburg), billed as Doris, is a former Swedish pop singer. Doris is best known for her lone solo album, eclectic pop, rock and funk "Did You Give the World Some Love Today Baby" recorded in 1970. The record was re-issued in 1996 to critical acclaim and caused interest among the Anglo-American and European alternative audiences as an odd Swedish funk rarity.
Biography.
Doris Svensson was born on July 1, 1947 in Gothenburg. Her singing career began in 1960 by recording an album with the Swedish band The Strangers. She went on recording with Plums, including the tracks "You Made a Fool of Me Last Night" and "Wouldn't That Be Groovy", and The Dandys, including "Go Back to Daddy".
In April 1970, Doris went to record in the EMI studios of Stockholm. Most of the lyrics of the songs were by Scottish writer Francis Cowan. The material was composed by TV producer, jazz-pianist, and composer Berndt Egerbladh. He also provided the big band brass arrangements for the tracks. The heavy drumming on the tracks was performed by Janne Carlsson from the duo Hansson & Karlsson, and the bass was played by Doris's husband Lukas Lindholm. The album "Did You Give the World Some Love Today Baby" was issued by Odeon in Sweden, 1970.
Reception.
The promotional singles distributed in U.K. and France in 1970 attracted little attention among the audiences. After Mr Bongo label re-issued the album "Did You Give the World Some Love Today Baby" in Sweden and U.K. in 1996, and U.S. and Canada in 1998 with bonus tracks from Doris's earlier period, the LP caused interest among the alternative listeners as an odd funk rarity from the archives of Swedish pop. "The Montreal Mirror" newsweekly reviewed it as:"A relic of epic Swedish pop from '70. Perfectly hilarious and hilariously perfect." Subsequently, the tracks "Did You Give the World Some Love Today?", "Don't", "Beatmaker", and "You never come closer" were included in eleven retrospective compilation albums issued all over Europe. Mr Bongo label issued "Did You Give the World Some Love Today Baby" in U.K. again in 2006. Her psychedelic jazz song "You never come closer" is featured on the compilation LPs "The Best Smooth Jazz... Ever!" and "Pregnant Rainbows for Colourblind Dreamers: The Essence of Swedish Progressive Music 1967-1979". "The Sunday Times" reviewed the song's instrumental and vocal style as:"...Hendrix backing Björk." The Blaxploitation.com database listed "Did You Give the World Some Love Today Baby" among the "Forty Essential Funk Albums" of the music history. Doris's tracks have received airplay in the retro music radio programs, including on BBC Radio 1, East Village Radio, FBi Radio of Australia, Q Radio,
Raadio 2 of Estonia, and Radio Fritz of Germany.
"You Never Come Closer" was sampled on "Closer" by influential hip-hop producer Madlib for Quasimoto. This has led to Doris ' work becoming increasingly popular amongst underground hip-hop fans and record collectors.

Pietro Magni (Genoa, December 22, 1898 - April 17, 1988) was an Italian aeronautical engineer. He was heavily involved with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics later in his career.
Thanks to some of his intuitions, he has been the precursor of some devices extremely actual nowadays, like the variable incidence wings, the development of the canard wings or the as innovative project of monoplane aircraft with the wing held by a single post. His activity has not been limited to the design, becoming also an entrepreneur, establishing a firm initially dealing with the manufacture under license of gliders, and then taking charge of the audit of aircraft for the Regia Aeronautica. He designed the Vittoria 1924 sport plane.
He succeeded also in manufacturing some of his designed aircraft characterized by his designed innovative features. On that sphere he experimented the most important one, a patent of a particular cowling to be applied on a radial engine, that allowed to remarkably increase the aircraft aerodynamics penetration and allowing at the same time an efficient system of temperature regulation of the aircraft itself. This project, known as Anello Magni, has been further developed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, becoming known as NACA cowling
Also his activity in the publishing sector are worth mentioning, either as writer of technical books, either as director of “L’Aeronautica”, supplement of the fortnightly magazine of the fascist aviation “L’Ala d’Italia”.

Pietro Magni (footballer)

Pietro Magni (20 March 1919 – 1992) was an Italian football player and manager. As a player, Magni made 193 appearances in Serie A, the highest level of Italian football. During a career spanning 14 years, he played for Varese, Liguria, Juventus, Lucchese, Genoa, Lecce and Cesena. It was in his second season with Lecce that Magni began his management career. He became player-manager and continued in that role at Cesena. Having retired from playing, Magni went on to manage Pro Patria, Bari, Varese, Pavia and Salernitana.
Career.
Magni began his career with Varese in 1937 and made 53 appearances in Serie C over the next three years, scoring nine goals. He joined Serie B club Liguria in 1940 – who would later become Sampdoria – and helped the club win promotion to Serie A in his first season, scoring 11 goals in 31 games. Having scored 12 times in 45 games for Liguria, Magni was transferred to Juventus in 1942. He scored ten league goals in his first season with Juventus, including four in one match – a 6–2 win against Triestina. He spent six years with the club, but only took part in four league campaigns due to the Second World War, which cancelled competitive football in Italy for two years. Magni scored 27 goals in 106 games for Juventus.
Having left Juventus in 1948, he spent a year with Lucchese and then another with Genoa – amassing 73 more appearances in Serie A. Magni dropped down to Serie C in 1951 to join Lecce, where he began his managerial career. Having made ten appearances in his first season with the club, he was appointed as player-manager for the 1952–53 campaign. Lecce narrowly avoided relegation to Serie D – Magni played in four matches – and he left the club in 1953. He finished his playing career with Cesena, where he also served as player-manager, and appeared in Serie D for the first time, scoring once in 16 appearances. Magni left Cesena in 1954 and did not manage again for another four years.
Magni returned to management in 1958 with Serie C side Pro Patria and the club won promotion to Serie B in the 1959–60 season under his stewardship. Having guided them to top-half finishes in Serie B over the next two years, Magni joined Bari in 1962. The club won promotion to Serie A during his first season in charge. Magni left the club in 1963 and spent the next two years away from management. He returned to Varese in 1965, who were now a Serie A club. The club finished bottom of the table during the 1965–66 season and were relegated. He joined Pavia in 1966 and managed them for a season before spending another two years away from the job. He finished his managerial career with a brief stint at Serie C side Salernitana in 1969.

<doc id="21641892" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21641892" title="Kaniguram">
Kaniguram

Kāṇīgurām is a town in South Waziristan, Pakistan. It is the principal place associated with the Burki tribe and was the home of the sixteenth century scholar Pir Roshan.
Demographics.
The Burki primarily inhabit Kaniguram, the most populous settlement in South Waziristan, at around above sea level. This has been their tribe's focal point for over 800 years. Kaniguram has historically been off limits to outsiders except for the Burki and, more recently, the Mahsuds. Common store-front signs are "Burki knives" and "Burki pharmacy" and are indicative of the Burki's dominant position in Kaniguram despite being significantly outnumbered by Mahsuds. Relations between the Burki/Urmar and the Mahsuds are as complex as they are intimate. They are generally on good terms except for occasional skirmishes/war between the two. Despite living in an enclave within what has become Mahsud territory, the Urmar/Baraki/Burki have stubbornly retained their mother tongue/identity/traditions in Kaniguram. Kaniguram's layout is distinctive from other hamlets/settlements in the FATA in that the homes are adjacent or interconnected. Land in and around Kaniguram is exclusively in Burki, and to a lesser degree Mahsud, ownership or control.
Pir Roshan, a Burki/Urmar, fought a major insurgency against the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the early sixteenth century. They are considered as the armory of the Mahsuds due to their small-arms cottage industry, which, however, does not rival Darra Adam Khel's. Kaniguram's daggers once rivaled those of Damascus.
Kaniguram is accessible from the north via the Razmak road and from the south from Wana on a narrow metalled road that is one of the few roads in South Waziristan. Access from this main "road" is limited to a suspension footbridge across a wide ravine that separates Kaniguram from the main road and is easy to guard, as behind it are mountains (Preghal and Jullundur) which limit access from the north. This footbridge has, more often than not, been unusable due to sabotage, damage etc. The people of this settlement often have to climb down the steep ravine from the road during harsh winter months and then climb back up to the Kaniguram side.
Many of Kaniguram's Burki spend winters in second homes in Dera Ismail Khan, where some work at the airport, or as traders. They are very involved in Pakistan's trucking and construction industries based primarily out of Karachi and are enterprising businessmen and traders.
Like other Pashtun tribes, the Burki seek self-segregation from the outside world: thus the importance of Kaniguram as the historical focal point of the tribe and the continued effort to retain their native tongue (Urmar), which predates Pushtu. Bayazid Khan of the Urmars/Baraks became widely known as Pir Roshan, which in Persian stands for "the Enlightened Sufi Master." He was the first local leader to lead a major insurgency against the Mughal Emperor Akbar.
Kaniguram's most famous resident was Bayazid Khan, whose descendants moved to Basti Baba Khel in the seventeenth century. He became known as Pir Roshan (the enlightened pir) and was an advocate for learning and equal treatment for women, a revolutionary concept for the times and even today in South Waziristan. From his base in Kaniguram, he started his insurgency movement, which was carried on by his children and then his grandchildren.
The major focus of the movement was to create equality between men and women, including the right to learn and listen to lectures of scholars and to fight against Akbar after his proclamation of Din-i-Ilahi.
Notable people from Kaniguram.
Religion.
Pir Roshan (literal translation: old man/saint of light) (Bayazid Khan) 1525–1585 Pushtun warrior and intellectual, founder Roshaniyya (Enlightenment) movement. Inaccurately referred to Bayazid ANSARI founder of the Afghan illuminati.
Descendants comprise the "Baba Khel" branch of the Burki Qaum (tribe).
Recent books and research.
Imran Khan (his mother was a Burki) covered the Burki and Kaniguram in his book "Warrior Race". Interestingly the invading armies in Afghanistan seem to have paid significant attention from a historical perspective. During the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, Saint Petersburg State University Institute of Oriental Studies seemed to have been the institution tasked to study the Roshaniyya movement, in order to understand their foe (see reference section below). The Soviets were not far off the mark as it so happens that Waziristan was the focal point for some of the toughest fighters against the Soviets.
Following the 2002 invasion, the West also sent their scholar into the field to study and understand this movement. Dr. Sergei Andreyev, (Chief Joint Mission Analysis Center, United Nations), an Oxford academic was sent on UN assignment to Afghanistan, while at the same time he was funded by the Institute of Ismaili Studies to research and write a book on the movement. There have been multiple editions of this book; however its sale and distribution remains restricted 10 years on.

Senecu, Chihuahua

Senecu (Senecú del Sur, San Antonio de Senecú) is a small Mexican village, now on the outskirts of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. It is at an altitude of 1123 m. and lies within the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem. 
Senecú del Sur was founded in 1682 by Piro Indians from Senecú, New Mexico, who fled south along with the Spanish after the Pueblo Revolt. There is evidence that some Tompiro joined the pueblo. Originally it was located on the north side of the Rio Grande, with its mission church (located approximately two miles west-northwest of the Ysleta, Texas mission. This close proximity resulted in repeated disputes over the boundary between the two pueblos. In 1832 there was severe flooding and due to the meanderings of the Rio Grande much of the village was destroyed. Further losses to the river occurred and after the Senecú Pueblo was not recognized by the Texas legislature, and after they had lost their suit of 1871 to Ysleta, the inhabitants probably developed the same land which was now south of the river; however, the town was not formally established at its current location until 1949.
As of 1901, Senecú still had "a tribal organization, with a cacique (who is also custodian of the church), a governor, a war-chief, and subordinate officials." The old church identified in 1901 is gone, replaced by a modern church. The 1910 Mexican Revolution caused some members of the community to flee across the border to Ysleta and Socorro del Sur.
The Pueblo is commemorated by a stone monument on Alameda Street, in El Paso, about 1½ miles west of the Ysleta Mission.

Brajabuli

Brajabuli is an artificial literary language developed in the 16th century. It was created primarily due to the influence of Vidyapati's lyrics on the love of Radha and Krishna on the Bengali poets of the medieval period.
Brajabuli is basically Maithili (as prevalent during the medieval period) but its forms are modified to look like Bengali. The medieval Bengali poets, Gobindadas Kabiraj, Jnandas, Balaramdas and Narottamdas composed their "pada"s (poems) in this language. Rabindranath Tagore also composed his "Bhanusingha Thakurer Padabali" (1884) in this language (he initially promoted these lyrics as those of a newly discovered poet, "Bhanusingha"). Other 19th century figures in the Bengal Renaissance like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee have also written in the Brajabuli.

Franklintown Historic District

Franklintown Historic District is a national historic district in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is the result of a plan developed in 1832 by William H. Freeman (1790-1863), a local politician and entrepreneur. His plan evolved gradually over the course of several decades and owes its success to his untiring promotion of the village. The central feature is an oval plan with radiating lots around a central wooded park. The district includes an old stone grist mill known as Franklin Mill, the innovative radiating oval plan, and the associated hotel and commercial area. 
The key residential buildings are excellent examples of the "I"-house form and display steeply pitched cross gables found in vernacular rural buildings throughout much of Maryland.

Lubart's Castle

Lutsk High Castle, also known as Lubart's Castle, began its life in the mid-14th century as the fortified seat of Gediminas' son Liubartas (Lubart), the last ruler of united Galicia-Volhynia. It is the most prominent landmark of Lutsk, Ukraine and as such appears on the 200 hryvnia bill. Another city castle, built by the Czartoryski family starting from the 14th century, is now a ruin.
The Kievan town of Luchesk had a wooden wall as early as 1075, when Boleslaw the Brave laid siege to it for six months. Yury Dolgoruky failed to take Lutsk after a six-weeks siege in 1149. In 1255, the walls of Lutsk were stormed by Jochi's grandson Kuremsa.
The current castle, towering over the Styr River, was built mostly in the 1340s, although some parts of the earlier walls were used. It repelled sieges by numerous potentates, including Casimir the Great (1349), Jogaila (1431), and Sigismund Kęstutaitis (1436). It was there that the Lutsk Conference of 1429 took place, attended by Emperor Sigismund, Vasily II of Moscow, Jogaila, Vytautas the Great, and the voivode of Wallachia.
During the long reign of Vytautas, Lutsk Castle was further fortified to guard against artillery and gunfire. The principal entrance, now bricked in, was from the west and adjoined a bridge over outer moat. Three main towers, named after Lubart, Švitrigaila and the Bishop, were built up in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. 
The walls of the castle formerly enclosed St. John's Cathedral, the residence of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and an episcopal palace. Of these buildings, only the Neoclassical palace of the bishops still stands.
On July 2, 1941 1,160 Jews were murdered within the walls of the castle. There is no monument or marker for this tragedy in the castle.

Machines of Grace

Machines of Grace is an American hard rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. The band features two former members of Savatage, namely vocalist Zachary Stevens and drummer Jeff Plate. Zachary Stevens is also the vocalist for Circle II Circle and Jeff Plate is the drummer for the Trans Siberian Orchestra, Metal Church and violinist Mark Wood. The band plays varied genres of hard rock including; heavy metal, acoustic rock and melodic metal.
History.
For a period of eight years, from 1992 until 2000, Zachary Stevens and Jeff Plate were members of Savatage. After four albums and several world tours with the group, Zachary left citing family reasons. During the winter of 2002 Zak started his own band called Circle II Circle, co-writing with former Savatage lead singer Jon Oliva and guitarist Chris Caffery. The remaining members of Savatage eventually turned into the Trans Siberian Orchestra, of which Jeff Plate is a founding member and is currently the east coast band's drummer. 
Zak and Jeff played in a band called Wicked Witch previously. With Mark Stewart on bass Boston area guitarist Matt Leff. Matt and Zak first met while attending Musicians Institute in Hollywood California. Upon graduating they moved to Boston Massachusetts and met Jeff. These three musicians have reunited under the band name "Machines Of Grace". When it was time to bring in a bassist, Chris Rapoza was called. Matt and Chris played together for several years in the Boston area metal band "Trigger Effect". Trigger Effect was chosen as one of the top unsigned bands in the USA by Sam Goody Record Stores, worked with Grammy winning producer Neil Kernon, and toured the Northeast as an opening act for Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche and Rob Halford. 
When 13 songs were ready to be recorded for the Machines Of Grace album, producer/engineer Paul David Hager was brought in. Paul previously mixed Wicked Witch live and in the studio. Paul has worked with many artists including The Goo Goo Dolls, Pink, Butch Walker, Megadeth, Miley Cyrus and Letters to Cleo. 
The album was recorded at Pyramid Sound in Ithaca, New York, Studio Metronome in Nashua New Hampshire, Red Room Recorders in Tampa, Florida and 37' Productions in Rockland Massachusetts. It was mixed at Skip Saylor Studios in Hollywood California and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City.
The band released their debut album, featuring 13 songs, worldwide in the summer of 2009 and plays live sporadically.

Egmond Gospels

The Egmond Gospels () is a 9th-century Gospel Book written in Latin and accompanied by illustrations. It is named after the Egmond Abbey, to which it was given by Dirk II, and where it remained for six centuries. It is most famous for being the earliest surviving manuscript showing scenes with Dutch people and buildings, and represents one of the oldest surviving Christian art treasures from the Netherlands. The manuscript has been owned by the National Library of the Netherlands since 1830.
Codicological information.
The manuscript consists of 218 vellum folios measuring 232 by 207 mm. Its Latin text is written in a single column of Carolingian minuscule of 20 lines measuring 156 by 126 mm. Its original binding was made of oak boards covered in gold and set with gemstones, which is described in the "Rijmkroniek van Holland" (Rhyming Chronicle of Holland) that was written around 1300. In another description from 1805, Hendrik van Wijn describes a biding of wooden boards covered in brown leather, unmarked except for the date 1574. This is likely the year when the valubale binding was removed. The binding was replaced again in 1830 when it was acquired by the National Library of the Netherlands, and once more in 1949 with a calfskin parchment after it appeared that the previous hard-glued spine caused damage. Its current binding is made of white goat's skin and dates to a restoration in 1995.
History.
The manuscript was written in the third quarter of the 9th century in northwestern France, likely in Reims. It is not known who commissioned it.
Around 900, eight folios were added to the manuscript, two at the beginning of each gospel. On the verso side of the first folio is the evangelist's symbol, and on the recto side on the second is his portrait. The second folio's verso side displays the incipit. The text on the following page was adjusted to reproduce the first letters of the text in large, decorative letters. It is still possible to see places where the original text was taken out, for example folio 19 recto, at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew in the Liber Generationis. A space above the first line 'XPI FILII DAVID FILII ABRAHAM' is clearly visible, where the text has been removed and brought to the preceding pages. The page likely originally began: ‘INC EVANG SCDM MATTHEUM / LIBER GENERATIONIS / IHU XPI FILII DAVID FILII ABRAHAM'. The removed text was rewritten in decorative letters on the added folios 17v, 18r, and 19v. At this time the manuscript's current canon tables were also added. These seven folios precede the Gospel of Matthew and may have replaced the original canon tables, or have been the first ones themselves.
The manuscript later came into the hands of the Frisian count Dirk II, who had its binding richly gilded and decorated with gemstones. He also added two miniatures paintings, in a diptych, in the back of the manuscript. These depict him and his consort, Hildegard of Flanders, giving the manuscript to the Egmond Abbey. The miniature paintings were likely added in Ghent between 975-988, while the gift itself took place in 975.
The left miniature on folio 214 verso shows Dirk and Hildegard underneath an arched structure with the open gospel book lying on an altar. The exterior of the abbey (certainly a fictional representation) is depicted as an architectural frame for the event. The text in the upper lefthand corner inidicates what is happening:
The recto side shows Dirk kneeling and Hildegard lying in proskynesis before Adalbert, the partron saint of the abbey, who pleads on their behalf to a Christ in Majesty. The accompany text reads: 
The circular space around Christ likely suggests a Byzantian dome.
The manuscript was kept at the Egmond Abbey until the Dutch Revolt. It was recorded in the abbey's inventory in 1571. In 1573, the abbey was looted and destroyed, but the Egmond Gospels had already been transported to safety in Haarlem by Godfried van Mierlo, the abbot of Egmond and bishop of Haarlem. The manuscript was handed over in 1578 to Pieter van Driel, the tax collector of Haarlem, along with a number of other valuable items. In 1583, Van Mierlo transferred its possession to Hendrik Bercheyk, from the Dominican monastery in Cologne.
The Egmond Gospels remained in Cologne with the Dominicans until 1604. In that year Van Mierlo's successor, Sasbout Vosmeer took it into his possession after he was made apostolic vicariate of the diocese of Haarlem. The manuscript was likely kept at the seminary Vosmeer founded in Cologne.
The manuscript returned to the Netherlands between 1656 and 1688, namely to Utrecht. In 1688, it was in the possession of the Geertekerk according to a note written by Joannes Lindeborne. Lindeborn was the pastor at St. Nicolaas and had been a student and rector at Vosmeer's seminary in Cologne. It is likely that Lindeborn brought the manuscript to Utrecht after the seminary was closed in 1683.
In 1802, the Utrecht concil member and archivist Petrus van Musschenbroek rediscovered the manuscript in the possession of Timot de Jongh, the pastor of the Old Roman church in Utrecht's Hoek. Van Musschenbroek's colleague, Hendrik van Wijn, had described the manuscript in his 1805 book "Huiszittend Leven" ("Domestic Life"). The manuscript had also been identified in 1720 by a previous pastor of the Old Roman church, Willibrord Kemp.
In 1830, King William I purchased the Egmond Gospels for 800 guilders and donated it to the Royal Library.

Audience (company)

Audience is an American mobile voice and audio-processing company based in Mountain View, California, and is one of the 34 founding members of The Open Handset Alliance. They specialize in improving voice clarity and noise suppression for a broad range of consumer products, including cellular phones, mobile devices and PC's.
Audience is the first company to have reverse-engineered the human hearing system and model its processes onto a chip, enabling computers and mobile devices to use the same kind of “auditory intelligence” that humans employ. By using this technology in conjunction with two or more microphones, background noise is suppressed, improving the quality of the remaining voice and reducing distraction for the listener. This technology mimics the “cocktail party effect”.
In 2010, Audience partnered with HTC to integrate their noise suppression technology into the Google Nexus One smartphone. The next year AT&T introduced eight different handsets powered by Audience's earSmart technology including the Samsung Galaxy S III Skyrocket and the HTC Vivid.
In 2013, Audience unveiled its eS515, a combination voice processor and audio codec. This single slot solution enables device manufacturers to streamline their designs, negating the need for a separate voice processor and codec.
Background.
The company’s core technology reduces background noise and improves voice clarity on smartphones, computers and tablets. The company’s technology has shipped in more than 140 devices including the Nexus One, Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note, the iPhone4 and 4S, and the LG G2. Audience also works with other mobile phone manufacturers such as Huawei, Google, HTC, Sharp, Pantech, ZTE and others. In 2010, the company announced a collaboration with AT&T to deliver its advanced voice capabilities to AT&T devices and is engaged with multiple operators around the world. Most recently the company announced its first design implementation in the PC space with the Dell Vostro 5460.
Products.
The company currently has two lines of processors, Advanced Voice and Smart Sound, both branded as "earSmart." Advanced Voice processors come in a variety of models, the eS110 (supports 1 microphone), eS305 and eS310 (supports 2 microphones) and the company’s latest generation eS325 (supports 3 microphones), which was announced at Mobile World Congress 2013.
Smart Sound processors combine the Advanced Voice processor feature set (HD call quality, wideband noise suppression, bandwidth expansion, acoustic echo cancelation, and improved performance for Automatic Speech Recognition) with a stereo audio codec. The company introduced its Smart Sound processor category at Consumer Electronics Show 2013 with the launch of the eS515.
Technology.
The company’s technology is built around the foundation of Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) -- a field of study that builds on the concept of Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA), a term first coined by psychologist Albert Bregman. ASA enables humans to accurately group sounds—even when composed of multiple frequencies, as in music, or when heard simultaneously –- and avoid blending "sources." As a result, ASA allows the listener to correctly distinguish and identify a sound of interest, like a voice, from other noise sources.
CASA attempts to recreate sound source separation in the same manner as human hearing, but in machines. Using the principles of CASA, Audience’s earSmart processors act like a human cochlea and group different sounds, based on a diverse list of cues such as pitch, onset/offset time, spatial location and harmonicity. These simultaneous sounds are evaluated and grouped by source. In doing this, the microphones of a mobile device, together with Audience's proprietary "Fast Cochlea Transform" technology, can identify and group sounds which are classified as noise, remove or at least reduce them, and leave the remaining clear voice signal intact.
Applications.
Beyond voice and video calls, this technology has been proven to improve the reliability and task completion rate of ASR (automatic speech recognition) in noisy environments as well as improve the quality and usability of media capture functions. Outside of the smartphone, tablet and mobile PC space, Audience is said to be targeting the Smart TV and Automotive markets where voice is becoming more commonplace as a form of user interface.
Awards.
Audience was the Silver Winner in the 2008 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Awards and the Winner of the Semiconductor category. The company was included in Gartner’s “Cool Vendors in Semiconductors, 2008” and selected as the Most Innovative True Mobile Start-Up for the “2008 GSMA Mobile Innovation Global Awards.”

Patrick Prosser

Patrick Prosser (born 8 September 1952) is a Computer Scientist at Glasgow University. His research has centred on Constraint programming, although it has extended into the application of those techniques into other areas. For his major contributions to the theory and practice of Constraint Programming, Patrick was awarded the Association for Constraint Programming's Research Excellence Award on 15 September 2011: he is only the sixth recipient of this award. He gave a prerecorded acceptance speech, which is available on YouTube.
His most notable contribution is his invention of Conflict-directed backjumping, an advanced technique for reducing search in constraint problems by avoiding unnecessary work on backtracking. His 1993 paper describing this has been widely cited.
Other areas of constraint programming he has researched include the identification of hard problems
and techniques for solving vehicle routing problems. His interest in applications of constraint programming has included (for example) how it can be used in computing species trees.
Amongst his recreations is kite flying as a founder of the Kite Club of Scotland. He has written about the Tetrahedral kite.

HP Pavilion TX1000 Series Tablet PC

The HP Pavilion TX1000 Series Tablet PC is a series of notebook computers from Hewlett Packard introduced in February 2007. These notebooks are designed for Windows Vista. The TX series uses the AMD Turion 64 X2 series of processors. This series has a 12.1-inch touch screen and a DVD+RW; it competed well with the top-of-the-line tablets at the time of its release. All models came with an NVIDIA GeForce Go 6150 graphics system, which features 128 MB of integrated graphics and an extra shared graphics memory of up to 916 MB.
This model has been superseded by the HP Touchsmart tx2 Series, and subsequently by the HP Touchsmart tm2.
Design.
The series is delivered with the HP Imprint Finish. The form factor is referred to as a "convertible tablet", that is, the screen can be rotated to use the notebook as a slate with the included stylus. The current model has a glossy, black plastic casing and a perforated touchpad. The speakers are located near the hinge, on the screen; and the webcam on the top of the screen. The stereo microphones are also mounted on the screen and the tablet comes with an optional fingerprint reader. The standard 6-cell battery juts out to form a hand-grip and the DVD drive can be replaced with a plastic "weight-saver".
Specifications.
Lithium Ion Battery 6 Cell config, 4 Cell 8 Cell
Criticism.
Within a few months of release of the tx1000 series, numerous technical failures were reported on internet blogs, review sites and HP's own support websites. These included webcam, audio, speaker, BIOS, power management, overheating, booting, and wireless adapter problems. Some were addressed in a timely manner with driver updates, but other users were still forced to turn the notebook on and off repeatedly until it booted up, while others were left with a non-working "bricked" unit. HP released an updated model, the HP Pavilion tx2, which in turn was followed by the HP TouchSmart tm2. HP never issued a recall for its tx1 model.

Boris Nayfeld

Boris Nayfeld, alias Biba, was a Belarusian mob boss and heroin trafficker, who operated out of Brighton Beach, New York City.
Arrival to America and rise to power.
Boris Nayfeld arrived in the United States in the late 1970s as a Soviet Jewish refugee under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. He became a small-time criminal and was arrested in Nassau County for grand larceny, pleaded guilty to petty larceny and was placed on probation. He later became a bodyguard and chauffer to Brighton Beach mob boss Evsei Agron. According to the NYPD, Nayfeld remains the prime suspect in the 1983 murder of Moldovan writer turned gangster Yuri Brokhin.
After Agron's murder in 1985, Nayfeld became an enforcer for Ukrainian mob boss Marat Balagula who ruled the neighborhood rackets before being convicted of gasoline bootlegging in 1991. In the aftermath, Nayfeld took over the remnants of Balagula's organization and began to branch out on his own.
Heroin ring.
Together with Italo-Polish gangster Ricardo Fanchini, Nayfeld ran a successful heroin-smuggling operation which transported China White from Thailand to the United States. After being smuggled into Singapore, the drug was hidden in television picture tubes and shipped to Poland via a Belgium-based import-export company. From there, couriers flew it via plane to Brighton Beach. Upon arrival the heroin was sold partly to the Five Families and partly to Latino street gangs. Things were going good for Nayfeld and he spent his time in either a luxury apartment in Antwerp with his mistress and his family home on Staten Island opposite a nature reserve.
Gangland war and arrest.
In January 1994 he was arrested by federal agents for drug trafficking. Later, he and his co-defendants, the Dozortsev brothers, pleaded guilty to laundering the drug money which belonged to themselves and Ricardo Fanchini.

<doc id="21642139" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21642139" title="Border Break">
Border Break

, is a third-person mecha action arcade game developed by Sega. It is the first title to run on Sega's RingEdge arcade system board and it was released on September 9, 2009. It was released in Hong Kong on January 25, 2010 and in Taiwan on April 1, 2010.
Within one month by the end of September 2009, at least 2,436 "Border Break" machines were sold to arcade operators, which increased to nearly 3,000 machines by the end of 2009. As of March 2012, the game has grossed ¥8.1 billion from arcade machine sales, equivalent to more than $100 million.
Gameplay.
The game premise basically focuses on robot battle through network connectivity between arcade cabinets. Two teams of ten robots will battle it out across different landscapes, which include cities, towns, and facilities. In each map, each team's goal is to destroy the opposing team's energy reactor core in order to win the match. Both cores are marked in blue and red respectively. At the end of each match, Class Points will be given to the player to level up their current rank.
The class point also affects the rank of the player. Generally, players who have just started the game will start playing in a series of cooperative battles against a computer-controlled "bots" team. The player will start facing actual opponents once when he / she has attained the rank of D4.
Robot types.
Parts.
In "Border Break", the robots, which are known as Blast Runners. Blast Runners are divided into four parts.
Each part determine different performance of Blast Runners:
If all four parts of a Blast Runner blongs to the same series(different types are OK), The Blast Runner will receive series bonus.
Classes.
There are four different classes of battle robots to choose:
Touch Panel.
Communication between players of the same team uses the touch-screen capability in "Border Break". Players can press the onscreen commands and responses to inform the team of their next move. They can send the entire team to attack an enemy together, defend themselves from a designated spot, call for reinforcements, scout the area ahead. Responses come with affirmation and NG (not able to follow the command).
Another ability to interact with a friendly Blast Runner once it is on screen. Players can say a word of thanks for help that the other Blast Runner may have done, apology for some mistake or error, or call for that Blast Runner to join them in action together. When players touch an enemy Blast Runner or landmark on screen, they can inform their own team of their discovery, or point it out for the team to attack. Players will be able to call out to any friendly Support Blast Runner nearby by touching their own Blast Runners and choosing the option to be repaired.
In addition, Heavy players can spot a place after howitzer deployed, by press a point in enlarged map within a specific range to commence artillery strike to there.
Data features.
"Border Break" employs a data card available for players to purchase in some arcades, similar to the one used in "Ghost Squad". This card is optional and is only meant for extended play and features. At the end of each match, regardless of winning or losing, players will be rewarded with mystery boxes with randomized items. Depending on how many boxes they can open, they can choose any of them on screen to be opened and the item inside will be added to their inventory. The items or ingredients as they are called, can be used to purchase better and stronger weapons or newer body parts for their Blast Runners. Blast Runners can be customized with better body parts and colored in different schemes, providing a unique feel for the player.
Arcade credits can be used to purchase Game Points (GP) in a data card. One credit allows the purchase of 260-300 GP, while two and five credits can purchase more GP with an added incentive: a small amount of free bonus GP. However, it is at the arcade's discretion to give the bonus GP credits. The more GP a player buys, the more time to play in a match. For example, 1200 GP can buy a player 1200 seconds (20 minutes) of game time. GP also can be used to purchase weapons and body parts, or customize the features of their pilot character, and the emblem and color of their Blast Runners.
If player reach certain achievements, respective medals are awarded. Some weapon or body parts may be required certain amount of medals specified to purchase. Some Blast Runners paints can be unlocked by collect specific sets of medals. In rank promotion mission, players are required to collect specified medals within period of time to complete it (for B5 or up).
Soundtrack.
A CD soundtrack was released on 11/26/09 in Japan. The majority of music from Border Break is a fusion between electronica and rock. A CD single by the Japanese pop artist, Mechanical Panda, was released separately and contains the opening theme song, Last Brave~Go To Zero, used for the game.
A second CD soundtrack titled, "Border Break Airburst", was released on 12/22/10. The music contained on this release is from the 2.0 upgraded version of the game.
A third soundtrack titled "Border Break Airburst 2", was released on 10/03/12. This expanded soundtrack was a digital only release.
A fourth and fifth soundtrack, titled "Border Break Union GRF" and "Border Break Union EUST" were released on 11/21/12. These expanded soundtracks were digital only.
Merchandise.
Kotobukiya will release a series of model kits featuring the mecha from the game itself. The nine were the Cougar I, released in January 2010, the Heavy Guard II, released in March 2010, the Shrike I, released in May 2010, the Cougar I(A class color) with heavy armament, released in June 2010, the Shrike I with assault armament, released in July 2010, the Zebra 41, released in September 2010, the Cougar S (S class color), released in November 2010, the Saber II, released in January 2011, and the Shrike V, released in March 2011.

Neumayer-Station III

Neumayer-Station III, also known as Neumayer III after geophysicist Georg von Neumayer, is a German Antarctic research station of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut. It is located on the approximately thick Ekstrom Ice Shelf several kilometres south of Neumayer-Station II. The station's assembly kit was transported to its current position early in November 2007. It is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year towards the open sea.
After almost ten years of work on the project, beginning in October 1999, including conception, environmental impact assessment, planning and construction phases, regular operation of the station began on 20 February 2009. The station replaces the Neumayer-Station II and the Georg-von-Neumayer-Station that preceded it. The expected lifespan of the station is 25 to 30 years and the entire project is estimated to cost €39 million.
Construction phase.
The station was constructed above ground on a temporary two-level platform, and it now rests on 16 hydraulic columns set on a solid snow surface. A garage and further technical equipment are located within a subsurface snow cavern at the front of the station. The moving concrete supporting feet are powered by hydraulic machinery. Through an annual lifting procedure of it is expected to prevent new snow from causing the platform to sink.
The station runs all year round and includes of laboratory surface, divided into 12 compartments. It has twice the floor area of previous stations. Within the 15 living compartments there is room for 40 occupants to sleep. All inner rooms of the platform are built as self-contained units, some of which have aligned connecting passages, depending on their size. The compartmentalized interior of the station is enclosed in sheet metal with an interior polyurethane rigid foam insulation.
Assembly.
A majority of the construction materials and the heavy steel frame were delivered by the end of January 2008. The plan specified that the last of the construction equipment had to leave Ekstrom Ice Shelf by March 2009. For, A crew of about 90 worked on construction. By mid-January 2009, the exterior work on the station was completed, so that further improvement to the 99 interior containers could continue unaffected by the weather.
Interior.
In addition to the previously mentioned laboratories and accommodation areas, there is a south-facing lounge with many windows, a laundry room containing two washing machines and two dryers, a sauna, an information technology room, shower and washrooms, a dining room with a serving window connected to the kitchen, a conference room, medical treatment rooms, operating rooms, storage rooms, a refrigerated area, a dressing room, a room for the heating system, a planning and training room, and a water-treatment room.
Remote stations.
In order to minimize any effect that the main station's regular operations might have on the accuracy of scientific projects, small remote platforms are set up at a distance of from the main station. Magnetic, seismic, trace element, and acoustic research are the chief research missions of these remote stations.
Research.
Previous Neumayer stations have been the center of continuous research since 1981, especially with respect to their observatories. In addition to the main research areas of meteorology, geophysics and atmospheric chemistry, which have been studied on the stations since the 1980s, infrasound has been studied for five years and marine acoustics since 2005.
Climate.
The climate table below is unprecise and provisory, but it gives the idea of Neumayer's climate.

Museums in Basel

The Basel museums encompass a series of museums in the city of Basel, Switzerland, and the neighboring region. They represent a broad spectrum of collections with a marked concentration in the fine arts and house numerous holdings of international significance. With at least three dozen institutions, not including the local history collections in the surrounding communities, the region offers an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. They draw some one and a half million visitors annually.
Constituting an essential and defining component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museums of the canton of Basel-City arose from the 1661 purchase of the private Amerbach Cabinet by the city and the University of Basel and thus represent the oldest civic museum collection in continuous existence. Since the 1980s, a number of collections have been made public in new purpose-built structures that have achieved renown as acclaimed examples of avant-garde museum architecture.
Museum landscape.
The main focus of collecting among Basel museums is the fine arts – painting, drawing and sculpture. More than a dozen museums cover a spectrum that extends from antiquity up to the present and includes historic and established works of art as well as pioneering creations. In particular, the latter category has been made increasingly accessible to the public over the past two decades in a series of newly opened museums. There are collections with more of a local and regional character, yet a number of area museums, especially the larger institutions, are noted for their international orientation and reach. In addition, Basel benefits from a long tradition of collecting that, in contrast to many other museums in Central Europe, was not disrupted by the wars of the 20th century, as well as from the city’s well-established connections to the market of art dealers and art collectors – such as through Art Basel.
Numerous museums address various themes of cultural history and ethnology while other institutions feature technical and scientific collections. The museums continue to be oriented to the scholarly tasks of collecting, conserving and exhibiting as well as research and education or at least view these as part of their activities. Consistent with museological trends seen elsewhere, however, the traditional self-image has evolved since the 1960s. Alongside the new forms of public outreach (museum education and didactics), institutional hybrid forms have arisen that actively embrace a sociopolitically relevant role and in which museum operations constitute just one facet, albeit a highly important one, of a more comprehensive cultural institution.
With the city's position at the junction of the "Dreiländereck" (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel’s museums are located in the city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of Lörrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come together here as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss "Upper Rhine Museum Pass" that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.
With the increasing aestheticization of everyday life, the architecture of museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary of postmodern and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.
The museums are a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an important economic factor. A number of Basel's museums are public institutions but the majority are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to the high level of museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.
Development of the museums.
Museums in the city.
Early collections.
The origins of the first public collection are closely linked to the University of Basel and the early modern era collections of books, art and natural curiosities, of which there were quite a few in Basel. Prominent among them, the Amerbach printer family had collected a substantial number of books, paintings, goldsmith works, coins and natural objects during the 16th century. In 1661, the Amerbach Cabinet was on the verge of being disbanded following a purchase offer from Amsterdam, then the European center for the trade in collector’s items. At the urging of the mayor Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the city and university decided to jointly purchase the collection in order to keep it in Basel. Installed in the Haus zur Mücke just off Cathedral Square in 1671, the collection did not operate like a museum. It principally served as a library for university scholars, with only a few parlors on the first floor reserved for works of art and natural objects. Two librarians were in charge of administering the overall collection. 
Beginning in the late 18th century, Basel saw an acceleration in the growth of collections of books and objects inspired by Enlightenment-era ideals of education and refinement. Significant holdings of antiquities, coins, fossils and natural curiosities made their way into the Haus zur Mücke through purchases, gifts or bequests by private collectors. An especially important addition came in 1823 with the contents of the Museum Faesch, a Basel collection from the 17th century. The first coherent ethnological collection was formed from the "Mexican cabinet" that had been assembled by the merchant Lukas Vischer from 1828 to 1837 during his travels in Central America. In 1821, the natural objects and artifacts were separated out from the collections in the Haus zur Mücke and an independent museum of natural history was established at the Falkensteiner Hof, likewise located right off Cathedral Square, which also included the instrument cabinets of the physics and chemistry institutes.
The city’s official repository for art was the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) whose rich ornamentation and upkeep represented a constant undertaking for the city and a source of commissions for numerous artists from the early 16th century onward. The city armory likely had a "museum corner" starting in the 16th century. Following common practice, weapons that had become unfit for war were decommissioned for disposal. In Basel, however, a substantial number of them were preserved, which means that the armory caretakers wished to store the obsolete medieval or early modern militaria for the sake of memory value. The most prominent examples were the real and supposed trophies of the Burgundian booty from 1476, which had fallen to Basel and remained on display to curious onlookers centuries later. In contrast, the care and storage of the Basel Cathedral Treasury that had lost its liturgical value in the Reformation did not bear the character of a museum. Locked away in the cathedral sacristy for three centuries, the reliquaries and other religious objects remained inaccessible and out of view until 1833 and were merely listed as book value in the state budgets.
First museum building.
In 1767, the university professor Johann Jakob d’Annone had the paintings and other objects moved to the previously empty ground floor of the Haus zur Mücke to create more space for the books on the first floor, and also provided for a more systematic organization. A few decades later, however, the building and its infrastructure no longer accommodated the increased volume of visitors (with the facility open four days of the week starting in 1829) and the modern culture of knowledge established through the Enlightenment. Moreover, a comprehensive index of the holdings was lacking, having been "altogether impossible heretofore in the inadequate premises where some pieces lay buried in darkened recesses for decades beneath an inch-thick layer of dust."
The need for space was resolved in 1849 with the removal of the collection to the multi-purpose building by Melchior Berri on Augustinergasse – simply named the "Museum" – on the site of the former Augustinian monastery. It was financed with a one-time contribution from the canton along with citizen donations. The late classicistic monumental edifice with decorative painting and frescoes by Arnold Böcklin is a comparatively early example of a civic museum and the first major museum in Basel. While taking clear inspiration from Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his Academy of Architecture in Berlin, the allocation of spaces and functions here combined university facilities with a library and natural history and art collections. This also served the institutional requirements of the university. Further examples of collections could be found in most of the subsidiary institutes – i.e., facilities with demonstration objects for instruction and research purposes. These included the instruments of the chemistry and physics institutes and the utensils of the anatomical institute.
Division of the public collections into state museums.
Parallel to the specialization of the educational and research disciplines that took hold at the beginning of the 19th century, Basel’s wide-ranging holdings of objects evolved into institutional collections divided according to various scientific fields. They were very different from the cabinets of curiosities that, according to the Basel professor Wilhelm Wackernagel, had merely involved "grabbing at curiosities with a half-pedantic, half-childish zeal". The Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum) founded in 1821 was the first step in this new direction. In 1836, the art collection was made legally independent from the university library with a separate publicly funded art commission to oversee it. In 1856, the "medieval collection" took up residence in auxiliary rooms and annexes of the Basel Cathedral (Bishop’s Court, St. Nicholas Chapel), having been established earlier that year with inventories from the Museum on Augustinergasse based on the model of the German National Museum in Nuremberg. In 1887, castings of ancient sculptures were put on display in the Sculpture Hall of the Basel Art Association (Basler Kunstverein). Meanwhile in 1874, the chemistry and physics institutes had moved into the new Bernoullianum building for the study of the natural sciences, whereupon their holdings of objects shed their collection character in favor of laboratory facilities. The canton had difficulty amassing funding and support for the creation of another museum for its collections. The Museum on Augustinergasse had represented a formidable beginning, yet remained the only one of its kind for nearly fifty years.
In 1892, the "antiquarian collection" (small artifacts of antiquity, excluding ethnological objects) was joined with the medieval collection of the Basel Cathedral and historical weapons from the Basel Armory to form the Historical Museum Basel (Historisches Museum Basel), with exhibition space in the reconverted Barfüsser Church from 1894 onwards. Today this museum houses the Upper Rhine’s most comprehensive collection of cultural history, showing artisanal crafts (Cathedral Treasury, goldsmith works, stained glass) and objects of everyday culture (furnishings, tapestries, coin cabinet). Major emphasis is placed on the Late Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The entire inventory of books was incorporated into the collection of the new University Library in 1896. The "ethnographic collection", which was given the title Collection of Ethnology (Sammlung für Völkerkunde) in 1905, moved into new space created by an addition to the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1917, where it became the Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde). With holdings of approximately 300,000 objects and a comparable number of historical photographs, it is the largest ethnological museum in Switzerland and one of the largest in Europe. The collection includes objects from Europe, Ancient Egypt, Africa, Asia (Tibet and Bali Collections), Ancient America and Oceania. In 1944, the federal administration distinguished its European holdings as the Swiss Museum of Ethnology (Schweizerisches Museum für Volkskunde). However, since 1997 this division no longer exists; non-European and European collections are now joined in the Basel Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen Basel), whose name intentionally expresses a change in emphasis from the presentation of “foreign” cultures to intercultural dialogue. The Natural History Museum Basel (Naturhistorisches Museum Basel), which features most areas of the natural sciences (anthropology, mineralogy, paleontology, vertebrates, insects including the Frey Collection of Beetles and other invertebrates), has not only remained in its original location since 1849 but has also retained its traditional name. Its collections, comprising nearly eight million objects which are also dedicated to scientific research, bear the title "Archives of Life".
The public art collection was installed in the upper story of the Museum on Augustinergasse in 1849. Its continuing growth led to increasing spatial demands that could not be met at that location. In 1936, after a planning period of roughly three decades, the art collection moved into the Kunstmuseum Basel. Satellite locations had already been established in 1922 at the Augustinerhof on Augustinergasse (collection of prints and drawings) and at the Bachofenhaus on Cathedral Square (Bachofen Collection with additional holdings). The greater part of the art collection was temporarily housed in the Kunsthalle from 1928 until 1936. The Kunstmuseum’s gallery of paintings and collection of prints and drawings comprise the largest and most significant public art collection in Switzerland. With an emphasis on paintings and drawings by artists of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600 (Holbein family, Witz, Cranach the Elder, Grünewald) and art of the 19th to 21st centuries (Böcklin, van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, Cubism with Picasso and Braque, German Expressionism, postwar American art), it also ranks as one of the leading international museums of its kind. Since the removal of the art collection to new quarters, the Museum on Augustinergasse has served as the exclusive domain of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures/Museum of Ethnology (Völkerkundemuseum/Museum der Kulturen). A major expansion of the public museum collections occurred in 1961 with the founding of the Basel Museum of Ancient Art and Ludwig Collection (Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig). This new institution combined previous holdings from the Historical Museum (small artifacts of antiquity) and Kunstmuseum (sculptures) with acquisitions from private collections, which are displayed in two neoclassical villas located opposite the Kunstmuseum. The Museum of Ancient Art opened in the first villa in 1966 and expanded into the adjacent structure, also built by architect Melchior Berri, in 1988. It is the only Swiss museum devoted exclusively to the art of the Mediterranean area (mainly Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Italic and Roman cultures, as well as Levante and the Near East) from the 4th millennium B.C. to the 7th century A.D. The collections of Greek vases, Antique sculptures and Ancient Egyptian artifacts occupy a central position within its holdings.
Satellite locations of the state museums.
The growing spatial needs of the collections that were housed in the Museum on Augustinergasse led to the incorporation of neighboring buildings. Similarly, the other museums also expanded. The Historical Museum in Barfüsser Church acquired the following satellite locations: the Museum of Domestic Life (Wohnmuseum) in the Segerhof (1926–34) and its successor in the Haus zum Kirschgarten since 1951, the Museum of Domestic Culture in Basel (Museum der Basler Wohnkultur); the Museum of Music (Musikmuseum), featuring five centuries of European musical history based on the musical instrument collection founded in 1943, which has been displayed since 2000 in the former prison Lohnhof; the carriage and sleigh collection in Brüglingen, established in 1981. Replica casts of ancient sculptures that were originally on display in the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturenhalle), but moved into storage in 1927 due to a lack of public interest, became part of the Museum of Ancient Art (Antikenmuseum) in 1961 and again received their own exhibition space in 1963 in the new Basel Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle Basel). It features the world’s only complete reconstruction of architectural sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens. The Public Art Collection (Öffentliche Kunstsammlung) also expanded into a second building in 1981 with the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museum für Gegenwartskunst) in St. Alban-Tal. As the first public exhibition building project in Europe, it is devoted exclusively to the presentation of contemporary works and artistic production since 1960. In addition to classic media such as painting and sculpture, its acquisitions also include video art.
Defunct and semi-public museums.
The Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) was founded in 1878 by the Society of Trades and Craftsmen as a forum for the presentation of local arts and crafts. It became a semi-public institution in 1886 before coming under full public sponsorship in 1914. Renamed the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) in 1989 due to its broadening thematic spectrum, it was closed in 1996. Affected by the same cuts in public funding was the architecturally oriented City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und Münstermuseum), established in 1939 under the auspices of the public agency for the preservation of historic monuments in the former convent of Kleines Klingental. The holdings of the Museum of Design were distributed among other institutions, with the transferral of its library and poster collection to the School of Design (Schule für Gestaltung). Thanks to the support of a foundation, the City and Cathedral Museum remains on the same premises under the present name Kleines Klingental Museum. 
The Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), founded in 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the premises of the cantonal Fire Brigade but does not have the status of a public museum and is not administerd by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The Hörnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof Hörnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton’s Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, hearses, coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.
Additional museums.
The first museum that was not supported and administered by the canton of Basel-City was established in 1860 in a large room at the Basel Mission. It presented ritual and cultural objects from the countries and ethnic groups among which the Basel Mission was active, as well as a portrait gallery of its missionaries. However, parts of this exhibit were later sold to the canton and the gallery space was closed. The concept of a multi-purpose building, following the example of the Museum on Augustinergasse, was embraced by the Basel Art Society (Basler Kunstverein), which erected the Kunsthalle on Steinenberg between 1869 and 1872. In addition to exhibition space and administrative offices, this building housed a library and studio space for sculptors. A building wing added in 1885 accommodated the Sculpture Hall (Skulpturhalle), where the previously mentioned casts of Antique statues from the Museum on Augustinergasse were displayed from 1886 to 1927. The former Artists House (Künstlerhaus) now defines itself “as a hub between artists and art agents and as a place that brings together local and international developments.” The next privately initiated museum was the above-mentioned Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum); founded in 1878, it came under cantonal administration just eight years later. The Anatomical Museum (Anatomisches Museum) of the University of Basel dates back to the acquisitional activities of Carl Gustav Jung in the 1820s. As the Collection of Pathology and Anatomy (Pathologisch-Anatomische Sammlung), it moved into its own building in 1880. Two especially significant objects in this collection are the oldest anatomical specimen in the world (prepared by Andreas Vesalius in Basel in 1543) and a skeleton prepared by Felix Platter in 1573.
The Museum of Pharmacy (Pharmazie-Historisches Museum, originally the Historical Apothecary Collection) followed in 1924 after the donation of a private collection to the University of Basel. It is one of the world’s largest collections on the history of pharmacy, encompassing old pharmaceuticals and early apothecary objects, laboratory utensils, ceramics, instruments, books, arts and crafts. The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the Rhine ports of Basel, entitled “Our Path to the Sea.” It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papiermühle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (Jüdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.
Like the Kleines Klingental Museum, the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) is located in the building complex of the former Klingental convent. Opened in 1974, the gallery serves as a presentation platform for the current work of artists living in Basel and aims to support emerging artistic talents. It is sponsored by the Klingental Gallery Society (Verein Ausstellungsraum Klingental). The Caricature and Cartoon Museum Basel (Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel), by contrast, was initiated by an individual, the collector and patron Dieter Burckhardt. Founded in 1979, it is devoted to caricatures, cartoons, comics, parodies and pastiches. The eponymous foundation (Stiftung Karikatur & Cartoon Museum Basel) is a dependent affiliate of the Christoph Merian Foundation. The exhibition galleries have been located in a structure from the Late Gothic period since 1996, following the completion of renovations and a new building addition by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Swiss Architecture Museum (Schweizerisches Architekturmuseum), founded in 1984, has resided since 2004 in the building complex of the Kunsthalle, which was completely renovated and redesigned by the architectural offices Miller & Maranta and Peter Märkli. The museum, sponsored by the Architecture Museum Foundation, presents alternating exhibitions on topics of international architecture and urbanism. An advantageous factor is the unusual concentration of internationally renowned architectural firms in Basel; Herzog & de Meuron, in particular, have made significant contributions to regional museum architecture.
Opened in 1996, the Tinguely Museum features a permanent exhibition on the life and work of the artist Jean Tinguely. The museum’s temporary exhibitions present works by friends and contemporaries of Tinguely, as well as other modern artists. Designed by Mario Botta, the museum is financed entirely by the Basel pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. The Dollhouse Museum (Puppenhausmuseum) was founded in 1998 by its patron and owner Gigi Oeri, who built up the collection herself. In addition to dolls, dollhouses and miniature shops from the 19th and 20th century, it displays the world’s largest collection of teddy bears. The media art space opened its doors in 2000 with the backing of the Forum for New Media Association (Verein Forum für neue Medien), which had been founded the previous year. It realizes exhibitions and projects, provides artists with international networking opportunities and helps convey works of media art to the general public. With one of the world’s most extensive collections of photographs (around 300,000 works with an emphasis on industrial society in the 19th century), the Herzog Foundation has exhibited its holdings since 2002 in a “Laboratory for Photography”. Located in the Dreispitz industrial sector, the warehouse converted by Herzog & de Meuron encompasses the collection along with a reference library on the history of photography and two additional rooms for study, teaching and research purposes.
Museums in surrounding communities.
"Many of the small and mid-sized municipalities around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. Mention is given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally open to the public several days a week."
Collections of natural, cultural and technological history.
The oldest museum in the Basel region outside the city is the Museum of Canton Basel-Country (Museum des Kantons Basel-Landschaft) in Liestal, nowadays called Museum.BL. It was founded in 1837 as a "Cabinet of Natural Curiosities" (Naturaliencabinett) and up through the 1930s primarily took up objects of natural history into the collections. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward cultural history. The diversity of the collection allows the museum to address wide-ranging themes related to the environment, history and the present day. The Museum am Burghof in Lörrach traces its origins to the Lörrach Antiquities Association (Lörracher Altertumsverein) founded in 1882, which bequeathed its collection to the town of Lörrach in 1927. Commencing operations in 1932 as the Museum of Local History (Heimatmuseum), the current permanent exhibition “ExpoTriRhena” presents the history, present-day culture and divisions and similarities within the "Dreiländereck" (Three-Countries Corner) border region where Germany, France and Switzerland meet.
Opened in 1957, the Roman Museum at Augst (Römermuseum Augst) is an open-air museum on the grounds of the former Roman city of Augusta Raurica, which has been the subject of excavations going back to the Renaissance. The exhibits feature numerous archaeological finds, including the largest silver treasure from Late Antiquity. The adjacent reconstruction of a Roman House (Römerhaus) was a gift of the Basel patron René Clavel while the museum and the entire archaeological park constitute a departmental division of Basel-Country. Located in the Brüglinger Plateau, the Mill Museum (Mühlemuseum) of the Christoph Merian Foundation is housed in the water mill of the former Brüglingen farming estate. The structure was converted into a museum in 1966 and presents the history of the mill and the work of millers from the Bronze Age up to the 20th century. The mill is still functional, allowing periodic demonstrations of the operational sequence from the water-powered mill wheel to the rotating millstone.
Opened to the public in 1972, the Toy Museum and Village and Wine Cultivation Museum (Spielzeugmuseum, Dorf- und Rebbaumuseum) in Riehen complements its exhibits of village history and wine growing with one of the most significant collections of European toys. The toys are drawn from private collections as well as loans from the Museum of Cultures (Museum der Kulturen). The museum is operated as a division of the municipal administration of Riehen. The Museum of Music Automatons (Museum für Musikautomaten) in Seewen, located on the outermost periphery of the Basel museum territory, houses one of the world’s largest and most well known collections of Swiss music boxes, disc music boxes, musical timepieces and jewelry and other mechanical musical automatons. It opened to the public in 1979 as a private museum of the collector Heinrich Weiss and was gifted to the Swiss Confederation in 1990. A newly remodeled and expanded facility for presentation of the exhibits was completed in 2000. Finally, the Museum of Electricity (Elektrizitätsmuseum) of the electric utility Elektra Birseck opened its doors in Münchenstein in 1997. Exhibits explore the history and development of power production and its use. The collection contains rare historic equipment and is complemented by a laboratory in which visitors can experiment with electric power.
Emphasis on art collections.
Since the late 1980s, the Basel region has seen a proliferation of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents a broad range of design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and Álvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, Cézanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and Bacon. The trees in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.
With the creation of the Basel-Country Art Museum (Kunsthaus Baselland) in Muttenz, the Basel-Country Art Association (Kunstverein Baselland) was given its own dedicated exhibition building in 1997. The Art Museum is devoted to contemporary art and presents temporary exhibitions of current projects by regional and international artists. Opened in 1998, Riehen Art Space (Kunst Raum Riehen) is another public institution with a similar thematic orientation. It serves the municipality of Riehen and its art commission with exhibitions of contemporary works of art from the region. Established in 2001, the Sculpture at Schoenthal Foundation in the former Schönthal monastery presents over twenty works by international and Swiss artists in a permanently accessible sculpture park under the motto “Art and Nature in Dialogue”. A Romanesque-era church has been converted into a gallery for temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists. In 2003, the Schaulager (or “viewing warehouse”) of the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation was opened in Münchenstein. Centered on the avant-garde art collection of the foundation, the institute functions as a mix between public museum, art storage facility and art research institute. The polygonal building is a design by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. The Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Space (Espace d’Art Contemporain Fernet Branca) in Saint-Louis, the Alsatian town just across the border from Basel, is located in the former Fernet-Branca spirits distillery that was decommissioned in 2000. Since 2004, the museum has presented temporary exhibitions on contemporary art themes and artists. The museum’s operations are supported by the Association for the Fernet Branca Contemporary Art Museum (Association pour le Musée d’Art Contemporain Fernet Branca).
Museum promotion and museum policy.
Primacy of the library.
Many museums can be traced back to courtly collections – at least in terms of the original set of holdings. Since the 19th century, in contrast, Basel has embraced a culture of remembrance of having created the oldest existing civic museum collection through its purchase of the Amerbach Cabinet in the year 1661. The acquisition of a collection from the 16th century fits with the historical and documentary interest in art that was prevalent at the time. In fact, however, the purchase was chiefly prompted by a desire to enhance the university’s inventory of books with the extensive book holdings of the Amerbach Cabinet. The Haus zur Mücke community hall that housed the university-administered collection was called the “Library” in recognition of its primary function. The role as the city’s art repository did not shift from the Basel Town Hall (Rathaus) to the Haus zur Mücke until the latter half of the 18th century. The Passion Altarpiece by Holbein that had been one of the main visitor attractions since the Reformation was moved over in 1770, followed by several additional paintings from the town council’s inventories in 1771 and Holbein’s organ doors from the Cathedral in 1786. Despite this weighting of the collections, the official legal status remained unchanged for quite some time. The natural history holdings and art collection were not split off from the library until 1821 and 1836, respectively.
At the end of the 18th century, civic museum culture was still in the early stages of its development, as illustrated by the very limited opening hours of the Haus zur Mücke (Thursday afternoon from two to four in the afternoon, otherwise on request). The first records of regular gallery visits by city residents and outside visitors date to this period. In the three centuries before and after 1800, most of the collection activities involved objects of natural history, with a substantial number of acquisitions and gifts in this area. The numerous top-level art objects that made their way to Basel in the 1790s from Revolutionary France, on the other hand, did not find a wide audience of buyers and in most cases were resold.
Transfer to the state and popular education.
For the republican and monarchical civic states of the 19th century, collections in the form of public museums became emblems of self-determination. The carting off of large numbers of artworks to Paris during the Napoleonic Wars had created an awareness of the identity-shaping power of art. Institutional role models were the “Musée français” in the Louvre and the “Musée des monuments français” in a former Augustinian convent, which closed in 1816. The maintenance of programmatic museum collections and the construction of museum buildings became one of the most prominent and defining national functions.
In the case of Basel, however, it was the increasing need for space in the Haus zur Mücke that prompted deliberations regarding construction of a new building. The discussion concerning the right location for the public collection took on a political dimension following the division of the canton into city and regional sections. The University Act (Universitätsgesetz) of 1818 had made the corporatively autonomous university a cantonal educational establishment, with the university holdings thus owned indirectly by the state. According to the arbitral decision governing the cantonal split, two-thirds of the university’s collection belonged to the regional canton and had to be purchased by the city canton. The ensuing consternation in the city led to the Administration and Use of University Holdings Act (Gesetz über Verwaltung und Verwendung des Universitätsgutes) of 1836 that such goods were indissolubly tied to the locality of the city of Basel for the purposes of education. This provision has remained in effect to the present day.
These occurrences led to the founding of the Voluntary Academic Society of Basel (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) in 1835, which began supporting the collections in financial terms and through purchases and gifts as part of its general promotion of the university. Yet the greatest momentum for the museum building came from natural science circles centered on the physics and chemistry professor Peter Merian, who was likely responsible for securing a dedicated annual budget for the Natural History Museum – the only state collection with this distinction. A combination of academic institution, library and laboratories, the establishment of the Natural History Museum at the Falkensteiner Hof also provided a model for the museum building. The fact that a primary museum building was ultimately created instead of a university-affiliated building was due to the university’s poor standing among wide sections of the merchant and industrialist classes. In these sectors, the university was considered a backward-looking institution. The museum, by contrast, was seen as a driving force for practical popular education and the community was willing to support its construction with private contributions as part of a wider process of renewal in the city.
At the instigation of Christian Friedrich Schönbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) was initiated in 1850 as the successor to an earlier association founded in 1841 for the construction of the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel’s rapid population growth in the latter half of the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued regular state appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.
Civic culture of remembrance and modernism.
From the outset, the museum authorities charged the collections with a federal mission, wanting them to exert a “beneficial and salutary influence on the entire Fatherland”. The “unofficial national gallery” grew over time, primarily through acquisitions of Swiss works of art. When negotiations got underway in 1883 regarding the establishment of a federal museum, the canton of Basel-City sought to be chosen as the location for the new institution and proposed its collections of cultural history as the nucleus of the museum, systematically expanding them in light of its candidacy. While the Swiss National Museum (Schweizerisches Landesmuseum) ended up in Zurich, plans were nevertheless realized for a history museum that was no longer generally Swiss but specifically related to Basel, located in the historic former Barfüsser Church from the High Gothic period. The establishment of the Historical Museum “was a self-assured display of Basel’s art-mindedness and craftsmanship, a mix of educational corridor and enfilade of stalls”. The transfer of the Museum of Applied Arts (Gewerbemuseum) to the state a few years earlier as an arena of contemporary achievements can likewise be seen under the aspect of civic pride and reinvented sense of commonality in which the citizenry understood its ideals and capabilities as a foundation of state and society.
While the collections had clearly established their international standing, this appreciation did not become rooted in the cultural awareness of a broader range of social classes until the end of the 19th century. The historic culture of remembrance that was growing in importance and impact at the time was strongly linked with the medieval collection and the many Late Medieval and Renaissance works of the Upper Rhine in the Kunstmuseum. In the years since, Basel has also cultivated its claim of possessing the oldest municipal art collection in continuous existence through its acquisition of the Amerbach Cabinet. On the occasion of two major public celebrations in 1892 (500th anniversary of Greater Basel’s acquisition of Lesser Basel) and 1901 (Basel’s 400th anniversary as part of the Swiss Confederation), Basel presented the civically minded portion of the population (and hence the base of support for the museums) with a series of identity-shaping historical and patriotic gestures that borrowed from the store of images from the past available in the museums.
With the epochal break of the First World War and in light of societal and cultural developments, the Basel museums became concerned with the citizenry’s assertions of legitimacy and quest for recognition and their representation within these very same institutions. The discussions regarding the relationship of the museums to modernism took on particular relevance in the area of the fine arts. The construction of a dedicated museum for Basel’s art collection ignited a “monumentality debate” in the late 1920s, in which the proponents of functionally oriented New Building (Neues Bauen) rejected the timelessly classic palatial form that was ultimately chosen as a demonstration of power by a conservative and “intellectually spent” notion of culture. In contrast to the form of architectural expression and the general anti-modernistic spirit of the 1930s, the acquisitions from the 1920s up to the outbreak of the Second World War took a decisively modern tack. In 1934, the public art collection added its first painting by Vincent van Gogh along with an ensemble of 134 drawings by Paul Cézanne. Founded in 1933, the Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation supported the Kunstmuseum in these efforts and took up residence in the facility with its works of contemporary art in 1940. The breakthrough in altering the overall profile came with the special funding credit provided by the Basel-City parliament in 1939 at the instigation of museum director Georg Schmidt for the purchase of German museum holdings that the National Socialists had vilified as “degenerate art”.
The establishment of classical modernism at the Kunstmuseum continued with ongoing acquisitions of postwar-era art, in particular with works by American artists. In Basel’s claim to being a “Museum City”, the highly controversial and unsuccessful referendum against the purchase of two Picasso paintings in 1967 holds considerable importance and constitutes a key moment in Basel’s culture of remembrance in regard to the fusing of society and museum.
Democratization, popularization.
Despite the affirmation by voters, traditional museums found themselves in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was “just a museum city” – here meant in a derogatory sense – and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.
The democratization that took hold in the 1960s meant doing away with the elite in favor of the egalitarian, dispelling fears of the new and unknown. With a focus on the constructivist works of the 1960s associated with the “New Tendencies” (Nouvelles Tendances) movement, the short-lived Progressive Museum (1968–1974) set out to “establish a modern collection that would be accessible to the public from the very beginning” and wanted to avoid any sort of “secularized ceremony”. The expansion of education and communication, likewise a mandate stemming from this era, could only be achieved through an increase in funding. Since the mid-1970s, however, increasingly tight budgets and persistent financial difficulties in the public sector have exerted a palpable impact on museums. The museum studies program at the University of Basel could only be offered from 1992 to 1994 due to funding shortages. In the mid-1990s, a government resolution cut the budget of the state museums by ten percent, leading to the 1996 closure of two museums, the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung) and the City and Cathedral Museum (Stadt- und Münstermuseum). The ensuing debate and the pressure from a public referendum in support of the city’s museums led to the adoption of the Basel-City Museums Act (Museumsgesetz) of 1999, which placed the holdings of the remaining five state museums (Museum of Ancient Art, Historical Museum, Kunstmuseum, Museum of Cultures, Natural History Museum) in the hands of the parliament. As a central component of cultural expenditures, the museums have also been included in the intensified negotiations over the past several years between the two Basel cantons regarding payment for the city-provided services within the framework of a fiscal equalization scheme.
Since the 1980s, the museums have experienced simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have been marked by a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience and led to a 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate in an environment that is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.

Helen Vincent, Viscountess D'Abernon

Helen Venetia Vincent, Viscountess D'Abernon (née Duncombe) (1866 – 16 May 1954) was a British peeress, socialite and diarist.
Early life.
Helen was the daughter of William Duncombe, 1st Earl of Feversham, of Ryedale and Mabel Violet Graham, born at their estate of Duncombe Park in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, England. She and her sister, Hermione, Duchess of Leinster, were renowned as leading beauties in their circle. 
Marriage.
Helen married Sir Edgar Vincent, then a governor of the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople on 24 September 1890. In 1899 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Exeter. Lady Helen, in that period, was "the most celebrated hostess of her age and was 'by reason of her outstanding beauty, intelligence and charm, one of the most resplendent figures'". 
Activities and later years.
Helen was associated with "the Souls", a salon of noted intellectuals of the day which included Arthur Balfour, George Curzon, Henry James and Edith Wharton. She is believed to have been the model for the characters of Lady Thisbe Crowborough in Max Beerbohm's story "Hilary Maltby and Stephen Braxton" in "Seven Men" (1919) and for Lady Irene Silvester in Maurice Baring's story "A Luncheon Party" (1925).
In 1904 during an extended visit to Venice, Lady Helen's portrait was painted by John Singer Sargent. That work is now part of the permanent collection of the Birmingham Museum of Art in Birmingham, Alabama, USA.
During World War I Lady Helen trained as a nurse anaesthetist and treated thousands of patients. She accompanied her husband (created 1st Baron D'Abernon in 1914) as he served on the Interallied Mission to Poland and as the British Ambassador to the Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. During this time the Baroness kept a diary of her experiences, parts of which were published in 1946 as "Red Cross and Berlin Embassy, 1915-1926: Extracts from the Diaries of Viscountess D'Abernon".
At the end of his diplomatic mission, Sir Edgar was elevated to 1st Viscount D'Abernon on 1 January 1926, and then also succeeded his brother, Francis, as 16th Baronet of Stoke d'Abernon. The Vincents did not have children and Sir Edgar's titles died with him in 1941. Lady D'Abernon died at age 84 on 16 May 1954.

Women's Strike for Equality

The Women’s Strike for Equality was a strike which took place in the United States on August 26, 1970. It celebrated the 50th anniversary of the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment, which effectively gave American women the right to vote. The rally was sponsored by the National Organization for Women (NOW). More than 20,000 women gathered for the protest in New York City and throughout the country. At this time, the gathering was the largest on behalf of women in the United States. The strike primarily focused on equal opportunity in the workforce, political rights for women, and social equality in relationships such as marriage. It also addressed the right to have an abortion and free childcare, but these were more controversial positions which more conservative women, including pro-life feminists, generally did not at the time agree with.
Historical context.
At the time of the protest, women still did not enjoy many of the same freedoms and rights as men. Despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited pay discrimination between two people who performed the same job, women comparatively earned 59 cents for every dollar a man made for similar work. In some areas of the country, women with college degrees earned significantly less than men with an eighth grade education. Women were further restricted in terms of their access to higher education, such as medical or law school, and the job market after receiving subsequent degrees. Only 5–10% of women were allowed in institutions of higher education. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, who graduated at the top of her class from Stanford Law School, was offered only secretarial jobs in Los Angeles law firms despite her prestigious degree. In 43 states, women were limited in the number of hours they could work and the amount of weight they could carry (generally no more than , the size of a toddler, as some feminists noted). In many states, women were also unable to obtain credit cards, make wills, or own property without a husband. The right to serve on a jury was denied to women in some states.
Organization.
Historian Betty Jameson Armistead sent a letter to Betty Friedan and others proposing the strike. Betty Friedan, writer of The Feminine Mystique, and a leader of second-wave feminism, then planned the protest to commemorate the anniversary of landmark legislation, and spotlight current battles. She said the movement was in need of “something big, something so big it will make national headlines”. Friedan initially proposed the strike to the National Organization for Women, an organization which she had helped found. Members were hesitant, however, fearful that the protest would not be successful, and could create a mockery of their movement.
Friedan continued to develop a strategy, months in advance, despite the negative reception. The initial planning meeting was small and chaotic; planners sat in a circle and discussed possible strategies without a real leader or any formal organization. The meeting produced nothing tangible or relevant. As the plans progressed, so did the controversy. In the final month leading up to the event, the group was significantly divided into two factions: the young “radical, crazies” and the “bourgeoisie” founders.
Eventually, Friedan prevailed, avoiding deep divisions by recruiting women and men, liberals and conservatives alike. Friedan sought permission from the city of New York to close Fifth Avenue for the protest. The city refused.
The strike.
Despite the setback, women gathered on the streets around 5 pm (chosen so that working women could attend), and began protesting. The New York action included chanting, speeches by prominent figures, (including Friedan), as well as signs and posters. Crowd estimates range from ten to twenty thousand people, mostly women, gathered on Fifth Avenue. Police attempted to keep the crowd on the sidewalks, but the sheer volume of people in the streets was impossible to control.
Thousands of politically and satirically charged signs dotted the crowd. “Don’t iron while the strike is hot” set the stage as the protest's famous slogan. Others included: “Hardhats for Soft Broads,” “I Am Not a Barbie Doll”, “Storks Fly – Why Can’t Mothers”, “We are the 51% minority”, and the sardonic “We have the right to vote for the man of our choice”. Speeches were given to ignite the crowd and inform bystanders. Friedan spoke of the strength and ability of women to rise above their oppression. The strike's goals were to publicize the feminist movement and ideas, and to expose the injustices experienced by women.
In conjunction with the New York City action, individuals and groups throughout the nation staged protests, marches, and other various forms of revolt to honor the movement. In Detroit, women staged a sit-in in a men’s restroom, protesting unequal facilities for men and women staffers. In Pittsburgh, women threw eggs at a radio host who dared them to show their liberation. Women in Washington, D.C. staged a march down Connecticut Avenue behind a banner reading “We Demand Equality”; in the same city, government workers organized a peaceful protest and staged a “teach-in”, which educated people about the injustices done to women, mindful that it was against the law for government workers to strike. “Silent vigils” held in Los Angeles drew meager crowds of only 500. In Minneapolis, women gathered and staged guerrilla theater involving key figures in the national abortion debate, and stereotypical roles of women in American society. Women were portrayed as mothers and wives; doing dishes, rearing children and doting obnoxiously on their husbands, all while wearing heels and aprons.
Despite initial obstacles and setbacks, Friedan declared the event a success. Including the protests and demonstrations throughout the country, she proclaimed, “It exceeded my wildest dreams. It’s now a political movement and the message is clear”.
Reactions and media coverage.
The strike received extensive local and national attention, both positive and negative. In opposition, some women called for the “National Celebration of Womanhood”, a day dedicated to women dressing in “frilly,” feminine clothing, singing while doing the laundry, and cooking breakfast in bed for their husbands. Other women simply watched the protest, unsure of its implications or what exactly the protest was about. One woman in the crowd was quoted as saying, “I don’t know what these women are thinking of. I love the idea of looking delectable and having men whistle at me.”
Many media outlets questioned the validity of the protest. CBS news quoted a poll that found two-thirds of American women did not feel they were oppressed. News anchor Eric Sevareid compared the feminist movement to an infectious disease and ended his report claiming that the women of the movement were nothing more than “a band of braless bubbleheads”. 
Many feminists were angry and dismayed by the language used by major media outlets to describe their movement, as many claimed the reporting was biased and condescending, focused primarily on the rage of the women in the march and not the overall message. ABC continued to fuel the anger when reporter Howard K. Smith publicly spoke against the movement, denying its credibility and claiming a lack of evidence for the cause. The women’s movement subsequently engaged in a media backlash, boycotting the four major corporations, whose advertising and broadcasting they found to be offensive and degrading. ABC eventually retracted Smith's statement. Smith later clarified that he did not support women's liberation because, in his view, women were already liberated. "Women dominate our elections; they probably own most of the nation's capital wealth; any man who thinks he, and not his wife, runs his family is dreaming."
Not all media attention, however, was negative. President Richard Nixon issued a proclamation acknowledging the credibility of the movement and designated the suffrage anniversary as “Women’s Rights Day”. "Time Magazine" also supported the cause and published a series of articles highlighting the issues of the movement.
The significance of the protest was vast for its supporters. Feminists and scholars claimed that the strike was a significant spark for second wave feminism, owing to the protest's high profile in the media and the country.

The Bearcats started off the 1997-98 season by announcing that the team would cease operation to help make away for the upstart Truro Bearcats Junior "A" team after twelve years of operation. For their final year, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association awarded them the right to host the 1998 Allan Cup.
In the first game of the Allan Cup, the Bearcats beat the Powell River Regals 5-1. In their second game, they tied the Ile des Chenes North Stars 1-1. They closed out the round robin with a 5-3 win over the London Admirals. The victory allowed them to finish first in the round robin and advance directly to the Allan Cup final. In front of a hometown crowd, the Bearcats again faced London, beating them soundly 6-1 to win their only ever Allan Cup. This would be the last game ever played by the Bearcats.

<doc id="21642431" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21642431" title="Nude Tour">
Nude Tour

The Nude Tour was a greatest hits concert tour by Prince. While the previous tour drew critical praise, the high cost of the concert tour production made it a financial disappointment, thus Prince eliminated much of the excessiveness of the previous tour to be more financially viable. Like several of his then-recent tours, Prince chose not to tour in the United States (the exception being Lovesexy). It wouldn't be till 1993's Act I Tour that Prince did a full tour of the U.S.
History.
Unlike the previous year's Lovesexy Tour, the Nude Tour promised a stripped-down, back to basics concert that saw Prince eliminate many of the excessive and expensive set designs that were produced for the Sign ☮' the Times and Lovesexy tours, thus the "Nude" moniker. The setlist was reduced to a limited number of his hits from the '80s with a few tracks from the "Batman" and then-forthcoming "Graffiti Bridge" albums, resulting in all the songs being played in their entirety and much shorter shows. In a move to promote a more youth-friendly image, as well as cut costs, Prince chose to eliminate the veteran horn section from the band.
Band.
After the stability of the previous two tours with a virtually unchanged band line-up, several departures forced Prince to rearrange his touring band. The departing members were Boni Boyer, Cat Glover, Sheila E. and the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. The young Michael Bland was added on drums, Rosie Gaines took over on keyboards, organ and co-vocals, and a trio of dancers known as the Game Boyz rounded out the new band. With the exception of Fink and Miko, this was the make-up of the original New Power Generation line-up.
The addition of The Game Boyz caused much upheaval in the Prince camp. They first came to Prince's attention in 1983 during the filming of "Purple Rain"; Mosely, Johnson and Dickson can be seen dancing during various performances at the First Avenue club. The trio continued to associate with Prince over the years, dancing as a group in the music videos for "Glam Slam" and with the band Madhouse. Around the time of "Graffiti Bridge", Prince recruited the trio for the film and his touring band.
Many questioned Prince's choice to begin courting the hip hop audience through the addition of The Game Boyz and the increased contribution of Mosely's rapping on future Prince tracks despite the belief that Mosely's rapping ability was sub par. Previously, Prince was negative towards rap music, dismissing it as a fad, as noted by the songs "Bob George" and "Dead on It" from "The Black Album".
Furthermore, Rosie Gaines complained that she was being mistreated by the dance trio. Tension developed between Gaines and Prince, as instead of disciplining the dancers, he simply removed Gaines from the tour bus and placed her on Mavis Staples' tour bus.
After the tour, the last remaining members from The Revolution, guitarist Miko Weaver and keyboardist Doctor Fink, left the group. Miko's departure was especially dramatic. During pre-tour rehearsals, Prince had a number of conflicts with band members, but particularly with Miko. According to several members of the group, Prince felt threatened by Miko's good looks and popularity with the women. "Prince didn't like the fact that Miko was getting women as much as was/On the road, Miko would have five or six women in his room, and some of them would want to go with Miko instead of Prince." The tension boiled over when Prince kept picking on Miko, asking him to turn his guitar down and yelling at him. After back and forth arguing, Prince challenged him "to take this shit outside?" to which Miko retorted, "Yeah like I'm gonna come outside with you and your bodyguards." Miko walked out and briefly quit over the incident, but later rejoined the band at the last minute for the tour.
Other official sources and tour personnel have also said that Prince sacked Miko Weaver because he caught him in bed with a Prince fan who was under the age of consent.
Mavis Staples went on tour as an opening act.
Typical set list.
In addition, Janet Jackson's "What Have You Done for Me Lately", "Little Red Corvette", "Do Me, Baby", "Bambi", Smokey Wilson's "Don't Make Me Pay for Your Mistakes", Z. Z. Hill's "Down Home Blues", Joni Mitchell covers "Blue Motel" and "A Song for U", "Jerk Out", Fontella Bass' "Rescue Me", "Respect", "Irresistible Bitch", "When Doves Cry", "Thieves in the Temple", "Venus de Milo", "Under The Cherry Moon" and Digital Underground's "The Humpty Dance" were incorporated into the setlist of some concerts.

North American Scrabble Players Association

The North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA) is an organization founded in 2009 to administer competitive Scrabble tournaments and clubs in North America. It took over these activities from the National Scrabble Association (NSA) effective July 1, 2009.
Activities.
NASPA has organized the annual National Scrabble Championship (NSC) since 2009,
most recently the 2013 National Scrabble Championship in Las Vegas. The 2014 NSC will be held in Buffalo, New York.
Its Dictionary Committee edits the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary and the 
Official Tournament and Club Word List.
Its Rules Committee edits the official Scrabble tournament rules.
Its Rating and Recognition Committee maintains the official rating system.
Its Tournament Committee maintains a calendar of hundreds of officially sanctioned
tournaments each year, and is a disciplinary body for players and directors.
Its Club and Director Committee maintains a roster of officially sanctioned clubs,
and certifies club and tournament directors.
Its Advisory Board determines policy that affects club and tournament play, and
hears appeals to the decisions of other committees.
Its Canadian Committee oversees matters that pertain solely to Canadian NASPA members, such as organizing the Canadian National Scrabble Championship tournament.
History.
NASPA came into existence following a weekend meeting at Hasbro headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts in December 2008. The meeting was arranged by the National Scrabble Association (NSA) and Hasbro executives. Hasbro had decided to stop its financial support of adult tournament Scrabble and clubs by the end of 2009. The NSA, which had been running adult tournament Scrabble since the late 1970s, would continue as an organization, but it would exist largely to focus on its growing school Scrabble program and to promote recreational play. (The NSA ceased operations on July 1, 2013.) The Springfield meeting was attended by 16 individuals. They represented a cross-section of the Scrabble community: prominent Scrabble players, club and tournament directors, and others from across the continent. Those 16 had been invited by the NSA to hear first-hand from Hasbro executives about the company's decision regarding its cessation of funding. In its wake, the attendees were offered the opportunity to form a new organization to preserve competitive adult Scrabble in North America and were encouraged to do so with the blessings of Hasbro.
Following the meeting, several committees were formed to make the transition of adult tournament and club play from the NSA to NASPA a smooth one. Most of the 16 attendees accepted Hasbro's challenge and formed the nucleus of the Steering Committee. An email vote among the Steering Committee's members determined the new organization's name: The North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA). NASPA was registered in Texas as a not-for-profit corporation and headquartered in Dallas. Chris Cree of Dallas and John Chew of Toronto emerged as co-presidents. Although Hasbro had given NASPA until the end of 2009 to establish control of the competitive tournament scene, NASPA was ready for the total transition six months early. Accordingly, the first NASPA tournament games were contested on July 1, 2009. On that date NASPA became the only Scrabble group in North America permitted to use the registered Scrabble name and trademark in adult club and tournament play.
Outwardly, the nature of the adult competitive Scrabble scene in North America changed very little as NASPA took over from the NSA in 2009. There have been some noteworthy changes regarding disciplinary matters, though. NASPA quickly adopted a new, stricter Code of Conduct with the goal of improving the deportment of players and officials at official Scrabble events. Also, there is considerable difference in the way NASPA is financed compared to its predecessor. In the NSA era, Hasbro provided a substantial annual budget, and tournament rating fees were nominal. NASPA receives no operational funding from Hasbro, relying on fees collected from annual player memberships, as well as "participation fees" collected by tournament directors, calculated at a fixed rate based on the number of games played in a tournament. An annual club affiliation fee was also collected from club directors. This fee was discontinued in 2012.
As of June 2013, NASPA had more than 2,500 dues-paid members and almost the same number of lapsed members. 
NASPA organized the 2009 National Scrabble Championship tournament in Dayton, Ohio, the 2010 and 2011 events in Addison, Texas, the 2012 event in Orlando, Florida, and will host the 2013 Championship in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dash for Gas

The Dash for Gas was the significant shift by the newly privatized electric companies in the United Kingdom towards generation of electricity using natural gas during the 1990s. 
The key reasons for this shift were: (a) political: the privatisation of the UK electricity industry in 1990; the regulatory change that allowed gas to be used as a fuel for power generation; (b) economic: the high interest rates of the time, which favoured gas turbine power stations, which were quick to build, over coal and nuclear power stations, which were larger but slower to build; the decline in wholesale gas prices; the desire by the Regional Electricity Companies to diversify their sources of electricity supply and establish a foothold in the profitable generation market; (c) technical: advances in electricity generation technology (specifically Combined cycle Gas Turbine generators (CCGT) with higher relative efficiencies and lower capital costs. An underpinning factor in the dash for gas was the recent development of North Sea gas.
As at the end of 2010, the dash for gas was the last major transformational change to have happened to the UK’s energy system. In 1990, gas turbine power stations comprised 5% of the UK's generating capacity, by 2002 the new CCGT power stations comprised 28% of UK generating capacity with gas turbines comprising a further 2%. It is estimated the Dash for Gas cost £11bn.
Gas-fired power stations with more than 30 MW installed capacity commissioned between 1990 and 2002 are listed below.

Spring pancake

Spring-pancake () is a traditional Chinese food unique to the northern regions. People eat spring pancakes on the day called lichun to celebrate the beginning of the spring.
The spring pancake took its rise from the Jin dynasty and has prospered since the Tang dynasty. The lichun was valued by both Chinese ancient kings and civilians. Unlike kings’ great celebrations, civilians celebrated the lichun by eating spring pancakes wrapped around fresh vegetables and meat, which is called bite-the-spring. Bite-the-spring implies that civilians are praying for a good harvest year through eating the fresh vegetables and meat at the beginning of spring. In the Qing dynasty, spring pancakes became a fried pancake wrapped around a filling that included ham, chicken, pork, black dates, scallions, walnuts and sugar. In addition, spring pancakes were one of the nine desserts for the regal banquet of Qing dynasty.

Soederberghia is a genus of prehistoric lungfish that lived during the late Devonian period.
"Soederberghia" probably had a widespread range because fossils have been discovered in North America, Greenland and Australia.
The long-snouted "Soederberghia" shares many relationships with the lungfish "Rhynchodipterus".

The Dressmaker

The Dressmaker (US title The Secret Glass) is a gothic psychological novel written by Beryl Bainbridge. In 1973, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Like many of Bainbridge's earlier works, the novel is semi-autobiographical. In particular, the story was inspired by a relationship that she had with a soldier as a teenager. The characters of Nellie and Margo were based upon two of her paternal aunts.
Plot.
Set in Liverpool and Lancashire during World War II, a repressed dressmaker and her sister struggle looking after their 17-year-old niece, who is having a delusional affair with an American soldier.
Reception.
"The Dressmaker" was almost unanimously praised by critics. Karl Miller of the "New York Review of Books" called it "a magnificent book" about isolation and family strife. The Times Literary Supplement said that the novel was a "remarkable achievement ... Miss Bainbridge's imagination pushes her towards nightmare, and her eye for detail is macabre." 
Film adaptation.
The novel was adapted for film in 1988 by starring Jane Horrocks as Rita, Billie Whitelaw as Marge and Joan Plowright as Nellie. The screenwriter was John McGrath and Billie Whitelaw won the 1988 Evening Standard British Film Award for best actress for her role.

Society of Humanitarianism

[[File:Kolonistenwoning Willemsoor.jpg|thumb|300px|Colonists i
n Willemsoord.]]
The Society of Humanitarianism ("Maatschappij van Weldadigheid") was a Dutch private organization set up in 1818 by general Johannes van den Bosch to help poor families, mostly from the big cities, improve their lot in the aftermath of the Napoleonic French occupation by granting them farming land. He petitioned William I of the Netherlands for its formation and bought uncultivated land in Drenthe for the poor to exploit. The Estate 'Westerbeeksloot' in what is now Frederiksoord was the society's administrative center.
Free Colonies.
The Society then built permanent colonies consisting of small colony houses with a little ground. Those houses were regularly spaced along straight roads. The colonies I and II were later transformed into the village Frederiksoord, the other colonies to the villages Wilhelminaoord and Boschoord (in Southwest Drenthe) and Willemsoord (in Northwest Overijssel). Here were about 1400 families collected  in the period 1818-1911. To educate the population and safeguarding ofbad influences, the Society founded itsown schools and they implemented “'colony money”. That money did not exist long, but the schools do. In addition to elementary schools, the Society also founded  vocational training schools which operated from 1829 to 1859 as the  'Institute for Agriculture'  in Wateren and the  “Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” horticultural and forestry school in Frederiksoord and  the ”Gerard Adriaan van Swieten” Agricultural School in 1884 in Willemsoord .The foundation of these schools was made possible by a donation from the former major of cavalry,F.H. L.van Swieten. . The horticultural school moved to Meppel in November 2005.
Trial Colony.
Johannes van den Bosch went energetically to work. On August 25, 1818 - one week after the purchase of the property by the Estate Westerbeeksloot - he laid the foundation stone for the first settlers home. On October 29, 1818 the first families arrived in the colony, which was still a “trial colony” .A total of 52 families from all parts of the country"chosen"to participate in the experiment of Johannes van den Bosch. After four and a half years, there were still 42 families under the care of the Society of Humanitarianism . A large part of them lived their until their death Their adventures are described by Wil Schackmann in” De Proefkolonie”. 
Renegade Colonies.
Some, especially younger - ousted from the colony settled in the vicinity in hastily built sod huts and formed the so-called renegade-like colonies in Nijensleek,Vledderveen, North or South Wolde-Marijenkampen (at Steenwijk). 
Poverty Reduction in the 19th Century.
The Netherlands was severely depleted in the early nineteenth century, after the French domination. Many families lived in the cities and in the countryside in sorrowful situations. It has been the merit of Johannes van den Bosch, he recognized this problem and that he actually took steps to try to eradicate poverty. Eventually his project suffered depletion, because he always had to borrow to keep the Colonies in state money because of the disappointing yields. For the settlers, being placed in the so-called "free colonies" meant a great intervention in their lives. Many were from the big city 'transplanted' in an unfamiliar environment to them as the Drenthe countryside. Some managed to save well but others went back to the place of origin.The settler Peter Arends found that life in the colony was mirrored as being better than it really was. When he complained about this in a letter to his sister the director in charge of the colony (Benjamin van den Bosch, brother of John) got to hear about this and gave him in a big scolding from called him "a big stupid sloth. Eventually Arends was still able to become a free farmer in Ommerschans. 
Criticism of the colonies.
The initiative of Johannesvan den Bosch received the strongest criticism from conservative Christian angle. In particular, the Reveil movement felt that man was not allowed to intervene God’s designated plan. Dirk van Hogendorp, pupil of Willem Bilderdijk, who visited the colonies with his friend Jacobvan Lennep, feltt hat the Society of Humanitarianism,because it was not a religious organization, would not last long Also Isaac da Costa and Ottho Gerhard Heldringstraat were fierce fighters of the ideas of Van den Bosch. Int heir view, the poor and needy were part of society, so the rich and wealthy could show their mercy as a token of Christian charity.
Penal colonies.
Veenhuizen (second institution), now a museum in Veenhuizen and Ommerschans penal colonies were established. Vagrants and beggars were locked up here and put to work. But settlers could also settle here. The punishment was for alcohol abuse, sexual abuse, waste, brutality or desertion. In1859 the colonies were taken over by the Dutch state. In 1890 Ommerschans was closed.. Veenhuizen is now an ordinary prison.
From 1896 to 1901 the description sheet was introduced in Veenhuizen. The creator of this system was the Frenchman Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1917). He was of the opinion that that on basis of accurate measurements,the identity of the individual could be recorded.  On this simple theoretical principle Bertillon built a complicated identification method, in which body measurements were central. Because human individuals cannot be described in numbers only, additional descriptions on the description sheet were necessary.
Southern Netherlands.
Following the Drenthe colonies there were also colonies developed with similar initiatives in the Southern Netherlands . In Wortel a free colony in 1822 and in Merplas an unfree colony was founded by Johannes van den Bosch. The colony in Wortel was completely demolished after the Belgian Revolution. This location was a tramp institution established in 1881, which still has limited service as such today. The colony of Merksplas is now a prison and a center for rejected asylum seekers.
Present Day.
In the 20th century residential schools were established for unsocial s, which were only set up in the big cities. The Society for Humanitarians has been transformed into a foundation, whichis responsible for the management of 1400 acres culture and forest land, where under is a part of the National Park Drents-Friese Wold. In the museum “De Koloniehof”  in Frederiksoord the Society shows what life in the colonies was like. There is a database with the names of persons wh ohave lived as settlers or as officers in the colonies or who worked there.  In Veenhuizenis the National Prison Museum located in a former work institution at Oude Gracht 1.

William C. Rader

William C. Rader is a psychiatrist who administers injections of human fetal stem cells as what he calls therapeutic treatments for a variety of illnesses.
He graduated from the State University of New York in 1967 and was a psychiatrist for the Navy’s alcoholism treatment program until 1973.
Early programs.
He was a medical expert for KABC Eyewitness News in Los Angeles from 1977 to 1991. "Newsweek" called his 5 part debut on KABC about compulsive overeating "riveting". In 1981, Rader published a book titled "No Diet Program For Permanent Weight Loss". In 1992, he started the Survivor Program, an organization helping victims of sexual abuse. He founded the Immune Suppressed Institute in 1993, an HIV/AIDS treatment center, in Mexico City. He also ran a chain of eating disorder clinics.
Stem cells.
Rader first observed the human injection of fetal stem cells in 1994 at a Ukrainian clinic. In 1995, he started administrating fetal stem cells to his own patients. His original stem cell clinic was in the Bahamas, but the clinic reopened in the Dominican Republic after the Bahamanian government asked him to leave, following a critical television program aired in the United States. He has not published any results from his treatments in medical journals. 
Of his injection process, he says "I'm not telling a cell where to go, because I have no clue where it should go. This is nature, God's work. Whatever you want to call it." Dr. Evan Snyder responded "That's not a therapy, that's snake oil." In 2009, the BBC's current affairs program "Panorama" aired an episode in which they investigated claims of Rader's high pressure sales tactics. Rader has stated that he charges $25,000 for the initial treatment and $8,000 for each followup. In 2010, Rader self-published another book titled "Blocked in the USA: The Stem Cell Miracle".

Mountain Enterprise

The Mountain Enterprise is a weekly newspaper circulating in the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass in the San Emigdio Mountains region of California, midway between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. Its sister publication is "The New Mountain Pioneer," published monthly.
History.
The "Enterprise" was founded in 1966 by Nedra Hawley Cooper, whose first editions were produced on a blue Royal typewriter. After numerous owners, publishers and editors over the decades, in 2004 the management of Hometown Publishing, LLC and its publications "The Mountain Enterprise" and "The Mountain Pioneer" was assumed by Gary Meyer (Publisher) and Patric Hedlund (Editor). In November 2006 ownership of Hometown was taken over by Meyer, Hedlund and Pam Sturdevant with general management continuing under Meyer and Hedlund. In 2014 ownership passed to Meyer and Hedlund who remain its managers. It is today published in a tabloid format of between 28 and 36 pages weekly.
Awards.
In April 2011, The Mountain Enterprise won the California Newspaper Publishers Association (CNPA) 2010 First Place award for Best Website and First Place for Online Coverage.
In April 2010, The Mountain Enterprise won the California Newspaper Publishers Association (CNPA) First Place award for Best Website and First Place in Public Service for its 2009 ongoing coverage of a remote community's struggle to obtain firefighter-paramedic service.
The newspaper won awards from the National Newspaper Association on July 10 for (1) a series of investigative reports on the starvation of horses in Lockwood Valley (second place), (2) reporting on the struggle by Pine Mountain Club residents to secure Kern County's first firefighter-paramedic program (third place), (3) editorial writing about the newspaper's public-service responsibility in "The Stinkin' Public and Our School District's Brain Drain," by Patric Hedlund (honorable mention), and (4) an environmental story headed "Secret Negotiation between Tejon Developers and 'Big Green' Groups Sprouts Deal" (third place).
On July 14, the newspaper was given three awards for excellence by the California Newspaper Publishers Association, including first place for environmental reporting, first place for a newspaper website, and second place for public-service reporting.
Controversies.
In 2011, Lebec County Water District board member Julie McWhorter began demanding that The Mountain Enterprise reporters cease using flash photography during the district's public meetings. When the newspaper refused to stop taking flash photographs, McWhorter began claiming that the flashes were causing her medical problems. She also began claiming that California Government Code Section 54953.5 and 54953.6 gave her the right to stop the use of illuminated photography during LCWD's public meetings. The newspaper refused to cease its photography in the face of threats by McWhorter and board member Tony Venegas to "call the sheriff." Kern County Sheriff's Sergeant Mark Brown attended an LCWD meeting in June of 2013 and stated afterward that he believed the photography was appropriate for a public meeting. McWhorter chose not to run in the next election and Venegas ceased his threats against the newspaper.
In December 2010 the newspaper was the target of criticism by the Kern County Grand Jury for its coverage of a controversy regarding the destruction of heritage oak trees during the construction of a new Frazier Park county library. A jury committee said a "lack of communication" was responsible for the controversy and blamed that circumstance on "the people of the area and their newspaper, " adding that the "Enterprise" news articles "appear to be inaccurate and/or inadequately researched."
"The Mountain Enterprise" responded citing three statements made in the jury's report that the "Enterprise" says were false, and stating that the county's own arborist had told "The Mountain Enterprise" that the Grand Jury had not contacted him to corroborate the three claims made in the report. In an editorial, Meyer and Hedlund wrote that the jury made no attempt to contact them before issuing the report, which, they said, "attacks the citizens and the newspaper . . . with statements that are shocking in their shallowness.
In 2006, Pine Mountain property owner David Seidner and his attorney Jack Draper filed a lawsuit against "The Mountain Enterprise" for defamation, citing stories published in the newspaper during the 2005 campaign for the Pine Mountain Club Property Owners Association Board of Directors. Seidner's preferred candidates lost the election and he claimed that "The Mountain Enterprise" had made untrue statements about him in the course of its reporting about the campaign issues. Seidner also had claimed that the publisher and the editor (Gary Meyer and Patric Hedlund) of the newspaper had tampered with the ballot box in the election. "The Mountain Enterprise" filed an Anti-SLAPP 'motion to strike' with the court which required Seidner to demonstrate that his arguments had merit or risk paying the newspaper's attorney's fees. The suit was dropped immediately. The term "Anti-SLAPP" refers to a legal motion which protects the public from a "Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation."

Colin Gifford

Colin Telfer Gifford (born 1936) is a British railway photographer. Gifford pioneered the "New Approach" to railway photography in the 1960s during the declining years of steam. This approach relies heavily on abstraction and sought to encapsulate the dirty working atmosphere of the railway.
Early years.
Gifford is a Londoner, from Islington, though he later moved to Crawley in Sussex where his family held a catering concession at what was to become Gatwick Airport. As a child he had no particular interest in railways – though he lived within walking distance of Kings Cross station, he was never a locospotter. Instead, he would hover around the ticket barriers, fascinated by the ebb and flow of travellers and the bustle of station business as much as by the trains themselves. It was not until his student days in the late 1950s at Harrow School of Art that he found tangible expression for the visual possibilities that railways offered him. Though he was far more interested in illustration than in photography, he began taking shots of railway scenes around North London and especially along the ex-Great Central main line that passed through Harrow, gradually moving further afield as his new-found enthusiasm for railway photography began to take hold. The branch lines around his Sussex home were another fruitful hunting ground.
After college Gifford worked as a graphic designer in the West End advertising industry, often using his weekends and holidays to travel the country – by public transport wherever possible – to photograph railways. He preferred steam subjects, but unlike most contemporary photographers always took plenty of shots of diesel and electric traction.
Although Bill Brandt is often cited as a major influence, the style that made Gifford's name clearly owed much to the work of a man who is virtually unknown to British enthusiasts – the pioneering Swiss avant-garde railway photographer Jean-Michel Hartmann, whose book Magie du Rail (Editions Amart, 1959) revealed an eye for pattern and form that had a massive impact on Gifford's pictorial approach. Other than Hartmann, Gifford was always cagey about naming which, if any, railway photographers he particularly admired. O Winston Link was dismissed as 'too contrived' and 'pantomime' and he had even less time for the cosy coterie of British cameramen whose work – conventional in the extreme, obsessed with locomotives and of interest only to other enthusiasts – dominated the magazines of the 1950s and early 1960s. Gifford preferred to record things honestly and naturalistically, as he found them, much as the great Picture Post photojournalists had done. He firmly believed this was a way of making railway photography accessible to a far wider audience, although it would be many years before his approach was fully vindicated.
Working for Ian Allan.
In the early 1960s Gifford joined the publishing house of Ian Allan as art editor and began slipping the occasional railway photograph into the magazines he designed. He took many of his most famous shots – including some stunning images of Bulleid pacifics at speed, captured from trains on adjacent lines – during the course of his daily commute; thirty years later, one of these images would be featured on a Royal Mail stamp. At Shepperton he restyled many familiar publications, such as the Combined Volume (the Winter 1962-3 edition is now a design classic, with its yellow cover featuring a green 4-CEP emu) and the expanding Ian Allan magazine stable. He was instrumental in reshaping and reinvogorating the austerely academic Railway World and helping transform the enthusiast-focused Trains Illustrated into Modern Railways, a quality large-format monthly for transport professionals that was driven by a strong visual dynamic. In a branch of publishing that was increasingly falling prey to nostalgia, Gifford's imaginative photographs of the current scene brought excitement and a breath of fresh air – the 'new' Euston was a particular favourite in Modern Railways. Many Ian Allan pictorial albums from this period benefited from his visual flair and creative design. There were even some elaborately contrived trompe l'oeil covers for Model Railway Constructor, including a speeding Trix 'Warship' and a 00 gauge BR Standard Class 9F seemingly emitting an enormous plume of smoke.
Away from the Ian Allan design studio, Gifford continued to build a photographic record of every region of British Railways using a Rolleiflex medium-format twin-lens reflex camera. He was also busily photographing the full length of the River Thames with the idea of one day making a book out of it. His work was predominantly black and white and for 35mm colour work he used cheaper, less sophisticated cameras such as the Russian-made Fed; in later years a Pentax SLR joined the faithful Rolleiflex TLR.
All this creativity came together with the publication in 1965 of Decline of Steam. Its effect on British railway photography was nothing short of cataclysmic – certainly to an audience that, for the most part, had never seen the work of Jean-Michel Hartmann. In place of endless front three-quarter views (with the sun always coming over the photographer's shoulder and the locomotive number clearly visible) here were misty industrial landscapes, sweating railway workers, rainswept nocturnal platforms, sulphurous engine sheds. The trains themselves were often almost an afterthought in this vision of the railway as a totality; some images did not feature trains at all. The design and layout of the pictures (by Gifford himself) was at least as important as the subject.
All over Britain, Gifford was either hailed as the new Messiah or reviled by the old guard (who could never quite articulate why they were so uneasy with his work - contemptuously describing a photograph as 'an out of focus blur passing some grainy cooling towers' was about the limit of their critical evaluation). Soon popular magazines such as Railway World and Railway Magazine were offering an uncomfortable mixture of Gifford-inspired avant-garde (or what passed as avant-garde) and the traditional. By 1967, however, Gifford had left Ian Allan and devoted himself to photographing the final years of British steam virtually full-time, often in the company of his young protégé Ian Krause, another product of Harrow School of Art (it was Krause, rather than Gifford, who was behind the 'New Approach' photographic feature that first appeared in Railway World in 1966 and continued after Gifford's departure). This association introduced Gifford to the infamous MNA (Master Neverer's Association), a group of (mostly) Midlands-based photographers centred on the legendary Paul Riley, an ex-roadie and professional hellraiser. The endless overnight car journeys and inevitable ego clashes were not to Gifford's taste – he is a soft-spoken and unassuming man – and he returned to public transport and his own company for the final months of steam. He never did own a telephoto lens in steam days, although it became the hallmark of the Gifford-inspired 'New Approach' to railway photography that had featured in Railway World and reached its apotheosis in the Ian Allan album Steam Portfolio (1968). Style sometimes triumphed over substance but in the work of young photographers such as Malcolm Dunnett and Roderick Hoyle, Gifford's influence was unmistakable; in the book's static page layout, however, the absence of his subtle design skills was all too obvious.
Each a Glimpse . . . And Gone Forever.
The best of Gifford's prodigious output from these years found a place in Each a Glimpse, his second masterpiece, published by Ian Allan in 1970 and once again designed by Gifford himself; it sold for an unbelievable four guineas, a fair proportion of which was absorbed by the laminated plastic dustjacket. Many of the pictures dated from 1967 to 1968 and the influence of Jean-Michel Hartmann – almost overwhelming in Decline of Steam – was far less marked in a book that showed how, in those final years of steam, Gifford had begun to experiment with new techniques (possibly stimulated by his association with David Percival and other young photographers) and find his own visual language, less graphically dynamic and more pictorialist than before. Forty years on, those photographs of a long-vanished Britain have the poignancy and social relevance of films such as Billy Liar, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning or This Sporting Life. Their value is enhanced by the fact that very few Gifford photographs have ever been published twice – he was always careful to keep his work fresh and unlike most of his contemporaries, never allowed publishers to hang on to his photographs on the off-chance they might be used one day. He was (and continues to be) reluctant to allow his work to be published unless he has designed the page layouts himself.
Although he had amassed a collection of some 18,000 negatives between 1958 and 1968, with enough unpublished material (including his rarely glimpsed colour work) for many more books, Gifford's understandable fastidiousness about his work became something of a stumbling block. The Thames book failed to find a publisher, while sales of Steam Railways in Industry (Batsford, 1976) were disappointing, as was the reproduction quality. A projected seven-part region-by-region study with Ian Allan ground to a halt after just one volume, Steam Finale North (also 1976), had been published and Gifford was not best pleased when Ian Allan subsequently brought out Steam Finale Scotland, superficially a continuation of the series but in practice containing nothing by Gifford. Things had looked far more promising when, the previous year, Gifford had signed with New English Library (an American-owned company) to produce the companion-piece to Each a Glimpse, entitled And Gone Forever. With an eye on the export market and foreign co-editions, extensive use of colour was stipulated for the first time. A mock-up of And Gone Forever was presented at the 1976 Frankfurt Book Fair but the book was never, alas, to reach production, at least in the form Gifford and his publisher anticipated; deadlines came and went and though most of the design work was eventually completed, the contract was terminated in 1978 - a very different book of the same title finally appeared from Oxford Publishing Company in 1994, but without the colour photographs that had been promised 18 years earlier.
In that same year, Royal Mail published a set of five postage stamps featuring a selection of his photographs, chosen in collaboration with the designer Brian Delaney; as with all Royal Mail stamp issues, the designs were personally approved by the Queen. There was an exhibition at the National Postal Museum to mark the event, which included items such as Gifford's notebooks and treasured Rolleiflex camera. Gifford had by then moved to Hertfordshire – and learned to drive – but for the next decade and a half little was seen of his work, other than occasional magazine articles and the odd small exhibition.
Beyond 2000.
By the end of the 'noughties', however, rumours began to emerge of a new, revised edition of Each a Glimpse with enhanced, digitally scanned images taken from the original negatives. The old rifts having evidently healed, Ian Allan would once again be the publisher but at the time of writing (March 2011) nothing concrete had emerged and there were suggestions that no formal contract had yet been signed. Another distinct possibility was an album of Gifford's colour work, based around a stunning set of around 100 images that had been exhibited at Kidderminster Railway Museum in 2009 under the title 'In the Wink of an Eye'. There was even mention of the River Thames book once again but, as ever with this gifted and charismatic photographer, only Gifford himself can know what the ultimate course of events will be.

Superga (brand)

Superga is an Italian brand of shoes founded in 1911. It originally made tennis shoes, including the famous model "2750 Classic" but then diversified.
History.
Superga was born in 1911 in Torino, Italy, when Walter Martiny started production of rubber-soled footwear marked with the Superga logo. In 1925 Superga invented the 2750 model, shoes with vulcanized rubber soles. From 1934, the firm diversified its production to new collections dedicated to other sports and daily life.
After WWII, Superga restarted production specializing solely in the production of high quality footwear.
In 1951 the firm merged with Pirelli, which brought it new funds and made it possible to sharply increase the production of tennis shoes.
In the 1970s, as the sales of the 2750 continued, Superga diversified to add sport shoes with technical attributes. In the 1980s, the firm launched the production of clothes. As of 2011, Steve Madden corporation acquired the license to sell, market, and distribute Superga products in North America. Shortly thereafter, he engaged former Full House stars Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen to join the brand as creative directors for Superga in the US.
In 2012 the girls launched a collection of Superga shoes as a collaboration with their luxe ready-to-wear line, The Row, in conjunction with the opening of a Superga Store in New York City.
Styles.
Superga now offers a wide range of colors, fabrics, and prints each season for women, men, and kids. Apart from the original Superga Vulcanized and Sport lines or "2750 Cotu Classic", the collections include Superga City leather and Superga Country rubber rain and outerwear boots.
Stores.
Superga has stores in the United States, Europe and South Africa; sales are assured in other countries by other stores. Superga makes sales available through premium department stores, specialty retailers, and online stores along with direct selling on www.Superga-USA.com. Superga opened its first store in the United Kingdom in Covent Garden in June 2011. Followed by its first US store in the Soho neighborhood of NYC in May 2012.

Maria Gertrudis Barceló

Maria Gertrudis "Tules" Barceló (circa 1800 – January 17, 1852), commonly known as "La Tules," was a saloon owner and master gambler in the Territory of New Mexico at the time of the U.S.-Mexican War. Barceló amassed a small fortune by capitalizing on the flow of American and Mexican traders involved with the nineteenth-century Santa Fe Trail. She became infamous in the U.S. as the Mexican "Queen of Sin" through a series of American travel writings and newspaper serials before, during, and after the war. These depictions, often intended to explain or justify the U.S. invasion of Mexico, presented La Tules as a madame and prostitute who symbolized the supposedly immoral nature of the local Mexican population.
Early life.
Barceló may have been born in the state of Sonora, Mexico around 1800 but one correspondent of the time, Wilkins Kendall of the "New Orleans Picayune", argued in his book "Narrative of the Texas—Santa Fe Expedition" that she was French, referring to her as Madame Toulouse. Not much is known about her early life or her family. Shortly after Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, Barceló, her parents, a brother, and two sisters moved to the remote northern territory of New Mexico.
On June 23, 1823 Barceló married Manuek Sisneros at the Church of Tome. The priest who performed the ceremony referred to her as "Doña," a title given to women of quality and high social standing. Much attention would later be given to the fact that she was four years older than her groom and four or five months pregnant at the time. The couple had two sons, both of whom died as infants. Fiercely independent, Barceló retained all of her own property throughout her marriage and was known by her maiden name.
Early Gambling Career.
In 1825, Mexican authorities fined Barceló for operating a gambling salon for miners in the Ortiz Mountains. Sometime over the next ten years, Barceló relocated to Santa Fe and opened a more ambitious saloon at the center of Santa Fe, New Mexico. She went by the nickname "Tules," a Spanish diminutive of "Gertrudis." Some authors have connected this to the Mexican Spanish word "tules", meaning "reeds," with suggestions that it referred to "the curvaceousness of her figure" or possibly to "her thin frame."
Contact with Euro-Americans.
Because of its centrality in Santa Fe, Barceló's saloon entertained many Americans traveling the Santa Fe Trail. Susan Magoffin, grand-daughter of Kentucky's first governor and the bride of an American trader, was perhaps Barceló's greatest critic. She wrote the La Tules "made her living by running a house where open gambling, drinking, and smoking were enjoyed by all...with no thought of being socially degraded." Some drank her liquor and gambled at her tables, but later reviled "Doña Tules" in writings sent to the Eastern U.S. Typical of many, Josiah Gregg's widely read "Commerce of the Prairies" described Tules as a woman of "loose habits."." In addition to erroneous assertions that she was a prostitute, many also claimed that she was having an illicit affair with Manuel Armijo, the Governor of New Mexico.
These sensational accounts were often embellished, if not totally fabricated. Most of the American descriptions of Tules Barceló contradicted each other. Some claimed she was astoundingly beautiful, while others wrote of her as old and toothless. Some said she had coal-black hair, while others said she had a shock of red hair. Some mistakenly claimed that she had been born in Taos, New Mexico rather than Sonora. The only real agreement among them was that Tules excelled at the card game monte, often winning vast piles of gold from the male customers in her saloon.
Barceló probably did not know about her infamy in English-language publications. She carefully guarded her good name in Santa Fe. On two occasions in the 1830s, Barceló went to court to defend herself against slanderous comments from her Mexican neighbors.
Despite her negative reputation among Americans and the alleged source of her "ill-gotten" fortune, the U.S. Army borrowed funds from Barceló shortly after the invasion of New Mexico in 1846. This loan paid the invading troops, making the continued occupation of Santa Fe possible. She's also been credited with exposing a conspiracy against the Army and thereby preventing a massacre.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Barceló, like the other Mexican citizens in the territory, automatically became a U.S. citizen in 1849 by simply having waited a year after the treaty's signing.
Death.
Barceló died on January 17, 1852 in Santa Fe with a remarkable fortune of $10,000 and several houses. Her will and a deed dictated to a local magistrate are the only documents known to have been written by her. She left her residence and property to her brother, her sister, and two young girls who had lived with her. All of Santa Fe attended her elaborate funeral, which was criticized by some for being too fancy for a woman like her, and for being financed by "ill-gotten gain."
Legacy.
Novelists, historians, and even performers have been drawn to Barceló's legend. Far from being historically accurate, most of the representations of her since 1852 have been influenced by ahistorical or racist assumptions. Anna Burr presented Tules as a manipulative trickster in the 1936 novel "The Golden Quicksand."
In 1948 Ruth Laughlin wrote the novel "The Wind Leaves No Shadow" with Barceló as the protagonist. While Laughlin clearly intended to be sympathetic to Barceló, racist assumptions nonetheless guided the novel's content. Except Barceló, the Mexicans in Laughlin's novel conform to stereotypes as jealous, superstitious, lustful, or even as outright murderers. 
The life of Dona Tules has also been told in the musical "Viva Santa Fe!", which was first presented in Hobbs, New Mexico in 1991 and then at the 1992 World Fair in Spain.

Scotland's Story

"Scotland's Story" is book by Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall first published in 1906 in the United Kingdom and in 1910 in the United States. It was reissued in 2005. It is about the history of Scotland, and it also has some legends having to do with Scotland. In more recent times the book has been described as "replete with British imperial iconography".
"Scotland's Story" starts off with the legend of Prince Gathelus, and it ends with King George IV. It ended here because as Marshall says in the book "And here I think I must end, for Scotland has no more a story of her own — her story is Britain's story."
Some of the stories this book includes are those of Macbeth, William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, and the Stewart kings, but there are many more.
The book's depiction of William Wallace, which describes him as paving the way for the union of Scotland with England, has been described as a "romanticised illustration" not "based on any idea of historical reality".

Itapiranga, Santa Catarina

Itapiranga is the westernmost municipality in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina.
Minority language.
Itapiranga was initially settled around 1920 by German speakers from what was known in German as the "Altkolonie", or the eastern region of Rio Grande do Sul where immigrants from the Hunsrück and other regions of Germany had started to establish themselves starting in 1824. Therefore, the primary language in this area was Riograndenser Hunsrückisch for many years; however, since the 1960s the Portuguese language, Brazil's national language, has gained preference amongst most inhabitants. Itapiranga shares a similar history with many towns in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, where the same migratory patterns occurred. In the recent years there is an increasing effort to preserve the local minority Brazil's minority languages.
The Brazilian linguist Cléo Vilson Altenhofen was born and grew up in Harmonia, Rio Grande do Sul; he is a native speaker of Riograndenser Hunsrückisch. As such, he co-wrote together with linguist Jaqueline Frey, also a native speaker of this dialect and a native to Itapirange, Santa Catarina, and he personally delivered a historic speech before congress in Brasília, revindicating better minority language public policies for the country. Here is a section of that original text: "In mein Gemeind in Itapiranga, Santa Catarina, hott’s eenfach net die Chance gebb, in de Schul Deitsch se lenne - ich menne hiemit Hochdeitsch ..." (Translation: In my community in Itapiranga, Santa Catarina, there was no opportunity to learn German - by that I mean High German).

Oviri (Gauguin)

Oviri (Savage in Tahitian) is a ceramic sculpture created from partially glazed stoneware by the French artist Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) in the winter of 1894/95. The work depicts the Goddess Oviri, a Tahitian deity of death and mourning, whose name translates as "savage" or "wild". She is shown strangling a blood stained wolf cub at her hip, while another wolf lies dead under her feet.
Gauguin often used the epithet of Oviri for himself; he saw himself as a "civilised savage" and referred to this sculpture as "La tueuse", "The Killer". Shortly before he died he wrote, "I am a savage. And the civilized feel it from the outset: because in my work there is nothing which surprises or ... am a savage in spite of myself." 
Ultimately, a later version of the sculpture became Gauguin's grave monument.
Background.
Primarily a painter, Gauguin came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught the craft by the French potter Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909). Félix Bracquemond had introduced Chaplet to Gauguin who, stimulated by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886-7, Gauguin attended the Vaugirard studio and with Chaplet created some 55 stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed. The venture was intended to function as an extra source of income, and though he declared it one of the best works he has produced, it did not sell, and was to be his final ceramic. 
Description.
Gauguin's Oviri has long blond / grey hair which reaches to her knees. Her head is disproportionately large, as are her eyes, while she has adolescent breasts. She is depicted clutching a wolf cub to her hip, which she appears to be strangling, intended as a symbol of her wild power, and more abstractly, the indifference of nature. A second animal, likely another wolf, is shown at her feet either curling in submission or dead; according to some art historians this may represent Gauguin himself. 
Gauguin described the character of the woman as "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow". According to the art historian Christopher Gray (1915-1970), the sculpture represents "the expression of Gauguin's profound disillusionment and discouragement". Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891, and was taken by the beauty of Tahitian women and set about painting a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. Evoking a sense of both melancholy and death, Gauguin intended his portraits to conjure the Tahitian state of "faaturuma", or resignation; imagery he later called upon for his Oviri ceramic. It is likely that he modeled this work from a wood carving. Gauguin also made several woodcuts depicting the goddess, as well as an 1894 self-portrait in patinated plaster entitled "Oviri (Savage)". 
In 2000, a bronze version of the work cast circa 1950-1960 sold at Christie's for US$64,625. Today, the original 1894 stoneware sculpture is in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

List of Washington Senators Opening Day starting pitchers

Two American League baseball franchises have borne the name "Washington Senators". The first franchise was one of the teams that was originally part of the American League when it became a Major League in 1901. That franchise moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season, becoming the Minnesota Twins. It was replaced by a new Washington Senators franchise in 1961. That franchise moved to Arlington, Texas after the 1971 season, becoming the Texas Rangers. The Washington Senators played in four home ball parks over their history. They started in American League Park and moved to American League Park II in 1903. In 1911, they moved to Griffith Park, where they remained until 1962. In 1962, they moved to District of Columbia Stadium, which was later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.
The 1901-1960 franchise won 32 Opening Day games against 28 losses. The 1961-1971 franchise won two Opening Day games and lost nine. So in total, the Washington Senators won 34 Opening Day games and lost 37. The 1901-1960 franchise had a record in Opennig Day games at home of 26 wins and 21 losses.

Crushed red pepper

Crushed red pepper is made from hot dried red peppers and is not made of one type of chili, but from various combinations of ancho, bell, cayenne and other dried red peppers. Crushed red pepper shakers have become as standard as salt and pepper on tables at Italian style restaurants and especially pizza parlors in the United States. Often there is a high ratio of seeds, which some people believe intensifies the heat of this flavorful condiment, whereas the heat actually comes from the vein of the pepper (pith) (off of which the seeds grow). Crushed red pepper is used in pickling, chowders, spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, soups and sausage. As chilis have become more popular, the varieties of peppers used to make crushed red pepper have also changed.

Sam Jennings

Samuel "Sam" Jennings (26 December 1898 – 21 August 1944) was an English footballer and football manager. A tall player, he was a goal-scoring centre-forward, with a ratio of a goal every two games.
After playing for various amateur sides, he joined Norwich City in 1919, moving on to Middlesbrough the following year. In 1921 he signed with Reading, where he would make his name over a three year stay with 45 goals in 110 league games. After a season with West Ham United, he signed with Brighton & Hove Albion in 1925. Again prolific, he scored 61 goals in 110 games, and won a transfer to Nottingham Forest in 1928. Moving on to Port Vale in 1929, he bagged 42 goals in 63 league games. In the 1930s he enjoyed short spells at Stockport County and Burnley, before settling in France with Olympique de Marseille and Club Français. He later returned to England to turn out for non-league sides Scarborough and Wisbech Town.
After retiring as a player he took charge at Glentoran in 1936, before taking charge of Rochdale the following year. He also served a coach across France and England.
Playing career.
Jennings played for Highbury Vale Methodists, Basford United, 5th Reserve Battalion Coldstream Guards, and Basford National Ordnance Factory, before joining Norwich City in 1919. The "Canaries" finished 12th in the Southern League in 1919–20. He then moved on to Middlesbrough, and scored twice in ten First Division appearances in 1920–21. Jennings then signed with Reading, who went on to finish the 1921–22 campaign 13th in the Third Division South. The "Royals" then dropped to 19th and 18th in 1922–23 and 1923–24. In his three years at Elm Park he scored 45 goals in 110 league games.
He returned to the top-flight with West Ham United, but was limited to three goals in nine games in 1924–25. He quickly returned to the Third Division South with Brighton & Hove Albion, who posted a fifth place finish in 1925–26. He finished as the club's top scorer in 1926–27 and 1927–28 with 20 and 27 goals respectively, as the "Seagulls" finished in fourth position.

He scored four goals in an 8–2 thrashing of Bradford Park Avenue on 22 September 1930, and ended up with 17 goals in 32 games in 1930–31 to become club's leading marksman for a second successive campaign. He hit two goals on the opening day of the 1931–32 season, in a 3–1 win over Plymouth Argyle at Home Park. He would train by throwing the ball up the pitch and race his greyhound to where it landed.

<doc id="21642965" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21642965" title="Saint Canius">
Saint Canius

Saint Canius ( or "San Canione") was a Roman Catholic bishop and martyr, and patron saint of the cities of Calitri, Acerenza and its archdiocese. He may have been a descendant of the Roman "gens Cania".
Life and persecution.
The principal source of information on the life of Canius is the "Passio San Canionis", a document preserved in Acerenza Cathedral.
According to this, Canius was born in Iulia (near Carthage) in the first half of the 3rd century and later became bishop of Acerenza. During the Persecution of Diocletian he refused in the presence of the prefect Pigrasius to worship idols and to acknowledge the divinity of the Emperor. He was thereupon put to torture and then imprisoned, on the assumption that hunger and his injuries would erode his resistance. He continued nevertheless to proclaim the Gospel and with his words and long-suffering converted to Christianity all who came near him.
When the prisoner's resistance was reported to him the prefect ordered him to be decapitated. A violent storm accompanied by an earthquake scattered the soldiers, and in the confusion Canius, with some of the faithful, was able to escape in a boat to Volturno.
Miracles.
At Atella (on the site of the present hamlet of Sant'Arpino), where he preached the Gospel, many miracles were attributed to him. In the amphitheatre of Atella, a man was healed in the middle of a heart attack by the touch of Canius' hand; a blind woman named Eugenia regained her sight; and a boy was cured of demonic possession.
When he was old and ill, Canius retired to a hermitage, where he died. Bishop Elpidius, when he learnt miraculously of Canius' death, built a little shrine on the site to protect the saint's body.
Veneration.
In about 800 bishop Leone of Acerenza built a cathedral on the ruins of an old shrine and translated the body of Canius there from Atella. In 1080, according to the chronicler Lupo Protospata, the body of Canius was re-discovered, and the newly rebuilt cathedral and diocese were put under his protection. 
In 1543, on the occasion of a pastoral visit by Cardinal Saraceni it was observed that it was not possible to see the body of Saint Canius, because it was under a large altar.
In the ambulatory of the present Acerenza Cathedral beneath the altar of Saint Canius his crozier is still preserved, a relic which is displayed and venerated, and considered as a testimony to the Diocese of Acerenza's calling to the mission of evangelisation.
Saint Canius is also venerated in the parish that bears his name, San Canione in Sant'Arpino, in the province of Caserta, where an ancient structure, now known as the "Romitorio di San Canione", is dedicated to him. It is believed to be an ancient Christian oratory of the Atellan era, and seems to have been the place where Canius' body was preserved before its translation to Acerenza.

David Riley

David Sidney Riley (born 8 December 1960) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder and striker, making 190 league appearances in a nine-year career in the Football League, scoring 40 goals.
He began his career at Nottingham Forest in 1983, and had loan spells at Darlington and Peterborough United, before joining Port Vale for £20,000 in October 1987. In March 1990 he was sold on to Peterborough United for £40,000, and helped the club to two successive promotions into the Second Division. He later played for Kettering Town, Ponsonby (in New Zealand), Boston United, and King's Lynn.
Playing career.
Riley played for Keyworth United before turning professional with Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in June 1983. He played 12 First Division games for the club between April 1984 and 1987, scoring two goals. He was loaned out to Darlington in February 1987, and played six Third Division games for Cyril Knowles' side, scoring two goals. He joined Fourth Division side Peterborough United on loan in 1987, and played twelve league games under Noel Cantwell, scoring two goals.
He joined Third Division club Port Vale in October 1987, manager John Rudge splashing out £20,000.
