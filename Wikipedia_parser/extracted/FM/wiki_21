Pamela Peck

Pamela Peck Wan-kam (, born circa 1944) was a Hong Kong radio agony aunt and celebrity and now a member of Wan Chai District Council. Since 1989 she has been the partner of 'celebrity' lawyer and legislator Paul Tse.
Early life.
Peck came to Hong Kong from China when she was three months old. Her dad died and her mother could not support her, so she went to live with her mother’s sister, accompanied by her wet nurse.
She says that her uncle was 'dissolute' and would often bring girlfriends home. But her aunt befriended them so that they left.
Peck was seen by social welfare officers. At around age 15, she ran away with a boyfriend, missing her HKCEE exams.
Career.
She became a flight attendant and hosted radio programmes when not flying. Three years later she went back to school, and later studied TV broadcasting at the graduate school of San Francisco State University.
Her name was made with the launch of her talk show 'Heart To Heart' in 1986. She was known as the 'Queen of Late Night Radio' for her on-air relationship advice.
(Later), on her radio show "Talk of the Town" people discussed their love lives openly on air, to which she gave typically pithy but practical advice.
Conviction and imprisonment for tax evasion.
On 19 April 2001, Peck was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to three months in prison. She had forged meal receipts and employee salary records to evade $210,000 in profits tax.
She had pleaded guilty to four counts of assisting Platinum Promotion Ltd with intent to evade tax between 1994 and 1998 - effectively four taxation years - by signing fraudulent returns. She held 99.9 per cent of the shares in the company.
Peck served her sentence, at Tai Lam Centre for Women, a low-security prison. While serving her sentence, she was not allowed to contribute to any of the various publications for which she wrote columns.
Since the mid-1990s she has been the partner of 'celebrity' lawyer and legislator Paul Tse. Tse is also her legal representative.

Animated Series.
This fourth version of Makeshift first appeared in the episode "Con Job", where he impersonated the Autobot Wheeljack. He assumed Wheeljack's appearance after Soundwave downloaded his appearance and personal history to infiltrate the Autobot base and reveal its location. However, Bulkhead, Wheeljack's best friend, sensed that something was off and tricked Makeshift into slipping up by making him retell a battle that he wasn't present for. Exposed, Makeshift is forced to take Miko hostage. But just as he activated the Groundbridge for the Decepticons to invade, the real Wheeljack, having broken out of captivity, bursts in and defeats Makeshift. Bulkhead then tossed Makeshift through the Groundbridge, right onto the Decepticon warship Nemesis. But before Makeshift could tell Starscream the location of the Autobot base, the bomb strapped to his hip (which was activated by Wheeljack) exploded, apparently destroying Makeshift.

Portrait of Pope Pius VII

The Portrait of Pope Pius VII is an 1805 portrait of Pope Pius VII by the French painter Jacques-Louis David to thank the pope for assisting at the coronation of Napoleon I of France. Pope Pius appears in David's "The Coronation of Napoleon", depicted as blessing the emperor, when in fact he was merely a spectator, assisting at the ceremony with a resigned expression throughout.
History.
The painting seems to have been commissioned by Count Charles Fleurieu, Quartermaster General for the French emperor, though no written mention of a commission survives. It was painted at the Tuileries around the end of February 1805 from life. David seems to have been won over and impressed by Pius's simplicity and deep humanity, choosing to show him in an introspective pose rather than as the most powerful prelate in Christianity. He was paid 10,000 francs for his work and the portrait was exhibited in the Gallery of the French Senate at its seat in the Château du Luxembourg and then assigned to the Musée Napoléon (now known as the Louvre). It was displayed again at the Château in 1824 before being returned to its permanent home in the Louvre in 1827.
David produced three copies of the portrait, assisted by one of his students (probably Georges Rouget), two of which were commissioned by Napoleon for the Musée de Fontainebleau and for the Musée du Château de Versailles. David held onto the third copy and took it with him during his exile to Brussels, and which is now lost.
Description.
Vertical in format and with a brown background, the painting shows Pius three-quarter-length seated on a red velvet chair embroidered in gold. He has a peaceful expression and wears a white zucchetto, a white rochet or tunic (of which only the sleeves can be seen), a red velvet pelerine-type camail with ermine cuffs and a red stole with gold embroidery. Pius's arms rest on the chair's arms and his right hand holds a paper on which is written in Latin "Pio VII Bonarium Artium Patron" ("Pius VII, Patron of the Fine Arts"). The painting is signed top left with LUD. DAVID PARISIIS 1805.

James Phang Wah

James Phang Wah, born 1961, is a convicted felon currently serving a jail term. Before his arrest and conviction, he was the founder and "international president" of the now-defunct multi-level marketing firm, Sunshine Empire, an unlicensed 'investment' company that was in fact a Ponzi scheme.
Controversial claims.
During media interviews, Phang described himself as a legend and 'better than Warren Buffett'. However, his name has never appeared on the List of Singaporeans by net worth, which lists all the billionaires and millionaires in Singapore. It is also not known whether James Phang Wah has met Warren Buffett. In addition, Phang also claimed to have over one million students worldwide and to control more than US$300 million (S$439 million) in assets. Before his arrest and conviction, Phang emphasised that he 'would not harm anyone and my businesses are legal'. He also claimed that in his seminars, his loyal participants would also shout "Father, I love you!".
As Phang's name did not appear on "Singapore's 40 Richest" list from Forbes in 2007 and 2008, his claims to personal success and wealth is therefore highly improbable.
Commercial Affairs Department investigation.
Phang was investigated by Commercial Affairs Department in November 2007, two months after the Monetary Authority of Singapore placed Sunshine Empire on the investor alert list.
On 2 February 2009, Phang, his wife and Hoo were arrested and were remanded overnight. They were subsequently released on bail of $600,000 each and their passports impounded. They were driven away in a convoy of Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. He was addressed as 'Lao Da' ('chief' in Mandarin) as he got into his car.
On 3 February 2009, Phang, with three others including Jackie Hoo Choon Cheat, a director of Sunshine Empire were charged with fraudulent trading, failure to maintain proper accounting records of Sunshine Empire and criminal breach of trust as an agent of Sunshine Empire.
Phang faced six charges of falsification of Sunshine Empire’s accounts and one charge of false declaration of the share capital of Empire Communications Technology Pte Ltd. He also faced three charges for possession of uncensored and obscene films at his Westwood Avenue home.
His wife, Neo Kuon Huay, a director of Empire Emall (S) Pte Ltd faced six charges of falsification of Sunshine Empire’s accounts under Section 477A of the Penal Code and one charge of false declaration of the share capital of Empire Emall (S) Pte Ltd.
Phang, with three others, are claimed trial with Subhas Anandan representing all four.
On 16 July 2010, Phang and Hoo were found guilty of perpetuating fraud and criminal breach of trust. Phang and his wife were also found guilty of falsifying accounts. On 30 July 2010, Phang has been sentenced to nine years' jail and fined $60,000 while his wife was also fined $60,000.
Personal life.
Phang is married to Neo Kuon Huay. He has four children.

Deflection (chess)

Deflection in chess is a tactic that forces an opposing piece to leave the square, rank or file it occupies, thus exposing the king or a valuable piece. It is typically used in the context of a combination or attack, where the deflected piece is critical to the defence. Deflection may be used as a gambit to cause an opponent's piece to move to a less suitable square.
Deflections are often used as part of a combination which may involve other types of chess tactics as well.
If the deflected piece happens to be an overworked piece then the opponent's defense instantly crumbles, making victory imminent to the one who employed the deflection.

Fort Anjediva

Fort Anjediva, built on the Anjadip Island, off the coast of the Indian state of Karnataka but under the administrative jurisdiction of the Indian state of Goa, was once under Portuguese rule. It has also in its vicinity an ancient church on the island called the Church of Our Lady of Springs built in 1505. The Chapel of St Francis D’Assissi is also located here but it is in ruins. Though the fort has a rich history linked to Portuguese rule, it is also presently in ruins. Both the fort and the church are located in the island of Anjadip, which covers an area of .
Anjediv—the name means "fifth island"—(see image in infobox), is the largest of an archipelago of five islands (known as the Panchdiva chain of five islands); the other four islands are the Kurnagal, the Mudlingud, the Devgad and the Devragad. Because of its strategic importance in the seafaring route to India and also as a watering destination for ships, a fort was built on this island by the Portuguese to enhance their military presence and control of trade route.
The fort island was also known as Agiadvipa (clear butter), Angedvpa (some isles), Agadvipa (derivative from goddess Aja) and Adiadvipa (Ancient Island). It was called Aigidias by the Greek geographer Ptolomey. Etymology of Anjediv is also attributed to the name of the local Goddess "Ajadurga Devi".
History.
In March 1505, Dom Francisco de Almeida came to India as Portuguese monarch Emanuel's Viceroy and was the first permanent representative in the East. He had a “Regimento” or mandatory orders to establish four forts in India, which included the fort at Anjadip island, off the West Coast of India (the other three forts were proposed at Cannanore, Cochin and Quilon) where seafaring merchant vessels from Greece, Arabia, Egypt, and Portugal would stop for water on their way to and from the East carrying valuable goods, such as spices from India.
The decision to build the fort was dictated by the fact that Vasco da Gama had stopped on this island in 1498, on his return from Calicut to Portugal, (after exploring the sea route to India) not only to repair his ships but also to collect water from the springs on the island (considered of good water quality). He had again stopped here in 1502. It is stated that Vasco Da Gama had appreciated, from his earlier visits to this island, that Angediva would be a good place not only to collect fresh and safe water but would also be a perfect safe site for docking ships during the south west monsoon season in India. In fact, Vasco Da Gama and Gaspar da Gama (a Jewish trader who was converted to Christianity in Cochin) recommended to the King of Portugal to establish a naval fort at Angediva, which eventually could help Portuguese to get control of the neighbouring island of Goa. 
Almeida took up the task of building the fort so seriously that he even declined an invitation from King of Bisnaga (Vijayanagara), a staunch ally of the Portuguese. As soon as he landed in Angedipa on 13 September 1505, he started building the fort with enthusiasm. The Vijayanagara emperor or his local vassal, the chieftain of Gerosopa, did not object to the fort building activity. Construction materials such as timber, cane, palm leaves and lime were readily supplied by the local people. An ancient temple on the island is said to have been demolished to extract stones for use on the fort. Its completion time has been recorded variously; as 21 days and also as three months. It was also claimed that during excavations of the foundations for the fort a stone bearing a Cross was found, which was interpreted to mean that the island was once a habitat of Christians. 
Further, the hydrographic conditions at the island location of about length, and from its shore to the Karwar head southwards, favoured building a safe fort as water depth of in the channel between the fort wall and the shore line was noted. At the outer sea side of the fort, the water depth was reported to be . A further away, the depth of water was reportedly .
The fort wall was built on barren and rocky surface and fortified by towers. The fort was built at a huge cost, as it provided military defence fortifications to defend the Portuguese colonial interests in India. The fort walls were mostly built with clay and stone, since there was shortage of lime stone and other materials on the island. Still, the fort as built was considered a good base for the military exchanges with the enemy. The military operations launched from this location helped Almeida subdue initial enemies like Timoja (a Hindu privateer who served the Vijayanagara Empire and later became of great help for the Portuguese). Subsequently, when Adil Shah of Bijapur attacked with a large force, there was intense bombardment and fierce strategic attacks in which the Viceroy’s son D. Lourenço also took part. After four days of intense fighting, Adil Shah of Bijapur retreated. But in the bargain, the Portuguese had suffered losses and even Almeida was injured. Subsequent to this victory, there was a rethink on the utility of the fort as a defence structure and was, therefore, abandoned. But a story that Almeida demolished the fort in 1506, as it was built on 13 September, an inauspicious day, is not borne out by the fact that the fort was revived as a Portuguese defence establishment during Viceroy Albuquerque’s (successor to Almeida) time and the fort ruins are still seen in the island. The decision to abandon the fort in 1506 was because the garrisons were better placed at Cannnaore and Cochin forts, which could ensure adequate protection to the trade. Another factor considered in abandoning the fort was on account of maintenance problems (operating from Cochin as the base), bad weather here and fear of enemy attack from Goa.
After the fort was built, Portuguese used it mainly as a military establishment and as a regular watering stop for their ships.
The fort was refurbished in 1682 by the Viceroy Count of Alvor. It was populated by about 600 people with facilities of a seminary, a Jesuit college and a Portuguese school. In 1768, it was under the administrative control of a governor when 350 people lived here. In 1812, the inhabitants counted 782 (including convicts). But, when the fear from any kind of enemy threat receded, in 1843 the Portuguese abandoned the fort once again.
Anjediva fort, when it was a Portuguese territory, was used by the Christians and Hindus of the mainland as a refuge during the invasion by the coastal kingdom of Bednore, and by Tipu Sultan. 
The island and the fort became a part of India on December 19, 1961, with the success of "Operation Vijay", a military operation in which the Portuguese were evicted from their colony in Goa, as well as their other Indian colonies.
Archaeological findings.
Excavations carried out in the area by the Department of Archaeology and Museums (Goa) has revealed pillars, stones, pots of the 11th and 12th century with the artistic work of Kadambas and Chalukyas. From this, it has been inferred that the findings could be the remnants of the ruined temple of goddess Aryadurga Devi.
Access.
The Fort on the island is located south of Baticala, the ancient kingdom of Garsopa, the present day Karwar. Karwar is approached conveniently by road on the National Highway NH 17. From Karwar, a causeway leads to the Officers (Sea Bird) gate and then to the historic fort. In the past, the approach involved a seaward journey of one hour by trawlers and then by a canoe to the island. It is also approachable by boat ride from the Binga beach.

The Kid Stakes

The Kid Stakes is a 1927 Australian silent black and white comedy film written and directed by Tal Ordell. 
The screenplay is based on characters created by Syd Nicholls in his comic strip, "Fatty Finn". 
Plot summary.
Fatty Finn (Robin 'Pop' Ordell) is the six-year-old leader of a gang of kids in Woolloomooloo. They enter Fatty's pet goat Hector in the annual goat derby, but his rival Bruiser Murphy (Frank Boyd) lets the goat loose before the race. After a series of adventures, Fatty finds the runaway goat and persuades a friendly aviator to fly him to the race-track in time for the main event.
Production.
The majority of the shooting locations for "The Kid Stakes" were in Woolloomooloo and Potts Point in Sydney. 
The film's finale, the goat race, however was filmed in Rockhampton in Queensland, because goat racing was illegal in New South Wales. 
The role of Fatty Finn was played by Tal Ordell's six-year-old son Robin, known as 'Pop' Ordell. 
Reception.
The film premiered at the Wintergarden Theatre in Brisbane on 9 June 1927.The now defunct weekly magazine, Pix, in its review states "Kid Stakes brings back the Sydney of the 1920s. They were all on parade; the ragged urchins, the brawling and the free-fisted characters of the waterfront." 
Ordell sold the remake rights to England and had discussions to make a talking version in 1930. However this did not eventuate and Ordell never directed another feature.
Robin Ordell went on to become a star of Sydney radio in the 1930s. He then joined the Royal Australian Air Force and won a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). He was killed over the Netherlands in 1945 at about the age of 24. 
The movie was thought lost until rediscovered in 1952. It was re-released two years later.
"The Kid Stakes" was remade as "Fatty Finn" in 1980.

Trade unions in Azerbaijan

Trade unions in Azerbaijan are governed under the Act on Trade Unions (1994) and the Labour Code (1999). Trade unions may be formed with seven or more members, although those in military service or in management positions may not form unions. The constitution provides for a right to strike, although essential services are excluded from this right. Trade unions are prohibited from carrying out political activities and may not associate with political parties or receive finances from political parties. The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) notes, "such a general prohibition is deemed contrary to the principles of freedom of association." The Azerbaijan Trade Union Confederation (ATUC) is the sole national centre. Azerbaijan has ratified the two key International Labour Organisation Conventions covering trade union rights on freedom of association and collective bargaining (Conventions 87 and 98).

Arthur Box

Arthur Box (September 1884 – q2 1960) was an English footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He made more than 100 appearances in the Football League playing for Burslem Port Vale, Stoke and Birmingham. He also played for Croydon Common and Crewe Alexandra.
Playing career.
Box was born in Hanley, Staffordshire, the son of Thomas, a boilermaker, and Edna. He was on the books at Hanley Villa, Northwood Mission and Stoke (without making a first team appearance), before joining Burslem Port Vale in August 1904. He played three Second Division games in the 1904–05 season, but was mainly a back-up to Harry Cotton. He became the club's first choice goalkeeper in the 1905–06 season, playing 35 league games to George Boote's three. Unusually for a goalkeeper he actually scored a goal, albeit a penalty, in a 1–0 win over Manchester United at the Athletic Ground on 24 March 1906. In the 1906–07 campaign, he played only 12 matches, as new signing Howard Matthews was preferred. Box returned to Stoke in July 1907, with Vale in the midst of financial meltdown. His rivals at the Victoria Ground were Wales international Leigh Richmond Roose and the inexperienced Fred Rathbone. Box played in 39 of the club's 44 fixtures in 1907–08, as the "Potters" finished in 10th position in the Second Division. However heavy financial problems saw the club enter liquidation and leave the Football League at the end of the 1907–08 season. He joined Birmingham in September 1909 for a fee of £100, and took over first-team duties from Jack Dorrington at the end of the 1908–09 season. However, the team finished bottom of the Second Division and Box left St Andrew's at the end of the 1909–10 season. He then moved into non-League football with Leek Victoria, Croydon Common, for whom he played 21 games in the Southern League as well as 29 in the South-Eastern League and 11 in the London League, and Crewe Alexandra.

Rudnica, Lubusz Voivodeship

Rudnica (German ) is a village in Poland, in the Krzeszyce gmina, Sulęcin County, Lubusz Voivodeship. It is 4 km east of the village of Kołczyn and 14 km south-west of Gorzów Wielkopolski. It is located 1 km east of the Lubniewka River, a regional tributary of the Warta River, and 2 km southward from the railway line leading from Gorzów Wielkopolski to Kostrzyn nad Odrą. 
Rudnica is on the edge of the Sulęcińsko-Skwierzyński forests, to the south of Kołczyn.
From 1975 to 1998 the village was administratively part of the Gorzów Voivodeship.
History.
Traces of the smelting of iron ore were discovered on the turf eras from ancient times. The village of Rudnica was established in the 15th century. Rudnica as a town, belonged to Brandenburg in Germany. Both the German and Polish names refer to iron ore being smelted here. Rudnica seized land in the first half of the 16th century (called Kolchin) since the founding of the ironworks. So at first, the ironworks settlement was called Neue Koltzschen (New Kolchin). Beginning in the 1580s the same iron forging area was called die Rede. In 1608 the Grunewoldta relationship was Klem Neuen Koltzen. In 1718, Hammer oder saved the settlement of Koltschen Klem, given as a small Kolchin. Listed in Bratringa's writings in the early 19th century, there is only Hammer. Knight Capital operated under the name Hammer-Koltschen. In 1631, the name Hammerkelschen was used. Many times people combined the German name of the village with the property name and new names would be derived on the spot. After the construction of ironworks the river was called Hammerflief. Unused today, the colony was called Hammerbusch, the court was called Hammerhof, then Altenhof. After 1945, an old mansion was located in Opieczki, a northeastern Rudnica hamlet and Hammereeke (meaning: k Nałżczyn hair). The old mansion of Waldowów was only mentioned in 1715 as a fief in a document. The village belonged to Colonel Arend von Waldow, who had three small sons at the time. Three years later, the fief and its cornfields had four co-owners: Lt.-Col. Adam Christoph von Waldow, Lt.-Col. Friedrich Sigismund von Waldow, Cpt. Karl von Maxen Andersen, (indebted to the Stobno farm), and the Ducal Saxon Waldowów and Sebastian von Waldow. In 1747, part of the village was to be given to the Adam Carl Waldow vin orphanage. Confirmation of this fact could not be found later, even in Bratringa's writings, or in any testament. Over the years Rudnica, together with part of Kolchin, acquired the land of Karl Sigismund von Reitzenstein. His successor was Carl Ernest Sigismund von Reitzenstein, who in the years 1786-1790 built the Kielpino palace and in 1800 founded the bell in Kołczynie. In 1795 by marriage, (probably by his daughter Ernestine von Reitzenstein to Carl Christian von Waldow), the ownership of Rudnica came back into the Waldowów family. Their descendants, in 1820, began using the name von Waldow-Reitzenstein. Later, only one third of Rudnica belonged to Sam Rudnica. In the 18th century part of Rudnica was again subjected to the farm in Stobno. However, with the emancipation of the property of Stobno (horns emblem), this part of the village of Rudnica was freed. In 1865, the town of Rudnica became part of the new entailment of Reitzenstein in Kiełpino.
The palace of Rudnica was built after the 30 years war (1618-1648). Although in 1631 the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus occupied Hammerkelschen, it could have been Kolchin. Rudnica was the seat of the Knights gatherings in 1724. It was located northeast from the village farm Hammerholf (forging court). Even in the early 19th century, Bratring wrote that Hammerhof is actually a noble Rudnica property in the city, located a few hundred yards from the village. This was the twilight of the glory of this settlement, in addition to the established classical palace of Kielpino having been built in 1790, it bore the Reitzenstein tribal name of the new owners. From that time period it was called Hammerhof Altenhof (old mansion). After 1945 it was called Opieczki and this name was recorded in the "Dictionary". By virtue of location Rudnica was a hamlet before 1945. Opieczki officially escaped being known as the Kiełpin (west Polish) community. Until the 18th century Kolchin was part of the Rudnica property, described in 1972, as Waldower Gestift oder Kolschenschen Territirium. In 1715, the estates created in the 15th and 16th century settlement were Rudnica, Brzozowa, (Neuwalde), Stobno, (Stubbenhgen), Mashko, (Neudorf), and Rudna (Rauden). In 1775, damages were awarded including assets that benefited the colonies (Lossow) and Krzyszczyzna (Cocceji).
As a result of adjustments in the years 1770-1778, lands originally belonging to Warta called Rudnica and Kolchin formed the colonies Szamarzewice (Altona), Silicon (Scheiblersburg), Łukomin (Streitwalde) and Kiełpin (Reitzenstein). The tradition of chivalry became part of the history of the branches of the Waldowów Rudnica family. In 1785, the property that became Włostów colonies, Szamarzewice, and (now non-existent Kolchin Ernestinenburg) took 7 colonists, and Babice (Weiberwerder) took 75 settlers, 10 peasants and 12 working-class families, and the farms Waldow and Treck as part of their establishment. In 1750 Waldowstrenk, or Wałdowice, Kiełpin Kolchin and the 12 workers, 8 Zagrodniks (people from Zagrodnik), a peasant, and four members of the noble household and moved to the new area. They took mills, glassworks, brickworks, a Smolarnia (smokehouse), a sawmill, and a mysterious manor by the name of Schalm and founded their own settlement. Sometime after 1778, a colony was founded called Hammersche Bush, later Hammerbusch. With a population of 20 families this settlement was "a mile from Rudnica", probably close to the neighborhood of Kolchin. The writer Bratring in the 19th century stated that the first quarter of the century belonged to Rudnica and Kolchin and the middle of the century to Babice and Dryer. In the mid-19th century the mansion Hammer Koltschen was 18,759 acres (4,789 hectare), of which 16 thousand acres was forest. Arable land 2,443 acres (624 hectare), with 130 acres of meadows and pasture making up 20 percent of the property. It was bordered by Berghaus owned land, the village of Rudnica, and forest belonging to the Lubniewice, Pniewy, Gorzow, and Boleminem. Scarlet fever affected the populace at one time. The estate belonged in part to Kiełpin, Wadowice, Szamarzewice, Ernestinenburg, a third part to Rudnica, a fourth part to Kolchin, some to crippled Kalkmuhle, as well to k. Wałdowic, Babice, Nałeczyn (Hammerecke), k. Hair and Hair himself.
The property in Rudnica in 1718 had five cornfields. In 1785 the farm of Hammerhof had 10 families living in cottage housing. In the late 18th or early 19th century, with the collapse of farming, Altenhof-Opieczki transformed itself into a forest village. Wielodrożnica sześciopromiennej means star-shaped, in the middle-square triangle, a description of the buildings. According to the descriptions of the pre-dominant multi-story buildings, they were plastered and timbered. In 1538, the start the ironworks gave the village is remembered for the first time. Muhlenflieb changed its name to Hammerflieb because of the ironworks located in the village of Lubniewka. In 1580 there were 3 houses in the village. In records of 1662 the village had 38 cornfields. By the 19th century there were 14 arable fiefs. In 1850, the village had 780 acres (about 200 hectare), of which 473 acres were owned by peasants, the rest by the nobles. In the years 1601 and 1615 the records showed that the village had 36 peasants and three shepherds. During the 30 years war (1618-1648) the village had suffered great damage, as a census in 1662 showed only 19 peasants, a pastor and a shepherd, with seventeen farms standing empty. In 1718, 29 peasants cultivated the fields, with 2 more owning a small sawmill. By 1785 there were 28 cottagers and 4 members of the noblility household living in Rudnica. This did not count the farm workers (under the control of the Stobno farm) and colony members of (prawdop. Hammerbusch). In the early 19th century, there were 28 Rudnica cottagers (or peasants), (Ganz-Kossaten), also 11 bailiffs. The countryside was characterized by service to the court, and to local businesses, where they had to work for zagrodnicy (landed farmers). The subjects of Rudnica had some assets in Stobno.
According to the totals of the 1785 census there were 11 cottagers, and seven bailiffs. In the late 18th century, 39 cottagers lived in the village, which is similar to the beginning of the 17th century. In the 1850s, part of the village belonged to the estate of the Stobno farm. The writer Berghaus calculated the total population was 49. In 1939 the total population in Rudnica was given as 211 individuals in households. Before independence in 1945 it was a rural commune.
Agriculture.
Agriculture was never the main livelihood of the population. In 1718 the arable land was divided into three cleared fields, and sandy fiefs containing poor soil were recorded in the census. The annual sowing was 63% rye, barley 21%, 5% vetch, and 10% flax and hemp. Total hay harvest was 152 carts of hay. The grasslands in dry years did not produce wet hay. The zagrodnicy (landed farmers) had 8 horses, 67 oxen, 137 cows, 70 sheep, 42 pigs, and 40 geese. Several cottagers had beehives.
Population.
Buildings 1850. -3 Homes, 1804, 59 , 1982. 98 . People:1804. 291 inhabitants, 1830. 327, 1939. 656.
After the war, no country had reached this level of population: 1949. -318, 1958. -419; Census of 1970. 409 people showed the population has been steadily decreasing: 1978. -368, 1988. -345. 
Before 1945. the village was of the German Evangelical faith. Some of the names of the cottagers were recorded in 1718. Residents names at that time: Stabs, Pohl, Mertzke, Wutzke, Teicherd, Moritz, Hauschcke, Tam, Lunderstadt, Slate, Kube, Scheider, Ulrich, Loppem, Lange, Schultze, Schroder, Grunow, Seyfert, Zeise, Potke, Mottner. After 1945. the village was populated first by ex. military, then as the area was earmarked for settlement, it was led by 5 displaced persons.In early 1945 It was occupied by German troops.

Before 1945, an independent rural commune, then after World War II it was clustered together with the community of Kolchin. For the years 1945 to 1972 it was a parish in the district of the National Council of Kolchin.

William Cope (footballer)

William Arthur Cope (25 November 1884 – 18 February 1937) was an English footballer who played as a full-back. He played 287 league games in the Football League over a nineteen-year professional career.
He joined Burslem Port Vale in August 1904, and spent three seasons with the club, moving on to Stoke after Port Vale resigned from the Football League. Stoke also resigned from the league in 1908, and he moved on to Oldham Athletic. He spent six years with the club, helping the club win promotion out of the Second Division in 1909–10, and to compete for the First Division title. He switched to West Ham United in 1914, and spent eight years with the club, helping the club to the wartime London Combination title in 1916–17. During this time West Ham moved from the Southern League to the Football League. He served the club as captain in 1921–22. He ended his career at Wrexham at the end of the 1922–23 campaign.
Playing career.
Cope joined Second Division Burslem Port Vale from Mount Pleasant in August 1904. He played 25 games in 1904–05, scoring once in a 3–3 with Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. The "Valeites" fared poorly, and finished third from bottom in the Football League, ahead of only Burton United and Doncaster Rovers. Cope was a key part of the club's 1905–06 campaign, playing 38 games alongside defensive partner James Hamilton. He played seventeen games in 1906–07, but left the Athletic Ground after the club resigned from the league. In his three seasons at the club he made 80 appearances (73 in the league) and scored one league goal.
He signed with nearby Stoke, also of the Second Division, and played 31 league and cup games in 1907–08. He was again without a club at the end of the season, as Stoke also resigned from the league due to financial difficulties.
He left the Potteries and moved on to Oldham Athletic. The "Latics" finished sixth in 1908–09, and finished as runners-up in 1909–10 (one point behind champions Manchester City), thereby winning promotion to the First Division. Oldham pushed on in 1910–11, and posted a seventh place finish. However they struggled in 1911–12, surviving relegation by finishing just one point ahead of Preston North End. Athletic then finished ninth in 1912–13 and fourth in 1913–14. He had played 62 league games for the club, scoring one goal.
Cope signed with West Ham United as World War I began. The "Hammers" finished fourth in the Southern Football League in 1914–15, and Cope made 33 appearances. He was with West Ham for the duration of the war, and made 111 wartime appearances; the club won the London Combination in 1916–17 and were elected to the Football League in 1919. West Ham posted a seventh place finish in 1919–20 and a fifth place finish in 1920–21. Cope was appointed as club captain for the 1921–22 season, and led the "Hammers" to a fourth place finish. He left the club at the end of the season; over the course of the three Football League campaigns he made 114 appearances.
Cope joined Third Division North club Wrexham for the 1922–23 season. Making thirteen appearances, he retired at the end of the campaign at the age of 38.

University of Strathclyde Students' Association

Founded in 1964, the University of Strathclyde Students' Association is the representative body for students of the University of Strathclyde. It is run by the students through an Executive Committee and Policy Forums. It was formed when the Students' Associations of the Royal College of Science and Technology and of the Scottish College of Commerce amalgamated. In 1989 it merged with the University of Strathclyde Sports Union.
The current Student's Union building is located on the western side of the John Anderson Campus, adjoining onto the Royal College, James Weir, and Thomas Graham buildings. It was originally opened in 1959, and extended in 1976. Its address is 90 John Street, G1 1JH.
The Association contains 10 floors, 8 of which hold student areas and 2 back office staff areas.
Governance.
The day to day running of the building is done by the Executive Committee who also serve on the trustee board alongside student volunteers elected by a cross-campus ballot.
There are five Sabbatical Officers:
The main policy making bodies of the Association are the Policy Forums, open to all students the forums meet frequently throughout the year passing policy through to the Policy Council of elected representatives which meets to discuss proposed policy.
Student Reps represent their fellow class colleagues to communicate issues, concerns, and opinions of students to University staff and vice versa. They have a positive role to play in enabling communication, feedback, and constructive change.
Student Representatives play a vital role in helping the lecturers, departments, faculties, and the University as a whole to identify issues (positive and negative) of the student learning experience. Effective management of these issues in partnership with the students can assist in strengthening National Student Survey results.
Reps can be useful in finding out how new initiatives are being received and the general opinion of their cohort on a wide range of topics. They can also can help facilitate staff communication to students.
There are a variety of different mechanisms that class reps can utilise to represent the views of their class to staff from informal chats to minuted Staff-Student Liaison Committees. They are also charged with reporting the responses back to their classmates.
Events.
Other than holding the majority of the night time events during Fresher’s Week, The Union is also famous for its weekly and other yearly events. This includes quizzes, karaoke, and themed nights all with their own exclusive drinks promos.
Also holding a main event each year for Halloween and Christmas which prove to be sell outs as well as competition to the genuine club venues
Fresher's week.
Held annually at the union where all Strathclyde university students can attend. The 2012 Freshers Week was held from the 15–23 September with all floors of the union being occupied for these events throughout the week.
Some well-known bands and acts often appear at Strathclyde’s Freshers week such as "The Human Regurgitator" Stevie Starr who appeared on Britain’s got talent as well as previous The X-Factor (UK) winner Leon Jackson.
There are many stands in and around the union which University’s clubs and societies have set up to give a brief introduction of what the society or club is. As well as stands there are small outdoor carnivals such as ‘Carnival of The Bizarre’ where a group of people perform strange acts.
Mature Student's Association.
Mature students (someone who is 21 years of age or older at the start of their course) represent almost 20% of the Strathclyde student population, including undergraduate, postgraduate and international students. Strathclyde’s Student Union also has a successful Mature Students Association, located on Level 2 of the Livingstone Tower. Facilities include; Common room, tea/coffee, microwave, toaster, fridges, tuck shop; desktop computers, printer, photocopier; quiet study room, lockers.
The main aims of the Mature Student Association (MSA) are to provide all mature students with a support network of both friends and fellow students as well as somewhere to study and relax. The mature students who comprise the membership are from all faculties, of varied ages, study methods and backgrounds. They are all on a journey through learning and the MSA pride themselves on drawing from all their experiences and learning together. They also endeavour to ensure that every member feels as welcome and as equal as the next. The MSA is a fantastic facility and provides support independent of the university to those who may not be following the typical student path. The members are the MSA's greatest resource and they pride themselves in the fact that there is always someone available to bounce ideas off or members who have similar problems/experiences in their courses.
The MSA is run by Convenor/s and/or committee who are elected yearly by the membership and liaise with the University and the USSA President on behalf of their members.

HM Prison Warren Hill

HM Young Offenders Institution Warren Hill is a male juvenile's prison located near the village of Hollesley in Suffolk, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated next to Hollesley Bay Prison.
History.
Opened in 1982 as part of Hollesley Bay Prison, Warren Hill as used to hold Category C Young Offenders. In January 2000, Warren Hill was re-rolled to hold juvenile prisoners, and an additional wing called the 'Carlford Unit' was opened on the site to hold teenage murderers. In April 2002, Hollesley Bay and Warren Hill became two separate prisons, with separate management and regimes. 
In November 2007, the Independent Monitoring Board issued a report calling for £1million to be invested on improved facilities at Warren Hill Prison. The Board recommended that the money be spent on a new reception and a first night unit at the prison, as new prisoners were often left in segregated units with inmates undergoing punishment regimes, until they could be transferred to other parts of the prison.
The prison today.
Warren Hill holds juvenile males in a closed security category environment. Prisoners are housed in single occupancy cells, each with its own sanitation, aside from one cell which accommodates two occupants.
Warren Hill provides education and skills training for prisoners. The prison's gym also operates a range of activities and courses. Warren Hill's Juvenile Activity Centre accommodates a drug rehabilitation project and a special education intervention group. There is also a special leisure area for inmates who earn privileges.
On 4 September 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that it intends to convert Warren Hill into a prison for adult male inmates.

Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife

The Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife is a double portrait of the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier and his wife and collaborator Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, commissioned from the French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1788 by Marie-Anne (who had been taught drawing by David). It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
History.
David was paid 7,000 livres for it on 16 December 1788. In 1836, the painting was left by Marie-Anne to her great-niece, and it remained in the collection of the comtesse de Chazelles and her descendents until 1924, when it was bought by John Davison Rockefeller. Rockefeller gave it to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1927, and it was acquired from this institution by the Metropolitan Museum in 1977.
Description.
It shows the couple in his office, with a wood-panelled floor and walls of false marble with three classical pilasters. In the centre the couple face the viewer, with both their heads in three-quarters profile. Marie-Anne is shown standing in profile looking at the viewer. Her costume is that in fashion at the end of the 18th century – a white wig, a white dress with a lace collar, and a blue fabric belt. She rests on her husband's shoulder, with her right hand leaning on the table.
Antoine Lavoisier is seated, wearing a black vest, culottes, stockings and buckled shoes, a white shirt, a white neckscarf and a powdered wig. His face turns towards his wife and he rests his left arm on the table, whilst writing with his right hand using a feather pen. The table is covered with scarlet velvet, many papers, a casket, an inkwell with two more feather pens, a barometer, a gasometer, a water still and a glass bell jar. A large round-bottom flask and a tap are on the floor to the right, by the table. To the table's extreme left is a chair with a large document-case and black cloth on it.
The painting is signed at the lower left: "L DAVID, PARISIIS ANNO, 1788".

Large Sakkos of Photius

The Large Sakkos of Photius is a satin tunic embroidered with gold and silver thread and decorated with silk and pearl ornament, approximately 4 ft 5 in long. It is held in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow, Russia. It is a luxury item created in the late Byzantine era for Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow around 1417.
The satin sakkos is embroidered with gold and silver thread and colored silks outlined with pearls. Dozens of religious and secular figures appear on the sakkos in an array of rectilinear, L-shaped, cruciform, and circular frames. The Crucifixion dominates the center of the front, and below is the Anastasis ("the Resurrection"). All around are various Orthodox Church feasts and figures of saints, as well as Old Testament scenes, including the binding of Isaac, linked with the Crucifixion of Christ. Also portrayed are the Grand Prince of Moscow, Vasily Dimitrievich and his wife Sophia Vitovtovna (labeled in Russian), as well as the future emperor John VIII Palaeologus and his wife Anna Vasilyevna (named in Greek). Beside John is Photius, Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. Needleworkers most likely embroidered the sakkos between the time of John's marriage in 1416 and Anna Vasilyevna's death in 1418. The couple probably sent the sakkos to Photius as a gift.

Secondary antisemitism

Secondary antisemitism is a distinct kind of antisemitism which is said to have appeared after the end of World War II. It is often explained as being "caused by" —as opposed to "in spite of"— Auschwitz, "pars pro toto" for the Holocaust. One frequently quoted formulation of the concept, first published in Henryk M. Broder's 1986 book "Der Ewige Antisemit" ("The Eternal Antisemite"), stems from the Israeli psychiatrist Zvi Rex, who once remarked: "The Germans will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz." The term itself was coined by Peter Schönbach, a Frankfurt School co-worker of Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, based on their Critical Theory.
Adorno, in a 1959 lecture titled "Was bedeutet: Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit" (published in his 1963 book "Eingriffe. Neun kritische Modelle.") addressed the fallacy of the broad German post-war tendency to associate and simultaneously causally link Jews with the Holocaust. According to Adorno's critique, an opinion had been readily accepted in Germany according to which the Jewish people were culpable in the crimes against them. Jewish guilt was assumed to varying extents, depending on the varying incarnations of that antisemitic notion, one of which is the idea that Jews were (and are) exploiting German guilt over the Holocaust.
Initially, members of the Frankfurt School spoke of "guilt-defensiveness anti-Semitism", an antisemitism motivated by a deflection of guilt.
The rehabilitation of many lower and even several higher-ranking Third Reich officials and officers appears to have contributed to the development of secondary antisemitism. These officials were rehabilitated in spite of their considerable individual contributions to Nazi Germany's crimes. Several controversies ensued early in post-World War II Germany, e.g., when Konrad Adenauer appointed Hans Globke as Chief of the Chancellery although the latter had formulated the emergency legislation that gave Hitler unlimited dictatorial powers and had been one of the leading legal commentators on the Nuremberg race laws of 1935. However, according to Adorno, parts of the German public never acknowledged these events and instead formed the notion of Jewish guilt in the Holocaust.

The Kingdom of The Winds

The Kingdom of The Winds, (), also known as The Land of The Wind, is a 2008 South Korean historial drama, broadcast on KBS from 10 September 2008 to 15 January 2009. It was directed by Kang Il-soo, written by Choi Wan-gyu, Jung Jin-ok, Park Jin-woo; adapted from manhwa by Kim Jin.
Synopsis.
The drama is about the life of the third king of Koguryeo, "King Muhyul/Daemusin" who was called the god of wars. The drama depicted "Muhyul" as a person who was born with a curse to kill his parents, siblings, son and destroy his own country. His father, "King Yuri", feared that this prophecy would come to pass but couldn't bring himself to kill his own son. He ordered his elder son, "Haemyung", to take baby Muhyul with him outside the palace to live as a commoner. So Haemyung takes Muhyul to his chief decorator friend, "Hae-Ap" who works in "King Jumong's" grave.
Twenty years pass and Muhyul is a grown man who doesn't know his true identity. Dae-so, then an old man, wants to get the Sword of Jumong for his benefit: It was claimed that the owner would be the ruler of the Northern territory. He sends his Huk-young — personal guards who train especially for the protection and usage of the Buyeoh King — to the cave where Hae-ap works. When they enter, they are unable to get the sword while Muhyool and Maro are busy with their mischief since Muhyool hates staying and learning in Jumong's cave which is boring for him. Hae-ap fights with the Huk-young and gets defeated. Muhyool comes out and finds his teacher fighting with them and attempts to hit them though he's unsuccessful. They are then caught while Maro has gone for help and are threatened to take the sword form inside the cave in exchange for their lives. It is a hard task — two Huk-young have already died. Muhyool takes the chance of going there: He doesn't want his teacher dead and yearns to leave the cave some day. He eventually succeeds and comes out with it. Hae-ap is shocked while Hae-myung comes for help and kills all the Huk-youngs. Later, when Hae-myung — Muhyool's older brother — is conversing with Hae-ap, she asks him how Muhyool was able to get the sword while she had once tried numerous times and had failed, and who is he exactly? Hae-myung tells her that it is not time for her to know. He leaves and promises her that he will tell her one day.
In 36 episodes, the drama focused on "Muhyul" and his nefarious fate. In an attempt to kill "King Daeso" of Buyeo, "Haemyung, Muhyul" and their gang fail, leading to "Haemyung's" suicide. Upon hearing this, the traumatized "Muhyul" (who thinks that Yuri is behind "Haemyung's" death) seeks revenge. So he joins forces with the Black Shadows secret army of Buyeo, where he meets "Dojin", an assassin in that army who was once a prince of Buyeo. He also meets "Yeon", a Buyeo princess who is physician. "Dojin", who has been raised with Yeon since they were children, noticed the growing feelings between "Muhyul" and Yeon, so he holds a grudge against "Muhyul".

<doc id="21407531" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21407531" title="Tharsis Tholus">
Tharsis Tholus

Tharsis Tholus is an intermediate-sized shield volcano located in the eastern Tharsis region of the planet Mars. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 and originally given the informal name Volcano 7. In 1973, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially designated it Tharsis Tholus. In planetary geology, tholus (pl. "tholi") is the term for a small domical mountain, usually a volcano.
General Description.
Tharsis Tholus lies on the eastern edge of the Tharsis quadrangle at 13.5°N, 91°W. It is about 800 km east-northeast of Ascraeus Mons, the northernmost of the large Tharsis Montes volcanoes. Lava from the Tharsis Montes and other sources within the interior of Tharsis completely surrounds Tharsis Tholus, forming a broad volcanic plain at the volcano's base.
Tharsis Tholus measures 155 km x 125 km. It is distinctly bulbous in appearance, and is unique among Martian volcanoes in the degree to which it has been modified by faulting. Large normal faults cut across and completely penetrate the volcano, dividing the edifice into several major blocks, or sectors. The volcano has an elongated central caldera (collapse crater) measuring 36.7 × 38.9 km and about 3 km deep.
In profile, Tharsis Tholus is dome-shaped (convex upward), with flank slopes ranging from less than 1° near the summit to up to 16° at the base. The average flank slope is 10°, making it one of the steepest volcanoes on Mars. The volcano rises to an elevation of about . The base of the volcano is buried by young (Amazonian-aged) lava flows presumably from the Tharsis Montes, so the true size of the edifice cannot be accurately determined. Estimates of the thickness of lava burying the base of Tharsis Tholus range from 500 m to 3.5 km.
Most of the volcano's surface is mantled with a thick layer of fine dust or ash, giving the volcano's flanks a smooth to slightly hummocky appearance. The mantle material obscures the underlying bedrock except in areas with steep slopes, such as along the caldera's upper walls. Landslide debris from the caldera's western and southeastern wall is present on the floor of the caldera.
Geology.
The volcano's relatively steep slopes and dome-like shape led some early researchers to conclude that the volcano is built from viscous, silicic lavas or pyroclastics, rather than fluid basalts. However, more recent studies based on data from the Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft indicate that Tharsis Tholus is probably a basaltic shield or a shield with a stratocone component. CRISM data from MRO show that lava exposed on the caldera scarp is composed of high- and low-calcium pyroxenes. Olivine is present in abundance on the west flank of the volcano, but it appears to be present only in the dust that mantles the volcano. No phyllosilicates (clay minerals), sulfates, or iron oxides have been detected.
Tharsis Tholus has a complex volcano-tectonic history. The edifice has been modified by at least four distinct episodes of structural deformation. The most prominent area of deformation is the central caldera complex, which consists of an outer, older caldera and an inner, younger one. The calderas are bordered by a well-preserved system of concentric normal faults and peripheral ring faults. A third, barely visible, caldera is present on the volcano's southern flank. Much of that caldera's rim is buried by ejecta from a young impact crater; however, the caldera's presence is outlined by an almost level circular area about 45 km in diameter.
A system of large, arcuate normal faults lie radial to the volcano's center. The normal faults have large offsets and transect the volcano into at least four sectors. The north and south sectors have smooth, convex upward profiles. The western and eastern sectors of the volcano consist of huge, down-dropped blocks. A large debris avalanche deposit (DAD) is present at the northwestern edge of the western block. The DAD appears to be made up of coherent slabs of flank material originating from the down-dropped western flank. Some researchers have compared the deformation on the flanks of Tharsis Tholus to "sector collapse" observed at Mauna Loa in Hawaii and other terrestrial volcanoes. Sector collapse is a sudden, catastropic detachment of a volcano's flank caused by lateral spreading of the volcano. Another suggested terrestrial analog for Tharsis Tholus is the Maderas Volcano in Nicaragua.
In addition to the normal faults, a system of narrow, parallel grabens cut across large parts of the volcano. The grabens strike to the northeast and range in width from 0.5 to 2.8 km. Chains of pits craters associated with the grabens are also observed. The age relationship between the grabens and normal faults is complex. In places, the grabens appear to crosscut the normal faults, indicating that the grabens are younger. However, the strikes of the normal faults locally appear to have a strong northeast influence, suggesting that the stresses that formed the grabens predate the normal faults. It is likely that the grabens developed repeatedly over an extended period of time and may be partly contemporaneous with the normal faults. 
The presence of two calderas suggests that two separate magma chambers underlie the volcano. In addition, a fissure-type eruption that formed a small stratocone is present near the south flank of the main volcano. Thus, Tharsis Tholus may be the result of two volcanoes growing together, with the main one taking up the northern two thirds of the structure.
Age.
Crater counting shows that the oldest parts of Tharsis Tholus formed around 3.82 billion years ago (Gya) in the late Noachian Period. The western flank seems to be about 3.73 Gya, and the east flank shows an age of about 1.08 Gya (Middle Amazonian Period). A fissure eruption on the south flank produced a lava flow around 196 million years ago (Late Amazonian Period). Volcanic activity thus covers more than 3.6 billion years of Mars history. The fissure-type eruption at the south flank of Tharsis Tholus is relatively young, so it may indicate that future volcanic activity is still possible at the mountain.

<doc id="21407545" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21407545" title="Bologna–Florence railway">
Bologna–Florence railway

The Bologna–Florence railway is one of the major links in the Italian rail network, connecting the railways of the Po Valley with the railways of Tuscany and central Italy under the Apennines. It is also known as the Bologna–Florence Direttissima—"direttissima" is Italian for "most direct". It was Italy's greatest engineering achievement in the first half of the twentieth century. When it opened in 1934 it significantly shortened the old winding Porrettana line over the Apennines via Pistoia, and was made possible by the 18.507 km-long Apennine Base Tunnel. The new Bologna–Florence high-speed railway was opened on 5 December 2009; it includes 73.8 km of tunnels in its 78.5 km length.
History.
The Porrettana line was opened across the Apennines between Bologna and Florence via Pistoia and Prato in November 1864 to connect the trunk railway of the Po Valley (the Milan–Bologna and the Bologna–Ancona railways, completed in 1861) with the railways of Tuscany. Florence was finally connected by rail with Rome via Perugia in 1866. The Porrettana line was immediately successful but while it was a significant engineering achievement it soon became clear that it was inadequate to cater for the traffic attempting to use it. In particular, it was a single track line, with steep gradients and its Apennine tunnel was built on a steep slope causing climbing steam trains to generate suffocating smoke, even when extra ventilation shafts and fans were eventually installed.
Various projects for additional crossings of the Apennines were developed, and the Pontremolese line was opened in 1892 between La Spezia and Parma providing an alternative route from Rome to Milan. The Faentina line was opened in 1893 from Florence to Faenza as another alternative route. However these lines suffered from the same basic problem: they were mountain lines consisting of a single, winding track and were subject to being obstructed by snow in winter. As time passed, traffic increased, but so did technical expertise in drilling long tunnels, so it became possible to envisage more direct routes with reduced climbs up a pass.
In 1882 the designer of Porrettana, Jean Louis Protche, was commissioned by several institutions to examine a number of projects including one dating back to 1871, proposed by the engineer Antonio Zannoni which proposed a more easterly route for the new line in order to reduce the length of climb. Protche chose a slightly different route through the valleys of the Setta and Bisenzio rivers, connecting with the existing line in Prato, and passing under the Apennines through an 18,032 m tunnel; its approach line would have had a total vertical climb of 328 m at a maximum slope of 12 per thousand.
In 1902, the Colombo Commission was established to study the proposals of Protche and Zannoni along with those of several other engineers, Sugliano, De Gaetani, Naldoni and Mercanti. In 1908 the government authorised for a budget of 150 million lire dor final studies for the project and its construction. The approval of the final route of the "Direttissima", however, continued to debated until 1911. The project was then approved for a double track line using electric traction, widely spaced stations, 31 tunnels—which alone constitute 37% of the line—and numerous bridges.
Construction.
Construction lasted from 1913 to 1934, slowed by World War I, economic and political crises and the complexity of the work. The work also often had to be carried out on unstable land and the tunnels had to be built largely through clay and sand schists, which are poor soils for tunnelling due to the instability of the schist and the tendency of clay to swell. Before 18.5 km-long Apennine Tunnel construction could be commenced two temporary 950 mm-gauge construction railways had to be built from Sasso Marconi up the Setta Valley to the northern tunnel entrance and from Parato up the Bisenzio Valley to the southern tunnel entrance. An aerial rope way was also built from the northern entrance to carry construction material to a work site built at Cà di Landino above the centre of the tunnel in the town of Castiglione dei Pepoli; Cà di Landino was connected to work sites in the Apennine Tunnel by two additional tunnels (both over 500 metres long) built at an angle of 27 degree. These preliminary works were completed in 1920 and construction of Apennine Tunnel then commenced, taking another 11 years to be completed. These works were affected by methane gas leaks, which were generally dealt with by controlled explosions, with only four causing serious interruption to the work. On the other hand a fire set off by blasting led to a serious fire in the wooden timbering used to shore-up the tunnel temporarily, which burnt for two and a half months, before it was flooded with water. It took another four and a half months to repair the tunnel, during which the work continued beyond the burnt section, accessed by a by-pass tunnel.
97 workers died during the construction of the railway, in particular in the central tunnel, and many of the survivors were afflicted by silicosis. On the other hand, it revived poor mountain villages whose inhabitants might otherwise have been forced to emigrate. On 22 April 1934 the line finally opened to traffic and revolutionised Italy's transport system, just as the Porrettana railway had done 70 years before.
The new line.
The line was built as a "modern" line, with double track, electric traction, and large-radius curves with good transitions. Compared to the Porrettana line the route was shortened from 131 to 97 kilometres; its maximum slope was 1.2 percent compared to 2.6 percent on the old line. The total ascent and descent on the line was reduced from 616 metres on the Porrettana line to 322 metres on the line. The new line's maximum speed was 180 km/h compared to 75 km/h on the old line.
The minimum time between Bologna and Florence was five hours when the Porrettana line opened in 1864, but had been reduced to three hours after World War I and to 2½ hours in 1927 when the Porrettana line was electrified. Express trains on the new line took 75 minutes when it opened; today, the fastest trains take 55 minutes.
Apennine Tunnel.
The Apennine Tunnel was the second longest in the world, only 1300 meters less than the Simplon and it is still in the top 20 in the world. It still has an underground station, which is very unusual on a non-urban railway, called "Precedenze" (Way) station, but it became disused in the 1960s for security reasons and due to lack of traffic. It was intended primarily to allow the overtaking of slow goods trains and had two lines over 450 meters long dug parallel to the main tunnel. It was also used for local passenger traffic, being connected with the outside world by a tunnel built at the angle of 50 degrees, with about a thousand steps, which emerged in Cà di Landino, which continued as a small village after the completion of the tunnel. The station is currently used to switch trains between tracks and is called "Posto Movimento Precedenze". Two underground stations are also sometimes used in the Seikan Tunnel (54 km), and a station was formerly proposed to be built in the Gotthard Base Tunnel (54 km) near Sedrun.
Terrorist attacks.
On the line there have been two terrorist attacks, in 1974 the Italicus Express bombing and in 1984 the Train 904 bombing.

It is a member school of Lutheran Education Australia, a network of 85 schools and 42 kindergarten/early childhood centres educating approximately 38,000 students Australia wide, and it forms part of the Riverina group of Lutheran schools together with Lutheran Primary School Wagga Wagga, St Paul's Lutheran Primary School Henty, St John's Primary School Jindera and Victory Lutheran College Wodonga (Victoria).
St Paul's College provides a Christian Education. The student body is drawn from a wide range of Christian denominations and it includes families not associated with a church.
The mission of St Paul's College is to provide an education that is "complete, distinctive and of quality" with the vision of being a ""Christ-centred community valuing people and learning""
Location.
St Paul's is located in a rural setting on the northern outskirts of Walla Walla. Walla Walla is a town of approximately 600 people located 40 kilometres north of the cities of Albury-Wodonga and 100 km south of Wagga Wagga; 540 km south-west of Sydney and 350 km north of Melbourne.
History.
When the Lutheran forefathers first settled Walla Walla they established their church and a day school. However, this school was short-lived and it was handed over to the NSW Department of Public Instruction in 1885.
The desire of the local community for Christian secondary education led Pastor JTP Stolz to begin the planning that would lead ultimately to the establishment of St Paul’s College. On Tuesday 10 February 1948, 28 foundation students answered the roll called by Mr Werner Hebart, the founding Headmaster. Thirteen of these students were boarders and they resided with local families. The College was established in the conviction that “unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labour in vain” (Psalm 127:1), meaning that “"the gospel of Jesus Christ must inform all learning, teaching, human relationships and activities so that young people can be prepared for their fullest and best lives"” (Wegener, 2002:19).
The College moved onto its current premises, from its temporary location in Zion church in 1950. Since that time there has been extensive development and refurbishment of buildings and facilities, together with the establishment and modification of curricula and programs.
Milestones in the history of St Paul’s include<br>
Strategic planning during 2008 set the direction for St Paul's future, in line with the vision of its founders, that St Paul's be a ""Christ-centred community valuing people and learning."" This plan focuses on what is central to St Paul's - developing its people and enhancing the quality of the learning that takes place.
Pastoral care.
St Paul's has a vertically arranged pastoral care group system consisting of students from Years 7 to 12. This structure, which was introduced in 1985, replaced the typical structure of having a year coordinator assigned to each year group. Each student is assigned to a care group, either within Kavel House or Leidig House and he or she remains in this caregroup for the duration of his or her schooling. This structure facilitates the development of strong relationships within the college community. Daily devotions, either in Care Groups or within the whole school assembly, are an important aspect of the holistic development of students.
Educational.
St Paul’s offers a relatively wide range of academic and vocational subjects to meet students’ interests and aspirations. Some students take the opportunity to specialise in Equine or Agricultural Studies, which are two high profile areas of learning at St Paul’s. Nonetheless, a broad curriculum is offered for the majority of the students who do not wish to gain employment in an agricultural field or have an interest in Equine sports.
As part of their learning, all students learn about Christianity and other major religious groups. In Years 7-10, students learn about the Christian faith using curriculum materials from Lutheran Education Australia and they engage in service learning. The NSW Board of Studies subject, The Study of Religion, is taught in Years 11 and 12. Christian faith is neither presumed nor demanded from students.
Students’ learning in agriculture is supported by practical activities on the College’s farms (totalling 92 ha) that are used for livestock, cropping and pasture production. The White Suffolk stud provides experiences in the production of sheep and wool; the preparation and showing of sheep; and the techniques of modern studwork. The College also runs a small commercial herd of cows, along with steers that are prepared for showing and carcase competitions. Show teams visit local agricultural shows and the Royal shows in Melbourne and Sydney.
The focus of the Equine studies programme is on the equestrian industry rather than the racing or breeding industries. Many students, including beginner riders, choose equine as a way of following their interests and developing a range of equestrian skills. The Equine centre includes stables, yards and paddocks, dressage and jumping arenas, a round yard and a cross country training circuit. Boarding students agist their horses at the Equine centre and College horses are available for students who do not have their own horse. Supervised riding takes place after school and boarding students have the opportunity to compete at local shows and gymkhanas.
Boarding.
Boarding is an important component of St Paul’s; from the time when the College was first established to the present time when approximately 30% of the students are boarders. At various times the boarding population has comprised over 80% of the enrolments with up to 160 full and weekly boarding students. Presently, boarding students are drawn from communities within the Greater Hume Shire, the Riverina, North Eastern Victoria and further afield from the cities of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.
Weekly boarding students return to their homes on weekends and College operated transport services are provided to and from Wagga Wagga and Wodonga. Full boarding students remain on campus on weekends. An organised activity is provided each weekend and boarders are encouraged to play tennis, netball, cricket and football with local teams.
Facilities.
There has been substantial investment in new facilities and the refurbishment of existing facilities in the last decade. New and refurbished facilities include:

Balcombe tunnel

Balcombe tunnel is a railway tunnel on the Brighton Main Line through the Sussex Weald between Three Bridges and Balcombe. It is long. The track is electrified with a 750V DC third-rail.
History.
The tunnel was constructed by the London and Brighton Railway between 1838 and 1841, through Grinstead Clay, with five ventilation shafts. The engineer for the line was John Urpeth Rastrick; the contractor responsible for the brick-lined tunnel is not known.
Ingress of water from the ground above was experienced during the construction of the tunnel, and this has remained a problem throughout its history. Rastrick described the tunnelling as very treacherous, requiring great caution on the part of the miners working it, as "it swells and effloresces as soon as exposed to the air." Between 1907 and 1909 the tunnel was partially relined with engineering brick.
Galvanised iron sheets were fitted to prevent the water falling on passengers in open carriages, but the blast from the steam locomotives and air pressure created by the passage of trains could result in the metal sheets being torn from the structure, creating a serious hazard. Thereafter drivers were warned about the hazard presented by hanging icicles.
The "railway murderer" Percy Lefroy Mapleton left the body of his victim in Balcombe tunnel in 1881.
In July 1903 plans were finalised for the boring of a second Balcombe tunnel as part of the scheme to quadruple the Brighton Main Line throughout, but these were never implemented.
In 1998/9 catchment trays were fitted under the tunnel's ventilation shafts to divert seeping ground water from the shafts into the track drainage system, with a sixth added in 2006/7. The trays consisted of steel decking, gutters and flashings which were installed under limited track possessions. The tray supports had failed by 2013, requiring the installation of additional support brackets, and the Office of Rail Regulation enforced improvements in tunnel examination procedures.

Portrait of Madame Marie-Louise Trudaine

The Portrait of Madame Marie-Louise Trudaine is an unfinished 1791–1792 portrait of Marie-Louise Trudaine by the French painter Jacques-Louis David. It was commissioned from David by her brothers-in-law, the Trudaine brothers (the Trudaine family had provided France with major civil servants such as Daniel-Charles Trudaine since the 17th century) who welcomed David, the poet André Chénier and other major artists of the time to their Parisian salon at place des Vosges. It shows her seated on a simple chaisse, with her hands crossed on her lap and wearing a sober dress, a blue waist-sash and a white collar. Her expression is worried and reinforced by the tormented background and her unkempt hair. David became radicalised at the time of the French Revolution in 1792, was elected a deputy to the National Convention, and became an extremist—unlike the Trudaine family, who opted for obscurity. David left the portrait unfinished.

The Last of the Knucklemen

The Last of the Knucklemen is a 1979 Australian film directed by Tim Burstall.
Plot.
The story involves a gang of rough miners. Tom (Peter Hehir) turns up at the mine looking for a place to hide. He allies himself with the mining foreman Tarzan (Gerard Kennedy) before the big fight.
Original Play.
John Power's play had been produced in 1973. 
Leslie Rees described it as "a sequence of sketches using the same basic characters but without much development or thematic resolution".
Production.
Before Tim Burstall started on "Eliza Fraser" he thought Hexagon Productions should make a male bonding film, and considered "Rusty Bugles", "The Odd Angry Shot" and "Last of the Knucklemen". He eventually decided on the latter. He had to wait to get the rights because the Melbourne Theatre Company were negotiating to sell the rights to the US but this fell through.
Burstall did the adaptation himself, which was largely faithful to the play. He felt that the film was weak in the first half setting up characters. Burstall:
I was trying to take the ocker stuff and cross it, as I think John Powers' play was, with anthropology. Before I rehearsed the cast, I got them to read 'The Territorial Imparity of the Native Aid'. I wanted it to be seen not just as ockerism but as anthropology. But the only people who got that were the French. It was bought in France and it's done terribly well there - much better than it ever did in Australia.
The movie was shot over six weeks in September and October 1978 mostly on sets at Melbourne's Cambridge Studios.
Reception.
"The Last of the Knucklemen" grossed $180,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $703,800 in 2009 dollars. Reviews however were strong. Burstall:
I don't think they knew how to market it. A lot of women said to me, 'I'd never go to a picture that had the title The Last of the Knucklemen'. But nobody ever looked at it as an analysis of the way men work. It's a right-wing view of unionism.
Home Media.
"The Last of the Knucklemen" was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in January 2012. The DVD is compatible with region codes 2 and 4 and includes special features such as the trailer, photo gallery and interviews with John Powers, Gerard Kennedy, Dan Burstall, Steve Bisley and Michael Caton.

Kraak &amp; Smaak

Kraak & Smaak are a musical production trio from the town of Leiden, Netherlands, consisting of Oscar de Jong, Mark Kneppers and Wim Plug.
Biography.
In 2003,UK label Jalapeno Records released the project's initial 12"s. Interest from Annie Nightingale and Pete Tong led to airplay and the recording of a DJ guest mix for BBC Radio 1. Several remixes for UK artists such as Mark Rae and dj tours across the US and Australia followed.
Their debut album "Boogie Angst," was released in the UK 2006. It featured several artists, including U-Gene and Dez (who wrote and sung the single 'Keep Me Home'). Benelux and Japan and a band is set up to be able to play live alongside the DJ sets. Throughout 2006 and 2007, their shows took them to festivals such as the Pinkpop, Sziget, SXSW, Miami's Winter Music Conference, Bonnaroo, Coachella, the Australian Good Vibrations Festival, and on a first small club tour in the US, during which they opened for Faithless a number of times. Supported by Jason Bentley of KCRW the album was re-released in the US by Quango Music, and various tracks found their way into television series such as Grey’s Anatomy, Men in Trees and What About Brian?
"The Remix Sessions" was released in early 2007. It includes previously released material remixed by artists including Jamiroquai, Sarah Bettens and Kruder & Dorfmeister. It also includes a remix of the Skeewiff cover version of ‘Man Of Constant Sorrow’ (as made famous by the O Brother, Where Art Thou? film by the Coen brothers). Since then Junkie XL, Sam Sparro, and others have also been re-rubbed.
In 2008, their second artist album was released, "Plastic People", whose title track was written by featured UK artist Bobby Nio and Mark Brydon of electro band Moloko. The first single off that album, "Squeeze Me", featuring UK singer Ben Westbeech, was a minor hit, with a #6 position in the Dutch pop charts and receiving lots of rotation worldwide. The video by Dutch director Andre Maat, with its ‘flip book’ theme won support from US celebrity blogger Perez Hilton and rap artist / producer Kanye West and picked up various awards. In the US, the album and single were released by Ultra Records and BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac asked Kraak & Smaak to record a minimix.
Dance magazine IDJ describes Kraak & Smaak as a “Must see live band”, alongside names such as the Chemical Brothers, Moby and The Prodigy. Building on that qualification, during 2008 Kraak & Smaak played the Glastonbury Festival, Bestival, Bloom, Lovebox, the Big Chill festival and club shows at The Cargo and The End in the UK, the Rothbury Music Festival in the US, Lowlands in the Netherlands and again the Sziget festival. During their US live tour at the end of 2008, they performed live on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC television. In 2009 and 2010 new US DJ and live tours follow, playing shows nation-wide in clubs and on festivals such as the Ultra Music Festival, Rothbury, Coachella, Detroit Movement, Wakarusa, and so forth.
In January 2009, the project won the EU sponsored European Border Breakers Award (EBBA), alongside acts such as The Ting Tings and Adele. The award was presented at the Eurosonic festival in Groningen (city), during a television show hosted by Jools Holland.
After a long period of touring and collabs (Sander Kleinenberg) and even more remixes (Maxwell, Max Sedgley, Fedde le Grand, Darwin Deez, etc.), K&S's third album, 'Electric Hustle,' was released in April 2011, featuring Romanthony, Lee Fields, Janne Schra, John Turrell and Lex Empress a.o. on vocal duties. A new series of dancefloor EPs was released under the name of 'Kraak Beats' and Moby's new single 'The Day' was remixed.
In 2013, Kraak & Smaak released their third album, "Chrome Waves"

People in Sorrow

People in Sorrow is a 1969 album by the Art Ensemble of Chicago recorded in Boulogne for the French Pathé-Marconi label, later reissued in the US on Nessa Records. It features an extended improvised performance by Lester Bowie, Joseph Jarman, Roscoe Mitchell and Malachi Favors Maghostut.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states "The still-startling music, which uses space, dynamics, and a wide range of emotions expertly, is not for everyone's taste (the high-energy tenors of the mid-1960s are actually easier to get into), but worth the struggle".

Portrait of Madame Récamier

Portrait of Madame Récamier is an 1800 portrait of the Parisian socialite Juliette Récamier by Jacques-Louis David showing her in the height of Neoclassical fashion, reclining on an Directoire style sofa in a simple empire line dress with almost bare arms, and short hair "à la Titus". He began it in May 1800 but may have left it unfinished when he learned that François Gérard had been commissioned before him to paint a portrait of the same model (Gerard's portrait was completed in 1802); on the other hand many David portraits have the same bare background. The pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder was adopted in 1814 by Ingres for his "Grande Odalisque". It is now in the Louvre.
In "Creatures in an Alphabet", Djuna Barnes wrote of the subject as
The Seal, she lounges like a bride,<br>
Much too docile, there's no doubt;<br>
Madame Récamier, on side,<br>
(if such she has), and bottom out.
René Magritte also parodied David's painting in his own "Perspective: Madame Récamier by David", showing a coffin reclining, now in the National Gallery of Canada.

A Vacant Affair

A Vacant Affair (Also known as AVA) is a 5-piece Singaporean Post-hardcore band that was formed in 2004. The band is one of the first few groups to bring heavier music to the mainstream audience and reach the local charts in Singapore.
The band consists of Matthew Lim (vocals), Joshua Tan (vocals, guitar), Rudi Osman (guitar), Tan Wei Shen (bass), Hafyz Tajuddin (drums). They have so far released an EP and one full-length album. In December 2008 and February 2009 respectively, it was announced that Shen and Rudi were to pursue their studies overseas. Later at their shows it was announced that they would be replaced temporarily by Joseph Cinco of Marchtwelve and Cedric Chew of death metal band, Meza Virs, with Joseph on bass and Cedric on guitars respectively. Cedric produced their album and both are good friends of the band. Shen has since returned to Singapore.
History.
Formed in 2004, the band first started playing through underground gigs and with much hard work. It wasn't until two years later that they first started gaining mainstream popularity when they performed in Baybeats '06. At the same time, they started selling their first self-titled EP album, which consisted of 5 tracks. They were featured on Mediacorp (2007 New Year's Eve Countdown @ Vivocity), Nokia (Flow! @ Ministry of Sound), The Esplanade (Baybeats 2006, Baybeats 2007, On the Waterfront shows), Midas Promotions (SingFest ‘08), National Library Board’s ‘Speak Good English’ campaign (School Invasion Tour 2007 & Timbre Bar shows), Lime Magazine (Lime Sonic Bang 2007) and National Youth Council's numerous 'Weekend Trip @ Youth Park' gigs & *scape @ The Lab gigs. In early 2009, they also performed in "Live n Loaded" on national TV. The band has so far shared stages with other groups such as As I Lay Dying, Story of The Year, Funeral For A Friend, Love Me Butch and many others.
Debut Album: Reasons to Leave (2007-present).
In early 2007, A Vacant Affair began writing new material for their debut full length, which was recorded producer Cedric Chew (Inversion Productions). It wasn't until late 2008 that the band released their long awaited debut and full length album. The album was titled "Reasons to Leave". To promote the album the band made a trailer for the album and posted it on YouTube. Their trailer can be viewed on their Myspace.
In November 2008 they were opening bands for the Rockstar Taste of Chaos international Asian stop at DXO, opening for international acts such as Grammy-nominated Metalcore band As I Lay Dying and rock group Story of the Year. They were also the opening band for Sky In Euphoria's album launch and headlined WeekendTRIP alongside Vermillion, Sky In Euphoria and other bands.

St. Jerome in Penance (Fra Lippo Lippi)

The St. Jerome in Penance is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi, dating to c. 1439. It is housed in the Lindenau-Museum of Altenburg, Germany. The work could be identified with the "St. Jerome Penitent" of which Lippi asked payment in a letter issued to Piero de' Medici in 1439.
The painting is one of the first known example on the subject of St. Jerome doing penance. It is a small panel, divided into two different scenes: in the upper part is St. Jerome with the wooden cross, the stone to strike his breast and the lectern lying on the rock. In the lower part, with a chronological step, is the episode of the saint with the lion having a thorn in the paw. The unfriendly landscape is a metaphor of the hermit style of life.

RPS-420

Satellite Orbiting Rocket Number 420 (Indonesian: Roket Pengorbit Satelit 420, abbreviated as RPS-420), or Pengorbitan-1, is Indonesia's proposed satellite launching rocket that if successful, will carry Indonesia's first indigenous satellite into Low Earth Orbit in 2014. The aim is to have home-made rockets and satellites. Reaching orbit will make Indonesia a new space power in Asia.
RPS or "Pengorbitan" (Indonesian for "orbital") is ultra-light space launch vehicles subfamily of 
"RX" ("Roket Eksperimental") rockets family. The multistage launchers are being developed by the state company Spacetecx for Indonesia's National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN). They will be launched from a mobile pad at Lapan Space Center, where RX-250-LPN mini-rockets have blasted off already.
Currently Indonesian RX rockets has suborbital capabilities only and could serve as a platform for high altitude outer atmosphere studies. Indonesia plans to develop orbital microsatellite launching capabilities with the RPS to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO). This project was first revealed to the public during the "Indo Defence Expo-2008" exhibition in Jakarta.
In 2008 optimistic hopes were that this rocket, known as "SLV" (Satellite Launch Vehicle) would first be launched in Indonesia to 2012, and if there were extra funds pursuant to the good economic situation of 2007-8, possibly the year 2010.
In fact, the LAPAN budget for 2008 and 2007 was Rp 200 billion (approximately USD $20million). Budgetary issues surrounding the international credit crises of 2008-2009 placed many Indonesian technical projects in jeopardy most especially the complete development of RX-420 and associated microsatellite program to world-class standards ahead of project finalization schedule and the opportunity to work together with the world institutions. LAPAN hopes to be an educating partner with Indian Aerospace in sciences related to satellite.
Pengorbitan-1.
Pengorbitan-1, or RPS/RX-420, will be a four-stage rocket with the ability to place 25 kg satellites in LEO. Its first launch is expected in 2014. 
Category: microsatellite orbital launch vehicle, similar to Lambda from Japan, but with lighter modern materials and modern avionics. Launch unguided at a 70-degree angle of inclination with a four-stage solid rocket motor launcher.
Diameter: 420 mm
Length: 6200 mm
Lift-off mass: 1000 kg.
Propellant: solid composite, firing time 13 seconds
Thrust: 9.6 tons
Flight duration: 205 seconds
Maximum velocity: mach 4.5
Range: 101 km, 53000 m altitude
Payload: diagnostic, GPS, altimeter, gyro, 3-axis accelerometer, processor and battery.
The RX-420 was entirely built using local materials.
LAPAN carried out a stationary test on RX-420 on 23 December 2008 in Tarogong, West Java. The RX-420 missile was tested at the launching station Cilauteureun, Pameungpeuk District, Garut regency, West Java.
The LAPAN RX-420 is the test bed for the entirely indigenously developed satellite launch vehicle. RX-420 is suitable for launch of micro-satellites (50 kg or less) and nano-satellites (5 kg or less) currently in co-development with Technical University of Berlin.
The rocket launching plan will be extended in 2010 by launching combined RX-420-420 and in 2011 for combined RX-420-420 – 320 and SOB 420.
Pengorbitan-2.
The five-stage Pengorbitan-2, or RX-420 Plus and RX-520, will launch a 50 kg payload to LEO and is intended to operate from 2014.
At planning stage are the RX-420 with multiple customizable configuration boosters and the planned 520mm RX-520. The RX-520 is predicted to be able to launch 100 kg+ payload into orbit. This large rocket is intended to be fueled by high-pressure liquid. Hydrogen Peroxide and various hydrocarbons are under evaluation. Addition of RX-420 boosters to the RX-520 is calculated to increase lifting capacity to 500 kg+ payload, although if too expensive, the proven Russian Soyuz and Energiya will likely be employed.
RX-520 consists of one RX-420 and two boosters of RX-420 in stage-1, one RX-420 in stage-2, one RX-420 in stage-3 and as a payload launcher one RX-320 in stage-4.
At November 11, 2010, LAPAN spokesman said the RX-550 rocket would undergo a static test in December this year and a flight test in 2012. The rocket will consist of four stages, will be part of an RPS-01 rocket to put a satellite in orbit.

1987 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs, the championship of the National Hockey League (NHL), began with sixteen teams on April 8, 1987. It concluded on May 31, with the Edmonton Oilers defeating the Philadelphia Flyers to win the Stanley Cup.
Series.
"Note: all dates in 1987"
In attempts to reduce the number of first round upsets, the NHL expanded the best-of-five series in the first round to a best-of-seven series.
The game seven opening-round game between the Washington Capitals and New York Islanders went four overtimes, and is known as the Easter Epic.
The 1987 playoffs marked the second consecutive year that all four former WHA teams made the playoffs in the same year. It would not happen again until 1999 by which time 3 of those teams had moved, the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix, and the Hartford Whalers to Raleigh, North Carolina.
The Quebec Nordiques made the playoffs and defeated the Hartford Whalers in the first round. The next playoff series they would win would be in 1996, their first year as the Colorado Avalanche. The Winnipeg Jets' opening-round win over Calgary would be the last playoff series win for the combined Jets/Coyotes franchise until 2012

Prince of Wales conference.
The 1987 Prince of Wales Conference Final is remembered not for the hockey that was played, but rather for a pre-game brawl that occurred prior to Game 6 in Montreal. Canadiens' forward Claude Lemieux was known for shooting a puck into the opposition's net at the end of warm-ups. Lemieux had been warned by several Flyers not to, but did so anyway after both teams had left the ice. The Flyers' Ed Hospodar returned to the ice and he and Lemieux fought, while other players from both teams gradually returned from their dressing rooms. When the Flyers' Dave Brown challenged the Canadiens' Chris Nilan, multiple fights erupted on the ice. After the playoffs, the NHL instituted new rules to eliminate bench clearing brawls.

Đuro Sudeta

Đuro Sudeta (Stara Plošćica near Bjelovar, April 10, 1903 — Koprivnica, April 30, 1927), was a Croatian writer.
After finishing the gymnasium in Zagreb, in 1922 he started working as a teacher at the civil school in Virje. Ever since the summer 1925, he fought tuberculosis, treating it in Topolšica, Zagreb and Koprivnica. In his brief lifetime he published two books of poetry: "Osamljenim stazama" ("By lonesome paths") and "Kućice u Dolu" ("Little houses in Dol"). He also wrote several novels and feuilletons.
Sudeta is a poet of dusky sentiments, rain, anxiety, disease and perishing, but he is want of the Sun, vivacity, spring and harmony, confronted with brutal reality of patient's deathbed. Sudeta is a lyric abounding with straightforwardness, creator of a divine religious inspiration, seeking for comfort of the solitude and the redemption in the idyllic quietude of snow-white churches. 
Among the myriad of short stories he wrote, modern lyrical-fantastic novel "Mor" can be singled out. He also wrote poems, magazine articles and political discussions in "Luč", "Hrvatska prosvjeta" and Vijenac.

Lonely Hearts (1982 film)

Lonely Hearts is a 1982 Australian film directed by Paul Cox which won the 1982 AFI Award for Best Film and was nominated in four other categories.
Plot.
A middle-aged man, Peter, goes to a dating agency in search of a companion. He is introduced to a shy bank clerk Patricia.
Production.
Paul Cox wrote the first two drafts, then Phillip Adams proposed the movie be the first of four films made by the Adams-Packer company. John Clarke was brought in to co-write and John Murray became producer. Cox was paid $30,000 which he says was the first payment he ever received for making a film.
The movie was shot over six weeks with two weeks for rehearsal.
Release.
The film was extremely well received and screened widely overseas, establishing Cox's reputation.
Bob Ellis later argued that the movie was Cox's best because more time and care was put into it with less improvisation. "It had a producer, a director, a script editor, you know, the usual apparatus and, of course, it's a full and wonderful film. His other ones are like brief, infinitely prolonged screams or sonatas or something..."
Home Media.
"Lonely Hearts" was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in August 2007. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the theatrical trailer and interviews with Paul Cox, John Clarke And Wendy Hughes.

<doc id="21407814" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21407814" title="Marinoan glaciation">
Marinoan glaciation

The Marinoan glaciation was a period of worldwide glaciation that lasted from approximately 650 to 635 Ma (million years ago) during the Cryogenian period. The glaciation may have covered the entire planet, in an event called the Snowball Earth. The end of the glaciation may have been sped by the release of methane from equatorial permafrost.
Origin of name and history of terminology.
The name is derived from the stratigraphic terminology of the Adelaide Geosyncline (Adelaide Rift Complex) in South Australia and is taken from the Adelaide suburb of Marino. The term Marinoan Series was first used in a 1950 paper by Douglas Mawson and Reg Sprigg to subdivide the Neoproterozoic rocks of the Adelaide area and encompassed all strata from the top of the Brighton Limestone to the base of the Cambrian. The corresponding time period, referred to as the Marinoan Epoch, spanned from the middle Cryogenian to the top of the Ediacaran in modern terminology. Mawson recognised a glacial episode within the Marinoan Epoch which he referred to as the Elatina glaciation after the 'Elatina Tillite' (now Elatina Formation) where he found the evidence. However, the term Marinoan glaciation came into common usage because it was the glaciation that occurred during the Marinoan Epoch, as distinct from the earlier glaciation during the Sturtian Epoch (the time period of deposition of the older Sturtian Series).
The term Marinoan glaciation was later applied globally to any glaciogenic formations assumed (directly or indirectly) to correlate with Mawson’s original Elatina glaciation in South Australia. Recently, there has been a move to return to the term Elatina glaciation in South Australia because of uncertainties regarding global correlation and because an Ediacaran glacial edisode (Gaskiers) also occurs within the wide ranging Marinoan Epoch.
Cryogenian Snowball Earth.
Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic era. There were three (or possibly four) significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic. These periods of nearly complete glaciation of Earth are often referred to as "Snowball Earth", where it is hypothesized that at times the planet was covered by ice thick. Of these glaciations, the Marinoan was the most significant, whereas the Sturtian glaciation was a shorter, but still worldwide glaciation. The Kaigas glaciation is considered the earliest of Cryogenian glaciations. Other Cryogenian glaciations were probably small and not global as compared to the Marinoan or Sturtian glaciations.
During the Marinoan glaciation, characteristic glacial deposits indicate that Earth suffered the most severe ice ages in its history. Glaciers extended and contracted in a series of rhythmic pulses, possibly reaching as far as the equator.
Evidence.
Even though much evidence has been lost through geological changes, field investigations show evidence of the Marinoan glaciation in China, Svalbard archipelago and South Australia. In Guizhou Province, China, glacial rocks were found to be underlying and overlaying a layer of volcanic ashes which contained zircon minerals, which could be dated through radioisotopes. Glacial deposits in South Australia are approximately the same age (about 630 Ma), confirmed by similar stable carbon isotopes, mineral deposits (including sedimentary barite), and other unusual sedimentary structures. Two diamictite-rich layers in the top of the Neoproterozoic strata of the northeastern Svalbard archipelago represent the first and final phases of the Marinoan glaciation.

Roy Moore (born 22 December 1914, date of death unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1930s. His father Herbert Moore played a game for South Melbourne in their premiership year of 1909.
Moore, a forward who liked the torpedo punt, came to South Melbourne from the Sandhurst Football Club in Bendigo. He kicked 52 goals in his debut VFL season. Two of those came in South Melbourne's losing 1935 VFL Grand Final team, where he replaced the injured Bob Pratt at full-forward, and he also kicked two goals in another losing Grand Final the following season.
Late in the 1937 season, against Fitzroy at Lake Oval, Moore bagged a career best nine goals, despite the entire South Melbourne team managing just ten in the entire game. Only Collingwood's Dick Lee has kicked that many goals in a game where only one other kicked a major score. A leg injury restricted his appearances towards the end of his career but Moore managed to finish as his club's top goal-kicker in 1938 with 34 goals. He represented the VFL on one occasion, in a game against the VFA.

The Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki is a 1781 equestrian portrait of the Polish patron, politician and writer Stanisław Kostka Potocki by the French painter Jacques-Louis David. It was painted in Rome when the artist and subject met during David's stay at the Villa Medici after winning the first prize for painting in the Prix de Rome, and chronologically after his "Saint Roch interceding with the Virgin for the Plague-Stricken" and before "Belisarius begging for alms". Its equestrian format is owed to influences from Rubens. 
Potocki, the subject of the painting, displayed it at Wilanów Palace, his residence near Warsaw. Ownership passed to the Branicki family in 1892. During the Second World War it was looted by the German forces, then passed into Soviet Russian hands after the war, before being repatriated to Poland in 1956. It is now on show in the Museum of King John III's Palace at Wilanów.

History.
Operational history.
Aerial transportation in South and Southwest Pacific during World War II.
Formation - Stateside
On 14 February 1942, the 33d Transport Squadron was activated at Middletown Air Depot, Pennsylvaina and became a unit of the 315th Transport Group. The original cadre was selected from the 2nd Transport Squadron, with First Lieutenant Elmer F. Estrumse, from the 6th Transport Squadron, in command. Shortly after activation, the squadron began to operate with C-39's, loaned by the 2nd Transport Squadron, hauling cargo from Middletown to widely scattered points in the United States as well as Newfoundland, Haiti, Cuba, and other foreign air fields. The squadron's first plane, a C-53 Skytrooper, was assigned during the first week of June 1942. 
On 17 June 1942, the squadron changed its station to Bowman Field, Kentucky. And influx of personnel increased the organization from a cadre to approximately half its T/O strength. The organization continued to haul cargo to diverse points while at Bowman Field, and, in addition, instituted an extensive training program for both flying and ground personnel. Training for pilots and enlisted men began for the operation of C-47 transport aircraft. In early July 1942, the squadron was redesignated the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron. 
On 3 August 1942, the squadron moved from Bowman Field, Kentucky to the Army Air Base, Florence, South Carolina. The movement was completed on 5 August. The squadron began to gather its required strength of pilots and enlisted man as combat crews, and its allotted quota of aircraft. An intensive overseas training program was immediately undertaken. Flying personnel engaged in night flying and dropped paratroops in southern maneuvers. Ground personnel were given infantry and commando training. While at Florence, the number of aircraft in the unit was raised to a maximum of thirteen. The squadron sustained its first loss of personnel when Sergeant Joseph Archembault died on 29 August 1942, at Florence, S.C., as a result of injuries received in a motor vehicle accident. 
In September 1942, seventy-two officers and enlisted men formed an air echelon and departed for Hamilton Field, California, for overseas transition training. Two weeks later, on 20 October 1942, the ground echelon departed Florence, S.C. by rail, arriving at its destination, Pittsburg, California, on 27 October 1942.
Departure for the South Pacific
On 18 October 1942, the air echelon, under the command of Captain Eugene R. Jackson, departed Hamilton Field with thirteen planes headed for the Southwest Pacific. Upon arrival at Canton Island, the evening of 21 October 1942, ten planes and crews assisted for two days in the search for Captain Eddie Rickenbacker whose B-17 had ditched in the Pacific.
The air echelon arrived at New Caledonia on 25 October 1942. Seven of the squadron's planes and crews were delayed there until 29 November 1942 to ferry personnel and supplies to Guadalcanal and New Hebrides Islands, using Tontouta as a base. Wounded personnel were returned from Guadalcanal. Here the squadron sustained its first casualties in the Southwest Pacific Area. On 8 November 1942, a C-47 with S/Sgt. Pilot Ray V. Hensman at the controls, was seen to burst into flame after takeoff, as it passed over the northerly end of Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, then in the hands of the Japanese. It has been struck by enemy ground fire. Two weeks later, on 22 November 1942, another plane was totally demolished in a take-off crash at New Hebrides carrying a load of hand grenades. the crew was seriously injured, but there were no fatalities. On 29 November, the five remaining planes departed Tantouta, joining the rest of the air echelon at Wards Drome, Port Moresby, New Guinea on 2 December 1942.
The remaining six planes continued on to Brisbane, Queensland, thence to Cairns, Queensland, and operated from there and New Guinea until 10 December 1942 when they were sent to their permanent station in New Guinea. On the first of November these six planes began to operate from Port Moresby in support of the Papuan and Buna New Guinea action.
The ground echelon departed the Golden Gate early on the morning of 3 November 1942 aboard the USS Tjisdane; arrived in Auckland, New Zealand on 22 November where it remained for four days, arriving at Brisbane, Australia on 1 December. Billited at Camp Doomben, three weeks elapsed during which training was continued (hikes, drill, weapons instructions, etc.) The squadron embarked on the supply ship Isaac Coles on 21 December. There were no troop facilities on board, and the men slept in one of the holds on strips of plywood laid on the floor. Strict smoking orders were enforced since there were thousands of tons of live ammunition, torpedoes, and bombs on board. After a seven day strenuous trip, Port Moresby, New Guinea was reached on 28 December 1942. The meeting of the air and ground echelons was a never-to-be-forgotten moment. The ground echelon was informed that although an area had been assigned, no camp had been established. The air echelon had slept in the planes, eating cold c-rations or eating occasionally at Camp Arcadia whose small kitchen appeared to be the only one on the island.
The men immediately set up pup tents and prepared sites for permanent quarters to be put up as soon as the pyramidal tents would be unloaded from the boat. 
The unit was notified that it had become a part of the newly designated 374th Troop Carrier Group, pursuant to General Order No. 32, Hq. Fifth Air Force, 12 November 1942, which was being built up in Brisbane.

During this month, two of the six aircraft, with crews, were lost. Nine enlisted men had been killed and one officer and two enlisted men were missing. One was the result of an attack by Japanese Zeros, while the other crashed in the Owen Stanley Range. Of the latter, on 10 November 1942, "The Flying Dutchman," loaded with 20 Americans of the 126th Infantry regiment crashed near Dobodura, New Guinea. Second Lieutenant George W. Vandervort and Sgt. Steven J. Pitch were killed, while Sgt. George R. Kershner, radio operator, was miraculously spared. Sgt. Kershner wandered through the New Guinea jungles for 38 days before he was rescued. Remains of Sgt. Pitch and nine infantry men were recovered in July 1944. 
During the month of January 1943, the war was brought to the men in the form of air raids. These raids resulted in little damage but they did manage to keep the men up most of the night.
During these early months, a dispute arose as to who was Commanding Officer of the squadron. Captain Eugene R. Jackson had been placed in command of the air echelon at Hamilton Field by order, of the I Troop Carrier Command at Indianapolis, Indiana. At about the same time, Captain Robert L. Ward was also assigned to the squadron at Florence, S.C. and placed in command by order of Lt. Col. Hamish McLelland, Commanding Officer of the 315th Troop Carrier Group. The issue was settled by Colonel Paul H. Prentiss, Commanding Officer, 314th Troop Carrier Group. His decision placed Captain Ward in command. His tenure of office was short due to the early promotion of Captain Jackson to Major. 
The air echelon had welcomed the arrival of the ground echelon for they had been flying daily, without rest, since their departure from the states. Now they would be able to get more rest because of the crew members who had come over with the ground echelon. Their exuberance was short lived for the battle for the Wau strip was in process and all the unit's planes were busy flying in Australian troops until the Japanese were eventually driven out, in February. 
It was during the height of this battle that another of our planes was lost to enemy action. On 1 February 1943, several flights of the squadron's planes reached the Wau strip simultaneously with 20 Japanese bombers and several fighters. The bombers dropped their loads on the strip and the fighters took after the squadron's aircraft. All escaped except for "Early Delivery," piloted by Lt. Robert H. Schwensen. The plane was last seen with two Zeros on its tail. Coincident with the Wau battle, the 33d planes were required to carry supplies to Kakoda, Doboduro, Buna, and dropping missions on the various battle fronts in Papua inaccessible to air strips. Casualties were usually evacuated on the return trips from these strips. The planes, upon approaching Wards Drome, would fly a distinctive colored streamer, indicating wounded aboard, and would be met innned1ately upon landing by American and Australian ambulances.
Group Citation
For its vital part in the Papuan Campaign between 19 September 1942 and 22 December 1942, the 374th Troop Carrier Group was cited in par. III, War Department General Order No.3, 15 January 1943. Also included in citation, lID Co. 1/:21, 6 May 1943. 
Operations was separated from Engineering in January and Lt. Cartwright was appointed Operations Officer. Communications was also established as a separate unit under the direction of Lt. Richard Krolik. 
The 33d continued to fly unprecedented numbers of troops and tons of supplies to Dobodura and Wau and Bulolo, where the enemy were being gradually pushed back into Salamau and Lae. To the Allied troops on the front lines of this sector, daily dropping missions kept them in supplies and ammunition. 
Enemy activity over the Port Moresby area was being gradually reduced to hit and run night raids of one, two and occasionally three planes. Day raids were a thing of the past so personnel had become lax in the upkeep of their slit trenches. This proved to be unfortunate when at 1000 hours on 12 April 1943 forty odd Japanese bombers and sixty-five Zeroes raided Seven Mile Strip and Wards Drome. Personnel on the strip crowded into several culverts. The 33d suffered no damage to installations or equipment. 
In July 1943, squadrons of the 375th Troop Carrier Group arrived. The 56th and 58th Squadron's were attached to the 33d for rations, quarters, and flying. These squadrons flew operational missions with the 374th Group, and under the guidance of the group's old pilots, built up experience and knowledge necessary for safe flying over the Owen Stanley Range and the southwest Pacific area in general. At the end of the month the 375th Group departed Moresby and moved to Dobodura. 
Ground and air operations against Lae and Salamua increased in tempo until the early weeks in September when Lae capitulated on the 16th. The Group's planes were soon hauling equipnent and personnel on a regular shuttle between Moresby and Lae. 
The Move to Australia
In October 1943, the entire Group moved to Australia. Headquarters and the 6th, 22d and 33d Squadrons went to Townsville and the 21st Squadron to Brisbane. The 33rd made a complete exchange of equipment with the 41st Troop Carrier Squadron, 317th Troop Carrier Group at Townsville. They in turn moved into the 33d's area at Port Moresby, taking over the equipment left by the 33rd. Although still under the administrative control of the Fifth Air Force, the Group was placed under the operational control of the Directorate of Air Transport.
A heavy schedule of operations was undertaken by the Group, and men and equipment were moved in a steady flow to all parts of Australia, especially Darwin and other West Australian military establishments. Another shuttle schedule was made between Moresby and Townsville. To the Group also fell the task of ferrying personnel from Moresby to the rest area at Mackay, Queensland. Flights from Townsville were altogether different than those from Moresby. All were at least four hours long. Here the Group would take a load to one station, offload, reload and head on 
flying until darkness or weather forced the crew to remain overnight. 
While stationed at Townsville, the number of aircraft assigned to the Squadron was increased. This enabled the 33d to step up production. Air miles flown and flying hours were almost doubled. This change came without any increase in personnel. Gradually, however, new men were added and manpower problems were overcome. During the period from October 1943 to April 1944, the squadron learned to maintain and operate twice as many aircraft as ever before, and during this period, only one major accident occurred over the Coral Sea probably as the result of bad weather.
The Move from Townsville to Port Moresby
On 14 April 1944 the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron movement from Townsville to Port Moresby began and was completed on 16 April, except for heavy vehicles and equipment scheduled to come by boat. April 20 the organization moved from temporary billets at HQ. Fifth Air Force to the permanent base at the old 54th Troop Carrier Wing area. Camp construction was started immediately. Diligent and cooperative work resulted in one of the best camp areas in New Guinea. Major Wamsley was appointed Base Commander of Wards Airdrome effective 17 April 1944. 
In the middle of May 1944, squadron operations, intelligence, and engineering moved from Wards to Jackson Drome. The move involved hauling several buildings approximately a mile and a half. At Wards Drome the Intelligence Department had ample space on the second floor of the Base Operations Building. At Jackson, the space allocated by DAT was so insufficient that it required construction of a new building. New materials being unavailable for construction, salvage from the old 6th and 33d Troop Carrier Squadrons was utilized. An interesting sidelight was the utilization of about 30 transient natives to move an old tent floor, pay being in cigarettes. During the month, in cooperation with Graves Registration and ANGAU, a thorough air search was made of the area in which the "Flying Dutchman" crashed 10 November 1942 in a mountainous region east of Port Moresby. Though there were survivors who eventually reached civilization, the plane has never been located, but another crashed plane hitherto not located was seen and photographed. 
For about four days out of the month of July 1944 the 33d flew Jack Benny, Carole Landis, and company to different bases in New Guinea. The highlight of the Communications Section activities for the month was the opening of its Radio Operator’s Training School under the supervision of Sgt. Ralph Harmon. The course covered radio repair and maintenance, theory and procedure, as well as the use of code. Training included practice in the air, as well as on the ground. 
Flights to the Philippines
The squadron was ordered to make a change of station to Finschhafen, New Guinea. Two detachments (25 enlisted men and 2 officers) departed for Finschhafen on 20 and 21 August 1944. On 22 August the movement orders were postponed by the commanding general of the Far East Air Forces. Fourteen enlisted men returned to the squadron next day. During September 1944, preparation of the new camp site at Finschhafen progressed favorably in steady rain and mud. The parachute department is the only complete department that moved up to Finschhafen. 
Between the 15th through 18 October 1944, the squadron moved to Hollandia. The new camp Site, at the base of the Cyclops Mountain Range, was formerly occupied by the 2lst Infantry Division. During October, 13 new pilots were received in the Squadron. 
Capt. Claude Patterson, 1st Lt. Eric Pearson and 2d Lt. Richard Bledsoe were the first personnel from the squadron to fly into the Philippines. On the 26th of November, flying a FEAF Headquarters plane, they took off for Palau and remained overnight there. On the following morning, they took off for Leyte, remained there almost an hour and flew back to Hollandia via Palau. 
On 17 December 1944 a new courier run was initiated: Holiandia - Biak - Morotai - Leyte and return. Toward the end of the year the squadron pilot roster increased from about 55 pilots to 105. For the year 1944, the Engineering Section maintained 90 percent of planes in commission, and there were 87 engines changed during the year, averaging 7 engines per month. During August through September, write-ups and photos were sent to home-town newspapers of various members of the squadron. 
The much expected cancellation of Australian leaves and furloughs for flying personnel came when the leave ship scheduled to take-off on 26 February 1945 was ordered cancelled. Along with this cancellation, word was received that there would be no further vacations to the mainland. The rest area at MacKay was ordered closed. While flying over Mindoro, W-588, piloted by 1st Lieutenant Frank R. Miller, was hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire on 16 February. The right aileron was almost completely shot off and a large hole shot in the right wing. Both aileron and wing had to be replaced. No injuries received by crew. 
During March 1945, the squadron flew an average of sixteen airplanes a day and logged over 4,000 hours, the equivalent of 600,000 airline miles. The hours flown exceeded those of any single month in squadron history by 750 hours. 
Moved to Nielson Field, Manila, Philippines
April 1945 was hardly underway when the squadron received its movement orders to make a change of station to Nielson Field, Manila, Philippine Islands. The organization was relieved from operational flying on the 7th and the first planeload departed at 0600. Aboard were the advance echelon of Lt. Osborne and four enlisted men with their personal equipment. Their specific duty was that of liaison with base officials. The actual movement was begun on the 8th. The advance echelon had set up a few tents just off Nichols strip where the equipment was being unloaded. Planes were unable to land on Nielson since repairs to the strip had not been completed. Lt. Barwick with the aid of several enlisted men, commenced on the 12th to survey and lay out the camp, area. Unnecessary delays were encountered when a shortage of center and corner poles for the tents was discovered. It was possible to put up only fifteen tents. Requisitions were returned "out of stock." The shortage was overcome when 144 poles were borrowed from the 9lst Engineer Battalion. Construction got under way again and six rows of tents, approximately seven tents in each row, were set up. The move was completed by the 20th with exception of three or four loads that was necessary to maintain the small detachment at Hollandia. 
Two new C-46's were received in April. Until pilots became acquainted with them, they were used for transition only. Mr. Hadely, the Curtiss-Wright representative, gave ground school for engineers and flew with Capt. Samuels and Lt. Thompson explaining and demonstrating flight operations of the Curtiss propellers.
The movement of the organization to a civilized area after a protracted stay in New Guinea was responsible for an improvement in morale.
VE and Redeployment
The construction of the new camp area, began in April, was carried on without interruption. Buildings began mushrooming in an orderly fashion all over the area during the month of May 1945. Normal operation of the squadron was disrupted by the defeat of Germany and the subsequent introduction of the Redeployment "bombshell". Ninety enlisted men and five officers had Adjusted Service Rating scores above 85. Of this group, 98% had been in the Southwest Pacific Area since November 1942. The remaining 2% attributed their high score to dependent children. The plan was responsible for a terrific upswing in the morale of the men with long overseas service. 
For the second time in the history of the squadron, an enlisted man was given a direct commission. Master Sergeant Harry Friedman was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. The only other direct appointment made was in August 1942 at Florence, South Carolina when Master Sergeant George Conley was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. The excellent record of the squadron's aircraft during this period reflected Friedman’s tireless efforts toward maintaining the desired degree of efficiency of maintenance. Within a few days of his appointment, Lt. Friedman was transferred to the 333d Repair Squadron, 4th Air Depot Group in Manila. Three C-46 aircraft were received during the month making a total of five in the squadron. 
During June 1945, “Redeployment and Readjustment" assumed the position of highest importance to the personnel of the unit. The first quota was announced on 16 June—two men, S/Sgt. Preston H. Yawn with a score of 126 and Sgt. Wallace F. Costello with a score of 123. Morale of the squadron nosedived since everyone had anticipated a much larger quota in view of the fact that the 374th Group was the original and oldest troop carrier organization in the Southwest Pacific Area. A total of 17 men had over 100 points. S/Sgt. James J. Murphy, Cpl, Francis H. Emmerich, and Pvt. Orville G. Griffith, the only men eligible under the War Department's announcement of discharging men over 40 year-of-age, were returned to the United States. 
During July 1945, the squadron released thirteen enlisted men under the Redeployment Policy. This surpassed last month's by eleven men. Of the thirteen men released, three had scores of 111 while the lowest man had 100 points. 
End of Hostilities
One BT-13 was assigned to the squadron to be used as an instrument trainer. On 27 July the BT-13 was demolished in a landing accident when it struck construction equipment at the end of the runway. A B-25 was also received to be used for a food ship. A considerable amount of work was done on this ship. All paint was removed and all moveable surfaces were replaced with new surfaces. Nielson Field, upon which the 33d Squadron is based became exceedingly congested, resulting in traffic blocks that kept aircraft attached to the squadron from getting off on time. 
August 1945 all hostilities ceased in the Southwest Pacific Area. The affect this news had on the men in the squadron was one of relief, but not great exuberance. On 31 August the squadron lost a C-46 aircraft missing on a routine flight from Merotai, Halmahera to Nielson Field. One night courier and one day courier schedule to Okinawa was added. The Japanese acceptance of Allied surrender terms in August alerted the Intelligence Department to preparing maps to Formosa and Japan. These maps were made ready and were used on August 28 when the squadron's first plane flew into Tokyo. This was the sixteenth Allied plane to land in Japan. 
The big business for the month of September 1945 was the releasing from the squadron of personnel on the Redeployment System. The aircraft that was listed as missing on a routine flight in August from Merotai, Halmahera to Manila was discovered on 25 September 7 1/2 miles from Del Monte, Mindanao airstrip where it hit a mountain at very low altitude. All crew members were killed. Courier runs to Tokyo, Morotai, and Del Monte constituted most of the flights for the month. So many key personnel were returned to the United States that the Engineering Section was very shorthanded. This month saw the lowest percentage of planes in commission, 63%, because of the personnel shortage. 
The 33d Troop Carrier Squadron was inactivated at APO 323, effective 15 February 1946. 
Statistics
Some interesting statistics on record flying time, weight hauled, and miles flown by the 33d Troop Carrier Squadron are: Flying Time, 4,039:05 hours in March 1945; Weight Hauled, 6,951,103 pounds in May 1944; and, Miles Flown, 471,474 miles in January 1945.

Shurasena

Shurasena (also written as Surasena, Shoorsen, Shursen, Shoorsaini, Shoorseni)(, ) was an ancient Yadava ruler of Mathura after whom the Surasena Kingdom or mahajanpada and the Yadava sept of Surasenas or Shoorsainis were named. According to a tradition, found in the Linga Purana (I.68.19), Shurasena was son of Kartavirya Arjuna. According to another tradition found in the Ramayana (VII.62.6) and the Vishnu Purana (IV.4.46), Shurasena was son of Shatrughna, brother of Rama. According to the Devibhagavata Purana (IV.1.2), Shurasena was father of Vasudeva (father of Krishna). He is extensively mentioned in both the Mahabharata and the Puranas as the father of Vasudeva (father of Krishna) and Pŗtha or Kunti (mother of Pandava).
Several Indian tribes such as Sainis of Punjab, Bhatis, Jadejas, some Meo clans of Rajput descent, etc. trace their origin to the Yadava tribe of Shoorsainis or Surasenas named after this eponymous Yaduvanshi king.
Likely Ancestor of Porus.
English historian James Tod considered Maharaja Shurasena to be an ancestor of king Porus:
This view has been treated as more than just probable by some other scholars who have also linked Porus to the tribe tracing its origin from Yaduvanshi king Shurasena.

<doc id="21407921" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21407921" title="Battle for Births">
Battle for Births

The Battle for Births was one of four economic battles that took place in Fascist Italy (1922–1943), the others being the Battle for Grain (to make the country more self-sufficient), the Battle for the Lira (an increase in the value of the currency), and the Battle for Land (which involved policies of land reclamation). Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, often known as "Il Duce", envisioned an Italian Empire to rival that of the Romans, and in order to carry out this objective, foresaw the need to increase the population. Mussolini pursued an often aggressive foreign policy to achieve his colonial aims: the Italian army invaded Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in October 1935. The phrase "Battle for Births" was also used, in contemporary sources, to describe policies developed in Nazi Germany.
Implementation.
Mussolini feuded with the Catholic Church over a number of issues in his time in office, but their views, at that time, coincided on the issue of gender roles and contraception: both felt that women should assume a role as wife and mother, and both disagreed with contraception and abortion, with Mussolini banning the former. The Battle for Births began in 1927: Mussolini introduced a number of measures to encourage reproduction, with an objective of increasing the population from 40 million to 60 million by 1950. Loans were offered to married couples, with part of the loan cancelled for each new child, and any married man who had more than six children was made exempt from taxation. Mussolini, who had developed a cult of personality, argued that the Italian people had a duty to himself to produce as many children as possible.
In correspondence with these incentives, laws were brought in to penalize any citizens who proved to be less productive. Bachelors were taxed increasingly, and by the late 1930s, the civil service began recruiting and promoting only those who were fertile and married. The state exercised some control over the number of women in employment through nationalized businesses, and the state-owned railway company sacked all women employed since 1915, bar war widows. These policies extended to private industry as well, with the majority of companies reserving promotions for married men.
Outcome.
Unlike the Battle for Grain and Battle for Land, which were considered to be moderately successful, the Battle for Births is seen as a failure. By 1950—seven years after Mussolini had been ousted by King Victor Emmanuel III, and five years since his execution—Italy's population stood at 47.5 million. Marriage rates stayed virtually the same during Mussolini's reign, and birth rates decreased until 1936, after which there was a modest increase. The birth rate of 112 per 1000 in 1936 was below that of pre-World War I levels (1911: 147 per 1000). Mussolini felt that the lack of enthusiasm shown by the Italian nation had cost him 15 army divisions in World War II (in which Italy had fought alongside the Axis powers).

Li Ning (Tang dynasty)

Li Ning (李寧) (793 – February 7, 812), briefly known as Li Zhou (李宙) in 809, formally Prince Crown Huizhao (惠昭太子), was a crown prince of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty during the reign of his father the Grand Emperor Xianzong.
Background.
Li Ning was born in 793, when his father Emperor Xianzong was the Prince of Guangling, during the reign of his great-grandfather Emperor Dezong, as Li Chun's oldest son. His mother was Li Chun's concubine Lady Ji. After Emperor Dezong's death in 805, Li Ning's grandfather Li Song became emperor (as Emperor Shunzong), and, as a grandson of the emperor, Li Ning was created the Prince of Pingyuan. Later in the year, Emperor Shunzong, who was seriously ill, passed the throne to Li Chun (as Emperor Xianzong). In 806, Emperor Xianzong created a number of his sons greater princely titles, and Li Ning was created the Prince of Deng. However, Li Ning's mother Consort Ji was not greatly honored, as the title she received, "Meiren" (美人), was not a unique title (potentially, there could be nine "Meiren" at one time) and was only the 15th highest title possible for imperial consorts.
As crown prince.
In 809, along with a number of imperial scholars, led by Li Jiang, requesting that Emperor Xianzong create a crown prince, Emperor Xianzong created Li Ning crown prince on May 9. He also changed Li Ning's name to Li Zhou, but soon changed it back to Li Ning. Meanwhile, Li Ning's formal investiture ceremony, initially set for the fourth month of the Chinese calendar, was delayed initially to the 10th month of the lunar year, and then delayed again, both times due to rain, but finally held in the 10th month. He died just before the Chinese new year in 812. Emperor Xianzong mourned his death with a 13-day mourning period. As the regulations on imperial ceremonies at the time lacked any regulations on the funeral for a crown prince, he put a professor of the imperial university, Pei Chai (裴茝), in charge of Li Ning's funeral.

Arthur Bagot

Arthur Gerald Bagot GC, DSC (26 April 1888 – 12 November 1979) was an Australian recipient of the Albert Medal, formerly the highest decoration for gallantry awarded to civilians or to military personnel for actions "not in the face of the enemy" in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. Bagot was awarded the Albert Medal in 1918 for his actions in removing depth charges from HM Motor Launch 356 after its engine room exploded, despite the flames, thus preventing a further explosion. With the establishment of the George Cross, the Albert Medal was discontinued and, in 1971, living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; Bagot took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross.
Early life.
Bagot was born on 26 April 1888, in Adelaide, South Australia. He was educated at St Peter's Grammar and Geelong Grammar School, before his family moved to Canada.
First World War.
Living in Vancouver, Bagot enlisted in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1916 for service in the First World War. Commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 10 September 1917.
On 12 April 1918, the engine room of HM Motor Launch 356 exploded at Dunkirk quay, and the forward petrol tanks burst into flames. Several of the launch's crew were blown overboard by the explosion, while the remainder were driven off by the fire. Flames soon began to issue forth from the cabin, and burning petrol spread on the surface of the water. As others proceeded to flee the scene, Bagot, along with Lieutenant Robin Hoare, realised the fire was threatening the aft petrol tanks and the depth charges located on board the launch. Jumping in a dinghy, the pair rowed out towards the blaze. On reaching the wreck, Bagot and Hoare removed the depth charges despite the flames; thus preventing any further explosion.
For their actions during the engagement, both Bagot and Hoare were awarded the Albert Medal. The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in the "London Gazette" on 20 August 1918, reading:
Appointed second-in-command of Motor Launch 283, Bagot was in action at the First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918. Throughout the operation, the launch conducted duties of rescuing officers and men from HMS "Brilliant" and "Sirius". Praised for his "great coolness under fire" during the engagement, Bagot was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 23 July 1918.
On 28 August 1918, Bagot was Mentioned in Despatches for "valuable services in action ... off the enemy coast". In March 1919, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant, which was made retrospective to 15 February 1918.
Later life.
Following the conclusion of the war, Bagot re-settled in Canada for a few years. Returning to Australia, he took up a mixed farming property near Piawaning, Western Australia, during 1925. In 1938, Bagot married Noel Irene Harris. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Bagot enlisted in the Citizens Military Force on 25 April 1942. Posted to the 9th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, he served in Australia with the unit until his discharge on 15 October 1945, with the rank of captain.
On retiring, Bagot and his wife moved to Perth in 1962. During 1971, the British Government announced that all living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would in future be treated as recipients of the George Cross, and were invited to exchange their medals for the latter award. As such, those who wished to exchange their insignia were invited to attend an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace to receive their George Crosses. Bagot was not fit enough to travel to London, and requested the medal be forwarded to him by registered mail. The medal was subsequently sent to the Governor of Western Australia, who presented it to Bagot on 26 November 1972.
Aged 91, Bagot died on 12 November 1979; his wife had predeceased him by seven months. Bagot was a first cousin of Lanoe Hawker, a First World War pilot and Victoria Cross recipient.

Sappho and Phaon

Sappho and Phaon is an 1809 neoclassical painting by the French painter Jacques-Louis David of Cupid, Sappho and her lover Phaon. It was commissioned by Prince Nikolai Yusupov for his Moika Palace and is now the only painting by David in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.
Sappho is shown sitting in a chair at the foot of a bed in a classically decorated room with columns, a marble floor and a view to a rural landscape outside (with Venus's birds, doves, sitting on the doorstep). Phaon stands behind the chair holding a spear and bow. On her knee is a scroll with some of her verses in praise of Phaon and Cupid kneels in front of her, holding up her lyre, which she tries to play with her right hand whilst leaning her head back to let Phaon cradle her head in his left arm.

Madonna del Ceppo

The Madonna del Ceppo is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi, commissioned to him between 1452 and 1453. It is housed in the Civic Museum of Prato, Italy (though exposed in the local Museum of Wall Painting, in the Palazzo degli Alberti). The name derives from the fact it was located over a pit of the garden of Pia Casa dei Ceppi in Palazzo Datini, in Prato. 
In the centre, the Madonna and Child are flanked by Saints Stephen and John the Baptist; below, Francesco Datini presents to the Virgin the four "Buonomini" ("Honourable Men") of the Ceppo: Andrea di Giovanni Bertelli, Filippo Manassei, Pietro Pugliesi and Jacopo degli Obizzi.

Nikolay Yusupov

Prince Nikolai Borisovich Yusupov (1750-1831) was a Russian nobleman and art collector of the house of Yusupov. He was the eldest son of Prince Boris Grigorievich Yusupov (1695-1759). He served as a senator (from 1788), diplomat (from 1783 to 1789), Actual Civil Councillor (from 1796), Minister of State Properties (1800–16), a member of the Council of State (from 1823) and Director of Imperial Theatres (1791-1796) under a series of sovereigns, including Catherine the Great, Paul I and Alexander I. He later also served as director of the Hermitage (in 1797), the Kremlin Armoury (date unknown) and the state porcelain and glass factories (c.1792).
A patron of the arts and a keen traveller, he spoke five languages and corresponded with Voltaire. As a diplomat, Prince Nikolai travelled throughout Europe, to France and Versailles, where he met Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, to Germany and Prussia, where he met Frederick the Great, to Austria, where he met Emperor Joseph II, and to Italy. During his journey he purchased a large collection of art for the tsar, acting as a mediator between the tsars and European artists.
Yusupov collected for himself alongside collecting for the tsars, and thus his own collection of paintings and objets d'art evolved from the same sources as the Imperial one. His own collection of His own collection became one of Europe's richest collections and included over 600 paintings (including many landscapes), sculptures, works of applied art, more than 20,000 books and porcelain, most of which he put on display in his estate. After 1917 his extensive collection was broken up and passed to several different museums, though the bulk of it is kept in Arkhangelskoye, the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum. In 1804, Nicholas went to Paris and frequently met Napoleon I, who presented him with a gift of three large tapestries. He also commissioned "Sappho and Phaon" from Jacques-Louis David in 1809.
In 1810 Yusupov bought Arkhangelskoye Estate, where he lived with his wife and family and which he turned into a luxurious palace, park and summer residence in Moscow. Prince Nicholas built his own porcelain factory there, with much of the artisans from France. He finally died aged 80 and was succeeded by his second and only remaining son, Prince Boris, since their elder son, Prince Nikolai, died in infancy.
Marriage and issue.
In 1793 Nikolai married Tatiana Vasilievna von Engelhardt (January 1, 1769 – May 23, 1841), one of Prince Potemkin's nieces. Their children were:

The X Factor (UK series 6)

The X Factor is a British television music competition to find new singing talent. The sixth series started on ITV on 22 August 2009 and was won by Joe McElderry on 13 December 2009. Cheryl Cole emerged as the winning mentor for the second consecutive year, the first time in the show's history that a mentor has won back-to-back series. The show was presented by Dermot O'Leary, with spin-off show "The Xtra Factor" presented by Holly Willoughby on ITV2. McElderry's winner's single was a cover version of Miley Cyrus's "The Climb". Public auditions by aspiring singers began in June 2009 and were held in five cities across the UK. Judges Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh returned for their sixth series as judges, while Dannii Minogue and Cole returned for their third and second series. For the first time, auditions were held in front of a live audience, due to. Following initial auditions, the "bootcamp" stage took place in August 2009, where the number of contestants was narrowed down to 24. The 24 contestants were split into their categories, Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups, and given a judge to mentor them at the "judges' houses" stage and throughout the finals.
During "judges' houses", the 24 acts were reduced to twelve, who went on to the live finals, with one act being eliminated each week by a combination of public vote and judges' decision until a winner was found. The live shows started on 10 October 2009. The acts performed every Saturday night with the results announced on Sundays. This was change of format from previous series in which the results were announced later on the Saturday evening.
Selection process.
Auditions.
Auditions were held during June and July 2009 across five cities: London (Excel Centre), Manchester (Manchester Central), Birmingham (ICC), Cardiff (International Arena) and Glasgow (Braehead Arena). In a change to previous series, auditions were held in front of a live audience due to the success of a similar system on "Britain's Got Talent". However, Glaswegian auditionees had already been judged using the old format, meaning that they had to apply again, as their initial audition was void.
Bootcamp.
As with the auditions, the "Bootcamp" selection stage was filmed in front of a live audience. Filming took place on 1 August at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo. Approximately 200 acts attended bootcamp. They were initially split into groups of three, and judges gave instant decisions on who would leave based on the group performances, bringing the number of acts down to 100. The judges then cut the number of acts down to 50. Following a further set of auditions, the number of contestants was narrowed to 24. Originally, the group Trucolorz were chosen by the judges for the final 24 but were disqualified due to one of the group's members being too young for the show, and they were replaced by Harmony Hood.
The contestants were then split into the usual four categories before the judges discovered which category they would mentor for the rest of the competition. The Boys (16–24) were mentored by Cole, Minogue had the Girls (16–24), Cowell mentored the Over 25s, and Walsh took charge of the Groups.
Judges' houses.
Each judge had help from a guest judge during the "Judges' houses" stage. Will Young assisted Cole in Marrakech, Morocco, Minogue had help from her sister Kylie Minogue in Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, Boyzone singer Ronan Keating helped Walsh near Lake Como in Italy, and Cowell had help from Sinitta in Los Angeles. At Judges' Houses, each act sang for their respective judge, and each judge and their guest eliminated three acts, leaving 12 acts to perform in the live shows.
Finalists and categories.
The final 12 acts were confirmed as follows:
Key:
Live shows.
The live shows began on 10 October 2009, and continued through to the finale on 12 December 2009. For this series the results shows were on Sunday nights instead of Saturdays as they were for the first five series. In another change to the format of previous years, the remaining finalists performed a song as a group at the start of each results show. As previously, each week had a different song theme. Each act performed one song on the Saturday night show and the results were announced on the Sunday. Beginning with week 8 of the live shows, with five acts remaining, each contestant would sing two songs. Up to week 8, the two acts with the fewest public votes were in the bottom two and would sing again in the "final showdown". The songs they performed in the bottom two were of their own choice and did not necessarily follow that week's theme. The four judges then each chose one act from the bottom two that they wanted to be eliminated from the show. If each act received an equal number of judges' votes, the result was deadlocked and the act with the fewest public votes was eliminated. From week 8 onwards, there was no bottom two and the act with the fewest votes was eliminated. In a change to the format of previous years, the remaining finalists performed a song as a group at the start of each results show.
Musical guests.
During each results show, either one or two guest artists would perform. Series 5 winner Alexandra Burke and Robbie Williams performed on the first live results show, with Whitney Houston and judge Cheryl Cole on the second. Michael Bublé and Westlife appeared on the third week, and Bon Jovi and JLS performed in week 4. Leona Lewis and The Black Eyed Peas performed for week 5, while week 6 featured a performance from Shakira. Susan Boyle appeared on the show for week 7 along with Mariah Carey. Rihanna and Alicia Keys performed in week 8 with Janet Jackson and Lady Gaga appearing in week 9. Guests in the final were Robbie Williams, Michael Bublé and George Michael (Saturday show) and Burke, JLS, Lewis, George Michael and Paul McCartney (Sunday show). In some weeks, the guest performers also mentored the acts in the run-up to that week's live show.
The choice of musical guests on "The X Factor" live shows had a significant impact on the UK Singles Chart. Of the seven singles that made number one from 18 October to 19 December, six of them had done so after having been performed on an "X Factor" live show the previous weekend. They were, in order: "Bad Boys" by Alexandra Burke, "Fight for This Love" by Cheryl Cole, "Everybody in Love" by JLS, "Meet Me Halfway" by the Black Eyed Peas, "You Are Not Alone" by the finalists and "Bad Romance" by Lady Gaga. This impact was noted by several commentators. After "Bad Romance" became the sixth song to reach Number One off the back of a performance on "The X Factor", James Masterton of Yahoo! Music called the show "a guarantor of Number One hits". Gennaro Castaldo of HMV remarked: "As soon as an artist goes on, almost overnight we see a surge in demand. Album sales can double or treble." He added: "In an age when there are very few truly mass-audience platforms left, the X Factor has become pivotal for those labels and artists seeking to reach a family-based audience." Paul Williams, editor of "Music Week", explained: "The impact of the programme's incredible numbers on music sales is all too evident, with the top end of the singles and albums charts week after week since the current season began heavily dominated by whoever has been on the show."
Live show details.
Week 1 (10/11 October).
Walsh was absent from the Sunday night results show due to the sudden death of Boyzone singer and close friend Stephen Gately, whom he managed. Due to this, the show did not take its usual format; there were no lights and neither O'Leary nor the three other judges made an entrance. Instead, the show commenced with O'Leary already on stage and the judges already sitting at their desk. Both O'Leary and Cowell addressed the viewers and audience regarding Gately's death and Walsh's absence. Following this, the show went on as normal with Minogue, Cowell and Cole present as judges.
With the acts in the bottom two receiving two votes each, the result was deadlocked and reverted to the earlier public vote. Kandy Rain were eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes.
Week 2 (17/18 October).
Walsh was absent from both shows this weekend, again due to Stephen Gately's death. The funeral took place on 17 October and Walsh paid his respects. This statement was released: "Due to recent tragic events, Louis Walsh will not be appearing on either the Saturday or Sunday live "The X Factor" shows this weekend as he is attending Stephen Gately's funeral. Louis has been in close contact with his acts throughout the week, although his opinions will not be represented in the show this weekend."
For the first time in the show's history, a contestant sang a cover version of a new song that had not yet even been sung live by the original recording artist. Cowell's decision for Danyl Johnson to sing "I Didn't Know My Own Strength" garnered a disapproving reception from Houston, with Cowell saying that Johnson "didn't exactly get rave reviews Houston and Davis in that room the masterclass."
Week 3 (24/25 October).

In the Republic of Ireland, the series was sponsored by Domino's Pizza.
Reception.
Ratings.
The first episode, which was broadcast on 22 August and showed the first set of auditions, attracted 9.9 million viewers; 47.9% of the viewing audience and the largest amount of viewers within its timeslot. One week later, 9.75 million people viewed the second episode; a 47.1% share of the TV audience. The third episode averaged 11.76 million viewers and a 51.9% audience share. Episode four attracted 10.26 million viewers. The fifth episode, which was scheduled directly against "Strictly Come Dancing" drew in about 9.27 million viewers, compared to 7.72 for "Strictly". "The X Factor" reached a record high number of viewers for the second and third results shows on 18 and 25 October, scoring 14.8 million viewers each. This was beaten on 8 November when the fifth results show peaked at 16.6 million people.
The final episode peaked with 19.7 million viewers when Joe McElderry was announced as the winner.
Controversy and criticism.
On 2 August 2009, "The People" reported that some bootcamp contestants felt they had been poorly treated by the show's producers; one compared the experience with that of a concentration camp and another claimed that those competing were only allowed to use the toilet twice a day. However, a spokesperson for the programme refuted the claims, saying "Yes, it was long hours but they knew what they were signing up for. The hopefuls got breakfast at the hotel and decent food throughout the day".
The new audition format (whereby auditions are held in front of a studio audience) was criticised by fans, by Cole and by certain former contestants.
The show was criticised in September 2009 for "recycling" contestants, as three singers from the final 24 acts had already been in pop bands, two had auditioned for "The X Factor" in previous years and one had appeared on "Britain's Got Talent".
Controversy began after the first live show on 10 October, after Minogue commented on press reports regarding Danyl Johnson's sexuality, sparking an online backlash. Minogue's comments received some media coverage resulting in Minogue releasing a statement on the issue:
"I want to clear up exactly what happened on last night's "X Factor" show and post my sincere apologies to anyone who took offense . I made a comment about Danyl changing the lyrics of his song. It was meant to be a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song. An openly bi-sexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'. Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show. I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention. I spoke to Danyl straight after the show last night and he wasn't offended or upset by my comments, and knew exactly what I was saying."
Minogue also apologised on the live results show on 11 October, saying Danyl was not upset by her comments. It has since been reported that Ofcom received around 4000 complaints from viewers over the comment.

Society of Friends of Russian Freedom

The Society of Friends of Russian Freedom was a group of British and American politicians, public figures and reformers, who supported the Russian opposition movement, broadly defined, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. 
English society.
The English Society of Friends of Russian Freedom was founded in April 1890. In 1892, the executive committee of the society included William Pollard Byles, Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse, Mrs. Edwin Human, Mrs. Oharies Mallet, Mrs. Marjory Pease and Edward R. Pease, G.H. Perris, J Allonson Ploton, Herbert Rix, George Standring, Adolphs Smith, Robert Spence Watson, Ethel Lilian Voynich and Wilfrid Voynich, and William W. Mackenzie.
From 1890 to 1914 Society published "Free Russia", a monthly newspaper edited by Sergei Stepniak and later Felix Volkhovsky.
American society.
Formation.
American branch of the Society was founded in April 1891 in Boston at Russian émigré Stepniak-Kravchinskii instigation. The Society formed by the local old-time reformers and former abolitionists and also their children, who were active in various social movements. The most notable persons of the SAFRF were Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Julia Ward Howe, Mark Twain, John Greenleaf Whittier and James Russell Lowell. Besides them, the Society received enthusiastic response from Francis Jackson Garrison, the son of the famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and the author and activist from Valley Falls, Lillie Wyman. According to F.F. Travis they advised Stepniak “on how to proceed” the Society and introduced him in the circle of Bostonian reformers. Higginson, Howe, Wyman, Francis Garrison and Stepniak drafted the appeal of the SAFRF – «To the Friends of Russian Freedom”, which was issued on 14 April 1891. The appeal signed 37 prominent Americans. From July 1891 till July 1894 the SAFRF published the monthly magazine “Free Russia”.
Members.
The total number of the members of the SAFRF was 164 in 1891 and 142 in 1892. The most active members of the SAFRF were Francis Garrison as the treasury, Edmund Noble as the secretary and editor of “Free Russia”, and Lazar’ Goldenberg as publisher of the magazine. The circulation of the periodical did not exceed 3000 copies. The SAFRF could not attain the public opinion to the “Russian cause” and in May 1894 the executive committee decided to suspend the American edition “Free Russia”.
Resurrection.
In 1903 the suffragist activist Alice Stone Blackwell reorganized the SAFRF. An Indiana politician William Dudley Foulke became president. The society organized the propagandist campaign of the Russian émigré Breshko-Breskovskaia in 1904-1905 in the USA.

Dance in the Vampire Bund

The plot follows the emergence of vampires into the human world, and explores how fear on both sides changes the world's status quo as they come into conflict with those who desire peace.
A 12-episode anime has been produced by Shaft.
Plot.
The story revolves around Mina Tepeş, princess-ruler of all vampires, and her protector -- Akira. Like other vampires, Mina has been in hiding with her people for many years. Seeking to end centuries of isolation, Mina gains permission to create a special district for vampires, "The Bund," off the coast of Japan by paying off the entire national debt of the Japanese government. Mina then reveals to the world the existence of vampires and her desire for both races to live together. Tensions, however, run high as fearful humans and extremist vampire factions begin to interfere with Mina's wish for peace with the human world.
Characters.
Vampires.
Vampires can be both born or created from humans. In the former case, 'True Blooded' vampires descended from a progenitor paternal figure continue through the female line, currently represented by Mina. In the latter case, vampirism appears to have an infectious aetiology, possibly a form of retrovirus. Unlike many vampire stories, transformation into a vampire is not a conscious decision but rather is caused by a vampire feeding off of a human. In recent years a "vaccine" has been developed to prevent transformation, but is only effective for up to 48 hours from the time of infection.
Compared to humans, vampire emotions are significantly more potent, causing many vampires to become violent, gluttonous for blood, and very often sexual deviants, in an effort to satiate those powerful urges; however, there also are vampires – chiefly among them those who were turned against their wills – who instead choose to become "Fangless", pulling their own fangs in order to hold onto their former human values. Such vampires face persecution from both sides, however, human and vampire alike; it is revealed early on that the creation of the Bund was in large part to provide a haven for the Fangless to live peacefully.
All vampires have a 'True Form', which is a physical representation of their innermost self, and is a very similar transformation to that of werewolves. This form can be almost anything, from a giant bat, to a lizard, to a spider, to, in Mina's case, a succubus-like figure. Very few of the vampires in the story have shown their true forms. 
In addition to human-derived vampires, there are also the "True Bloods": vampire families who possess "pure" vampiric ancestry, undiluted by human blood, whether by mating with humans or by being transformed. These are the most powerful of all Vampires in the world, but are restricted by tradition and codes of conduct when it comes to dealing with each other.
In the storyline, currently the vampire world is ruled by the royal family, the Ţepeş represented now by Mina. There are only three male "true blood" nobles left: Rozenmann, Ivanovic, and Li.
The "Dance" vampires are best classified as "living vampires" as they can age, sexually reproduce, and are still living despite being able to live with injuries fatal to humans. In one notable instance, a vampire had her organs removed to hide a bomb within her body.
The Three Clans.
The Three Clans are the most powerful of the vampire clans, save for the Royal Family itself, and are led by Rozenmann, Ivanovic, and Li. It is revealed that prior to the story, the three lords devoured the other noble clans and pursued the Royal Family. They succeeded in their campaign resulting in the extinction of the "true bloods" and the death of Queen Lucretia. However to keep the true bloodline, one is to be married to and shall bear a child with Mina, as she is the only true-blood female vampire left. In the anime, it is heavily suggested one or all of them are controlling Telomere, a terrorist group created to kill Mina. Also in the anime, they all are forced to swear their allegiance to Mina once their assassins are all defeated by Akira.

Werewolves.
The is a family of highly evolved wolves that have developed to look like humans. They have been in the service of the Tepeş family of vampires, particularly Mina Tepeş, for generations; they act as the Ţepeş empire's military and special-ops units. They are born with stronger bodies than humans, keener senses of smell and sight, and (unlike vampires) can walk around during the day. Werewolves are also said to have extremely long lifespans as mentioned by Akira in the manga when he said that werewolves were immortal (although he was leaving silver-related injuries out of this statement). The protagonist, Akira, is the son of the head of the Tepeş Beowulf forces, Wolfgang, and a Japanese woman. Akira has been Mina Ţepeş' familiar #1 servant for nearly his entire life. It was revealed in chapter 35 that all members of the earth clan are male. It is also revealed that in order for a Werewolf to reliably sire a werewolf offspring, he must impregnate a woman while in his transformed wolf-man form. Only about 30% of male children become werewolves otherwise. This act is an extremely traumatic effect on the woman which can lead to physical and/or psychological damage. Even simply gestating a werewolf child can have traumatic effects due to the demand for nutrients by the fetus during gestation. Akira's mother for instance is wheelchair-bound. Later it is revealed that the lack of female werewolves and incompatibility with vampire blood is due to genetic faults engineered into the werewolves to limit population growth and the prevent werewolf-vampire hybrids. It was also revealed in the manga that before Mina's time, the Earth Clan was evenly divided among the Pure Blood vampires but the royal family destroyed the other branches of the Earth Clan to maintain power. However the Earth Clan themselves secretly accepted the survivors and allowed them to intermingle with the Tepeş Earth Clan. Most of the Werewolves are fully devoted to Mina but there are those that resent the Princess and her ancestor and passively act against her. These Werewoles are called "The outer clan"

Antagonists.
Assassins.
At a time the Three Vampire Lords were considering who got to mate with Mina, since she must mate with one of them to create a pure blood Vampire, being the only pure blood female vampire left, as well as she can only give birth once in her life. The Lords came up with a game where each one summoned their best assassin and whose ever killed Akira would be who she had to marry.
Ivanovic's assassin in both the anime and manga is a female(later revealed to be male) shapeshifting mutant. She tries to interrogate Akira about Mina's true form, using the appearance of people close to him. Akira transforms into a werewolf while she is in the form of Mina and bites her head off. In the manga she is the first killed, but in the anime she is the second killed.
Li's assassin(s) are twin brothers who can feel each other's pain and switch places during fighting. One of the brothers is killed by Seiji Hama, and the other by Akira. In the manga, both brothers have a true form of a bat-like humanoid with claws. In the anime there is only one assassin who has a baboon true form, and is quickly the first killed by Mei Ren.
Rozenmann's assassin is Seiji Hama, a Werecat. He was originally in charge of the soldiers that attacked Mina in the first chapter, and was abandoned for failure. Given a second chance, and a power-suit he actually helped Akira with a shotgun against the "Corsican Brothers" while claiming to be a police officer. He managed to kill one of the Brothers in his werecat form before a final fight. He survived his fight and aided Akira later in the series. He is absent from the anime, but his role as an assassin is replaced by the anime-only Mei Ren
In the anime there are many differences, most likely due to the shorten time frame, where the assassins were killed off relatively quick and the Chinese assassin being only one person instead of two.
Manga side story.
In Japan, a ten-chapter companion manga was released for cell phones, running concurrently with the monthly chapters appearing in "Comic Flapper". "Dive in the Vampire Bund" takes place during the early half of "Dance in the Vampire Bund" Vol. 6, prior to Angie's arrival. It explores the origins of the deadly Pied Piper virus. 
Seven Seas Entertainment released this side story in April 2011 as "Dance in the Vampire Bund Gaiden: Dive in the Vampire Bund".
Anime.
The anime promo was released on January 2010. Since that time, all 12 episodes have aired in Japan. On March 4, 2010, North American anime distributor Funimation Entertainment announced that it has acquired the rights to Dance in the Vampire Bund and will stream and offer simulcast subtitled episodes, days after they are aired in Japan.
Censorship.
Initially, Funimation announced that the U.S. release would be released in an edited format, because of "controversial elements which, when taken out of context, could be objectionable to some audiences," and which Funimation considered "inappropriate for U.S. viewing and [...] not essential to the storyline" (nudity involving Princess Mina, who is in a nine-year-old body but is truly an aged vampire). Another title, "Strike Witches", was released unedited, despite containing some similar elements. After negative fan reaction to edited DVD and Blu-ray releases, Funimation released another statement on March 10, 2010, saying the company expects to release the show unedited based on the first seven episodes, but will make a final decision once the company has seen the final five episodes to ensure that they comply with U.S. law. It was later released in June, completely uncensored in an unedited edition. 
In October 2011, it was announced that the UK edition - distributed by Manga Entertainment - would not be censored, and that all material removed by Funimation for the US release would be included in its original form.This version was passed with a '15' rating by the BBFC.

The Love Letters from Teralba Road

The Love Letters from Teralba Road is a 1977 Australian short film directed by Stephen Wallace. In 1980 David Stratton called it "not only the most moving love story given to us by the Australian cinema, but also probably the best featurette of the decade."
Plot.
Len (Bryan Brown) and his wife Barbara (Kris McQuade) have separated after he beat her in a drunken rage. He tries to get her back with a series of letters.
Production.
Wallace found a number of letters in a Sydney flat in 1972 which had been written by a man living in Newcastle in 1959. He had beaten up his wife, who subsequently moved to Sydney, and was asking for her forgiveness. Wallace drew from these to write and direct the short film. The film is Bryan Brown's screen debut.
The budget was provided in part by the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission.
The film won three awards at the 1977 AFI Awards (Best Cinematography in a Non-Feature Film, Best Short Fiction Film, Special Award) and in 1978 the Interfilm Award at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The original woman to whom the letters had been written was tracked down by a journalist and was upset by the film and threatened to sue. She eventually agreed to not to after seeing the movie and meeting Wallace.

Palazzo Datini

Palazzo Datini is a building in Prato, Tuscany central Italy. Begun in 1383 as the residence of merchant Francesco Datini, it was subsequently decorated by some of the most notable artists of that age, such as Agnolo Gaddi and Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, both internally and on the exterior, although the latter paintings are rather damaged. It once included, in front of the current façade, a botanical garden which was among the first ones in Italy. In 1409 the Datini housed here Pope Alexander V and Louis II of Anjou, King of Naples.
After Datini's death, all the papers from his archive were shut in a wall of the buildings; they were discovered, nearly intact, in the 19th century and are now housed, for a total of some 150,000 documents, in the building.
Filippo Lippi's "Madonna del Ceppo" was once located in the palace's garden.

It is operated by Hong Kong International Airport Ferry Terminal Services Limited, a joint-venture company between Chu Kong Passenger Transport Co., Ltd and Shun Tak-China Travel Ship Management Limited. At this pier, passengers abroad can transit from Hong Kong International Airport to piers in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province or vice-versa, without immigration and customs clearance through Hong Kong. 
History.
It was a local ferry pier called Chek Lap Kok Ferry Pier (). It provided a ferry route to Tuen Mun, operated by New World First Ferry. But the route was cancelled and replaced by another route between Tuen Mun and Tung Chung New Development Ferry Pier in 2002, because the Hong Kong Airport Authority took back the pier for its own development. The route between Tuen Mun and Tung Chung ceased operation in 2008.
The pier is linked to the airport terminal by an extension of the Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover opened in December 2009, enabling travellers using the Skypier to avoid immigration and customs formalities at HKIA, cutting travel times.
Future development.
Hong Kong Government agreed to consider the suggestion for Skypier to provide cross-boundary ferry services to non-transit
passengers, in order to complement the development of Tung Chung by creating more business and job opportunities for the local communities.
Locates beside AsiaWorld Expo and Hong Kong Skycity Marriott Hotel., Skypier provides ferry services for transit passengers from Hong Kong International Airport. Architecture firm Aedas designed Skypier 
The plan to turn Skypier into a control point was nevertheless shelved.
Ferry Service.
The pier currently provides seven ferry routes to and from individual places in Pearl River Delta. Another one will be launched soon.

LNER Class A4 4902 Seagull

LNER 4902 Seagull (or "60033 Seagull" as it was renumbered under British Railways) was one of 35 Doncaster built LNER Class A4 Gresley Pacific steam locomotives.
It entered service on 28 June 1938 and was withdrawn on 29 December 1962.
Like her famous sister "Mallard", "Seagull" was one of only four of the A4 Pacifics built with a double chimney and double Kylchap blastpipe from new, the rest of the class acquiring it in the late 1950s.
"4902 Seagull" was based at Kings Cross and ran on the London-Edinburgh line.
When British Railways were nationalised and the LNER A4s were renumbered, "60033 Seagull" and two of her sisters "E22 Mallard" and "60034 Lord Faringdon" were used for the 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials. "Seagull" was used on the ex-GWR main line between London and Devonshire. Though "Seagull" didn't perform as well as the GWR locomotives which had been designed for that stretch, she performed better than "Mallard" and better than the SR and LMS competition.
60033 "Seagull" was withdrawn from Kings Cross Top Shed on 29 December 1962. She was cut up at Doncaster works on 23 January 1963.
Liveries, boilers and tenders.
"Seagull", Doncaster Works number 1876, was fitted with a Kylchap double blastpipe as from new, never having a single chimney. In her service life she wore a variety of liveries with different numbering schemes: Garter Blue as 4902 from her introduction, LNER black as of 27 May 1942, wartime black marked on tender as "NE" from 24 September 1943, renumbered as E33 on 31 October 1946, garter blue with no valances as of 5 December 1947, renumbered as 60033 on 10 April 1948, British Railways dark blue on 10 November 1950 and finally British Railways Brunswick green on 13 June 1952. Advanced Warning System (AWS) was fitted on 25 February 1953 and a Smith-Stone speed recorder was fitted on 8 June 1961.
All of the class were fitted with streamlined valances, or side skirting, from new, but these were removed during the war to ease maintenance. 4902 lost her valances during a works visit on 27 May 1942.
"Seagull" was fitted with eleven boilers during her twenty-four year career. These boilers were: 9030 (from construction), 8947 (from 4484 "Falcon", 24 September 1943), 8949 (from 60018 "Sparrow Hawk", 6 May 1949), 29278 (from 60025 "Falcon", 10 November 1950), 29313 (new-build, 13 June 1952), 29296 (from 60006 "Sir Ralph Wedgewood", 3 December 1953), 29301 (from 60022 "Mallard", 14 May 1955), 29290 (from 60029 "Woodcock", 13 June 1956), 29301 (from 60027 "Merlin", 5 March 1958), 29302 (from 60004 "William Whitelaw", 4 July 1959) and 27967 (new-build, 8 June 1961).
"Seagull" was fitted with three tenders during her career: 5636 (28 June 1938 – 30 March 1948), 5325 (9 April 1948 – 28 May 1954) and 5332 (28 May 1954 – 29 December 1962).
"Seagull" was allocated to only two depots during her career: Kings Cross Top Shed from new, Grantham from 23 April 1944 and Top Shed again from 21 March 1948.

330th Bombardment Group (VH)

The 330th Bombardment Group ("Empire Busters") was a bomber group of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. It constituted on 1 July 1942 at Salt Lake City Army Air Base, Utah. The unit fought in the Pacific Theater. Its lineage and honors were carried by the 330th Aircraft Sustainment Wing until it was permanently inactivated on 1 July 2010.
The unit was organized in 1942 as a Consolidated B-24 Liberator Replacement Training Unit (RTU) in New Mexico and Texas. In 1944, the Group was equipped with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and was assigned to the 314th Bombardment Wing, training in Kansas for deployment to the Pacific Theater. Flying from North Field, Guam as part of the Twentieth Air Force, it entered combat in April 1945. The Group received two Distinguished Unit Citations for incendiary raids on the homeland islands of Japan. The Group returned to the United States in late 1945, and was inactivated on 3 January 1946.
Lineage and honors.
Upon activation 6 July 1942, the 330th Bombardment Group (Heavy) was assigned to Second Air Force as a Consolidated B-24 Liberator Replacement Training Unit (RTU). The Group performed this training at Alamogordo Army Airfield in New Mexico, then later at Biggs Field near El Paso, Texas. On 1 April 1944, the Group was redesignated as the 330th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), assigned to the Second Air Force and was designated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress operational bomb group, being assigned to the 314th Bombardment Wing. The Group was assigned to Walker AAFB, Kansas, for equipping and training.
The Group began its deployment to North Field, Guam in early 1945, and was assigned to the XXI Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force. It entered combat on 12 April 1945 with an attack on Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama, Japan. The Group received two Distinguished Unit Citations for incendiary raids on the homeland islands of Japan. The 330th Bombardment Group returned to the United States during November and December 1945, and was inactivated on 3 January 1946.
On 27 June 1949, the unit was redesignated as the 330th Bombardment Group (Medium), activated and assigned to the United States Air Force Reserve. On 1 May 1951, the unit was ordered to active duty and its personnel transferred to Korea; and the unit (less personnel) was inactivated on 16 June 1951. On 14 June 1952 the unit was redesignated as the 330th Troop Carrier Group (Medium), but was inactivated on 14 July 1952.
The unit is credited with the American Theater, Air Offensive – Japan, and the Western Pacific campaigns.
History.
When activated in 1942, the Group functioned as an RTU, training in both New Mexico and Texas. On being designated as an operation bomber group, it was assigned to the 20th Air Force. The Group consisted of the 457th, 458th and the 459th Bomb Squadron; the 26th Photo Lab, activated in April 1944 at Walker Army Air Field, near Victoria, Kansas, also became part of the Group.
Two months later its cadres split, part of the Group remaining "on line" at Walker and part setting up manning headquarters at Dalhart, Texas. After a rapid filling up of both echelons, they were reunited at Walker AAF in August 1944. The newly assigned air crews joined them in late September and early October 1944. As a complete bomb group, they were ready for their brief period of intensive flight and ground training in slight B-29 Superfortresses. The Group's advanced ground echelon left Walker AAF by train on 7 January 1945 for the Fort Lawton Staging Area in Seattle, Washington. On 17 January 1945, they left on a 30 day journey on the Army transport Ship "Howell Lykes" en route to Guam. The air crews and the aircraft mechanics support technicians would not join them until mid-March.
Guam 1945.
The Group's ground personnel arrived in the Port of Agana, Guam on 18 February 1945. The 854th Airfield Construction Battalion was still busy putting the finishing touches on the parking aprons and taxiways for the 330th, which it had been working on since late November 1944. There were two other bomb groups of the 314th Wing just settling into North Field; the 19th Bomb Group and the 29th Bomb Group had been there for several weeks. The 330th's area of the airfield was still mainly jungle. While the 845th continued work, the ground echelon along with the 502nd Engineering Squadron of the 89th Air Service Group (ASG) began the detailed work of making the airfield operational.
The air crews continued to commute between Walker Army Air Field and Batista (Cayuga) Field in Cuba, to sharpen their combat training. Once back in Kansas in early March, they picked up their new Boeing B-29 Superfortresses and headed to Guam via Mather Field, California, Hawaii and Kwajalein. The first 330th aircraft set down at North Field, Guam on 25 March 1945.
The 330th first flew against the Empire of Japan on 12 April 1945, before its last squadron arrived. Its forty-seventh and final bombing strike was in the air at the hour the Japanese surrender was announced on 15 August 1945. The result was a bomb group with the lowest overall abort rate on the ground, and the highest over-the-target rate of any bomb group in the entire 20th Air Force. The 330th BG flew 1,320 combat sorties, 18,978 combat hours and had dropped of high explosives and incendiary bombs on its targets.
Aircraft.
The sixty or so aircraft that made up the 330th were divided into three Bombardment Squadrons (BS):
On their vertical stabilizers they wore a square black box unit identification mark with a large capital letter K superimposed. This was to assist with identifying squadron aircraft out of a crowded sky to form up on during the daylight missions. In late summer the 'K' was infilled with a bright orange–yellow paint for better recognition. In late summer in 1945, it was ordered that all aircraft would have their undersides painted a glossy black. The intention was to mask them from enemy searchlights.
Nose art.
As it was part of the 314th Wing, the 330th used the "City of ..." style for naming its aircraft. This was a large diameter Navy Blue globe with a bright orange/yellow footprint of North America. Within this would be a thick white flagpole with a wavy white "City of..." flag attached depicting either the hometown of the Aircraft Commander or one of the crewmen whose name was drawn out of a hat. They were allowed to also have other nose art on the starboard side but "bloodthirsty" art was forbidden for fear that if the aircraft was shot down, subsequent Japanese propaganda would reinforce the belief that they were flown by "barbarians" and potentially harm future downed airmen.
Missions.
The 330th Bomb Group (BG) arrived in the middle of an intensive bombing campaign by the Twentieth Air Force with the strategic objective of knocking the Japanese aircraft industry out of the war. To date, this campaign did not appear to be very successful since several major plants, such as the Nakajima Musashino Aircraft Plant north of Tokyo and the Mitsubishi Plant near Nagoya, seemed to be little damaged as a result of persistent daylight precision raids by B-29s flying in formation. A major reason was the weather which hindered both assembling in formation at a remote point and then flying to the target, which might be covered in clouds or haze making visual bombing difficult or impossible.
On a typical daylight mission, aircraft flew individually, one minute apart, from Guam to a predesignated "rallying" point about off the coast of Japan. There, they would form up on a "lead" aircraft and proceed in smaller formations of 10 aircraft or so over the target. They would then drop when they witnessed the "lead" aircraft drop, then return individually to Guam. The aircraft flew thousands of miles for 12 or more hours, and had to conserve as much fuel as possible in order to make it back to base or to Iwo Jima. Flying individually gave the pilots the ability to allow for particular conditions.
On a daylight mission, squadron visibility was the key to a successful mission – the reason for the large tail letters and individual aircraft numbers on fuselages. For some missions, it was imperative that the aircraft commander (AC) found his designated squadron and proceeded over the target at the briefed time, the briefed altitude, and hit his target. If he could not find his particular formation, he would join another group and bomb their target.
On a typical night mission, several 'Pathfinder' B-29s took off first. The rest of the squadron's aircraft took off 10–15 minutes later. Instead of 'rallying' off the coast of Japan, each aircraft would have its own pre-assigned altitude and heading over the target. Minutes before the rest of the squadron was due over the target, the 'Pathfinders' would drop incendiaries, marking it for the rest to drop on.
Whether on a daylight or nighttime mission, if the primary target was obscured, the bombers would either drop by radar or attempt to bomb a predesignated secondary target.
April 1945.
Mission: 1.
Twenty B-29s were scheduled to participate in this mission with each carrying eight general purpose bombs of Composition B high explosive. The B-29s took off in the early morning hours of 12 April. One B-29 was late in taking off, never made it to the assembly point in time and later dropped its bombs on a Target of Opportunity (TO). Two others aborted. Two formations were formed from the remaining 17 B-29s, consisting of 12 aircraft and 5 aircraft. The larger formation, at an altitude of up to , was off the briefed heading on its bomb run and had to make a second run with visibility at in haze. The smaller formation attacked the plant on a different heading. Japanese flak was described as meager and inaccurate and there was absolutely no fighter opposition. Thirteen aircraft landed back at Guam late that evening while three were diverted and landed safely at Harmon Airfield.
Bomb results were excellent; all the main buildings in the 330th's target area were damaged or destroyed, comprising 73% of the target roof area. Losses were two aircraft. One ditched in the ocean with the loss of four crew; and the other crashed and caught fire on landing at Agana after suffering damage trying to land at North Field on instruments, only one crewman surviving. As a result a second beacon was added at North Field to guide aircraft in instrument landings.
Mission: 2.
This mission, classified as a precision night mission, was a three-wing effort by the 73rd, 313th and 314th Bomb Wings (BWs) using combination loads of HE and incendiary bombs. The 330th BG contributed 16 aircraft that deposited 47.5 tons on or near its aiming point (AP) described as the Tokyo Artificial Chemical Fertilizer Plant. The reported burned out area was estimated as . Antiaircraft fire was intense and a B-29 from the 458th Bomb Squadron was one of seven lost during the mission. It was hit over Tokyo and went down in Tokyo Bay.
Mission: 3.
Twenty B-29s from the 330th BG were part of a larger effort by the 73rd, 313th and 314th BWs against the southern Tokyo suburb of Kawasaki, between Tokyo and Yokohama. The Group deposited 95.2 tons on the target. Photo analysis indicated that approximately of Tokyo was burned out that night. It was a clear night in the area and the searchlights, enemy flak and fighters were particularly effective, resulting in a loss of 13 aircraft, although none were from the 330th BG.
Mission: 4.
All but one of the remaining missions by the 330th BG in April were against airfields on Kyūshū. This was part of the XXI Bomber Command anti-Kamikaze campaign requested by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Starting with the Philippine Campaign, the Japanese Navy utilized Kamikaze tactics against American warships and carriers.
The 330th BG played an important role in the campaign. Six of the Group's nine Kyūshū airfield raids were against the Kanoya Airdrome complex and code named 'Checkbook'. Kanoya airfield was the headquarters of Admiral Matome Ugaki who skillfully directed the Kamikaze campaign from this base. Checkbook #1 took place on 17 April 1945 against the Kanoya Airdrome by 11 B-29s, which dropped 16.27 tons of HE on the complex. The aiming point (AP) for the Group was a row of buildings on the SW corner of the base. Crew reports stated hangar buildings at the base were hit and burning and, in general, bomb results were reported as good to excellent.
Mission: 5.
The 330th BG bombed the Kanoya Airdrome again the following day. This time 11 aircraft took off, with one aborting. The remaining ten B-29s proceeded in formation to Kanoya where they dropped 26.80 tons of bombs. Fighter opposition was reported as nil and flak meager and inaccurate.
Mission: 6.
Next the 330th BG was assigned to attack the Kushira Naval Air Base and 11 aircraft were dedicated to the mission. The 330th BG was joined by other BGs from the 314th Bombardment Wing. Results from crew reports ranged from unobserved to excellent. In all 40.25 tons of general purpose HE bombs were deposited on this airfield without loss.
Mission: 7.
The 330th BG supplied 11 aircraft to a composite group to attack the Kanoya Airdrome complex, one of nine Japanese air bases attacked that day. The 11 B-29s deposited 48.2 tons of bombs on the target with crews reporting unobserved to excellent results. All aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 8.
This was the second daylight precision bombing raid against a strategic target by the 330th BG. The target was the Hitachi aircraft factory located at Tachikawa (a suburb west of Tokyo).Ten 330th BG aircraft deposited 46.5 tons of bombs on the target with results described as poor. Anti-aircraft fire was reported as generally moderate to intense and accurate. This was confirmed by the six aircraft receiving minor flak damage. Eight Japanese fighters were sighted and two attacked the formation. One B-29 was lost, seen to ditch off the Japanese coast; sinking in about four minutes. Three crewmen survived the war as POWs.
Mission: 9.
This raid was planned as a precision daylight raid on the Miyakonojo airfield on southern Kyūshū, but encountered poor weather. Twenty B-29s took off but couldn't assemble, instead proceeding individually and dropping their bombs by radar. Two aircraft bombed the primary target, 15 bombed the secondary target, Miyazaki Prefecture airfield, and three dropped bombs on targets of opportunity. No enemy aircraft were encountered and only one crew reported flak. All aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 10.
The 330th BG contributed ten aircraft to a composite bomb group of the 314th BW to bomb Kanoya Airdrome. The ten B-29s dropped a total of 49.25 tons. Bombing results were described as good to excellent. All aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 11.
The 330th BG contributed twelve aircraft from one squadron to another squadron from the 19th BG to form a composite group to attack Kanoya Airdrome again. One aircraft aborted due to mechanical failure. Another joined the wrong squadron and bombed Miyakonojō Airfield instead. The ten remaining B-29s dropped a total of 49.25 tons on the target, with reportedly excellent results. There were no casualties and no aircraft lost.
Mission: 12.
Thirteen aircraft were scheduled for Kanoya this day but four failed to take off due to mechanical problems. The Group's bombs landed from the briefed AP with fair results.
Mission: 13.
The target was Tomitaka airfield on the East coast of Kyūshū. Twelve aircraft took off, but one aborted due to engine trouble. Reported results were good to excellent. There were no losses or enemy opposition.
May 1945.
Mission: 14.
Continuing with the anti-Kamikaze campaign, the 457th BS contributed nine aircraft and the 458th BS contributed ten; to a strike against the Matsuyama Naval Air Station. The anti-aircraft fire was weak but 18 enemy fighters attacked the formations, resulting in four enemy aircraft damaged. The bombing results ranged from poor to excellent. There were no casualties among the B-29 crews.
Mission: 15.
Eleven aircraft attacked Ōmura Naval Air Station. A Kawasaki Ki-61 "Hien" dropped a phosphorus bomb in the formation, which came under about six fighter attacks in all. The 314th BW summary states that the Ōmura formation had ten enemy attacks with one enemy aircraft destroyed by the 459th BS gunners. Flak was heavy caliber, meagre and 90% inaccurate. All aircraft returned to base unharmed.
Mission: 16.
In this raid 112 aircraft attacked the Ōtake Oil Refinery on Honshu in a precision daylight bombing raid in formation, including 33 from the 330th BG. The 457th BS contributed twelve B-29s; the 458th BS contributed twelve and the 459th BS contributed nine. It was estimated that 45% of the refinery unit and finished product storage areas were destroyed and the plant was probably put out of operation. Opposition was stiff. Enemy fighters made 54 attacks, damaging five B-29s. On the briefed route, anti-aircraft fire was heavy caliber but meager and inaccurate, but a few formations received intense naval fire while leaving the target. Twenty-three B-29s suffered flak damage.
Mission: 17.
This raid against the Kawanishi Aircraft Plant, near Kobe was a three-Wing effort. The 314th BW contributed 40 aircraft, of which 11 were from the 330th BG, these depositing 50 tons of bombs. The BW Report states that 39% of the plant was damaged or destroyed and collateral damage was received by adjoining Merchant Marine College, residential and manufacturing areas. No aircraft were lost.
Mission: 18.
The 14 May strike was a daylight-bombing mission against Nagoya in formation, with the 330th BG contributing 32 of the 135 aircraft from the 314th BW that hit the city. The 330th dropped 152.4 tons of bombs.
Mission: 19.
In this night raid, the 330th BG had 32 B-29s dropping 176.95 tons of bombs on the South Nagoya Urban area. The damage to Nagoya from Missions # 174 and 176 were or 13.7% of the city's built up area. Damage ranging from slight to complete destruction was inflicted on 29 numbered industrial targets and 7 unnumbered industrial targets.
Mission: 20.
This was to be a precision daylight-bombing raid in formation, with the 330th BG contributing 22 aircraft, to attack industrial targets in the Tokyo area. Due to poor weather the bombs were dropped on the primary radar target, the city of Hamamatsu, instead. It was reported that the four-Wing effort damaged , 5% of the city. One industrial target was 20% destroyed.
Mission: 21.
Taking off at 23/2000G, 35 aircraft from the 330th BG attacked the heavily defended Tokyo South Urban Area. The 330th BG was part of a combined four-Wing attack on the city. One aircraft was reported missing.
Mission: 22.
In the last major strike of the war against Tokyo, the 330th BG contributed 24 bombers and 106.8 tons of incendiary bombs. The south central Tokyo area was the focus of the attack, which included the Imperial Palace. Crews had explicit orders not to bomb Hirohito' s residence, but some bombs fell within the Tokyo Imperial Palace grounds. Total area damaged as a result of BC Missions 181 and 183 was . Most of the bombs fell south and west of the Imperial Palace. Numerous buildings within the Palace grounds were destroyed as well as areas adjacent to the Palace. A minimum of 31 numbered industrial targets were damaged or destroyed. The total city area damaged as a result of all incendiary raids was or 50.8% of the city's built up area.
Mission: 23.
Closing out the month of May, the 330th BG contributed 38 aircraft to a daylight raid against the Yokohama urban area. They dropped 203 tons of bombs on the target out of a total of 621 tons of bombs dropped by the 131 aircraft on the raid.
June.
Mission: 24.
The BG contributed 37 aircraft that dropped 150 tons of incendiaries and 6.4 tons of fragmentation bombs on the Osaka urban area. Keyes identified the target euphemistically as "Home Industries". It was believed at the time that many of the major industrial plants were supplied by factories in homes. This was found to be untrue after the war; actually many small feeder factories were intermingled in residential districts. The Group was part of a 457 effort by the XXI Bomber Command in its continuing campaign to knock out the major Japanese industrial cities. Keyes states that they took off at 02:40 () and assembled in loose formation at Iwo Jima and proceeded through soupy weather to the empire. They climbed to where they reassembled. Proceeding to the IP, they saw flak ahead and many fighters, some in pairs, which they presumed to be North American P-51 Mustangs. Many Japanese fighters; Nakajima J1N, A6M Zero, and Nakajima Ki-44 'Tojo', attacked their formation, and one attacked their plane from 12 o'clock and came within 25 yards of them before going over it. Bombs were dropped at 12:54 and more flak was seen on the way out; Keyes states that it was the most flak he had seen to date. The BG recorded a total enemy fighter toll of 16 down, 9 probable and 24 damaged by B-29 and P-51 fighters (some of these were not verified in post war analysis of Japanese records). The aircraft landed at North Field at about 17:40.
The mission was "Black Friday" for the 20th Air Force with 24 P-51 Mustangs lost. The P-51s used B-29s to guide them over the long overwater flights. Upon entering an unpredicted very large severe weatherfront the fighters lost contact with the B-29 and they had to ditch when they ran out of fuel.
Mission: 25.
Continuing the strategic fire raids against major Japanese cities, the BG contributed 31 planes to a 473-plane armada against Kobe. The BG planes deposited 170.1 tons total, of which 5.6 tons were fragmentation bombs to keep the fire fighters away from the 164.5 tons incendiary bombs deposited. This was a daylight raid with take off between 5/0100G -5/0140G. Planes proceeded to the Japanese mainland at about and, in the case of Keyes, arrived early and circled for 30 minutes before finding their formation. The formation proceeded to the IP climbing to . The target was the rail center and bombs were away at 5/0930G. Passing over the city, the formation encountered fairly accurate flak and passed to the left of a large smoke column rising up to . It was a costly mission for the XXI BC which lost 11 planes, 2.3% of the attacking force. The 330th BG lost one aircraft and all the crew were listed missing in action.
Mission: 26.
Not giving Osaka a chance to recover, the 330th BG contributed 27 planes to a 409-plane armada that struck Osaka again in a daylight raid. According to Keyes, they left Guam at 7/0450G and proceeded to Minami Iwo Jima and assembled into formation at in clear weather. After the clobbering that some formations took from Japanese fighters on 5 June 1945, Keyes was happy to see a flight of 46 P-51s escorting the formation to the Empire that day. The 330th BG planes deposited 152.38 tons of incendiary bombs and 0.8 tons fragmentation bombs on Osaka from approximately at 7/1258G. It was 10/10 cloud cover and bombs were dropped by radar. Flak was coming up close to the formation as well, so the Japanese were using radar to fire their anti-aircraft guns. In addition, crews were dumping lots of chaff to deceive Japanese RADAR. This was effective since no planes were lost from the BG and only two planes (0.5%) were lost from the entire armada. Aircraft landed at North Field between 7/2000G to 7/2100G.
Mission: 27.
This was a precision daylight raid on the Kasumigaura Naval Seaplane base northeast of Tokyo. Thirty-two airplanes were airborne at 10/0100G and returned at 10/1600G. Two planes aborted and 26 planes bombed the primary target and four planes bombed the secondary target, the city of Gifu. The Group deposited 143.75 tons of high explosive on the seaplane base. The presumed reason for this strike was to neutralize the base's capability of launching reconnaissance seaplanes to monitor the movements of the U.S. Third Fleet. This was Adm. Halsey's mobile naval task force and he was preparing a major sortie against the Empire starting on 1 July 1945. The 330th BG did not lose any aircraft a number of crewman were injured.
Mission: 28.
As part of a large armada of 494 B-29s from the XXI BC that attacked the Amagasaki urban area northwest of Osaka, the 330th BG contributed 26 planes to the raid. The planes departed at 15/0230G and landed at 15/1800G. One plane from the 330th BG hit a secondary target and six planes aborted. The bomb load was as follows: 88.75 tons from the 457th BS, 65.5 tons from the 458th BS and 48.0 tons from the 459th BS. The average bomb load for each squadron was as follows: 457th: 7.4 tons per AC; 458th: 9.4 tons per AC; 459th: 6.9 tons per AC. The surprise in these figures is the heavy bomb load per AC carried by the 458th BS. There were 33 planes hitting the primary. This fire raid was the last of the major raids that laid waste to the industrial heartland of Japan and certainly must have convinced any doubters among the Japanese military that Japan's days as a military power were rapidly diminishing. Despite the heavy bomb loads, no Group aircraft were lost. Osaka, as a result of these fire raids, as well as the strangulation on their food and raw materials caused by mining, ceased to function as a viable city by the end of July 1945.
Mission: 29.
This was the first in a series of night fire raids against minor Japanese cities (cities with a population of less than 300,000 persons). At this juncture in the bombing campaign against Japan, the XXI BC had four Bomb Wings to draw upon but attacking the urban areas of minor Japanese cities normally required only one BW to do the job. Therefore, on attack night, each BW was assigned a separate Japanese city. On this date, the 330th BG joined the three other BGs of the 314th BW to attack the city of Kagoshima on the south coast of Kyūshū with a population of 182,000. The BG deposited 203 tons of IE and the average tons per aircraft were as follows: 457th Squadron 7.4 tons per AC, the 458th Squadron 9.2 tons per AC and the 459th Squadron 7.3 tons per AC These average masked large individual plane differences. Planes departed at about 17/1700G and returned at 18/0800G. These night missions typically lasted 14 to 15 hours. In this case, later photo analysis of damage to Kagoshima indicated that approximately 44% of the built-up area was burned out. Keyes indicated that on this night mission the AP was military installations and staging areas. The night was clear over the target for K-58 with bombs away at 18/0033G from . The 314th BW History states that 74 planes bombed by radar, 8 visually and 21 by radar with visual correction. There were no planes lost and no casualties from the 330th BG.
Mission: 30.
Continuing the offensive against the minor Japanese cities, the 314th BW attacked the city of Shizuoka, located on the coast on the main rail line between Tokyo and Nagoya. It was presumably an easy target to identify by radar. The 330th BG contributed 33 planes and with three aborts 30 planes deposited 189.22 tons of incendiary bombs on the city. The tons per AC by Bomb Squadron were as follows: 457th: 5.8 per AC; 458th: 7.1 tons per AC and 459th: 6.2 per AC. They were aloft at 19/2030G and climbed to up past Iwo Jima and then up to over the city at a speed of 250 mph (CAS). Bombs were away at 20/0314G. They experienced little flak over the target but they received flak from naval ships in Suruga Bay where a major port is located. There was smoke up to but a stiff breeze was blowing it away from the city. Of the 123 planes hitting the target from the 314th BW, 54 planes bombed visually. 31 planes bombed by radar with visual correction and 37 planes bombed by radar; 1 plane could not see the target but could see the offset reference point. It was estimated that 66% of the city's built up area was consumed in the fire started by the incendiary bombs. The raid effectiveness factor was per ton. Two planes from the 314th BW were lost but none from the 330th BG. The elapsed time of this mission was 13 hours, a short mission relative to some of the daylight missions.
Mission: 31.
On this mission, the BG went back to precision daylight bombing in formation against the Japanese aircraft industry. The 330th BG sent 33 planes aloft, four of which aborted. The 29 planes assembled in formation and attacked the Mitsubishi aircraft plant at Tamashima, which produced. the Mitsubishi G4M 'Betty' aircraft. The BG deposited 174 tons of high explosive, with aircraft loads as follows: 457th: 4.9 tons per AC; 458th: 6.4 tons per AC and 459th 6.7 tons per AC. Planes were aloft at 22/0200G and returned at 22/1'715G. The 330th BG lost one aircraft will all the crew but one killed in action.
Mission: 32.
Another clear day was predicted over Honshū and a number of strategic targets that could, only be attacked in daylight were chosen for attack by the XXI BC. The 330th BG attacked the Sumitomo Duralumin Plant near Nagoya. Other BGs of the 314th BW attacked other industrial plants in the Nagoya area. The Sumitomo plant produced duralumin, the hard aluminium alloy used in airframe construction. The 33 planes took off from North Field at 26/0200G and landed at 26/1800G. Two planes aborted. two planes hit secondary targets and the remaining 29 planes dropped 155.5 tons of high explosive on the plant. The tons per aircraft were: 457th: 6.7 per AC; 458th.1: 3.5 per Aircraft and 459th: 5.6 per Aircraft. The planes were over the target at 26/1020G at . But, whatever the weather predictions, the weather at the target was otherwise. Weather in the assembly area made assembly difficult.
Mission: 33.
Continuing with the night attacks against minor Japanese cities, the 330th BG contributed 246.6 tons of incendiary bombs on Nobeoka, a relatively small city on the east coast of Kyūshū and on the main rail line running along the east coast of the island. This seemingly insignificant raid was in fact the start of an intensive bombing campaign of cities and the railroad system on this coast since it was directly in the path of the projected invasion of Kyūshū by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on 1 November 1945. The 32 planes were airborne from North Field, Guam at 28/2000G and landed at 29/1100G with bomb loads per AC as follows: 457th: 6.1 tons per AC; 458th 8.9 tons per Ac and 459th: 8.4 tons per Ac. One notes the dramatic increase in bomb loads permitted by these night incendiary raids compared to the early daylight raids over Tokyo at with planes averaging 2 to 3 tons per AC. The consensus of the crews was that this was a good mission. The target area was burning well. Scattered fires were seen with smoke rising to . But, later crews started their bomb run in clouds and smoke.
July.
Mission: 34.
The city of Shimonoseki, population 196,000, was the target of this night raid. Thirty-eight aircraft took off with one aborting. The BG deposited 180.5 tons of incendiary bombs; part of the overall load of 833 tons dropped by four groups, burning out an estimated 36% of the built up area. One B-29 dubbed "Porcupine" was using radar countermeasures for 90 minutes jamming Japanese radar. Despite the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft guns in and around Shimonseki, all aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 35.
On this mission, the Bomb Group deposited 328.5 tons; another reference gives 314.9 tons of incendiary bombs (IB) on Tokushima, a railroad hub on the eastern shore of Shikoku Island, the smallest island of the four Japanese home islands. The bomb loads were the highest of the war to date with the 457th: 10; 458th: 9.8; and 459th: 10 tons per AC. The total 314th BW deposited 1,051 tons of bombs, burning out an estimated of the town. This was 74% of the total built up area of the town for a bombing efficiency factor of per ton. Take off time on this mission was 3/1900G and the planes returned at about 4/1100G.
There were no planes lost or casualties.
Mission: 36.
The 314th BW attacked the city of Kōfu, an inland city west of Tokyo. Bombing through cloud cover, the 330th BG contributed 33 aircraft with one aborting. The BW deposited a total of 970 tons of incendiary bombs, burning down 64% or of the town with an effectiveness factor of per ton. The 330th BG flew as BW lead and received the Distinguished Unit Citation for this mission. The citation stated: " This source of power was permanently eliminated as a target and 2/3 of its industrial region was leveled in this magnificent demonstration of determination and bombing skill".
Mission: 37.
The 330th BG contributed 243.4 tons of incendiary bombs, all E-46 cluster bombs, to the 899 tons of incendiary bombs deposited by the 314th BW this night on Gifu. Thirty-four planes were aloft with three aborts and the average bomb loads were distributed as follows: 457th: 7.8; 458th: 7.8; and 459th: 8.0 tons per AC. The planes left at about 9/1700G and returned at approximately 10/0800G with bombs away between 10/0117G and the last at 10/0200G at an altitude of 14.000 -16.000 feet resulting in the bombs for the 31 planes being dropped in 43 minutes. This equates to an average time interval of 1.4 minutes between planes. This interval is important in determining the overall effectiveness of a fire raid. Later analysis indicated that (74%) of the city were burned out. The bombing efficiency factor was per ton. There was only meager, inaccurate, heavy caliber anti-aircraft fire (15,000–25,000 feet), but inaccurate and intense automatic weapon fire (2,000–5,000), which was ineffective at the bombing altitude. Again, the estimated and actual fuel consumption was very close. The calculated value was and the actual average used was . There were no planes lost or casualties.
Mission: 38.
This mission was planned as a night mission against a relatively small city, Uwajima, of 50,000 population on the west coast of Shikoku. Thirty-three planes from the 330th BG took off at 12/1700G and landed about 13/0800G. Weather was the determining factor in the poor results of this mission. There was a weather front which was north of the predicted position and close to the target, so crews flew at 14,000 -17,000 feet in the soup on instruments for 55 minutes from the front to the target and back to the edge of the front. The lower cumulus clouds over the target confused the radar pictures making identification of the target difficult. Bombs were scattered all over the countryside as only (16%) of the target area was burned as a result of the 873 tons of incendiary bombs dropped by the 314th BW on this target. The efficiency factor for this mission was per ton. The target had to be revisited at the end of July to complete the job. Radio discipline was good as no one broke radio silence in the 330th BG, but three planes in the other BGs did break radio silence. Cruise control worked out very well with the calculated average fuel consumption of comparing favorably with the actual fuel consumption of . One plane had 22 of its 187 M-47 incendiary bombs hang up in the bomb bay and they were dropped on Rota (island) before landing. There were no planes lost or casualties.
Mission: 39.
The target for this night's mission was Hiratsuka, a relatively small town south of Tokyo with an estimated population of 53,000, on the main railroad line linking Tokyo and Nagoya. Bombing by radar through complete cloud, the BG dropped 335.75 tons; and the 314th BW dropped a total of 1,163 tons of bombs on the city. This resulted in about , or 41.9% of the city destroyed for an efficiency factor of per ton. Later, crews reported a glow in the clouds with smoke mushrooming up to and explosions in the target area. All aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 40.
The 330th BG, with 31 planes, teamed up with the 19th and 29th BGs to attack Okazaki: a town lying 20 miles (30 km) to the southeast of Nagoya. The 330th BG planes were loaded with 184 M-47 IB's, each weighing about 100 lbs for a total bomb Ioad of 196.2 tons. The other BGs used M-17 and E-46 incendiary devices. The total incendiary bomb load dropped on the town was 850 tons, burning down or 68% of the total built-up area for an effectiveness factor of per ton. There were scattered clouds above the target above . This permitted nine planes to bomb visually and 22 by synchronous radar from 14,200 to . Bombs were away between 20/0152G to 20/0234G. All aircraft were back at North Field at about 20/0830G. Crews reporting on the bombing results indicted that the bombs dropped in the target area causing fires and one reported a large explosion lighting up a city block. One crew reported five trains of bombs burning in the river. Another crew saw a string of bombs north of the course near Koromo. While radio discipline appeared to be good overall, communication with the weather ship on the VHF channel appeared to leave room for improvement. Only four sightings were made of enemy aircraft and no heavy anti-aircraft fire was experienced and meager, inaccurate automatic weapon fire at lower altitude was observed. But with three BGs, totaling 94 aircraft, in the area and apparently scheduled fairly close together, mistakes were made. The 330th BG lost one aircraft.
Mission: 41.
This was the only daylight precision bombing mission in formation by the 330th BG during July. The primary visual target was the Nakajima aircraft plant near Nagoya. When the formation got there it was cloud covered. The formation then traveled to the secondary visual target and it was cloud covered as well. The formations then proceeded to the city of Tsu, Mie, about southwest of Nagoya, the primary radar target. This mission had what the Royal Air Force called a "Master of Ceremonies" when one aircraft took off before the others and was over the various targets to direct traffic. Despite flying to three targets in formation, all aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 42.
As with most night missions during July, there were scattered clouds from the base up to 6,000 to and a clear sky with visibility up to 10 miles (16 km) between 8,000 to , and clouds above that altitude. Ōmuta was a major town on the west side of Kyūshū. The 58th BW attacked it on 17–18 June 1945 with only minor damage. It had a population of 177,000 and was the focus of the 314th BW's efforts with all four bomb groups participating this night. The 330th BG had 33 planes scheduled with 11 from each Bomb Squadron. Two aircraft aborted the mission and the remaining 31 planes dropped 252.84 tons of M-47 and M-17 incendiary bombs on Omuta from 14,000 to . Altogether, the four BGs dropped 965 tons of IB on the town, burning or 46.6% of the total built up area. The efficiency factor was per ton. Despite the complaint about the weather, it was an efficient bombing strike. Its strategic value lay in the fact that Omuta was a rail hub and a port on the western side of Kyūshū and would need to be isolated before the Kyūshū invasion. The raid was planned as a classic night area-bombing mission with Pathfinder planes. This concept works only if the Pathfinders correctly mark the town and the follow-on aircraft can see the marker bombs. Otherwise, the crews were on their own. There were six Pathfinder Planes over the target between 27/0113G and the last 27/0133G and the main force was over the target from 17/0133 – 27/0201G. On many past missions, there were complaints that the weather planes provided weather information that was outdated by the time the planes reached the target. In this case the reverse was true when one Pathfinder was on its bomb run when the wind data came in. The Nav's complained that the forecasted wind directions and actual wind directions between Iwo Jima and the target were off by 90 to 100 degrees. These late and inaccurate weather reports may be the reason that one of the 457th BS Patfinder aircraft almost had its wing torn off by bombs falling on it from an aircraft overhead.
The Japanese were aware that this was an important target as well; they sent up night fighters (they had very few) and shot down one B-29 and badly damaged another -neither plane from the 330th BG -but the demise of the B-29 was vividly described by the returning crews. Several crews saw a B-29 with one engine flaming, fired on by two sets of tracers beyond the target area; it exploded once in the air and again when it hit the ground at 27/0158G. Heavy and medium anti-aircraft fire was observed over the town but it was meager and inaccurate.
There were no planes lost or casualties on this mission.
Mission: 43.
This was a memorable mission for the 330th Bomb Group. The target was Ōgaki urban area with a population of 56,000. In the first instance one aircraft had on board Ray Clark, a newsman from Station WOW, Omaha who broadcast live back to Guam and the States. He gave a running account of the anticipation and excitement of the bomb run. This unprecedented broadcast was sent out live over three networks and recorded for repeat broadcast by two other networks. Later, Ray Clark was able to get the aircraft and crew back to Nebraska in October 1945 to participate in a Victory Bond drive. The second highlight of the mission was that the City of Ogaki was part of a 20th Air Force Psychological Warfare Effort involving the Japanese people. Certain cities, Ōgaki being one of them, was the recipient of propaganda leaflets stating it would be, along with 10 other cities, firebombed in the near future and the civilians were warned to evacuate the city. The pamphlets warned that certain cities were to be bombed and they should evacuate the cities. Therefore, many Japanese cities in July and August 1945 were forewarned, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki (although the warning to Nagasaki may have come too late since the date of that mission was moved up a day due to weather predictions). The 330th BG sent 33 planes against Ogaki, dropping 227.26 tons of bombs consisting of E-46 and M-47 incendiaries. The 330th BG was joined by the 29th and 39th BGs; the 19th BG hit a different target. The total bomb load dropped on the town was 659 tons IB, burning of Ogaki for an efficiency factor of per ton, not a very effective mission. Planes left North Field, Guam at 28/1807 -1940G and returned between 29/0900G -29/1000G. Bombs were away between 29/0201 – 29/0318G. Bombing results as reported by crews was good to excellent, with the last crew over the target reporting smoke up to . Enemy opposition was stronger than met on previous night raids. Enemy fighters teamed with search lights in attacking planes with 5 passes made at three planes from the 330th BG. Meager to moderate heavy caliber anti-aircraft fire and meager to intense medium caliber anti-aircraft fire was encountered in the area with 15 to 20 searchlights with planes caught in the lights catching the most flak. The crews due to the pamphlets forewarning the Japanese of the attack and the clear night, which made a raid likely, believed the aggressive defenses. Calculated gas consumption was and the mission average was .
Three planes landed at Iwo Jima for fuel. The 330th BG lost no planes and no casualties.
August.
Mission: 44.
The 330th BG scheduled a maximum effort with 43 aircraft. Two aborted, the remaining 41 bombed the primary target, Mito urban area. An estimated 73.1% or of the town were burned for an efficiency rating of per ton. The town was located about northeast of Tokyo. The 330th BG contributed 289.71 tons to the 314th BW total of 1,145 tons. Enemy opposition was meager. Two searchlights were observed with meager and inaccurate heavy anti-aircraft and medium anti-aircraft fire. Six enemy aircraft were observed in the target area but made no attacks. All aircraft returned safely.
Mission: 45.
A minor city, Nishinomiya, population 112,000 between Kobe and Osaka was attacked this night with 6/10 cloud cover over the target during the bomb run. Thirty-three aircraft were scheduled for the mission with one 'Super Dumbo' ("a group B-29 temporarily stripped of ammunition and filled with extra fuel tanks, liferafts, BC-778 "Gibson Girl" rescue radios and supplies that could be dropped to a downed crew"), K-8, and one radar countermeasure (RCM) aircraft, K-55. Six Pathfinder aircraft carried mixed loads of M-47 and one T4/E4 and one M-46 bomb while the main force J carried E-46 incendiary clusters. The average bomb load was 7.5 tons per aircraft. The bomb run was made between 06/0125 -06/0208G at an average altitude of . Of the 27 aircraft returning directly to base, 14 bombed by radar and 13 bombed visually with crews reporting good to excellent results. Later analysis indicated that (29.65%) of the built up area was burned down. This was a joint mission with the 314th and 73rd BGs participating, dropping a total of 2,004 tons IB for an efficiency factor of per ton. It called for an average gas consumption of and the average used for the 26 planes that returned to North Field was . One plane lost an engine on the way up and bombed a target of opportunity instead of the main target.
There were no planes lost or casualties.
Mission: 46.
This was the last daylight raid of the war for the 330th BG and it was an old favorite of the XXI Bomber Command. The target was Nakajima Aircraft Engine plant northwest of Tokyo. The first strategic target hit by the B-29s in November 1944 from the Marianas and had been hit 12 times previously by the 73rd. 58th BWs and Navy Carrier Task Force planes. Just to show how sometimes the larger picture reports are misleading as to what was actually bombed, this mission is a good example. The 314th BW summary reports that 60 planes from the 314th BW bombed the Tokyo arsenal, the radar target for the Bomber Command Mission #320. The Tokyo arsenal was the primary radar target and secondary visual target. The 330th BS's assembled into four formations over a small volcanic island due south of Tokyo, called Torishima, Toshima. They then proceeded to the target with the 458th BS in the lead followed by 459th BS, 457th BS and a composite formation. Flak was encountered from landfall to the target with heavy anti-aircraft (HAA), meager to moderate and generally accurate as to altitude. Approaching the target, HAA fire increased in intensity and accuracy and continued until the formations climbed out of the target area. The 458th BS formation attacked on an axis of 70 degrees and dropped its bombs from . The 459th attacked on an axis of 175 degrees, overran the 458th BS formation, made a 360-degree turn and went over the primary target again. But, the formation could not see the target the second time around and went for the secondary visual target -Tokyo Army Arsenal. The 457th BS formation, on a heading of 72 degrees, dropped its bombs from and the composite formation on a heading of 73 degrees dropped its bombs from . Why the 459th BS was on a heading of 175 degrees is not known. The weather over the primary target was almost ideal for a precision daylight-bombing raid with a few scattered clouds and visibility of 20 miles (30 km). Despite some snafus the 330th BG received its second DUC for its performance on this mission.
There were no planes lost and no casualties.
Mission: 47.
Since 12 April 1945, when the 330th BG went into action, until 8 August 1945, the normal time interval between missions was 2 to 3 days, sometimes one day and on rare occasions, 5 days. The time between the Nakajima mission and the Kumagaya mission was six days. Two atom bombs were dropped earlier this month. One on 6 August and the other on 9 August, and there were reports that the Japanese were thinking of surrendering, but this did not materialize in any concrete message from the Japanese. So the 330th BG was forced to go out again. This time against the Kumagaya urban area with a population of 47,000 located northwest of Tokyo but it was on a main rail line to the West Coast. Departure was at 14/1800 to 14/1907G and return was 15/0814 to 15/0915G. While some of the planes were landing the ROs reported that Japan had accepted the surrender terms offered by the Allies. Forty planes had taken off from North Field with four aborts due to trouble with the Wright Cyclone engines (three aborts lost an engine and one had an engine backfire). The remaining 36 aircraft included one Super Dumbo and one RCM craft. The RCM plane carried two 2 ton HE bombs and the other 34 aircraft carried E-46 and M-47 incendiary bombs. The average bomb load depending on the reference was 7.5 tons per aircraft or 6.3 tons per aircraft. Bombs were dropped by radar as the target was completely cloud covered. There was only meager and inaccurate flak and no enemy aircraft sighted. This was a joint mission with the 313th BW and a reported total of 593 tons of IB were dropped on Kumagaya burning for an efficiency rating of per ton -not one of the most efficient area bombing missions.
Although this was the last official 'Combat' Mission for the 330th, it did not end the war for some crews. Until the Armistice was signed aboard the USS Missouri
on 2 September 1945, crews flew food packages to POW camps and participated in show-of-force missions for which they got combat mission time (important in the point system that sent troops back to the US in the following months).
So ended the war, which started for the Americans on Monday, 8 December 1941 (Tokyo time; Sunday, 7 December 1941 Washington, D.C. and Hawaii time) and ended 15 August 1945 (Tokyo time).
Miscellaneous missions.
12 April 1945 to 2 September 1945
North Field, Guam
There were four main types of reconnaissance : weather, photography, radar scope photo and measuring the enemy's radar signals. The BG also provided navigational escort for P-51 Mustangs from Iwo Jima to Japan and back. Occasionally a crew would be called upon to conduct a sea search for a downed aircraft. On 6/7 August 1945 Howard McClellan led a radar scope photography mission of various cities in southern Honshū. They saw the still-smoldering ruins of Hiroshima at twilight on 6 August 1945. On return, they described the devastation seen at Hiroshima stating that there must have been a large raid on the city to cause such damage though McClellan was not aware of any scheduled air raid on that city. Later the same night, McClellan was awakened and he personally had to describe what he had seen to General Power.
Radar jamming missions.
Early in the war, it was identified that although the Japanese had sophisticated radar, it was not used effectively.
The job of the 330th BG Radar Countermeasures Section (RCM) was to ensure that this was the case. The dramatic fall in 330th BG losses to zero in July and August 1945 was due, no doubt, to luck, but also to the work of this section. The RCM participated in all BG missions from 4 May 1945 till 15 August 1945. They searched for Japanese radar, spot jammed individual Japanese radar units and barrage jammed target areas with specially equipped B-29s called "Porcupines". Locating Japanese radar required specialized electronic equipment which was installed in these aircraft. The equipment included; a) a tuner-analyzer to measure the radar frequencies and strength and presumably the pulse width and pulse repetition frequency and b) four to five transmitters producing static noise, in effect drowning out Japanese radar signals.
They could determine whether the signals were emitted by gun laying radar or radar-directed searchlights or air-to-air radar carried by Japanese fighters. The radar countermeasures observer also noticed the coincidence of enemy signals with enemy action and the weather. What was not observed was just as important. The Japanese night fighters had no airborne radar. In a few cases, they were observed to have air-to-surface vessel (ASV) type radar. The Japanese radar operated on 75 and 200 megahertz bands but no 540-megahertz band radar was observed. The latter was the frequency of German Wurzburg radar which produced devastating results for the 8th Air Force in the European theater.
On BG missions from 4 to 25 May 1945, radar signal analyzers were carried, but no radar jamming was permitted. Only "chaff" was used during this period. Due to the concentration of gun-laying radar around Tokyo, jamming was requested but it was denied. The 20th Air Force lost the largest number of B-29s over Tokyo on 25–26 May 1945. On all subsequent missions, either spot jamming or barrage jamming of enemy radar signals was done. The "chaff" consisted of spools of foil packaged in breakout containers and each spool gave the impression on enemy radar of a B-29. B-29 gunners stated that searchlight beams sometimes followed the chaff as it floated down. A variation on the foils were packets of "straws" -straw shaped strips coated with aluminium- packed 20 to a packet and dropped by the Navigator; these gave the impression on enemy radar of 20 B-29s.
Further reports stated that the foils falling across bare electric power and communication lines shorted them out, further complicating Japanese existence.
There were 42 RCM missions starting on 4 May 1945, which included 35 regular BG missions; two missions to assist the 315th BW, which had no RCM capability, and five special radar signal search missions. During this period, 440 enemy radar signals were observed and analyzed and this information was forwarded to higher echelons for collation with information from other sources. On the regular BG missions, the RCM observer would spot or barrage jam the detected Japanese signals but, since the aircraft would be in the area for only 10 to 15 minutes, it was not effective during the entire time that the group was over the target. The Group had six Porcupine aircraft and more were being added when the war ended. These B-29s were dedicated mainly to analyzing and jamming Japanese radar signals. They were used over targets with heavy concentrations of gun-laying and searchlight-controlling radar. They would stay in the target area during the entire bombing period. RCM activities were very effective based on numerous crew reports of searchlights frantically searching the sky with little degree of accuracy when there was partial undercast cloud cover. At times of completely undercast skies, the anti-aircraft fire was totally inaccurate when radar jamming was employed. Over Shimonoseki, with over 200 anti-aircraft guns, a Porcupine was in the area and no Group planes were lost. The 315th BW planes, employing the AN/APQ-7 Eagle radar, had a long bomb run lasting 15 minutes, ideal for gun-laying radar. But at the heavily defended Kawasaki oil refinery no B-29's were lost due to the effects of the Porcupine jammers.
POW missions.
The Americans had a pretty good idea where the Japanese POW camps were located and they also knew about the atrocious living conditions in the camps since the liberation of the POW camps in the Philippines and South East Asia. The Air Force launched a humanitarian effort to immediately relieve the POWs suffering by dropping food supplies to the camps, which were spread all over the Far East. The 330th BG participated in this effort. The 73rd BW Service Center on Saipan made up the packages and the appropriate mechanism to effectively drop these supplies by parachute. It was a massive effort and the 73rd BW alone dropped 2,000 tons from 472 effective sorties to POW camps on the Japanese home islands, Korea and China. Ten planes from the 330th BG flew to Saipan to pick up the supplies. The following day, 31 August 1945, they flew to Japan and dropped the supplies on POW camps around Osaka Flying back over Tokyo, one crew, K-3 got a close look at the devastation in Tokyo and a view of the naval floatilla steaming into Tokyo Bay with the USS "Missouri" on which the surrender took place two days later. The crew of K-5 were given the task of dropping supplies to a POW camp near Hong Kong. To accomplish this they had to fly to Clark Field in the Philippines and pick up supplies and information on the location of the camp.
One aircraft was asked to fly medical and food supplies to Okinawa which had been struck by an enormous typhoon days before. They did this with wooden platforms devised to be hung in the bomb bays. These platforms were loaded with supplies and lashed into place. Upon reaching Okinawa they were met by a crew of GI's who unloaded the supplies. After topping off the gas tanks they would head back to Guam. When they flew the aircraft to the states during the Sunset Project, they used the platforms again. This time they had about six passengers. Five Army enlisted men and one officer, all of whom had priority to return to the States. They had been in the Pacific area since before Pearl Harbor.
The 330th BG lost no planes in this effort, but the 73rd BW lost four planes in the effort, including one to the Russians who forced down a B-29 over Korea. The Cold War started early in the Far East.
Show of force missions.
When Col. Reynolds moved up to Chief of Staff, 314th BW, the 330th BG continued to get important assignments. One such mission was to ferry the photographs of the Japanese surrender signing aboard the USS "Missouri" to Washington as quickly as possible. So a composite crew, consisting was formed for K-52. Since there was no runway around Tokyo long enough to land a B-29, the crew picked up the photos at Iwo Jima where they had been delivered by a B-17. The B-29 flew to Hawaii where the crew had four hours of sleep and then headed to Washington, DC. The plane lost an engine over the Rockies so they landed at Wright-Patterson AAF, Dayton, Ohio, and the photos were taken on by train to Washington, D.C.
Sept-Nov 1945 and Operation Sunset.
With victory in the Pacific achieved, the return of aircraft and crews not required for the occupation began under Sunset Project. The aircraft were operated under ATC control flown by combat crews and with passengers assigned as extra crew members. The returning aircraft passed through the Marianas, Kwajalein, Johnston Island, and John Rodgers Field (Oahu) to Mather Field, California. This effort continued through the rest of the year and on into early 1946. By New Year's Day, 653 B-29's and 601 B-24's had made the homeward journey.

Dispute pyramid

A dispute pyramid is an upside-down triangle that illustrates how many grievances result in legal proceedings, such as a trial or hearing. Court filings are at the bottom as the smallest amount, then lawyers, then claims, and finally grievances at the top with the largest number. It demonstrates how a large number of grievances, for example, one thousand, will filter down to around seven hundred claims, only one hundred lawyers will be hired, and only fifty court filings will occur out of those one thousand grievances. Researchers believe that approximately one in every twenty cases that could potentially be brought to court will actually be brought to court. The reason for this phenomenon is the existence of settlements outside the court itself, and the pyramid demonstrates this through numbers.

Adrian Bird

Sir Adrian Peter Bird, CBE, FRS, FRSE is a British geneticist and Buchanan Professor of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. Bird has spent much of his academic career in Edinburgh, from receiving his PhD in 1970 to working at the MRC Mammalian Genome Unit and later serving as director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology. His research focuses on understanding DNA methylation and CpG islands, and their role in diseases such as Rett syndrome. 
Adrian Bird has received a number of awards, such as the 2011 Gairdner Foundation International Award and 2012 Royal Society GlaxoSmithKline Prize, and he was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours list.
Early life.
Adrian Bird was born in Wolverhampton, England, but from age four lived in the town of Kidderminster, near Birmingham. He attended a grammar school in Hartlebury, achieving grades CCD for his A-level results. Whilst at school Bird played cricket and hockey for a local team.
Career.
Bird received his PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1970, following undergraduate study of Biochemistry at the University of Sussex. He went on to postdoctoral positions, first at Yale University with Joseph G. Gall, and then at the University of Zurich before returning to Edinburgh in 1975 to work at the MRC Mammalian Genome Unit, where he would stay for 11 years. It was here that Bird, along with Edwin Southern, mapped the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides along ribosomal RNA in the African clawed frog.
In 1990, Adrian Bird became Buchanan Professor of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. He helped create the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, also in Edinburgh, and served as its director from 1999 until 2011, when he was succeeded by David Tollervey. From 2000 to 2010, he was also a governor of the Wellcome Trust, serving as deputy chairman during the latter three years. 
Adrian Bird is a trustee of the charitable organisation Cancer Research UK and of the Rett Syndrome Research Trust. He also serves as a Governance Board Member of the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre.
Research.
Adrian Bird's research has focused on CpG islands and their associated binding-factor MECP2. He led the team which first identified CpG islands—originally named "HpaII tiny fragments"—in vertebrate genomes. These are short genomic regions with a high density of CpG dinucleotides, and are commonly found in an unmethylated state within or nearby to an active gene's promoter. 
Bird's group discovered that the MeCP2 protein binds specifically to methylated CpG sites, and further that disruption of this interaction causes the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome. The Bird lab also implicated nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 as an important binding partner in the MeCP2/methyl-CpG interaction.
In 2007 the Bird laboratory published a paper in the journal "Science" describing a proof-of-principle that the murine equivalent of Rett syndrome could be successfully reversed in laboratory mice. This was accomplished by reintroducing a functional MeCP2 gene and proved successful even when the condition was at an advanced stage, hinting at the possibility of a gene therapy approach to curing the human disease in the future.
Personal life.
Adrian Bird is married to fellow geneticist Cathy Abbott and has four children. At age 66, Bird was quoted as having no plans to retire, saying "we research group are still funded well and our work is still published in journals and as long as that continues, so will I."
Awards and honours.
Bird was awarded the Gabor Medal in 1999 "in recognition of his pioneering work in the study of global mechanisms by which transcription of the mammalian genome is regulated and for his exploration into the molecular basis of fundamental biological mechanisms, particularly his development of ways of analysing methylation patterns of eukaryotic DNA using endonucleases and the discovery of and continued research into a new class of DNA sequences found in all vertebrates". He received the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine in the same year, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2005. In 2011 he was a recipient of the Gairdner Foundation International Award, "for his pioneering discoveries on DNA methylation and its role in gene expression." The following year Bird won the 2012 GlaxoSmithKline Prize.
In 2013, Bird was tipped as a potential winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for "fundamental discoveries concerning DNA methylation and gene expression" though the prize later went to James Rothman, Randy Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof. He was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to science. In January 2014, Bird received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine "for his discoveries in the field of epigenetics".

Widdick Chine is a geological feature on the west coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It is west of the village of Totland.
It is a steep coastal gully, which is overgrown with vegetation. The water that used to flow down the slope has been redirected through a pipe which takes it to beach level to reduce its effect on erosion to the cliff. A set of steps have been constructed down the chine to provide access from Totland to the beach of Totland Bay.
The Chine/pipe drains water from the northern slopes of Tennyson Down.
The Isle of Wight Coastal Path passes up the steps of the chine. At the bottom of the chine is the old Totland lifeboat house.

Catherine McShane was born in Dublin, Ireland, the fourth of seventeen children born to Daniel and Kate McShane, of whom only seven survived to adulthood. In 1910 Arthur Lucan was touring Ireland and was playing his pantomime "Little Red Riding Hood" in Dublin. Here he met McShane, who successfully auditioned for a part in the show as a singer. Aged just 16 she married the 28 year old Lucan on 25 November 1913 at the Church of St Andrews in Dublin. The couple had one son, Donald Daniel Towle (2 October 1915, Dublin – 1970).
'Old Mother Riley'.
McShane and Lucan became a popular music hall and film double act during their nearly forty years together. They gradually evolved the stage characters of Old Mother Riley, with Lucan appearing in drag as Mrs Daphne Snowdrop Bluebell Riley from Dublin, and McShane playing her daughter 'Kitty Riley', whose wayward ways resulted in many of Mother Riley's amusing reactions.
McShane appeared in 14 of the 15 'Old Mother Riley' films. Lucan and McShane's marriage was difficult, possibly due to their age difference and the rumours of McShane's many affairs, and they separated in 1951. In McShane's last film, "Old Mother Riley's Jungle Treasure" (1951), their scenes were filmed on separate days. McShane opened a beauty salon, which failed, while Lucan continued to support her financially. 
Following Lucan's death in 1954, McShane continued the act with an impersonator playing the 'Mother Riley' role, but the venture was not successful. The death of her partner, Billy Bleach, from cancer of the bladder in December 1963 led to McShane having serious problems with alcohol. 
McShane was found dead at her London home on 24 March 1964, aged 66, from undisclosed causes.
Legacy.
In 1982, Alan Plater wrote a play, "On Your Way, Riley", about Arthur Lucan's life with Kitty McShane, with songs by Alex Glasgow. This was also broadcast on ITV in 1985 with Brian Murphy and Maureen Lipman in the leading roles.

Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder

Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) is a specific form of hearing loss defined by the presence of normal or near-normal Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) but the absence of normal Middle Ear Reflexes and severely abnormal or completely absent auditory brainstem response (ABRs). 
Individuals presenting with this recently recognised hearing loss appear to display sporadic windows of hearing and not. Very few (1 in 14) will go on to develop normal speech and language but with poor speech perception in background noise and in others, no speech perception and therefore language development is possible.
The condition was originally termed Auditory neuropathy (AN) and in 2001 as Auditory Neuropathy / Auditory Dys-synchrony (AN/AD) (to include those cases where no true Neuropathy was apparent). In 2008 at a meeting convened at Lake Como in Italy (Guidelines Development
Conference on the Identification and Management
of Infants with Auditory Neuropathy, International
Newborn Hearing Screening Conference, Como, Italy,
June 19–21, 2008), a group of leading authorities on the condition reached a consensus and renamed it as Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder.

Maggs Bros Ltd

Maggs Bros Ltd is one of the longest-established antiquarian booksellers in the world, established in 1853 by Uriah Maggs, born c.1828 in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. All four of Uriah’s sons eventually joined the business, taking over on his retirement in 1894.
The initial Maggs Brothers of the firm’s title were Benjamin and Henry, later joined by Charles and Ernest. In 1908, B.D.Maggs served a full (then yearly) term as President of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association (ABA). Maggs Bros. is still under family ownership, and is currently managed by Edward Maggs.
Notorious Sales.
In 1916 Maggs Bros bought the penis of Napoleon Bonaparte from the descendants of Abbé Ange Paul Vignali, who had given the last rites and surreptitiously cut off the member in question. Vignali apparently brought it to Corsica, and died in a vendetta in 1828. He passed on the memento to his sister, who at her death passed it on to her son. In 1924, the desiccated item was sold to a Dr. A. S. Rosenbach, who mounted it in a case of blue morocco and velvet. In 1927, it was exhibited at the Museum of French Art.
Maggs Brothers pulled off the greatest bookselling coup of the inter-war period, when in 1932 they successfully negotiated with the government of Soviet Russia to acquire not only a Gutenberg Bible, but also the celebrated Codex Sinaiticus.
In 1931 Ernest Maggs had travelled to the Soviet Union with a colleague, Maurice Ettinghausen, who was both a bookseller and a scholar. When they saw the priceless Codex Sinaiticus, Ettinghausen remarked to his hosts, “If you ever want to sell it, let me know." Some time later, Maggs received a postcard saying that the Soviet government would be prepared to sell the Codex Sinaiticus for 200,000 pounds. The British group countered with 40,000 pounds. Finally, a price of 100,000 pounds was agreed upon. This was the largest price that had ever been paid for a book. It was an enormous sum at the time. The British government agreed to pay half the amount and guaranteed the remainder if it were not raised by public subscription.
Maggs have regularly set book price records; in 1947 they bought a second Gutenberg Bible - the Dyson Perrins copy - for £22,000, on behalf of Sir Philip Frere, and a few years later resold it to Mrs. Doheny of California, this latter copy now the only one in Japan. In 1998 the firm set the current record for the most expensive printed book, when it bought for £4,200,000 a copy of the first book printed in England, William Caxton’s The Canterbury Tales.
Warrants.
Maggs Bros. Ltd. have been antiquarian booksellers by appointment to H.M. King George V, H.R.H. The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), H.M. King Alfonso XIII of Spain, H.M. King Manuel II of Portugal, and are currently favoured with the Royal Warrant to H.M. Queen Elizabeth II.
Its premises are at 50 Berkeley Square, widely known as the "most haunted house in London"; George Canning, Great Britain's shortest-serving Prime Minister, died there in 1827.

Chris Banks (footballer)

Christopher N. "Chris" Banks (born 12 November 1965) is an English former professional football defender, now a physiotherapist at Stoke City.
Starting his career with Port Vale in 1982, he moved on to Exeter City in 1988. He was at Bath City from 1989 to 1994, before spending ten years with Cheltenham Town. He is considered a highly significant player in the histories of both Bath and Cheltenham, both of whom he captained for many years. In all he played 766 league games in a 22-year career, between 1982 and 2004. He was promoted four times in his career, and also won the FA Trophy in 1998.
His younger brother Ian was also a professional with Port Vale, but was released after just one year; he went on to have a successful career in non-league football.
Playing career.
Banks began his career as an apprentice with Port Vale, turning professional in December 1982. He had to wait until 29 January 1985 before he made his debut, in a 1–1 draw with Northampton Town in the Football League Trophy. He went on to make seven Fourth Division and three cup appearances in 1984–85. He played nineteen league games in 1985–86, as the "Valiants" won promotion into the Third Division; he also scored his first senior goal, salvaging a point in a 1–1 draw with Burnley at Vale Park on 24 February. He played 34 games in 1986–87, as Vale secured their third tier status under the stewardship of John Rudge.
After a reserve match at Barnsley on 23 September 1987, he was attacked by a gang of youths and had his nose broken whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. He made 21 appearances in 1987–88, before he was released. He joined Exeter City in June 1988. Despite playing in all but three of the "Grecians" games the following season, Banks was released from his contract at St James Park by City manager Terry Cooper. In June 1989 he joined Bath City. He was player of the year the following season and became club captain for the four seasons after that. In five years at Twerton Park, he won the Somerset Premier Cup three times, and finished second in the Southern League in 1989–90.
In July 1994, Banks, requested a move north to a club closer to his Staffordshire home, and was signed by Cheltenham Town, along with Martin Boyle, for a combined fee of £16,000. He went on to captain the side as they rose from the Southern League to the Football League. While playing part-time at Whaddon Road he worked as a tiler, but resumed full-time football on Cheltenham's promotion to the Football League. Finishing second in the Southern League in 1996–97, the "Robins" finished second in the Football Conference in 1997–98, before going on to top the Conference table in 1998–99 under the stewardship of Steve Cotterill. Banks also played in the 1998 FA Trophy Final at Wembley, as Cheltenham beat Southport 1–0. He helped Cheltenham to the Second Division following victory in the 2002 Third Division play-off Final. He was forced to retire through injury in November 2004, and later trained to be a physiotherapist.
Post-retirement.
He worked as a postman for four years while completing his training, before he was appointed as Youth Academy Physiotherapist at Stoke City in 2007. He graduated from the University of Salford in 2007 with a degree in Physiotherapy. He worked as a postman whilst studying at university.
In the 2006 publication "Cheltenham Town Football Club 50 Greats", Banks was included in the list by authors Tom Goold and Jon Palmer.
Banks also played cricket as a spin bowler for his hometown side, Stone, who he captained to the North Staffs and South Cheshire League Premier Division title in 2006.

Michele Karen Dougherty FRS is a Professor of Space Physics at Imperial College London. She won the 2008 Hughes Medal of the Royal Society "for innovative use of magnetic field data that led to discovery of an atmosphere around one of Saturn's moons and the way it revolutionised our view of the role of planetary moons in the Solar System".
She was distinguished "for her scientific leadership of the international NASA-ESA-ASI Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and its moons". As Principal Investigator of the operation, data collection and analysis of observations from the magnetic field instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft, she strongly contributed to improve our understanding of Saturn and its moons. Her work has led to the discovery of a dynamic atmosphere with water and hydrocarbons constituents at Saturn's moon Enceladus. Such results had a strong impact on our view of planetary systems, opening up new possibilities for spacecraft missions to Saturn's moons in search for life.
Before working on the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, Professor Dougherty was involved in the magnetometer team for the Jupiter analysis of the Ulysses mission. She was also Guest Investigator on the NASA Jupiter System Data Analysis Program as part of the Galileo unmanned spacecraft.
Professor Dougherty became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012 and was recognized by the UK Science Council as one of the 100 top UK living scientists.

William Ewart Morse

William Ewart Morse (23 November 1878 – 18 December 1952) was an English businessman and Liberal Party politician, briefly member of parliament for Bridgwater and later a member of Wiltshire County Council.
Family and education.
Morse was the son of Levi Lapper Morse, a prominent Swindon shopkeeper and the Liberal Member of Parliament for the Wilton or South Division of Wiltshire from 1906-1910. He was educated at the High School, Swindon. In 1910 he married Alma the daughter of Hawthorn Thornton of South Africa, a civil engineer. They appear to have two sons and a daughter. Their second son, Stanley, was killed on active service with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1941.
Career.
Morse was a director of a limited company and a leading businessman in Swindon. His wife owned Croft Down Kennels, which bred at least one champion dog. He served as President of Swindon Chamber of Commerce and was a Freemason for 40 years, Past Master of the Royal Sussex Lodge of Emulation, 355 and held the office of Provincial Grand Standard Bearer.
Religion.
Morse, like his father, was a lifelong member of the Primitive Methodist Church. In 1923 he was one of three Primitive Methodists chosen to represent his denomination on the British Council of the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches. He was elected Vice-President of the Primitive Methodist Church for 1925-26.
Politics.
Local politics.
Morse followed his father’s path in politics as in religion, perhaps prompted by his given forenames. In local politics, Morse was a member of Swindon Town Council for 20 years. He was Chairman of the Finance Committee, an Alderman and served as Mayor of Swindon for two years. Morse was also elected to Wiltshire County Council and sat for 30 years on that authority. He also served as a Justice of the Peace and was Chairman of one of Swindon’s three rotas of Justices.
Parliament.
Morse first stood for Parliament at the 1922 general election in the Bridgwater Division of Somerset. He narrowly failed to defeat the sitting Conservative MP, Sir Robert Sanders, losing by 119 votes in a three-cornered contest. The Labour candidate, T. S. B. Williams, came in third place losing his deposit. Morse was Liberal candidate again in Bridgewater at the 1923 general election. This time he gained the seat from Sanders in a straight fight by a majority of 1,431 votes. He fought the seat again in 1924, this time in another three-cornered contest. Sanders had announced he would not fight the Bridgwater Division again after his defeat and stood down as Tory candidate. He had been replaced for the Tories by Brooks Crompton Wood. The Labour Party was represented by a local trade union official, and a former Liberal Party worker, Mr J M Boltz. Boltlz's intervention threatened to split the anti-Tory vote depriving Morse, who was said to be a strong candidate, of a seat he was otherwise predicted to hold. Boltz gained 1,966 votes and Labour again forfeited their deposit. Wood took the seat from Morse by a majority of 3,441. 
In the 1929 general election Morse switched Somerset constituencies, this time standing for the seaside seat of Weston-Super-Mare. In a three-cornered contest in which the Labour candidate Mrs C E M Borrett lost her deposit, Morse came second to the sitting Conservative MP Lord Erskine losing by 5,679 votes. He did not stand for Parliament again.
Death.
Morse died on 18 December 1952 at the age of 74 years.

The series is the third television adaptation of the manga following Meteor Garden and its sequel Meteor Garden II in Taiwan. It also resulted in a sequel Hana Yori Dango Returns and a movie adaptation Hana Yori Dango Final. It was one of the most popular dramas of the year and won many major awards.
Plot Synopsis.
Makino Tsukushi is a tough, hard-working, middle-class student at the prestigious escalator school Eitoku Gakuen. Initially, Makino wanted to attend Eitoku because her idol, an internationally renowned model named Todou Shizuka, was an alumna of the school. Not long after however, Makino discovers the superficial nature of her classmates. Their arrogance and her inability to relate to them because of her social status, limits her chances at making friends. Worse yet, the school is ruled by the F4 or Flower Four, composed of playboys Nishikado Soujiro and Mimasaka Akira, introverted Hanazawa Rui and violent and bratty Domyouji Tsukasa. The F4, sons of Japan's wealthiest and most powerful tycoons, bully fellow students out of boredom or malevolence until they are expelled or quit. 
Makino's only wish was to remain invisible in Eitoku to avoid getting into trouble. However, she is immersed into the lives of the four legendary bullies after her first and only friend at school, Sanjo Sakurako, accidentally spills juice on Domyouji's white shirt in the cafeteria and she defends her. The next day, she receives a red tag in her locker (an order from the F4 to bully the target student in whatever means possible) and as a result, the whole school turns against her. Despite the harassment, Tsukushi, the "tough weed", refuses to give in and quit. After Domyouji crushes the prawn her parents painstakingly cooked for her with his shoe, she finally snaps, knocks him out and declares war back on him. This unexpected retaliation catches him by surprise and causes him, ironically, to fall in love with her. But Tsukushi is in love with Rui, who in turn harbors romantic feelings for his childhood friend Shizuka.
The courtship between Tsukasa and Tsukushi is the main theme throughout the series. Various challenges threaten their blossoming relationship including Tsukushi's wavering feelings for Rui, the envy of fellow Eitoku students, an obsessed childhood classmate, their differences in social class, Tsukasa's brash and possessive nature, and the animosity of Domyouji Kaede, Tsukasa's mother. The first season ends with Domyouji giving the saturn necklace to Makino and her confession of love right before he leaves for New York.

William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)

William Barlow (Barlowe; alias Finch) (died 1568) was an English Augustinian prior turned bishop of four dioceses, a complex figure of the Protestant Reformation. Aspects of his life await scholarly clarification. Labelled by some a "weathercock reformer", he was in fact a staunch evangelical, an anti-Catholic and collaborator in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and dismantling of church estates; and largely consistent in his approach, apart from an early anti-Lutheran tract and a supposed recantation under Mary I of England.
Life.
An Augustinian regular canon, he became prior of Bromehill Priory, Weeting, Norfolk in 1524, having headed some smaller houses. It was dissolved by Cardinal Wolsey in 1528.
Already by 1526 he was in contact with the literature of the Protestant reformers, having brought a work of Bugenhagen to Thomas More.
Court circles.
He certainly was closely associated with the Boleyn party at Court, and so with the anti-Wolsey faction, but the details are unclear. His brother John Barlow was a member of the household of Anne Boleyn. It is said that William was sent by Henry VIII as a courier to William Knight in Rome, on the divorce negotiations; but this is also doubted, as more likely his brother John, at the end of 1527. He was also chaplain to George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, and owed advancement to the Boleyn interest at court. There is a further confused story about presentation to the living of Sundridge, Kent, and a verbal muddle with Tonbridge.
What is apparent is that William Barlow was later appointed as prior of Haverfordwest Priory, in 1534; the position was in the gift of Anne Boleyn as Marchioness of Pembroke. He was also suggested as a suffragan bishop in the diocese of St David's, but the bishop Richard Rawlins, soon to be a troublesome opponent, rejected him.
Haverfordwest Priory was soon suppressed, and Barlow was made prior of Bisham Priory, with the support of Thomas Cromwell. This he handed over to the king in 1536; but it was briefly a candidate to be upgraded to an abbey. His brothers Roger and Thomas Barlow were purchasers or grantees of Haverfordwest Priory in 1546, after its dissolution in 1536. They founded a Barlow family in Slebech. Roger Barlow was a merchant and a companion of Sebastian Cabot voyaging to South America; Thomas Barlow was rector of Catfield.
Missions to Scotland.
William Barlow, then Prior of the Monastery of Bisham, was sent to Scotland in October 1534. He went again to James V of Scotland with Sir William Howard in February 1536. Barlow wrote to Cromwell discussing the miseries of the English border people who were not well served by the judiciary, and compared their situation to the rule of a corrupt Abbot whose officers live in luxury and support his power whilst the brothers live in grievous wretchedness. At Holyroodhouse they presented the King with the ornaments of the Order of the Garter. In Edinburgh, Barlow encountered the suspicions of the King's Catholic advisors, who feared he had come to preach or take away Henry VIII' sister Margaret Tudor. Howard in his letter of 25 April 1536 referred to Barlow as 'My Lord of Saint David,' and regretted that Barlow could not advise him during his meeting with James V at Stirling Castle on Good Friday.
Howard and Barlow were in Edinburgh in May 1536, and learnt of a plan for James V to marry his mistress Margaret Erskine although they thought it was 'against the heart of all his nobles.' They heard that James had sent a messenger to the Pope asking him to forbid James to meet Henry VIII. Barlow stayed in Scotland some days after Howard's return at request of Margaret Tudor, and he joked to Cromwell that it would be no more unpleasant to leave Edinburgh than for Lot to pass out of Sodom.
Bishop in Wales.
He was successively Bishop of St Asaph in 1536, and Bishop of St David's. His appointment at St Asaph was made during his absence on a diplomatic mission to James V of Scotland, with William Howard and Robert Ferrar. Some historians have argued that he must not have been consecrated because there is no direct reference to it in the Archbishop's register. However, that Register does record his election as Bishop, the royal assent to it and his confirmation. Moreover, "the (separate) record of his consecration may easily have been lost or stolen", as clearly happened on other occasions. His consecration as Bishop is important in the issue of apostolic succession, his own consecration of Matthew Parker holds an important place in the question of the validity of Anglican orders, from the Catholic perspective.
He was involved in quarrels with his chapter, who sent up a series of articles addressed to the President of the Council of Wales, denouncing him as a heretic. Nevertheless he carried on a campaign against relics, pilgrimages, saint-worship, and other Catholic practices. He tried to suppress the cult of St David, in St David's Cathedral. The statue of "Our Lady of Cardigan", at St Dogmaels Abbey was a particular target, mentioned in his correspondence with Cromwell; the abbey was suppressed in 1536.
In despair of the western district around St David's, he sought to transfer his see to relatively central Carmarthen. He established the later custom of the bishops residing at Abergwili, a village within two miles of Carmarthen, and stripped the lead from the episcopal palace at St. David's; but the see did not move. He alienated the rich manor of Lamphey from the see. He tried to maintain a free grammar school at Carmarthen, and succeeded in obtaining the grant of some suppressed religious houses for the foundation of Christ College, Brecon, and of a grammar school there (19 January 1542).
Barlow also took part in general ecclesiastical politics. He signed the articles drawn up in 1536. He shared in composing the "Institution of the Christian Man", and supported the translation of the Bible. He vainly tried to substitute a milder policy for the Six Articles of 1530. Extreme Erastianism, which maintained that simple appointment by the monarch was enough, without episcopal consecration, to constitute a lawful bishop, he shared with Thomas Cranmer. But the other opinions he maintained—that confession was not enjoined by Scripture; that there were just three sacraments; that laymen were as competent to excommunicate heretics as bishops or priests; that purgatory was a delusion—were extreme and incautious for the end of Henry VIII's reign. At this period he was one of Cranmer's few close allies on the evangelical wing of the bishops: they two with Hugh Latimer were the main clerical supporters of humanist education, and with Thomas Goodrich were the most advanced reformers on some matters of doctrine. In 1547 he supported Cranmer's "Homilies" campaign, preaching at St Paul's Cross, early in the new reign.
Bath and Wells.
Early in the reign of Edward VI Barlow commended himself to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset by preaching against images. In 1548, he was translated to become Bishop of Bath and Wells. On 20 May of the same year he sold to the Duke seven manors, together with the Bishop's Palace, Wells, and other estates and profits of jurisdiction belonging to the see, for, it is said, £2000; of this he appears to have received £400. Bath Place and the Minories went to the Duke's brother, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. He also sold the lead from the great hall at the Bishops Palace. Barlow himself was lodged in the deanery. Finding that Dean Goodman had annexed the prebend of Wiveliscombe, Barlow deprived him. The dean in return attempted to prove him guilty of "praemunire", the deanery being a royal donative. Barlow had to accept the king's pardon, but the deprivation stood. Barlow was in complete sympathy with the rulers and reformers of the time, but Cranmer did not trust him.
He was now married to Agatha Wellesbourne. This marriage or relationship apparently anticipated the formal lifting of the requirement of clerical celibacy; the subsequent tradition around the large family of the Barlows has been attributed to compensatory apologetics.
Later life.
When Mary I of England came to the throne he resigned his bishopric, because he was married. He was a Marian exile in Germany, and Poland, after imprisonment in the Tower of London. He travelled with Catherine Willoughby, 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby and Richard Bertie. He also had an English congregation at Emden.
Under Elizabeth I he was bishop of Chichester. Almost immediately she compelled him by Act of Parliament to give up manors, including Selsey.
Works.
It has been argued that heretical pamphlets by Friar Jerome Barlow (or Barlowe) were by William Barlow. Scholarship now attributes these works, hostile to Wolsey, from 1528–9, to a Franciscan.
A work "A dialogue describing the originall ground of these Lutheran faccions, and many of their abuses" from 1531, printed by William Rastell, was reissued in 1553. It takes Martin Luther to be a heretic, and in it Barlow explains that contact with Lutherans had led into a temporary apostasy. George Joye accused Thomas More of being the real author.
Family.
His five daughters each married clergymen who were to become bishops:
William Barlow (1544–1629), writer on magnetism, was his son.
His wife Agatha died in 1595; there is a memorial to her in Easton, Hampshire.

Tim Cole

Timothy Brian Cole (July 1, 1960 – December 2, 1999) was an African-American military veteran and a Texas Tech University student wrongly convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985.
Cole attended two years of college followed by two years of service in the U.S. Army. After his Army service, he returned to college at Texas Tech in Lubbock. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison, but was posthumously pardoned.
Crime and aftermath.
Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused.
Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe asthma. DNA evidence later showed him to be innocent.
Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999, during an asthma attack. His family and the victim, through the Innocence Project of Texas, sought to clear his name. On February 6, 2009, a Texas district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. The judge, Charlie Baird, reversed the conviction and ordered Cole's record expunged. It was the first posthumous DNA exoneration in the history of the state of Texas. Cole's exoneration led to numerous changes in Texas law. 
Johnson confirmed in court that he was the rapist and asked the victim and Cole's family to forgive him. "It's been on my heart to express my sincerest sorrow and regret and ask to be forgiven," said Johnson, who is serving life in prison for two other 1985 rapes. However, Johnson cannot be charged in the Mallin case because the statute of limitations has expired.
Legislation.
The Texas Senate passed legislation to exonerate Cole. The Texas House of Representatives bill passed through committee and then the full house. After that, it went to Governor Rick Perry to be signed into law. Another bill, named after Cole, was passed by the legislature and sent to the governor on May 11, 2009. It made those who are falsely convicted of a crime eligible for $80,000 for each year of incarceration and provide them with free college tuition. The bill also established the Timothy Cole Advisory Panel on Wrongful Convictions. A panel set up to study the causes of wrongful convictions and to devise ways of preventing them is to report to the Texas governor no later than 2011. While Rick Perry stated he wanted to issue a pardon, he felt that he was not legally able to do so. However, on January 7, 2010, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott issued an opinion which cleared the way for the governor to pardon Cole. On March 2, 2010, Governor Rick Perry granted Timothy Cole the state's first posthumous pardon. 
Memorials.
On February 3, 2012, on the third anniversary of Cole's exoneration, the State of Texas unveiled a historical marker at his grave. In June 2012, the Lubbock City Council voted to honor Cole with a memorial. The $25,000 granite monument, paid for by local attorney Kevin Glasheen, is to be located on city land that will be turned into a public park.

On 25 March 2006, in a match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and Hallescher FC, Ogungbure was the subject of monkey noises from Hallescher FC Fans. In retaliation he placed two fingers above his mouth and saluted at the crowd – a reference to Adolf Hitler. First, Ogungbure was accused and reported by German police, as it is illegal to make Nazi gestures for political or abusive purposes, but criminal proceedings were dropped 24 hours later.
The team and especially a group of the supporters of FC Sachsen came up with a campaign to show their solidarity with Ogungbure. The fans' campaign "Wir sind Ade" (We are Ade-bowale) managed to raise attention for Ogungbure's situation and against racism in Germany. The initiative still exists as "Bunte Kurve" (colourful fan stand).

<doc id="21408716" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21408716" title="IVX">
IVX

IVX is a volatility index providing an intraday, VIX-like measure for any of US securities and exchange traded instruments. IVX is the abbreviation of Implied Volatility Index and is a popular measure of the implied volatility of each individual stock. IVX represents the cost level of the options for a particular security and comparing to its historical levels one can see whether IVX is high or low and thus whether options are more expensive or cheaper. IVX values can be compared for the stocks within one industry to find names which significantly differ from what is observed in overall sector.
Specifications.
IVX is an expected stock volatility over a future period. It is derived from current option prices and it is available for any optionable security
To calculate this index they use a proprietary weighting technique factoring the Delta and Vega of each option participating in its calculations. In total, 8 ATM options (4 calls and 4 puts) are used within each expiration to calculate the Call, Put and Mean Implied Volatility of each stock. This IV Index is normalized to fixed tenors (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 360, 720 days) using a linear interpolation by the variance (IV2t)
IVX and VIX have similar nature, despite some diversities in the methodology and calculation. VIX (introduced by CBOE in 2003) is counted as an option prices’ weighted average, using all available range of strikes, thus it is independent of the model used to derive implied volatilities. This technique works with a thick grid of actively traded strikes (i.e. S&P 500 and other indices), but not for the majority of optionable stocks. IVX allows calculating this measure for each individual stock, not just for the market in general.
Interpretation.
IVX is calculated in the following way: (an example based on "IVX Call 30") suppose today is 04/05/2004, and there are 12 days till front month (April) expiry — and 47 days till next month expiry (May). Options with these two expiries will be used for IV Index calculation of term 30 — as they are 2 expiries closest to 30-day virtual expiration.
First, 4 April Call options contracts with strikes nearest to current stock price (spot) are selected—they are used to calculate IV Index for April. "IVX Call April" is their weighted average, where weighting is by Vega (option price sensitivity to a change in implied volatility). Some of these options, however, can be considered "bad" and filtered out of further calculations. For example, options with expiry less than 1 week from now are always discarded. The other check is that so-called put-call parity relation should not vary significantly. This means that implied volatility values of Call and Put option in the pair are sufficiently close. Briefly, the filtering algorithm tries to eliminate suspicious option contract to make sure that the resulting IV Index figure is relevant.
In the very same way, the IV Index for May expiry is calculated, "IVX May". Now, interpolation is performed between these two values to get "IVX Call 30"; interpolation is linear by variance, that is,
formula_1
This particular interpolation is commonly used when dealing with volatilities.
History.
Implied Volatility Index was introduced in 1998 and it is a registered trade mark of 
IVolatility.com.
Criticism.
Being an excellent measure of an averaged implied volatility of the stock, IVX, however, sometimes can not be calculated for the stocks with the illiquid options that have no volume traded and huge spread in prices. This is because none of the option models will produce good volatility measure using the options with unreliable prices.
Many commented in the past on availability of IVX only as an end-of-the-day measure; however, this changed last years, and now IVX is available on an intraday basis.

Battlefield 1943

Battlefield 1943 is an online multiplayer World War II first-person shooter video game developed by EA Digital Illusions CE and published by Electronic Arts for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network via digital download only. Unlike "Battlefield 1942", this game takes place only in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II. A PC version was planned but later cancelled.
Setting.
"Battlefield 1943" casts players as either the United States Marine Corps (USMC) or the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) with up to 24 players on three classic Battlefield maps: Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima. After players collectively reached 43 million kills, their respective console versions received access to an additional Coral Sea map.
Gameplay.
Like "", "1943" features the Frostbite Engine for its environmental damage. The game only features the series' signature Conquest mode and a new gametype called Air Superiority which was unlocked when the online gaming community reached a combined total of 43 million kills in Conquest. Similar to "Battlefield Heroes", "1943" features only three classes - Infantryman, Rifleman, and Scout. Each class has an unlimited supply of ammunition; however, explosive ordnance takes a few seconds to replenish. The game also features a regenerating health system.
There are four types of vehicles in the game; fighter, tank, jeep and landing craft. Each team's base has two one-man fighter aircraft with A6M Zeros for the Imperial Navy and F4U Corsairs for the United States Marine Corps. Typically there is an airfield for either team to capture where a third plane can be used to a team's advantage. Each airplane has four machine guns and can also drop bombs. Tanks can accommodate two players, a driver who can use a tank cannon and a coaxial machine gun, and a passenger who can use a tank mounted machine gun. Jeeps can accommodate up to three players: a driver who cannot fire, a gunner in the back who operates a .30 caliber machine gun, and a passenger who can fire their own gun. Landing craft (boats) are used to deliver troops from the carriers to the beaches. Players can also use air raid bunkers to order three bomber aircraft to clear an area of a map. To operate these, the player must enter a bunker with a large spinning dish on top. Planes can be shot down by fighter pilots and anti-aircraft guns, reducing the amount of bombs that the air raid can deliver.
Development, marketing and release.
According to the game's development team, accessibility and value were the main reasons the game went digital as opposed to a retail launch.
At the time of the Xbox Live Arcade version's release, issues with server joining and statistic recording functionality were reported. DICE's Gordon Van Dyke and EA responded to the situation, noting that the player volume was higher than expected and server capacity was exceeded. To remedy the issues, EA and DICE added more servers. Van Dyke also noted that there were problems with players having trouble using their EA accounts. Despite launch problems, DICE reported that after the first day of release players had accumulated 29.45 years worth of game time and over 5 million kills. In 2011, DICE announced that development of the PC version of the game was cancelled, in order to focus onto Battlefield 3.

William Anderson (naturalist)

William Anderson (28 December 1750 North Berwick, East Lothian – 3 August 1778 Bering Sea) was a Scottish naturalist, one of the seven children of schoolmaster Robert Anderson and Jean (née Melvil). William studied medicine at Edinburgh University for the period 1766–68. He enlisted in the navy and qualified on 1 December 1768 as surgeon's first mate, being promoted to surgeon on 1 November 1770 and posted to the vessel "HMS Barfleur" (1768–1819).
Anderson accompanied James Cook on his second voyage, boarding the "Resolution" on 12 December 1771 as surgeon's mate. Anderson proved to be diligent and was chosen to accompany Cook on his third voyage as surgeon and naturalist, joining the "Resolution" again on 15 February 1776.
Though he had received no formal training as a naturalist, Anderson proved to be more than capable. He described and put together a large collection of specimens for Joseph Banks and added considerably to the knowledge of Pacific languages. He is commemorated by the botanical subgenus "Andersonia".
Anderson died of consumption on 3 August 1778 while the Resolution was on the Bering Sea. Shortly before dying he made a will leaving most of his estate to his sisters, Beth and Robinah, and to his mother's brother, William Melvil. In a letter to the Earl of Sandwich, Joseph Banks states that Anderson's family received the moneys due to them.
Disturbed by Anderson's death, Cook wrote:
Cook, though, had become confused and tried to rename St. Lawrence Island. Anderson Point in Nootka Sound commemorates William Anderson.

History of Perth, Scotland

Perth () is a city and former royal burgh in central Scotland. There has been a settlement at Perth since prehistoric times. Finds in and around Perth show that it was occupied by the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who arrived in the area more than 8,000 years ago. Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles followed the introduction of farming from about 4000 BC, and a remarkably well preserved Bronze age log boat dated to around 1000 BC was found in the mudflats of the River Tay at Carpow to the east of Perth. Carpow was also the site of a Roman legionary fortress.
Early medieval period.
The name "Perth" derives from a Pictish word for "wood" or "copse", and links the town to the Picts described by the Romans, who subsequently joined with the Scots to form the kingdom of Alba which later became known as Scotland. During much of the medieval period the town was known colloquially as "St. John's Toun" or "Saint Johnstoun" because the church at the centre of the parish was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. Perth's Pictish name, and some archaeological evidence, indicate that there must have been a settlement here from earlier times, probably at a point where a river crossing or crossings coincided with a slightly raised natural mound on the west bank of the Tay (which at Perth flows north-south), thus giving some protection for settlement from the frequent flooding. The presence of Scone two miles northeast, a royal centre of Alba from at least the reign of Kenneth I mac Ailpín (843-58), later the site of the major Augustinian abbey of the same name founded by Alexander I (1107–24), will have enhanced Perth's early importance. It was for long the effective 'capital' of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court. It was at Scone Abbey that the Stone of Destiny was kept, and on it the Kings of Scots were crowned down to Alexander III (1249–86).
12th and 13th centuries.
King David I (1124–53) granted burgh status to the town in the early 12th century, and documents from this time refer to the status of the kirk there. Many of the records taken from this time were the result of the arrival of the Dominicans or Blackfriars; Blackfriars, Perth, was established by Alexander II (1214–49) by 1240. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Perth was one of the richest trading burghs in the kingdom (along with such towns as Berwick, Aberdeen and Roxburgh), residence of numerous craftsmen, organised into guilds (e.g. the Hammermen or Glovers). There was probably some decline in prosperity during the numerous wars of the 14th century. The town also carried out an extensive trade with the Continent, and examples of foreign luxury goods have been recovered from excavations within the town (e.g., Spanish silk, fine pottery from France; wine will also have been a major import, not least for the use of the Church). The main destinations were France, the Low Countries and the Baltic. Medieval crafts are still remembered in some of the town's old street names, e.g., Skinnergate, Cutlog Vennel.
The royal castle (on or near the site of the present multi-storey car park adjacent to the new council offices), was destroyed by a flood of the Tay in 1209, one of many that have afflicted Perth over the centuries. William I (1142–1214) restored Perth's burgh status, while it remained as the nominal capital of Scotland.
14th century: English occupation.
King Edward I of England brought his armies to Perth in 1296 where the town, with only a ditch for defence and little fortification, fell quickly. Stronger fortifications were quickly implemented by the English, and plans to wall the town took shape in 1304. They remained standing until Robert the Bruce's recapture of Perth in 1312. He ordered the defences destroyed.
In 1332, the pretender Edward Balliol, son of John of Balliol, invaded to claim the throne of Scotland with the backing of Edward III of England. Robert the Bruce had died three years previously, and the regent of his infant son David II fell quickly at the hands of Balliol's army at the battle of Dupplin Moor. Balliol took Perth and the throne in September, and the Scottish Civil War ensued. Balliol himself was driven out quickly, only to return the next year. His deposition was only made complete in 1336; his supporters were eventually driven from Perth in 1339. As part of a plan to make Perth a permanent English base within Scotland, Edward III forced six monasteries in Perthshire and Fife to pay for the construction of massive stone defensive walls, towers and fortified gates around the town (1336). These followed roughly the lines of present day Albert Close, Mill Street, South Methven Street, Charterhouse Lane and Canal Street (these streets evolved from a lane around the inside of the walls). The town lade, which was led off the River Almond in an artificial channel to power the burgh mills, formed an additional line of defence around the walls. The walls were pierced by several ports or gates, whose names are still remembered: the Red Brig Port (end of Skinnergate), Turret Brig Port (end of High Street), Southgait Port (end of South Street) and the Spey Port (end of Speygate). There was probably also a minor gate leading to Curfew Row. These defences were the strongest of any town in Scotland in the Middle Ages. Though still largely complete at the time of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, they began to be demolished from the second half of the 18th century, and there are now no visible remains, at least above ground. The last tower, called the Monk's Tower (corner of Tay Street and Canal Street) was demolished about 1810.
Late 14th and 15th century.
During the Middle Ages, Perth's only parish church was the Burgh Kirk of St. John the Baptist. Medieval Perth had many other ecclesiastical buildings, including the houses of the Dominicans (Blackfriars), Observantine Franciscans (Greyfriars) and Perth Charterhouse, Scotland's only Carthusian Priory, or "Charterhouse". A little to the west of the town was the house of the Carmelites or Whitefriars, at Tullilum (corner of Jeanfield Road and Riggs Road). Also at Tullilum was a manor or tower-house of the bishops of Dunkeld. The bishops also owned a house within the burgh itself, at the corner of South Street and Watergate.
The theatre of trial by combat was first brought by Perth in 1396. The Battle of the Clans pitted Clan Chattan against Clan Cameron, each thirty strong, at the town's North Inch. This 'tournament' (actually an attempt to resolve a disruptive Highland feud) took place under the gaze of King Robert III (1390–1406) and his court, who watched the spectacle from the "Gilten Arbour", a garden attached to the House of the Blackfriars. Although records vary, Clan Chattan is understood to have won the battle, with the last of their opponents fleeing to safety across the Tay. The assassination of King James I occurred in 1437 when rebel noblemen forced entry into the house of the Dominicans or Blackfriars. Perhaps as a direct result, James was the last king to command from a throne at Perth; the capital was moved to Edinburgh in 1437.
16th century.
While political and religious strife engulfed England in the mid-16th century, John Knox began the Scottish Reformation from grass-roots level with a sermon against 'idolatry' in the burgh kirk of St. John the Baptist in 1559. An inflamed mob quickly destroyed the altars in the Kirk, then attacked the Houses of the Greyfriars and Blackfriars, and the Carthusian Priory. Scone Abbey was sacked shortly afterwards. The regent of infant Mary, Queen of Scots, her mother Marie de Guise, was successful in quelling the rioting but Presbyterianism in Perth remained strong.
There are no visible remains of the pre-Reformation religious houses of Perth, though their approximate locations are perpetuated in modern street-names. In August 1600 James VI of Scotland came to Gowrie House, the home of the Provost of Perth, the Earl of Gowrie. As a result of a misunderstanding, or a conspiracy, the king's retainers killed the Earl and his sons.
17th and 18th centuries.
Charles II was crowned at Scone, traditional site of the investiture of Kings of Scots, in 1651. However, within a year, Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarians, fresh from victory in the English Civil War, came to Perth. Cromwell established a fortified citadel on the South Inch (a large park south of the town) in 1652, one of five built around Scotland at this time to overawe and hold down the country. Perth's hospital, bridge and several dozen houses were demolished to provide building materials for this fort. Even grave slabs from the Greyfriars cemetery were used. It was given to the town in 1661 not long after Cromwell's death, and began almost immediately to be dismantled. The ditch, originally filled with water from the Tay, was still traceable in the late 18th century, but there are now no visible remains. The restoration of Charles II was not without incident, and with the Act of Settlement came the Jacobite Risings, to which Perth was supportive. The town was occupied by Jacobite supporters thrice in total (1689, 1715 and 1745).
Late 18th century to present.
In 1760, Perth Academy was founded, and major industry came to the town, now with a population of 15,000. Linen, leather, bleached products and whisky were its major exports, although the town had been a key port for centuries. In 1804, Thomas Dick received an invitation from local patrons to act as teacher in the Secession school at Methven that led to a ten years' residence there for him. The school was distinguished by efforts on his part towards popular improvement, including a zealous promotion of the study of science, the foundation of a "people's library", and what was substantially a mechanic's institute. Under the name "Literary and Philosophical Societies, adapted to the middling and lower ranks of the community", the extension of such establishments was recommended by him in five papers published in the "Monthly Magazine" in 1814. The Perth Royal Infirmary was built in 1838, although this was soon relocated due to cramped conditions by 1914 - making the hospital one of the first in Scotland to deal with X-rays. Piped water and gas became available in the 1820s, and electricity in 1901.
Despite being a garrison town and major developments, social and industrial, during the First World War, Perth remained relatively unchanged according to Dr Bill Harding in his study of the effects of the war on the people of Perth published in " On Flows the Tay: Perth and the First World War." (2000).
Given its location, Perth was perfectly placed to become a key transport centre with the coming of the railways. The first railway station in Perth was built in 1848. Horse-drawn carriage became popular in the 1890s although they were quickly replaced by electric trams.
During the Second World War, Perth's main cemetery, Wellshill Cemetery, was enlarged to provide space for the war dead of the Free Polish Forces based in Scotland. The graves are in a special section of the cemetery. The gravestones have the Polish eagle engraved on them, and at the entrance to the section is a Polish war memorial.

InfinitInk

InfinitInk is a tattoo ink designed to simplify tattoo removal. The ink breaks down more quickly in laser light than conventional inks. It is also the first tattoo ink to be developed in the United States with medical trials for safety testing.
Freedom-2, Inc. produced the ink and released it for sale with limited availability in the United States during January, 2009. , it was only available in black and red, with other colors planned. Nuvilex, Inc. acquired Freedom-2 Holdings, Inc. in March, 2009.
Technology.
The initial ink formulation consisted of inert plastic beads (made of PMMA) containing bioremovable dyes. During tattoo removal, laser light can rupture the beads allowing the ink to leak out for removal by the body's immune system. Freedom2 referred to the technology as the Particle Encapsulation and Enhancement (P2E) Platform. This method, although effective, left room for improvements to its aesthetic appeal to the artists.
The ink encapsulation technology was initially developed by Drs. Bruce Klitzman and Kim Koger at Duke University and they were granted the first patent for tattoo inks . The concept received widespread coverage in press and broadcast media (Press included the NY Times, the LA Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the Guardian, Time Magazine 2007 Invention of the Year in fashion, New York Magazine, Fortune, Self, Smithsonian, Science News, and Allure. Broadcast media included ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The Colbert Report, BET, Fox News, and Bloomberg).
It was further refined by Drs. R. Rox Anderson of Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard University with assistance from Edith Mathiowitz and A. Peter Morello of Brown University. After several iterations, Freedom2, Inc. developed a different tattoo ink formulation that they market as "permanent, yet more easily removable" than conventional tattoo ink while maintaining the same aesthetic properties demanded by tattoo artists and consumers." Freedom2 switched to a proprietary process to produce their inks. The black ink was steadily becoming more widely available . 
Applications.
The concept for this ink arose initially from potential medical uses, such as in reconstructive surgery and in radiation oncology. The company found that a permanent and safe, yet more easily removable ink would also find a market with tattoo artists for decorative tattooing.
