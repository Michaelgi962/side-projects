Ongi River

The Ongi River () flows through the endorheic Ongi River Basin in Mongolia and past Arvaikheer. In some particularly wet years, it used to empty into Ulaan Lake, in most years it dries up earlier. In recent years it has been additionally threatened by 37 mining operations within the basin, but successful pressure by Tsetsegee Munkhbayar and the Ongi River Basin Movement helped convince 35 of the operations to cease explorations and harmful activities in the region. The water and groundwater in this area may be contaminated with mercury and cyanide from the mining industry.

Surf break

A surf break (also break, shore break, or big wave break) is a permanent obstruction such as a coral reef, rock, shoal, or headland that causes a wave to break, forming a barreling wave or other wave that can be surfed, before it eventually collapses. The topography of the seabed determines the shape of the wave and type of break. Since shoals can change size and location, affecting the break, it takes commitment and skill to find good breaks. Some surf breaks are quite dangerous, since the surfer can collide with a reef or rocks below the water. Surf breaks are often defended vehemently by surfers. In 2008, surfers and environmentalists opposed a toll road project in Orange County, California that would have changed sediment patterns and affected the world-class "Trestles" surf break north of San Onofre State Beach which attracted 400,000 surfers in 2007.
In 2007, the NSW Geographical Names Register began formally recognizing names of surf breaks in Australia, defining a surf break as a "permanent obstruction such as a reef, headland, bombora, rock or sandbar, which causes waves to break".
One of the largest surf breaks in the world is the Jaws surf break in Maui, Hawaii, with waves that reach a maximum height of .
Types of breaks.
There are several types of breaks. 
Point break.
A point break refers to the place where waves hit a point of land or rocks jutting out from the coastline. Bells Beach in Australia and Jardim do Mar in Madeira, Portugal are examples of point breaks. 
Beach break.
A beach break takes place where waves break on a sandy seabed. An example of a classic beach break is Hossegor in Southern France, which is famous for waves of up to .
Reef break.
A reef break happens when a wave breaks over a coral reef or a rocky seabed. These waves are perhaps the most dangerous if a surfer wipes out badly. Example are Cloudbreak in Fiji and Jaws in Maui.
Shore break.
A shore break is a wave that breaks directly on, or very close to the shore. This happens when the beach is very steep at the shoreline. Oahu in Hawaii is known to have some of the largest shore breaks in the world, measuring up to a height of 3 - 4 meters during the winter months.

Žanis Ansons

Žanis Ansons (4 December 1911 – 24 November 1968) was a Latvian member of Waffen-SS, Germany's World War II fighting unit of the Schutzstaffel (Protective Squadron). He rose to the rank of Hauptscharführer and was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, an award given in recognition of extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. At the conclusion of the war, he was taken prisoner by the Red Army.
Biographical details.
A native of Kandava, a small town in Latvian region of Courland, Žanis Ansons was born into a farming family. He graduated local primary school in Kandava. After compulsory military service in Latvian army, he worked in his father's farm.
In the aftermath of Germany's June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, Latvia fell under German occupation, and Ansons volunteered to join the Latvian Brigade, a fighting unit incorporated into German military command. He was posted to 1st Company, 24th Talsi Police Battalion, where he remained until March 1943, when he was transferred to 3rd Company, 2nd. Latvian Regiment in the newly formed Latvian Brigade. In October he was promoted to the rank of Oberscharführer and, in April 1944, to Hauptscharführer in the 6th Company, Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS 44, 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), and fought during the Battle of Leningrad. Ansons also participated in the fighting at the Courland pocket where, according to the commendation, he exhibited bravery deserving of the Knight's Cross awarded to him in December 1944. He was the first Latvian NCO who was awarded with it.
Over the night of 27 December the Red Army had broken through the front line and penetrated about two kilometres into the rear. Ansons was sent on a reconnaissance of point 73, to determine enemy strength and positions. The eight men under his command, armed with hand grenades and machine guns, assaulted point 73 and drove off the soviet reserve and artillery observers and pushed the soviets back to their starting positions.
After capitulation of German forces in the Courland pocket, he didn't surrender and he went into hiding in forests near Mazrūmene. However in 18 December 1945 he was arrested by soviets and deported to Vorkuta. In 1955 he went back to Latvia. 24 November 1968 he died and was buried in Priedulu cemetery (Kandava parish).

The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers

The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers is an international guideline regulating how rivers and their connected groundwaters that cross national boundaries may be used, adopted by the International Law Association (ILA) in Helsinki, Finland in August 1966. In spite of its adoption by the ILA, there is no mechanism in place that enforces the rules. Notwithstanding the guideline's lack of formal status, its work on rules governing international rivers was pioneering. It led to the creation of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. In 2004, it was superseded by the Berlin Rules on Water Resources.
Provisions.
Applicable to all drainage basins that cross national boundaries, except where other agreement between bordering nations exists, the Helsinki Rules assert the rights of all bordering nations to an equitable share in the water resources, with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of the bordering nations. It also mandates protection of the resource by bordering nations with respect to water pollution in Chapter 3 (Articles IX to XI) and sets forth recommendations for resolving disputes over usage of such watercourses.
The Helsinki rules consist of 37 articles spread over 6 chapters. 
Chapter 2, Article 4 states: "Each basin State is entitled, within its territory, to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of an international drainage basin".
In determining what is reasonable and equitable share, all relevant factors are to be considered together and a conclusion reached on the basis of the whole. The list provided in Article 5 (2) is produced in full below:
1. The geography of the basin, including in particular the extent of the drainage area in the territory of each basin State
2. The hydrology of the basin, including in particular the contribution of water by each basin State
3. The climate affecting the basin
4. The past utilization of the waters of the basin, including in particular existing utilization
5. The economic and social needs of each basin State
6. The population dependent on the waters of the basin in each basin State
7. The comparative costs of alternative means of satisfying the economic and social needs of each basin State
8. The availability of other resources
9. The avoidance of unnecessary waste in the utilization of waters of the basin
10. The practicability of compensation to one or more of the co-basin States as a means of adjusting conflicts among uses
11. The degree to which the needs of a basin State may be satisfied, without causing substantial injury to a co-basin State
Article 6 precludes inherent preference of any use over others. Article 7 prohibits denial of reasonable use to a basin state on the basis of future uses of other states.
Article 8 relates to "existing reasonable uses". 
Section 8 (1) states: "An existing reasonable use may continue in operation unless the factors justifying its continuance are outweighed by other factors leading to the conclusion that it be modified or terminated so as to accommodate a competing incompatible use". 
Section 8 (2) defines the entry & exit criterion of an existing use. 
Section 8 (3) prohibits a use that is incompatible with an already existing reasonable use at the time of becoming operational from being treated as an existing use.
Limitations.
Although "an important set of draft rules," according to Stephen McCaffrey of the McGeorge School of Law, the Helsinki Rules do not address independent aquifers, but only those connected to a river. Accordingly, the United Nations decided in 1970 to create a more inclusive set of guidelines, which after more than twenty years of investigation by the International Law Commission resulted in the adopting of the Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses in 1997. The ILA itself addressed this limitation in adopting the Rules on International Groundwaters, also known as the Seoul Rules, in Seoul, Korea in 1986 and the Berlin Rules on Water Resources in 2004, which superseded this guideline.

Joseph W. Cullen

Joseph W. Cullen (1936–1990) was the director of the AMC Cancer Research Center, and Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute.
History.
Joseph Cullen grew up in the Boston area attending Boston Latin School where he developed his strong debate and speaking skills which he displayed throughout his professional career. He received his Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Florida State University in 1968. He served on the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles, and also worked at the Pavlovian Research Laboratory. Throughout his life, he was an active volunteer with the American Cancer Society. He was the first Director of the Division of Cancer Control at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at Los Angeles. In this position, he became a leader nationally and internationally in focusing attention among the cancer prevention and control community on the importance of what would make the biggest differences in preventing cancer. Through his work with the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), he developed a strong international network of colleagues who were confronting the tobacco problem worldwide, including Nigel Gray (Australia), head of the UICC Tobacco Program from 1974–1990, and Richard Doll (UK), Richard Peto (UK), Sir John Crofton (UK), Keith Ball (UK), Takeshi Hirayama (Japan), Dimitrios Trichopoulos (Greece), Judith Mackay of the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society, Kjell Bjartveit (Norway), D. David Simpson of UK's Action on Smoking and Health, Allan C. Erickson of the American Cancer Society and Michael Pertschuk (USA).
From 1982 - 1989 Cullen served as Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. Together with Dr. Peter Greenwald, the Director for the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, he established a new scientific approach to cancer control based upon a five-phase decision-making model: (1) hypothesis development, (2) method development, (3) controlled intervention trials, (4) defined population studies, and (5) demonstration and implementation studies. A major component of how this model was put into action at NCI was the new Smoking Tobacco and Cancer Program (STCP) which Cullen created in 1982. During his tenure at NCI, he was a vocal advocate for increasing program funding to develop and test intervention strategies to reduce tobacco use and then to apply the best strategies in large target populations. By 1989, the STCP included 55 smoking prevention and cessation trials, affecting 25 states and active in over 200 North American cities. One of the major achievements of the STCP was the establishment of the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention, widely known as ASSIST, which represented a major shift in federal funding for tobacco control from a primary focus on individuals to include a focus on the community and social environment. Based upon the leadership of Cullen within NCI and Dr. Harmon J. Eyre, representing the American Cancer Society (ACS), and their presentations before the NCI's Board of Scientific Counselors, ASSIST was approved for funding in 1989 and launched in 1991 through a collaborative public/private partnership between NCI and the ACS. ASSIST funded 17 state health departments to conduct the first comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs on a state-wide basis. This seven-year demonstration project served as a model for national tobacco control efforts and led to the current National Tobacco Control Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office on Smoking and Health, which continues to fund state health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. During the 1980s, Cullen developed a close working relationship with the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Cullen became a key technical consultant to Dr. Koop as he developed into an international leader in tobacco control. In part from the influence of Cullen, Dr. Koop issued a challenge to Americans in 1984 to "create a smoke-free society in the United States by the year 2000."

Church of Saint-Étienne, Lille

The Church of Saint-Étienne, Lille () is a church dedicated to Saint Stephen on the rue de l'Hôpital Militaire in Lille, classed as a monument historique since 1971. It is one of the largest Jesuit churches in France.
History.
First building.
The first parish church of this name was on the north corner of the city's Grand'Place (as shown by the names of the streets in that area - rue Saint-Étienne, rue des débris Saint-Étienne, rue du curé Saint-Étienne) and mainly dated to the 14th and 15th centuries. It was richly endowed by the Hangouart family, whose main members served the dukes of Burgundy. It was a Dutch-style hall church with two aisles and a nave, with many chapels along both sides of the nave. It was destroyed by fire in 1793 during the Austrian siege of the city, and replaced in 1796 by the present church.
Current building.
The present parish church originated as a Jesuit chapel. The Jesuits set up a base in Lille in 1562 and they were put in charge of the municipal collège built in 1529 on the decision of the city magistrate. The Jesuits' chapel of the immaculate conception (now the parish church of Saint-Étienne) was built from 1605 to 1610, but then destroyed by fire on 8 October 1740. From 1743 onwards François-Joseph Gombert rebuilt it to plans by Dominique Delesalle and, though works were delayed in 1744 by the War of the Austrian Succession and in 1745 by the siege of Tournai, they were finally completed in 1748 and the new building consecrated by the bishop of Tournai in 1750. The Jesuits were expelled from France in 1765, on which the chapel became the chapel of the collège and of the military hospital which took over the collège from 1778.
Description.
The church's stone façade is 29m high and its height is accentuated by the very straight rue de l'Hôpital militaire. Its style is resolutely classical and inspired by the Roman Baroque, with two superimposed orders (Ionic order at the bottom, Corinthian order at the top). A 57m high square bell tower topped with a campanile is to the left of the choir. The church's interior is 61m long, sobre, light and on a Latin cross plan. The nave has 7 bays, with side chapels all along the aisles, and the choir extends the nave and ends in a semi-circular apse. The choir and aisles are covered by an ogive vault and the nave by a barrel vault. The black and white marble flooring comes from the former chapel and the stained glass windows by Charles Gaudelet between 1854 and 1862.
The pulpit was carved by the sculptor François Rude between 1825 and 1828. It is made up of a tent topped by an angel and cherubs, with Faith and Hope supporting a vessel adorned with a bas-relief of St Stephen's martyrdom. The 1840 organ was built by the Daublaine Callinet house. It has been modified four times (by Cavaillé-Coll in 1899 then by Mutin in 1901) and now has 39 jeux, 3 keyboards and pedals.

Navan Junction railway station

Navan Junction was a railway station serving the town of Navan in County Meath. As the name suggests, the station was located at the junction of two railway lines. The first was a branch line off the main line between Belfast and Dublin, which connected Drogheda and Oldcastle, and opened in 1850. The second, which opened in 1862, was also a branch line, this time off the line from Dublin to Sligo, connecting Clonsilla and Navan. This line was later extended as far as Kingscourt in 1865.
Although Navan had two railway stations, Navan Junction was the main one serving the town, with a total of four platforms serving the two routes. However, following the nationalisation of the railways in Ireland in 1945, a major rationalisation programme led to the closure of many branch lines. Passenger services on the Kingscourt line ended in 1947, and led to the line between Clonsilla and Navan being lifted, while services on the Oldcastle line ended in 1958, with the line between Navan and Oldcastle lifted in 1963. This saw the final closure of Navan Junction station itself. 
Today, little remains of the station. Most of the buildings have been demolished, with the exception of the Midland Great Western Railway goods shed and the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) down platform. However, freight trains still pass through the site - until 2001, trains transported gypsum from the Gypsum Industries plant at Kingscourt through the site, while trains from the Tara Mine continue to use the remaining part of the Oldcastle line to transport zinc and lead to Drogheda. In addition, the reinstatement of the line from Clonsilla for passenger services will see trains running through on the old alignment to a new park and ride terminus at Navan North.

FBI Special Advisors are primarily responsible for serving in an advisory capacity to the FBI Senior Executive team and completing "management" type of issues.
History.
The FBI Special Advisor Program evolved from a 2002 effort by the FBI's Finance Division to recruit new talent from top business schools. Initially, one graduate of Harvard Business School was hired to work in the Director's Office. In 2003, another Harvard Business School graduate joined the FBI to work for the Chief Financial Officer. The work of these two merited the attention of the FBI's senior leadership and led to a proposal for a formal business school recruiting program. In 2007, executives from 25 FBI divisions participated in the three-year-old Special Advisor Program.

Captive killer whales

Captive killer whales are large predatory marine mammals that were first captured live and displayed in exhibitions in the 1960s, and soon became popular attractions at public aquariums and aquatic theme parks due to their intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity, and sheer size. However, the captive environment usually bears little resemblance to their wild habitat, and the social groups that the killer whales are put into are foreign to those found in the wild. As of August 13, 2013, there are 45 orcas in captivity worldwide, 32 of which are captive-born. The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial.
Orcas.
The killer whale ("Orcinus orca") is the largest species of the dolphin family. It is found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to warm, tropical seas.
Killer whales are intelligent, versatile and opportunistic predators. Some populations feed mostly on fish, and other populations hunt marine mammals, including sea lions, seals, walruses and even large whales. They are considered an apex predator, having no natural predators in their environment. There are up to five distinct killer whale types, some of which may be separate races, subspecies or even species. Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups, which are the most stable of any animal species. The sophisticated social behavior, hunting techniques, and vocal behavior of killer whales have been described as manifestations of culture.
Although killer whales are not an endangered species, some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to pollution by PCBs, depletion of prey species, captures for marine mammal parks, conflicts with fishing activities, acoustic pollution, shipping vessels, stress from whale-watching boats, and habitat loss.
Capture and breeding.
Killer whales are large, active and intelligent.
Males range from and weigh over , while females range from and weigh . It is extremely difficult to capture killer whales and to provide a healthy environment for the captives. Early attempts in the 1960s caused many injuries and deaths. However, with experience the teams who specialized in the business became more adept and post-capture survival rates improved. Live captures peaked in the early 1970s, but have become increasingly rare as the marine parks have learned how to maintain theme park populations through captive breeding and artificial insemination.
Today, worldwide there are approximately 42 Orcas known to be held captive. 137 Orcas were captured from the wild and 91 percent of those Orcas are now dead. 91 percent of the Orcas who died ranged from the age of one day to 28 years old, the median survival age was four years old. According to marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose male Orcas in the wild live an average of thirty years, the maximum being fifty to sixty years whereas, females in the wild average living to the age of 46 with a maximum age of eighty to ninety years. There have been a total of 32 Orcas that have been born in captivity and have died; that is excluding stillbirths, but in total, 156 have died in captivity including stillbirths and miscarriages (Whale and dolphin conservation society.)
North Eastern Pacific Captures.
The first captured North Eastern Pacific killer whale (Wanda) was caught in November 1961 by a collecting crew from Marineland of the Pacific in Los Angeles. The orca was placed in a tank at the aquarium, where she repeatedly crashed into the walls. She died the following day. The next killer whale captured, Moby Doll, had been harpooned and shot in 1964 and survived for three months when brought back for display to Vancouver, British Columbia. The third capture for display occurred in June 1965 when William Lechkobit found a 22 foot (6.7m) male orca in his floating salmon net that had drifted close to shore near Namu, British Columbia. The killer whale was sold for $8,000 to Ted Griffin, a Seattle public aquarium owner. Named after his place of capture, Namu was the subject of a film that changed some people's attitudes toward orcas.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, nearly 70 killer whales were taken from Pacific waters for exhibition. The Southern Resident community of the Northeast Pacific lost 48 of its members to captivity. By 1976, only 80 killer whales were left in the community, which remains endangered. With subsequent captures, the theme parks learned more about avoiding injury during capture and subsequent care of killer whales, and discovered that they could be trained to perform tricks, a great attraction to visitors. As commercial demand increased, growing numbers of Pacific orcas were captured, peaking in 1970.
A turning point came with a mass capture of orcas from the L-25 pod in August 1970 at Penn Cove, Puget Sound off the coast of Washington. The Penn Cove capture became controversial due to the large number of wild killer whales that were taken (seven) and the number of deaths that resulted: four juveniles died, as well as one adult female who drowned when she became tangled in a net while attempting to reach her calf. In his interview for the CNN documentary "Blackfish", former diver John Crowe told how all five of the whales had their bellies slit open and filled with rocks, their tails weighted down with anchors and chains, in an attempt to conceal the deaths. The facts surrounding their deaths were discovered three months later after three of the dead whales washed ashore on Whidbey Island. Public concern about the welfare of the animals and the impact of captures on the wild pods led to the Marine Mammal Protection Act being passed in 1972 by the US Congress, protecting orcas from being harassed or killed, and requiring special permits for capture. Since then, few wild orcas have been captured in Northeastern Pacific waters.
Lolita, originally known as Tokitae, was a survivor of the Penn Cove captures. She was about six years old at time of capture and is now the oldest captive killer whale. Lolita is the subject of the documentary "Lolita: Slave to Entertainment", released in 2008. Various groups still argue that Lolita should be released into the wild.
Icelandic captures.
When the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 effectively stopped the capture of Pacific orcas, exhibitors found an area more tolerant of killer whale captures in Iceland. Icelandic herring fishermen had traditionally seen killer whales as competitors for their catch, and sale of live killer whales promised a large new source of income. 48 live killer whales captured in Icelandic waters were exported to marine parks between 1976 and 1988. The capture process was based on luring the orcas by dumping leftovers from herring fishing in front of the pod, capturing the killer whales in a purse seine net, selecting desirable animals and hauling them on board in a specially designed frame, then placing them in foam-lined boxes full of seawater. However, restrictions on US killer whale import permits and advances in captive breeding programs meant that the market never became as large as expected. Growing concern from conservationists and animal rights activists has caused the Icelandic government to limit the number of orcas that may be captured each year.
Perhaps the best known of the Icelandic captives is Keiko, caught in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in Hafnarfjörður. Three years later, he was sold to Marineland Canada, where he first started performing for the public and developed skin lesions indicative of poor health. He was then sold to Reino Aventura (now named Six Flags Mexico), an amusement park in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the 1993 movie "Free Willy", the publicity from which led to an effort by Warner Brothers Studio to find him a better home. Using donations from the studio, Craig McCaw and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon spent over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. He was airlifted to his new home in January 1996, where he soon regained weight. In September 1998, he was flown to Klettsvik Bay in Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland, and gradually reintroduced to the wild, returning to the open sea in July 2002. Keiko died from pneumonia in December 2003. He had become lethargic and had a loss of appetite. He beached himself in the morning and died aged 27 years.
North Western Pacific captures.
1,477 killer whales were hunted in Japanese waters between 1948 and 1972, 545 of them around Hokkaido. Killer whale encounters in Japanese waters are now rare. In 1997 a group of ten killer whales was corralled by Japanese fisherman banging on iron rods and using water bombs to disorient the animals and force them into a bay near Taiji, Wakayama. They were held in the bay for two days before being auctioned to Japanese marine parks. Five animals were released, and the other five transported via road or sea to the aquariums. All five are dead.
The first live killer whale captured in Russia was an -long female estimated to be about six years old, captured off the Pacific coast of the Kamchatka district on September 26, 2003. She was transferred over to a facility owned by the Utrish Dolphinarium on the Black Sea, where she died in October 2003 after less than a month in captivity.
Killer whales born in captivity.
The majority of today's theme-park killer whales were born in captivity: 32 out of 45. Kalina, a female orca born in September 1985 at SeaWorld Orlando, was the first captive orca calf to survive more than two months. Kalina's mother is an Icelandic female named Katina, and her father, Winston (also known as Ramu III), was a Pacific Southern Resident, making Kalina an Atlantic/Pacific hybrid — a unique situation that would not have occurred in the wild.
The first killer whale conceived through artificial insemination was Nakai who was born to Kasatka at the SeaWorld park in San Diego in September 2001. A female killer whale named Kohana, the second killer whale conceived in this manner, was born at the same park eight months later. Artificial insemination lets park owners maintain a healthier genetic mix in the small groups of killer whales at each park while avoiding the stress of moving killer whales for breeding purposes.
The practice of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world and may not be able to adapt to life in the wild. Captive breeding also promises to reduce incentives to capture wild orcas. However, in January 2002 the Miami Seaquarium stated that captive orcas are dying faster than they are being born, and as it is virtually impossible to obtain orcas captured from the wild, the business of exhibiting captive orcas may eventually disappear.
Killer whale captivity locations.
As of June 5, 2013, orcas in 11 facilities in North and South America, Europe and Asia provide entertainment for theme park visitors. Building the physical infrastructure of the parks requires major capital expenditure, but as the star attractions the orcas are arguably the most valuable and irreplaceable assets.
SeaWorld.
SeaWorld is a chain of marine mammal parks in the United States and is the largest owner of captive killer whales in the world. The parks feature killer whale, sea lion, and dolphin shows and zoological displays featuring various other marine animals. The parks' icon is Shamu, the orca. Parks include:
There was also a fourth park named SeaWorld Ohio, but the park closed down in 2001.
Miami Seaquarium.
The Miami Seaquarium is an aquarium located on Virginia Key in Biscayne Bay near downtown Miami, Florida. A subsidiary of the privately held Wometco Enterprises, the Seaquarium was the first major marine park attraction in South Florida, opening in 1955. In addition to marine mammals, the Miami Seaquarium houses fish, sharks, sea turtles, birds and reptiles. It is home to Lolita (aka Tokitae), the oldest killer whale in captivity.
Marineland Canada.
Marineland is a privately held themed amusement and animal exhibition park in the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Owing to its proximity to the falls and other natural park areas and its blend of animal attractions and rides, it is one of the main tourist destinations in Niagara Falls, in Ontario, Canada.
Marineland (Antibes).
Marineland is an animal exhibition park in Antibes, France, founded in 1970. It receives more than 1,200,000 visitors per year, and is the only French sea park featuring two cetacean species: killer whales and dolphins. The park is a subsidiary of Parques Reunidos, a Spanish group with properties in Europe, Argentina and the USA.
Loro Parque.
Loro Parque (Spanish for "parrot park") is a zoo located on the outskirts of Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife. The park has the world's largest indoor penguin exhibition, the longest shark tunnel in Europe, and is one of only two parks in Europe to house killer whales.
In February 2006, Loro Parque received four young killer whales; two males, Keto (born in 1995) and Tekoa (born in 2000), and two females, Kohana (2002) and Skyla (2004) on loan from SeaWorld. Sea World still maintains ownership of these animals, and has sent its own professionals, including trainers, curators & veterinarians, to supplement the staff at Loro Parque. In 2004 and 2005, before the killer whales were brought to Loro Parque, eight animal trainers from the park were sent to Sea World parks in Texas and Florida for training. However, only half of these trainers are currently employed in Orca Ocean, Loro Parque's facility for the killer whales. None of the subsequent employees hired have been sent to Sea World parks for training. On December 24, 2009, orca trainer Alexis Martinez, age 29, was killed during a Christmas show rehearsal when he was attacked by one of the killer whales, presumably Keto, resulting in his drowning. He had worked at Loro Parque since 2004. From this date the trainers no longer enter the water with the orcas during live shows.
Mundo Marino.
Mundo Marino, located south of Buenos Aires in the coastal town of San Clemente del Tuyú, Argentina, is the largest aquarium in South America. Mundo Marino is home to one male killer whale, Kshamenk, that was stranded, or force-stranded, in 1992. Kshamenk is estimated to have been around 4 1/2 years old when captured.
Captivity conditions.
Tank size and water conditions.
Legal requirements for tank size vary greatly from country to country. In the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the Code of Federal Regulations, 9 CFR E § 3.104, under the "Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals". In 9 CFR 3.104, Table III classifies killer whales as Group I Cetaceans with an average length of 24 feet (7.315 meters). Based on length, Table I states up to two killer whales may be held in a pool with a minimum horizontal dimension (the diameter of a circular pool of water) of twice that length or 48 feet (14.63 meters) and a minimum depth of 12 feet (3.66 m), giving a minimum volume of 615 m3 for two killer whales. Each additional killer whale requires a pool with an additional 308 m3 of volume. 9 CFR 3.104 also requires a minimum of 63 m2 surface area per killer whale in Table IV (the example with a cylindrical tank 7.315 m in diameter for two whales provides 84 m2 of surface area per killer whale). Swiss regulations require a larger minimum volume: 400 m2 x 4.0 m deep for two killer whales, or 1,600 m3. The Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) goes further, and recommends 1,918 m3 for two killer whales. The US exhibitors of captive killer whales belong to the AMMPA, but exhibitors in other countries do not.
The tanks in most marine parks are considerably larger than the minimum sizes required by regulations. However, the Miami Seaquarium has been criticized for the small size of the tank holding their sole killer whale, Lolita, which is less than two of her body lengths wide at any point. Building a new tank would be costly and there is little prospect of replacing the aging Lolita.
Nutrition and medical care.
On average, an adult killer whale in the wild may eat about three to four percent of their body weight daily, or as much as 227 kg (500 lb) of food for a six-ton male. Their diet in the wild depends on what is available, and may include fish, walruses, seals, sea lions, penguins, squid, sea turtles, sharks and whales. According to SeaWorld, each of their adult orcas receives 140 to 240 pounds of food per day, primarily herring, capelin, salmon and mackerel. To maintain their alertness, the killer whales are fed at sporadic intervals throughout the day (as would happen in the wild) and feeding is often combined with training and shows. Each batch of fish is carefully tested to determine its nutritive composition, and each killer whale's weight, activity and health is carefully monitored to determine any special dietary requirements.
Killer whales have been the subject of extensive medical research since their first capture, and much is known about prevention and treatment of the common viral and bacterial infections, including vaccination and use of antibiotics and other medicines. Allometric principles and therapeutic drug monitoring are used to accurately determine the doses and avoid toxicity.
Training.
Killer whales are intelligent and can be trained to perform spectacular behaviors. Trainers usually work on a one-on-one basis with an individual killer whale. In addition to training, the trainer is responsible for the health of their orca, preparing food and documenting their health, diet, and behavior. The trainer must patiently build a relationship of trust with the animal as they teach it show behavior, which takes years of hard work. All of the behaviors, including jumps and slides, are natural, so training involves teaching the killer whale to perform the behaviors on the trainer's command. This is done by breaking down the behaviors into simple components and using a system of reward (called "positive reinforcement" by trainers) by giving the killer whale food or other reinforcement when they are successful at each stage, and withholding it when they are not. Food deprivation is not permitted in training, all animals receive all of their daily food requirements just not when they are unsuccessful in a behaviour. It is the trainers job to ensure the animal succeeds to get its food or change the behaviour to something a little easier until it has learnt the new behaviour. Secondary reinforcement—things not essential to life, such as play time, tactile rewards and fun games—can also be used to reward the animal.
Issues with captivity.
The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial, and organisations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the captivity of killer whales. Orcas in captivity may develop physical pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males.
The captive environment bears little resemblance to their wild habitat, and the social groups that the killer whales are put into are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim that captive life is stressful due to small tanks, false social groupings and chemically altered water. Captive killer whales have been observed acting aggressively toward themselves, other killer whales, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress.
Disease and reduced lifespan.
The lifespan of killer whales in captivity is substantively shorter, with many having only lived into their 20s. Several studies published in scientific journals show that the average mortality rate for captive killer whales are approximately three times higher than in the wild. However, there are examples of orcas living longer, including Corky II, Kiska, and Lolita/Tokitae who are over 40 years of age. In the wild, female killer whales have an average lifespan of 50 years and can live over 80 years, with the oldest known female being 103 (estimated) in 2014. The average lifespan for males in the wild is 30 years, but some live up to 50–60 years.
SeaWorld San Antonio's 14-year-old Taku, born in captivity, died suddenly on October 17, 2007. Trainers were notified that Taku had been acting differently a week before his death. The necropsy determined that Taku had died from a sudden case of pneumonia, a common illness among captive orcas. It was also discovered that Taku was infected by the West nile virus, transmitted by mosquitos.
The original Namu developed a bacterial infection which damaged his nervous system, causing him to become nonresponsive to people. During his illness he charged full-speed into the wire mesh of his pen, thrashed violently for a few minutes and then died.
Dorsal fin collapse.
Most male captive killer whales, and some females, have a dorsal fin that is partially or completely collapsed to one side. Several hypotheses exist as to why this happens. A dorsal fin is held erect by collagen, which normally hardens in late adolescence.
Scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have reported that "the collapsed dorsal fins commonly seen in captive killer whales do not result from a pathogenic condition, but are instead thought to most likely originate from an irreversible structural change in the fin's collagen over time. Possible explanations for this include: (1) alterations in water balance caused by the stresses of captivity dietary changes, (2) lowered blood pressure due to reduced activity patterns, or (3) overheating of the collagen brought on by greater exposure of the fin to the ambient air." According to SeaWorld's website, another reason for the fin to bend may be the greater amount of time that captive whales spend at the surface, where the fin is not supported by water pressure. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dorsal fin collapse is largely explained by captive killer whales swimming in small circles due to the inadequate space in which they have to swim. SeaWorld, however, claims that "Neither the shape nor the droop of a whale's dorsal fin are indicators of a killer whale's health or well-being."
Collapsed or collapsing dorsal fins are rare in most wild populations and usually result from a serious injury to the fin, such as from being shot or colliding with a vessel. After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the dorsal fins of two male resident killer whales who had been exposed to the oil collapsed, and the animals subsequently died. In 2002, the dorsal fin of a stranded killer whale showed signs of collapse after three days but regained its natural upright appearance as soon as the orca resumed strong normal swimming upon release.
Although, according to research by SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, it has been reported that seven out of 30 (23%) wild adult male killer whales from New Zealand waters have bent dorsal fins, this figure includes a variety of dorsal fin abnormalities, including rippled or twisted fins, in addition to simple one-sided collapse. The New Zealand study noted that, in addition to the high prevalence of dorsal fin deformities, two of the 30 adult males in this population also had prolific body scarring that were consistent with bite marks from other killer whales. The prevalence of dorsal fin deformities is 4.7% among adult male orcas in British Columbia and 0.57% in Norway. Amongst the well-studied wild killer whales off the coast of British Columbia, the total rate of dorsal fin collapse is around 1%.
Attacks on humans.
There have been no confirmed attacks on humans, fatal or otherwise, by wild killer whales. Two recorded instances include a boy charged while swimming in Helm Bay (in southeast Alaska) and orcas trying to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. In the case of the boy in Alaska, the boy was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals, leading to speculation that the killer whales misidentified him as prey and aborted their attack. In the case of the Terra Nova expedition, there is speculation that the seal-like barking of the sled dogs may have triggered the killer whales' hunting curiosity.
In 2004 a video purporting to show a jumping orca capsizing a Korean individual's kayak circulated the Internet; according to folklorist David Mikkelson of snopes.com, this is a fake originally produced as an advertisement for the sports drink Powerade.
Killer whales in the wild, however, are much less likely to attack people than are their captive counterparts, who have been known to attack either their handlers or intruders. Following one such attack on a trainer in 2006, ABC News reported that killer whales have attacked nearly two dozen people since the 1970s. Studies of killer whales in the wild have identified at least two categories, based on their territorial range. Those living in a limited area, such as Puget Sound or the Strait of Juan de Fuca, are termed "resident" whales, while "transient" whales roam the oceans at will. These "transient" types have to be more aggressive, in order to assert themselves in a wide range of territories and to prey on a variety of different species. This increased aggressiveness does not disappear in captivity. Furthermore, captivity itself could aggravate aggressive behavior, resulting in a "cetacean equivalent of anxiety disorder."
Captive killer whale attacks on humans seem to fall mostly into the categories of: biting during feeding, ramming in the water, and holding under water. Killer whales biting trainers during feeding or shows is generally the mildest form of attack seen, but can escalate to an animal dragging the trainer underwater and holding them there until they lose consciousness and/or drown. Trainers who have had killer whales ram into them in the water tend to suffer from a range of injuries including internal bleeding, broken bones, ruptured organs, and heart attack.
Tilikum, a male killer whale, was captured near Iceland in November 1983 at about two years of age. Tilikum was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of a trainer in 1991. 20-year-old Keltie Byrne, who worked at SeaLand, slipped and fell into the tank with the killer whales. Tilikum and two other killer whales grabbed her in their mouths and tossed her to each other, drowning Byrne. Tilikum was at the scene of another death on July 6, 1999. Daniel P. Dukes, a guest, was found floating in Tilikum’s pool, apparently killed by a combination of hypothermia and drowning. Dukes was covered in bruises, abrasions and bite marks, and his scrotum had been ripped open, indicating that Tilikum had clear contact with the victim but whether or not Tilikum actually caused the man's death was not determined. The guest had visited SeaWorld the previous day, stayed after the park closed, and evaded security to enter the killer whale tank. On February 24, 2010, after a noontime performance at Sea World, Orlando, Florida, Tilikum killed Dawn Brancheau during a training session with the killer whale. Tilikum is believed to have killed Brancheau due to a missed cue during the afternoon show which resulted in Tilikum not being rewarded for completing a behavior successfully. Brancheau died shortly thereafter from drowning and multiple traumatic injuries. This latest incident with Tilikum has reawakened a heated discussion about the effect of captivity on the killer whale's behavior, and in particular about the future of Tilikum in the context of SeaWorld.
Kasatka, a female killer whale who was captured off the coast of Iceland in October 1978 at the age of one year, has shown aggression toward humans. Kasatka tried to bite a trainer during a show in 1993, and again in 1999. On November 30, 2006, Kasatka grabbed a trainer and dragged him underwater during their show. The trainer suffered puncture wounds to both feet and a torn metatarsal ligament in his left foot.
On Christmas Eve of 2009, 29-year old Alexis Martinez of Loro Parque, Tenerife, Spain was crushed to death in the jaws of Keto. After spending two and a half minutes at the bottom of the 12-meter deep main pool, his body was retrieved but he was never able to be revived. The park initially characterized the death as an "accident" and claimed that the body of the young man showed no signs of violence, however the subsequent autopsy report stated that Martinez died due to grave injuries sustained by an orca attack, including multiple compression fractures, tears to vital organs, and the bitemarks of the animal on his body. During the investigation into the death of Alexis Martinez, it came to light that the park had also mischaracterized to the public a 2007 incident with Tekoa, the other male, and claimed it was also an "accident" rather than an attack.
Aggression between captive orcas.
One infamous incident of killer whale aggression took place in August 1989, when the dominant female Icelandic killer whale at SeaWorld San Diego, Kandu V, attempted to "rake" a female newcomer named Corky. Raking is a way orcas show dominance by forcefully scratching at another with their teeth. Kandu charged at Corky, attempting to rake her, missed and continued swimming into the back pool, where she ended up ramming the wall, rupturing an artery in her jaw. The crowd was quickly ushered out of the stadium. Forty-five minutes later Kandu V sank to the bottom of the pool and died.
Kanduke, a male captured from T pod in British Columbia, Canada in August 1975, often fought with a younger Icelandic male named Kotar. The aggression became increasingly serious, leading to an incident in which Kotar bit a part of Kanduke's genitals and caused an infection. It is not known if such serious aggression and injury would occur in the open seas.
Early pregnancy and related issues.
Captive killer whales often give birth at a much younger age than in the wild, sometimes as young as age 7. The young mothers may have difficulty raising their offspring. The calves have a relatively low survival rate, though some have lived into adulthood.
Corky (II), a female from the A5 Pod in British Columbia, Canada became the first killer whale to become pregnant in captivity, giving birth on February 28, 1977. The calf died after 18 days. Corky went on to give birth six more times, but the longest surviving calf, Kiva, lived only 47 days. SeaWorld has attracted criticism over its continued captivity of Corky II from the Born Free Foundation, who want her returned to her family in the wild.
A killer whale named Katina, captured near Iceland at about two years of age in October 1978, became pregnant in early spring of 1984 at SeaWorld San Diego and gave birth in September 1985 to a female named Kalina. Although it was an extremely young age for an killer whale to become a mother, Kalina was the first killer whale calf to be successfully born and raised in captivity. In turn, Kalina gave birth at only seven and a half years of age to her first calf, a male named Keet.
Gudrun was an Icelandic female caught in the 1970s. In 1993, she gave birth to Nyar, a female who was both mentally and physically ill, and who Gudrun tried to drown during several shows. Nyar died from an illness a few months later. Gudrun died in 1996 from stillbirth complications.
Taima is a transient/Icelandic hybrid female killer whale born in captivity to Gudrun in 1989. Trainers believe that Gudrun's behavior towards Nyar may have confused Taima, as she may have thought this was how to raise a calf. In May 1998, Taima gave birth to a male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar and throwing him out of the pool onto the trainer’s platform. She then slid out herself, and continued to bite him. In November 2000, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. The two were separated after only nine months due to aggression between them. On March 12, 2007 Taima gave birth to her third calf, Malia. Taima seemed to be a better mother this time, and no notable occurrences of aggression were reported, this may be in part due to the fact, Kalina acted as "aunt" to Malia and helped Taima to look after her. Kalina was a very experienced mother and would often be kept with Malia, while Taima was given time with her mate, Tilikum.
Taima died in 2010 during the birthing process of her fourth calf. The calf, fathered by Tilikum, was stillborn.
Kayla, a killer whale born in captivity, gave birth to her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Kayla rejected her calf, perhaps because she had never been exposed to a young calf before and did not know how to deal with it. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn died unexpectedly on June 15, 2008.
On October 13, 2010, Kohana, an eight-year-old female killer whale, gave birth to a male calf at Loro Parque's "Orca Ocean" exhibit after a four-hour labor. The calf weighed in at about 150 kilograms (330 lb), and was two meters (6 ft 7 in) long. Kohana has yet to establish a "maternal bond" with her calf, forcing trainers to take the first steps in hand rearing him. The outcome of this pregnancy was not considered surprising since Kohana was separated from her own mother, Takara, at three years of age, and was never able to learn about maternal care, compounded by the fact that she spent the formative years of her life surrounded by the three other juvenile killer whales at Loro Parque.

Zangasso

__NOTOC__ 
Zangasso (also Sangasso) is a small town and commune in the Cercle of Koutiala in the Sikasso Region of southern Mali. The commune covers an area of 452 square kilometers and includes 10 settlements. In the 2009 census it had a population of 19,925. The small town of Zangasso (or Sangasso), the administrative centre ("chef-lieu") of the commune, is 30 km southwest of Koutiala on the Route Nationale 11 that links Koutiala with Sikasso.
The French explorer René Caillié stopped at Zangasso on 12 February 1828 on his journey to Timbuktu. He was travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts to Djenné. In his book "Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo" published in 1830, he spelled the name of the village as Sanasso. He wrote:
As we advanced the soil became sandy and well cultivated. The country was generally open, yet there were some cés and nédés "rhamnus lotus" and "nauclea". We met a numerous caravan from Jenné, laden with salt. This caravan was composed of about two hundred men, sixty women, and twenty five asses. About nine o'clock in the morning we halted at Sanasso. From Toumaré to Jenné, wood is so scarce that the greater part of the inhabitants burn millet stubble. Sanasso is shaded by bombaces and baobabs. Like all Bambara villages in this region, it is built of bricks baked in the sun. The houses have only a ground floor: they are very dirty, and surrounded with walls. 
Caillié recorded details of many of the plants. The "cés" are shea trees "Vitellaria paradoxa" (formerly "Butyrospermum parkii") from which shea butter is made. "Nédé" is "Parkia biglobosa". "Rhamnus lotus" is a synonym for "Ziziphus lotus", and his "nauclea" were probably "Mitragyna inermis".

Subglacial channel

A subglacial meltwater channel is a channel beneath an ice mass, like ice sheets and valley glaciers, roughly parallel to the main ice direction. These meltwater channels can have different sizes, ranging from very small channels of a metre deep and wide to big valleys which can be up to a kilometres wide. The dimensions of these channels are regulated by several factors, like: temperature, meltwater volume, debris content in the water, ice wall closure rates and squeezing of fluidized sediment (Menzies, 2002).
In the scientific literature three forms of sub glacial melt water channels are commonly mentioned. 
The first type of channels is the R-channels (Röthlisberger, 1972). These are semi-circular channels cut upward into the ice. The balance between channel enlargement by viscous heating and closure by ice deformation when the channels are water-filled reflects their size and water pressure.
The second type mentioned is the H-channels. These channels are broad, flat channels cut upward into the ice that tends to follow local bed slope. Such channels form where water flows at atmospheric pressure beneath thin ice and on steep downglacier bedslopes.
The last type, the N-channels (Nye, 1973), are incised into bedrock, perhaps suggesting long-term channel stability under some alpine glaciers.

Kakkmaddafakka

Kakkmaddafakka is a Norwegian indie rock band formed and based in Bergen. Their music is influenced by a wide range of genres, including elements of rock, hip hop, reggae, disco, R&B and house music. The band is known for their high energy live performances, playing with up to twelve people on stage.
History.
The band was formed by brothers Axel and Pål Vindenes, together with school friends Jonas Nielsen and Stian Sævig. All classically trained musicians, the band was formed to play a one-off show at a local youth centre, Ungdomshuset 1880, but after positive response the band continued to play many live shows around Norway. In 2006 the band made their first recording and released the EP 'Already your favourite EP' which was produced by Matias Tellez, and featured the track OOO.
Kakkmaddafakka released its first LP "Down To Earth" on 24 September 2007, which reached number twenty on the VG Topp30 Album list and brought the band nationwide attention in their native Norway, despite a largely negative critical response.
The band is one of many young artists currently emerging from Bergen, which the Norwegian press has called the "New Bergen Wave", as it is reminiscent of the many successful bands that emerged from Bergen in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.
Kakkmaddafakka has performed at numerous festivals including Iceland Airwaves, Montreux Jazz Festival, NXNE, CMJ Music Marathon, Southside Festival, Hurricane Festival, Eurosonic Festival, , Area 4 Hove and Melt! festival in Germany, where they were introduced on stage by prominent Bergen musician and friend Erlend Øye.
In 2008 Kakkmaddafakka was nominated as Best Norwegian Act in the MTV Europe Music Awards, along with Madcon, Ida Maria, Karpe Diem and eventual winners Erik og Kriss.
On February 25, 2011, Kakkmaddafakka released their second album "Hest". The album was produced by Erlend Øye and released on the label Bubbles. The first single taken from the album was "Restless".
On 28 June 2013 the third album was released - "Six months is a long time". It was again produced by Erlend Øye.

Pontifical Academy of Martyrs

The Pontifical Academy of Martyrs or Pontificia Academia Cultorum Martyrum (original founded as the "Collegium Cultorum Martyrum") is an academic honorary society established in Rome by the Catholic Church for the advancement of the "cult of saints and martyrs", the promotion and worship of the saints and the study of related early Christian history including the catacombs.
Is operates with guidance and support from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Roman Curia and is one of the ten such Pontifical Academies established by the Holy See.
History.
The Academy was established on 2 February 1879 by Mariano Armellini, Adolfo Hytreck, Orazio Marucchi and Enrico Stevenson (four distinguished scholars of sacred antiquity) and the Papal Academy, in conjunction with the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.
Functions.
The Academy is tasked with promoting the cult of the Holy Martyrs and increasing, through study, knowledge of the saints including examples of "Witnesses of the Faith". 
It is also responsible for the "monuments" to these saints from the first centuries of Christianity, including the catacombs beneath Rome. The Academy organises and promotes celebrations of ancient Christian cemeteries, the catacombs and other sacred places, as well as religious functions and archaeological conferences. To this end it works closely with the Pontifical Academy of Archaeology.
The Academy holds at least two General Meetings each year, close to the "Papal Institute of Christian Archaeology" and the Collegio Teutonico in The Vatican. 
The Papal Academy "Cultorum Martyrum" supports also, during Lent, the unwinding of the ritual stand in honour of Carlo Respighi, Magister from 1931 until 1947.
Membership and leadership.
The Academy consists of "Sodales" and "Associates" of both sexes. At the age of 80 a "Sodales" becomes an "Emeritus". Sodales who become Cardinal or Bishops are appointed "Defences". 
The Academy's administrator is referred to as the "Magister"; an office appointed (and renewed) by the Pope. The Magister, in accordance with the Academy's "Guiding Advice", can affiliate the Academy with other Pontifical Academies which have business related to a particular "Martyrs' Sanctuary". 
Its current "Magister" is Fabrizio Bisconti.

Rolls-Royce RB3011

The Rolls-Royce RB3011 (previously designated RB2011) is a prototype propfan engine in development by Rolls-Royce plc. The design is also known as an "open rotor" engine.
Design and development.
The RB3011 is designed for the 180-300 passenger aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus A320). Rolls-Royce bought the Allison Engine Company in 1995, and has studied the Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX propfan engine built in the 1980s.
The engine has two contra-rotating external rotors (fans) on the outside of the engine nacelle, either at the front of the assembly ("tractor") or at the rear ("pusher"). Both pusher and tractor open rotor designs form part of the RR's long-term "15-50" vision, which is examining various architectures to tackle the 150 seat-aircraft market. Within 15-50 group -named for specific fuel consumption reductions of 15-50% compared with current generation engines- there are various options based on technology availability and maturity. 
The open rotor design is known to have increased noise compared to normal turbofan engines, where noise is contained by the engine duct. The forward rotor is larger in diameter than the rear rotor, to avoid problems with eddies from the forward rotor tips. The rotors are powered by the engine shaft via an epicyclic gearbox. These produce a large amount of heat.
The engine has been tested at the Aircraft Research Association in Bedford, Bedfordshire. Wind tunnel testing has taken place at DNW in Marknesse in the Netherlands.
It is hoped to reduce the fuel consumption of an aircraft, compared to those with normal turbofan engines, by up to 30%. This is main reason for choosing this design of engine. Certification is planned for 2017-8, with market entry with airlines by 2020.

Caillié was impressed with the range of goods on sale in the market and wrote:
I went to see the market, which I found better than those of the villages through which I had previously passed. It was held under a sort of penthouse, which kept off the rain in bad weather. It was very well supplied with all the productions of the country. I even saw butcher's meant and European commodities, such as cloth, muskets, powder and glass trinkets.

Citânia de Briteiros

The Citânia de Briteiros is an archaeological site of Castro culture in the north-western Iberian Peninsula, significant for its size, urbanism, and architecture. Although primarily known for its remains of an Iron Age proto-urban hill fort (or oppidum), excavations at the site have revealed evidence of sequential settlements extending from the Bronze Age to the Middle Ages.
Location and environment.
The site is situated on a small promontory called Monte de São Romão near the Ave river, in the Norte region of Portugal, between the freguesias of Salvador de Briteiros and Donim, about 15 kilometers north-west of Guimarães. The location provides an extensive view over the navigable Ave river and its valley, and over an early north-south trade and communication path between the Douro and Minho river valleys. The moderate elevation of the site, the temperate and humid climate, and the nearby river give the hill and the surrounding area varied and rich natural resources for exploitation, from fruits of the woods to fishing to grazing.
Research history.
The site has been studied extensively since 1874, when the Portuguese archaeologist Francisco Martins Sarmento began annual excavation campaigns while helping to develop methods of archaeological research and preservation in Portugal; Sarmento's campaigns led to the discovery of much of the ruins of the acropolis (the highest portion of the settlement), and he reconstructed a pair of dwellings on the site from his research. Continuing discoveries during the first decades of work led Martins Sarmento to purchase the land on which the settlement lay. The land and Martins Sarmento's research materials were bequeathed to the Martins Sarmento Society; from the 1930s through the 1960s, new excavations were carried out by the Society, supervised by Mário Cardozo, which led to the discovery of large parts of the settlement on the eastern slope and additional portions of the acropolis. Further surveys were made in the 1970s (in the north-eastern section), and in 2002, 2005 and 2006.
As research methods developed over the 19th and 20th centuries, the successive excavations at the Briteiros site adapted to evolving concepts, and gaps remain in the scientific knowledge of the site. In 2004 a project was initiated under the responsibility of Minho University with the collaboration of the Martins Sarmento Society to integrate the past studies and improve the conservation of the site.
The site was classified and protected by IPPAR as a Portuguese National Monument in 1910.
Settlement history.
Notes by Martins Sarmento and from recent explorations show that the Monte de São Romão was a favored location for rock art engravings of the Atlantic Bronze Age, in the beginning of the first millennium BCE; it is not known when or why this first group left.
Numerous early engraved rock surfaces were destroyed when many boulders were cut to build the ramparts and family compounds as the Castro settlement grew. Little is known of the beginnings of the Castro occupation, as no structures from the late Bronze Age have been found. Pottery from the early Iron Age has been found, when the settlement would already have been fortified. The majority of the ruins visible today have been dated from the second Iron Age, especially the last two centuries BCE. This period was the peak of occupation of the site, by Celtiberians.
Expansion of the Roman Empire into the region has left evidence in the oppidum at Briteiros, in the form of coins (those of Augustus and Tiberius are the most numerous found, with smaller numbers of coins of the Republic, and the Flavians and the Antonines) ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. A small number of amphorae and red pottery pieces have been found, and there is some evidence of Romanization in the architecture of the alleys and buildings of the eastern slope, but overall the visible impact of Roman occupiers is not strong.
The reduced number of later coin and pottery finds suggests that occupation of the oppidum was declining from the 1st century CE, resulting in the 2nd century with very few people living within the ramparts. Evidence shows that there was a transitory reoccupation in the High Middle Ages, which included the building of a medieval chapel and graveyard on the acropolis.
Characteristics of the Castro settlement.
The visible ruins of the walled village or hill fort cover an area of about 24 hectares. The Briteiros site is called a "citânia" or "cividade" (from Latin "civitas", city), due to its large size and city-like structure; other examples from the region and period include the Citânia de Sanfins and Cividade de Terroso.
The defensive system includes three lines of ramparts, with a partial fourth line to the north and a pair of moats. The preserved walls measure one to three meters thick and less than two meters high; a portion of wall restored by Martins Sarmento measures almost four meters high. The walls were built using irregular dry stone masonry methods, edged on both sides. The innermost rampart was partially absorbed into the urban development by being incorporated as a support wall for several family compounds. Gates were cut through each of the ramparts to provide passage; some of the gate openings still have hollows where vertically-moving palisades were placed. Ramps and stairs providing access to the top of the third rampart are evident.
The known urban area of the settlement includes the acropolis, at the highest elevation, surrounded by the first rampart, and covering an area of about 7 hectares. Around 100 family dwelling compounds were found in this area, grouped into small blocks, with the blocks divided by several streets; Briteiros is unusual among castros in having its streets arranged in a rough grid pattern. The ramparts and main roads form the most visible aspects of the urban organization for public use, but other community elements exist: conduits which carried water from a spring on the hill, fountains, at least two public bath structures, and a large meeting or council house. One bath ruin, an accidental find during road work in the 1930s, is one of the best-preserved constructions of its kind in northern Portugal and Galicia, and includes a decorative monolith of almost 3 meters square, called the Pedra Formosa (the "handsome stone", thought once to have formed part of a burial chamber).
Each of the family compounds, delimited by masonry walls, provided living and working space for a large family. Most compounds included one to three circular stone houses, some of them large and with an atrium, where the nuclear family lived; other structures within the compound housed other family members, served as stables, or stored agricultural tools, food, and rain or spring water.
Daily tasks and crafts were performed in the stone-paved courtyard of the compound, which formed the center of family life in the citânia. Assuming around 6 people per family unit, a population of the acropolis of around 625 people has been estimated, but estimates may reach as many as 1500 for the entire settlement when excavations are made of the eastern and south-western extremities.

The French explorer René Caillié stopped at Kouoro in February 1828 on his journey to Timbuktu. He was travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts to Djenné. In his book "Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo" published in 1830, he refers to what was then a village as Couara. Caillié wrote:
At nine o'clock in the morning we halted at Coura, a pretty village, where we found an abundance of all the necessities of life. The inhabitants grow a great deal of cotton and millet, and are supplied with water from a stream that runs E.N.E., half a mile from the village.
What Caillié referred to as a stream was actually the Banifing River, a tributary of the Bani but in February it would have had very little water.

Krstova Gora

Krstova Gora (Serbian Cyrillic: Крстова Гора; literally: "The Cross Mount") is a hill in the immediate vicinity of the town of Teslić in Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The altitude of the hill top is about 270 m, with the town center being on about 202 m. The Krstova Gora is located about 2 km to the west from the town center. It physically divides the village of Ružević to the two local communities: Gornji Ružević and Donji Ružević (literally: "upper" and "lower" Ružević, respectively).
Up to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina The Krstova Gora was named The Gračun (). The name was changed in the post-war period, when first regulation of the hill were undergone. In that period the two approaches to the hill top were improved. Pedestrian trail from the south now starts with concrete stairs and the vehicle road from the north is repaired. On the very top of the hill a several meter high metal cross is erected, standing on a two meter high concrete foundation. The cross is painted in bright colours making it clearly visible in daylight and during the night it is marked with spotlights. The cross represents local Orthodox Christian population which makes the absolute majority. The cross was the basis for the new name of formerly The Gračun hill.
While entering the town from direction of Banja Luka (west) the hill and the cross are clearly visible to the left, just at the immediate entrance to the town.

<doc id="21507445" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21507445" title="Pomalidomide">
Pomalidomide

Pomalidomide (INN, originally CC-4047 or 3-amino-thalidomide, trade name Pomalyst in the US) is a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is anti-angiogenic and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013, and is expected to be marketed in Europe under the brand name Imnovid.
Origin and development.
The parent compound of pomalidomide, thalidomide, was originally discovered to inhibit angiogenesis in 1994. Based upon this discovery, thalidomide was taken into clinical trials for cancer, leading to its ultimate FDA approval for multiple myeloma. Further structure activity studies done in Dr. Robert D'Amato's lab at Boston Children's Hospital led to the first claim in 1995 that amino-thalidomide had antitumor activity. Interestingly, the pronounced anti-tumor activity is due to its ability to directly inhibit both the tumor cell and vascular compartments of myeloma cancers. This dual activity of pomalidomide makes it more efficacious than thalidomide "in vitro" and "in vivo".
Clinical trials.
Phase I trial results showed tolerable side effects.
Phase II clinical trials for multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis reported 'promising results'.
Phase III results were reported at ASH in 2012 and showed significant extension of progression-free survival (median 3.6 months vs. 1.8 months; P < 0.001), and overall survival in patients taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone v. dexamethasone alone.
Mechanism.
Pomalidomide directly inhibits angiogenesis and myeloma cell growth. This dual effect is central to its activity in myeloma, rather than other pathways such as TNF alpha inhibition, since potent TNF alpha inhibitors including rolipram and pentoxifylline do not inhibit myeloma cell growth nor angiogenesis. Up regulation of Interferon gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 as well as down regulation of IL-6 have been reported for pomalidomide. These changes may contribute to pomalidomide's anti-angiogenic and anti-myeloma activities.
Pregnancy and sexual contact warnings.
Because Pomalyst can cause harm to unborn babies when administered during pregnancy, women taking Pomalyst must not become pregnant. Women must produce two negative pregnancy tests and use contraception methods before beginning Pomalyst. Women must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with Pomalyst, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of Pomalyst therapy. Pomalyst is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 28 days after discontinuing Pomalyst, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking Pomalyst must not donate sperm.

Planina, Postojna

Planina () is a village in the Municipality of Postojna in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Gornja Planina, Dolnja Planina, and Grič in the main settlement as well as Kačja Vas (or Kačje Ride) to the southwest and Malni and Hasberg to the south.
Name.
Planina was attested in written sources in 1300 as "Mounç in foro" (and as "Renç miles de Albinus" in 1321, "czu der Alben" in 1333, and "pey der Albn" in 1341). The Slovenian name of the settlement is derived from the common noun "planina" 'treeless mountain; mountain pasture', referring to the local geography and semantically corresponding to Middle High German "albe" in the medieval transcriptions of the name.
History.
The Planina area was already settled in prehistoric times, along a trade route from Šmihel pod Nanosom to Vrhnika. The hill with ruins of Haasberg Castle has the remains of prehistoric and Roman-era fortifications, and graves dating to the Bronze Age and Roman era have been excavated on a hill slope closer to Unec. Medieval Planina developed around a castle belonging to the lords of Alben (). A toll house belonging to the Counts of Gorizia was attested in Planina in 1217. As a town, Planina was granted the right to a market day every Saturday and an annual fair on Saint Margaret's Day. The town was later under the control of the Haller and Eggenberg noble families. By the 17th century, Planina had developed into an important trade connection between Carniola and the Adriatic, with routes connecting it to Pivka, Cerknica, and Logatec. A major postal station was established in Planina in 1728, and a road to Trieste was laid through the town in 1830.
In the early 19th century an amadou factory was established in Planina and it exported its products throughout Europe. A district court was established in Planina in 1867 (and transferred to Logatec in 1875). After the First World War, the Treaty of Rapallo split the town: the hamlet of Kačja Vas, the source of the Unica River (at the mouth of Planina Cave), the Ravbar Tower of Little Castle, and Haasberg Castle lay on the Italian side of the border.
During the Second World War, the Partisan Dolomite Detachment was active in the area. The Partisans destroyed an Italian outpost near Planina on 17 May 1943 and burned Haasberg Castle on 27 March 1944.
Mass grave.
Planina is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Liplje Cave Mass Grave () is located on the slope of Mount Planina (), northeast of the peak. It contains the remains of undetermined victims based on skeletal remains discovered by spelunkers.
Churches.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Margaret and belongs to the Ljubljana Archdiocese. It is a Baroque church that was built at the site of an older predecessor in 1771. Another church stands in Gornja Planina and is dedicated to Saint Roch. It was built in 1761. There are a number of churches near the village belonging to the same parish. Holy Cross Church is built next to the cemetery north of the village. A church dedicated to Mary Refuge of Sinners stands on a hill northwest of the village.
Notable people.
Notable people that were born or lived in Planina include:

Bradford and Airedale Teaching Primary Care Trust

Bradford and Airedale Teaching Primary Care Trust is the name of the publicly funded healthcare system which serves City of Bradford and Airedale in West Yorkshire and is part of the NHS. The tPCT governs healthcare services in the area and like most NHS services, the majority of services are free at the point of use. It was abolished in April 2013.
The tPCT provides primary health care and community services or commissions them from other providers. Primary care provides the initial pathway into the healthcare system. It could be a visit to a doctor, dentist, optician or even going to the chemist to pick up medication prescribed by your GP.
The tPCT merged from four separate PCTs (Airedale, North Bradford, South and West, and City) in 2007.
Bradford and Airedale tPCT is also a ‘Teaching Primary Care Trust’, which has specific hospitals where medical students can learn in a practical setting.
The tPCT is managed by a Board of directors made up of eight directors and headed by a Chief Executive, Simon Morritt. The Chairman of the Trust is a non-executive director, John Chuter OBE.
The finances of the tPCT, like most PCTs and tPCTs, are largely determined by directives set by the Strategic Health Authority or the Department of Health.

Gardens Commercial High School

Gardens Commercial High School is a coeducational inner city Secondary School in Cape Town, South Africa with learners aged 12 – 18 years. In 2006 the school was designated a Business, Commerce and Management (BCM) Focus School. As such, Gardens Commercial is part of an education intervention that aims to redress the Apartheid education system. The school is a lead institution that supports learners with exceptional interest, talent, interest or aptitude in the field of business, commerce and management. Gardens Commercial offers the following focus field subjects: Accounting, Business Studies, Economics and Computer Applications Technology.
History.
Gardens Commercial High School is a fine mixture of the old and the new. The five original houses which still form parts of the school buildings were built in 1882 and were used as University of Cape Town residences during the 1920s. Since then they have housed a private hotel, the offices of the Provincial Administration (1939–1944) and the offices of the Department of Inland Revenue and the Rent Control Board (1944–1967).
In 1967 the demolition of Avenue Terrace - as the buildings were then known - was planned. In its stead a new school would be built to house the pupils from the Day School of Commerce which, until then, had been a department of the Cape Technical College. These plans, however, were shelved and the original buildings were adapted for use as a school.
In 1968 the school came under the jurisdiction of the Cape Education Department and a year later it was renamed Gardens Commercial High School. The Avenue Terrace buildings survived intact, a second time, when demolition plans were again mooted.
When Louis Karol Architects were commissioned in 1976 to build the new school, their decision to incorporate Avenue Terrace finally guaranteed the survival of these buildings. The intriguing blend of old and new in this design earned the architects an Award of Merit from the Institute of South African Architects.
In 1984 - two years before the school's silver anniversary - the Twistniet Sports Complex was opened in Upper Orange Street. It offers facilities for hockey, tennis, basketball, netball and athletics.
The school is proud of its historic links with the city of Cape Town. In 1993 the old School buildings, the wall and the ground were declared a National Monument. The original deeds of transfer of the ground, are part of the Uitvlugt, date to 1732.
Sport & Culture.
Learners are encouraged to participate in at least one extramural activity throughout the year. The following codes are offered:

Kuntasi

Kuntasi is an archaeological site (locally known as "Bibi-no-Timbo") which is identified as a port belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization. and 30 km from Morbi in Maliya taluka of Morbi District in Gujarat state of India. It is five k.m. inlandward from present shore line. It was first reported by P. P Pandya and later thoroughly explored by Y. M. Chitalwala. The excavations revealed two periods of occupation. Period I is assigned to the Mature Harappan phase (c. 2200–1900 BCE) and the Period II is assigned to the Late Harappan phase (c.1900–1700 BCE). This site was identified as a jetty and a manufacturing centre.
Area.
Kuntasi had 2 hectares of walled town and unwalled suburbs. A stone platform ran along the western side of wall. It appears to have been a planned settlement, established for production, storage and movement of goods.
Architecture.
The excavated site consists of two parts, a two hectare walled settlement and unwalled suburbs. A stone platform ran along the western side of the wall, and adjoining this inside the walled town were a substantial industrial complex and a number of storage facilities. A centrally placed house with a number of rooms, including a private kitchen was found. Other houses lay in the north and west of the walled area, mostly large rectangular buildings. The houses in Kuntasi were built on stone foundations with walls of mud bricks in Harappan proportion but unusually large. In the southwestern corner, a large isolated room was found, which has been identified as a kitchen serving most of the settlement. The buildings were arranged around a large open space. However, the town of Kuntasi lacked Citadel which was prominent in bigger towns like Kalibangan, Dholavira, Banawali etc. belonging to Indus Valley Civilisation.
Double wall.
Kuntasi had a double wall, built out of boulders and mud, separated by a passage with a width of about 20 meters. Southernwest corner of town had a tower, and eastern side had a gate flanked by guard chambers, presumably to control public access to the walled area.
Artefacts found.
Pottery with drawings. Two cylindrical stone anchors, suggesting seaborne activity.
Importance.
Kuntasi was similar to Lothal, another port town of IVC, though on a smaller scale. It is also suggested that a land route connected this site to Lothal via Rangpur, India.

Sarabha Sastri

Sri Sarabha Sastri (1872–1904) was an Indian venu flute player, known as the first great Brahmin flutist. He brought the flute to the mainstream Indian Carnatic concert stage — until then, it was almost exclusively a folk instrument.To Sastri goes the credit of promoting the flute to the status of a primary concert instrument from being a mere ‘second fiddle’ to dance.
Early life and Background.
Sri Sarabha Sastrigal was born in 1872 to Viswanatha Sastri and Smt. Dharmambal. His mother’s native place was Tiruvadi and She lived next door to Saint Tyagaraja.His father died when he and his brother (Rao Sahib)Sivakumara Sastri were very young.Blind at a young age, he was initiated into a career in music under the guidance of his maternal uncle Sri Kuppusamy Sastri of Tiruvadi near Thiruvaiyaru and later by Manambuchavadi Sri Venkatasubba Iyer, one of the disciples of Saint Thiyagaraja. Sri Govinda Nayanakkar unravelled the mysteries of flute to young Sarabha Sastri. 
Sri Saraba Saastrigal lived in Soliappa Mudali street in Kumbakonam and was married to Ambu Ammal.
Penance at Eraharam.
Sastri undertook penance in ErAharam -Sri Sankari Samedha Skandanadha Swamy temple, obtained divinity and brought peace and happiness to local population.Later, he organised "Sarba Kavadi", " Macha Kavadi" etc. and spread the fame of this temple. Carrying kavadi is a practice of penance or prayaschittam.Thaipusam is a festival that is marked by acts of penance such as carrying the Kavadi. The Kavadi itself is a physical burden through which the devotees implore for help from deity.
Achievements.
Blindness in childhood could do nothing to blunt the musical genius of Sarabha Sastri. By experimenting with the flute, he evolved a fingering technique by which he could produce the entire range of Indian ragas on it.
Sri Sarabha Sastrigal composed more than 500 Sahityas for Nayanmar charithrams, in various languages.
Sri Saraba Saastrigal taught a unique technique in playing the Flute (with Tu-Tu kaarams). He was also able to play the Thaanam on the Flute. Sri Saraba Saastrigal was also called "Eka Chandra Graahi", since he had the uncanny ability to grasp anything by just listening once. Sri Palladam Sanjiva Rao was a direct disciple of Sri Saraba Saastrigal. Palladam Sanjiva Rao passed this on to Sri H Ramachandra Shastry who taught Carnatic flute at Kalakshetra until 1992. Some of the notable musicians practicing this art form include G. S. Rajan, Ludwig Pesch and T. Sashidhar.
Sastri was always sought after by fans, but he never practiced the flute at home.Sastri who never practiced would however warm up within a few seconds from the commencement of a concert and readily get into his stride.He was a confirmed believer in emotional purification through music.He was invited to serve as the “Asthana Vidwan’ of Mysore samasthan by the erstwhile Maharaja of Mysore which was refused by Sastri.He was also against commercialization of music.
Origin of the Carnatic Flute.
Until the late 19th century, the Carnatic flute (better known in Tamil as the pullanguzhal), an 8-hole bamboo flute, the South Indian equivalent of the North Indian 6-hole bansuri flute, had never been used in Carnatic concerts. Sharaba Shastri has been characterized by his followers as a musical genius after experimenting and creating the Carnatic flute. He is also known for bringing the Carnatic flute to the fore of Carnatic music concerts as an influential instrument.
The Sharaba Shastri style or bani of playing was established and was carried on by his disciple Sanjeeva Rao. However it was the self-taught "Mali" who brought a revolution in popularising the Carnatic flute and whose legacy was carried on by Ramani and other national and international disciples of Mali.
The fingering technique invented by Sarabha Shastri was as highly scientific, and as accurate as a keyboard. The minutest oscillations required for the intricate gamakas of Carnatic music were covered by this fingering system. By progressing from playing only simple tunes to the ability of producing full fledged kritis complete with the nuances of every raga, the flute came on par with the veena as a concert instrument. No recordings of his playing survive, and apart from stray references in larger works, little has been written about his music. We only know his music through his student, the legendary Palladam Sanjiva Rao.
Sanskrit Scholar.
Sastri was a great scholar and used to have discussions with other scholars such as Thirupalanam Panchapakesa sastrigal,Sulamangalam vaidyanatha bhagavathar and others.Music scholars such as Thirukodikaval Krishna Iyer, “Fiddle” Govindasamy Pillai,Pattanam Subramaniya Iyer, Thanjavur Krishna Bhagavathar, Mridangam Narayanaswamy Appa, Mridangam Azhaga Nambi Pillai, Kumbakonam Sivakolundu and Tirumarugal Natesa Nayakarar were his contemporaries and used to accompany him in his concerts.
Death.
Sri Sarabha Sastrigal died at the young age of 32 years in the year 1904 at Kumbakonam. Sarabha Shastri, like many a great genius, lived only a short life. Upon his death at the age of 32, his work was carried on by his most celebrated disciple, Palladam Sanjeeva Rao, who perfected and elaborated on the fingering system and popularized the flute as a solo concert instrument. However the original contribution of Sarabha Shastri upgrading the flute onto the concert platform remains immortal
Sastri’s Flute.
The flute he handled is still on display at Sri Rama Bhajanai Sabha at 110, Solaippan Street, Kumbakonam.Sri Sarabha Sastrigal's flute is been preserved for more than 100 years from Sastri’s family members.
Venuganam Sri Sarabha Sastrigal Memorial Trust.
A trust under the name and style of "Venuganam Sri Sarabha Sastrigal Memorial Trust" has been formed & functioning, organising music, cultural & service oriented programs & the trust is managed by leading personalities. Ekadasi Bhajans and Radha Kalyanam are conducted fortnightly,during the month of Margazhi.
Sri Rama Bhajanai Sabha.
Sastri lived a very simple life and offered his divine music as worship to Lord Rama.Sri Rama Navami uthsavam was performed by him every year which used to be attended by all the leading musicians of those days.This tradition is continued until today by group of enthusiasts.
Sri Rama Bhajanai Sabha, Kumbakonam founded and nurtured by none other than the famous Vanuganam Sri Sarabha Sastrigal about 125 years ago occupies a unique place among various cultural and service organisations.Sri Rama Bhajanai Sabha, Kumbakonam remains committed to its vision of being the premier Sabha that serves the cultural and religious needs of the Hindu society of current and future generations and be the hub of vibrant culture and service oriented programs. With the grace of lord Sri Rama, the sabha is progressing towards this vision by celebrating Sri Rama Navami Utasavams, Sri Radha Kalyana Mahotsavam every year, Sri Kanchi Kamakoti peetam Maha Periyava Jayanthi, Bhajans on every Ekadasi days, organising lectures on Srimath Valmiki Ramayana, Bhagavadham etc. and offering community services including Annadhanams during festivals.(Ramabhajanaisabha blogspot link in the reference section contains all articles published about Sarabha Sastrigal since 1904)

Silent running (submarine)

Silent running is a stealth mode of operation for naval submarines. The aim is to evade discovery by passive sonar by eliminating superfluous noise: nonessential systems are shut down, the crew is urged to rest and refrain from making any unnecessary sound, and speed is greatly reduced to minimize propeller noise.
The propellers have a characteristic RPM band in which no cavitation noise arises. Since this rotation speed is usually relatively low, the first electric submarines had special "silent running" engines designed for optimum performance at reduced speed. These required less active cooling (further reducing noise), and were generally equipped with "slip-bearings" rather than ball-bearings. These engines were also acoustically decoupled from the hull, as they employed belt transmission rather than direct coupling to the propeller shaft.
Nuclear submarines can run even more quietly, at very low speeds only, by turning off active reactor cooling during silent running. The reactor is then only cooled by natural convection of the water.

Community Action Services and Food Bank

Community Action Services and Food Bank (CASFB), located in Provo, Utah, is a non-profit organization that serves the low-income population of Utah, Summit, and Wasatch counties and focuses on the operation of programs that help alleviate poverty. It was founded in 1967 following the signing of the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and is one of more than 1,000 independent Community Action Agencies across the country. It is sponsored by United Way of Utah County.
The agency's purpose is to assist the disadvantaged in meeting critical basic needs such as food and housing while working with families on a long-term basis to help them increase their potential for financial and social self-sufficiency. It is dedicated to fostering self-reliance in individuals, families and communities. This is accomplished by providing a variety of programs and solutions designed to address local needs and issues. CASFB has been a pioneer in the development of publicly and privately sponsored programs designed to address the needs of the disadvantaged. The organization has a trained staff with many community contacts to help low-income persons evaluate their problems and lead them to resources that can help in solving those problems.
Programs.
Food Bank.
The Community Action Food Bank is the second largest food bank in Utah and is the only food bank serving Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. It is often confused with the Utah Food Bank, which is a separate organization that primarily serves Salt Lake and Tooele counties but also assists food pantries in other counties in the state of Utah. Community Action Food Bank annually distributes more than 2.3 million pounds of food to thousands of families and many local service organizations. Community Action employees and volunteers work to alleviate hunger by providing eligible families with food boxes, counseling, budgeting and referrals. They collect and distribute donated food and hygiene items on a regular basis to more than thirty other agencies, including local pantries, community agencies, churches and senior centers. The Community Action Food Bank also operates five food pantries located in Utah communities Payson, American Fork, Heber, Kamas, and Coalville. An additional satellite office in Park City relies on Community Action for food and other donated items.
Family Development Program.
The Family Development Program helps families become self-reliant by providing short-term assistance to resolve immediate crises, such as help paying for rent or bus tokens, followed by continued support to assist them in attaining financial stability and self-reliance. Support includes haircuts for job applicants, help with resumes and references.
The program works with families to increase their potential for social and financial self-sufficiency through goal setting, case management, self-empowerment/self-esteem training, and advocacy assistance.
Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program.
The Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program helps families obtain long-term home ownership through education and counseling. It works toward strengthening communities by identifying resources, advocating ethical practices and assisting with dispute resolutions.
Community Action Services and Food Bank is approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a housing counseling agency. The program provides the following services free of charge: pre-home ownership counseling, home buyer education classes, mortgage default counseling, reverse mortgage counseling, refinance counseling, and predatory lending counseling.
HEAT Program.
Community Action Services and Food Bank administers the Utah State Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT) Program for Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. The HEAT Program provides approximately 4,200 eligible low-income households with a once-per-year utility payment to help ease the burden of electricity and heating costs while promoting energy conservation. An energy conservation class is required for first time applicants.
Community Services Program.
Community Action Services and Food Bank helps improve the quality of life for elderly and disabled individuals by connecting them to programs and resources through home and community visits. Community service specialists are available to assist local senior citizens and disabled residents by assessing individual situations and determining eligibility for specific programs. Referrals are also given for other resources that may be beneficial to each individual. Help is provided in completing the forms to apply for the HEAT Program, the Circuit Breaker Program, a property tax abatement, veteran’s abatement, blind abatement, mobile home abatement, or renter refund. Outreach workers are available in local senior citizen centers several times each month. In addition, home visits are arranged for those who are homebound.
Youth Program.
Community Action Services and Food Bank directs the Utah Valley chapter of Trips for Kids, a national program that provides mountain bike experiences and training to local, underprivileged youth. The program helps youth from low-income families resist negative peer pressure and become contributing members of the community by providing mentor support and skills training. Trips for Kids Utah Valley currently holds three six-week sessions each year. Youth ages 12 to 17 who are accepted into a session attend weekly workshops and go on two to three rides in the nearby mountains. Scholarships for registration fees and equipment are available for those who qualify.
Community Garden.
Starting in April of each year, Community Action Services and Food Bank leases small garden plots in its community garden in located behind the Boulders Apartments in Provo. The CASFB Community Garden allows families with limited yard space to grow their own fresh produce alongside their neighbors and other community members. Garden plots are measured in 4-foot by 20-foot rectangles with 4-foot walkways between plots. Watering is provided as a service of the garden, but gardeners are responsible for providing their own tools and seeds.
Advocacy and Building Community Solutions.
Community Action Services and Food Bank works with other community organizations to develop solutions to the problems faced by low and moderate-income Utah residents. It also works to bring about change in local, state, and national policies.
Organization.
The Community Action Services and Food Bank board of trustees provides direction and guidance to staff regarding community needs, future planning, and fiscal oversight. It is a tri-partite board consisting of 1/3 public, 1/3 private, and 1/3 low-income representatives, thereby giving low-income residents an opportunity to provide input to agency programs and operations. The agency's annual budget exceeds $1.5 million, and independent external audits are conducted for each fiscal year. Approximately 75 percent of the agency's funds come from grants such as the Community Services Block Grant. Remaining funds come from local sources including the United Way of Utah County and corporate and private donations.
Several local autonomous organizations in Utah had their start at Community Action Services and Food Bank, including Information and Referral, the Volunteer Center, Crisis Line, and others. The agency has also served as a catalyst to coordinate efforts and encourage other organizations to deliver needed services. CASFB is recognized locally for its leadership capabilities, expertise in regard to poverty issues, and ability to provide quality services.

John Brown, formerly judge of the Chickamauga District of the Cherokee Nation East, was elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation West 22 April 1839, after the Old Settlers decided to elect new officers to strengthen their position vis-a-vis the Latecomers under John Ross, in place of then Principal Chief John Looney. He served until a majority of the Old Settlers decided his administration had not gone far enough to accomplish a compromise with the Ross party, and re-elected his predecessor John Looney in his place that July.
Brown's Tavern in Lookout Valley, Chattanooga, Tennessee, is so-named because it was once his, part of a complex of businesses that included a riverboat landing for the tavern and inn, Brown's Ferry a mile or more downstream, a large farm, and a mill. Now a private home, it is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Kougari Oval

The BMD Kougari Oval is a sports venue in the Brisbane, Australia suburb of Manly West. Since 1967, it has been the home of the Wynnum-Manly Seagulls, a rugby league club playing in the Queensland Cup. The ground has a capacity of about 5,000 spectators, and the current naming-rights sponsor is The BMD Group, a Brisbane urban development company.
The ground is occasionally used for trial matches by the Brisbane Broncos, to which the Seagulls are affiliated, and has been used for youth internationals by the Australia national schoolboy rugby league team - one of which resulted in that team's heaviest defeat, an 8-46 loss to the Junior Kiwis in 2005.
The ground was built by the club on land purchased in 1964, and was originally known as Wondall Road ground. The current name was adopted in about 1971, and comes from the Yugumbir aborigine word for seagull.

J. Christopher Burch

J. Christopher Burch (born March 28, 1953) is an entrepreneur active in the lifestyle brand and retail sectors. He is the founder and CEO of Burch Creative Capital, a firm with offices in New York City and Shanghai that manages venture investments and brand development and co-founder of Tory Burch LLC along with his ex-wife fashion designer Tory Burch.
Early life.
Burch was raised in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in a middle-class family. His mother Robin Sinkler, an Episcopalian, was from a Philadelphia Main Line family and his father, John Walter Burch, a Roman Catholic, was one of 10 kids born to a middle-class Baltimore family. His father owned a distributor of mining equipment and supplies.
Career.
Christopher Burch was an entrepreneur and investor in the fashion industry and in real estate. He became a billionaire in 2012, with "Forbes Magazine"'s profile of him in its annual "The World's Billionaires" stating that the 2012 valuation of Burch's majority stake in C. Wonder pushed his net worth over the ten figure mark. In addition to his personal investments, he was an investor with the Guggenheim Partners.
Fashion industry.
In 1976, while an undergraduate at Ithaca College, Burch and his brother Robert started Eagle's Eye apparel with a $2,000 investment. The two bought the sweaters for $10 each and then sold them for $15. Burch noticed that the students around him were constantly wearing "preppy" sweaters, and decided to find a factory to produce a new brand so that he could sell them door-to-door on campus. His operation soon expanded to other campuses, where at first he sold them on his own, and later he hired employees nationally. Eventually, he sold them through retails stores. The name of the company was an homage to their father, whose nickname was Eagle. Over the next decade, the company expanded to $140 million in sales and a national distribution footprint, including more than 50 of its own retail stores. The company was partially sold to Swire Group, in 1989, and entirely, in 1998 in a deal that valued the brand at $60 million.
In 2004, Burch helped his then wife of eight years to launch the Tory Burch fashion label, investing in the business. He served as co-Chairman of the company. He also owned 28.3%, selling half of it in December 2012, as the company was estimated to be worth $3.5 billion. He then established J. Christopher Capital LLC in 2008, which was later renamed Burch Creative Capital. The company was developed to incubate his new brands and to manage his investments. In 2011, he invested in two new fashion companies, including C. Wonder, described as a "a colorful and preppy chain of boutiques with a flagship store in New York's SoHo". Burch stated that the company was inspired by the idea of "shopping for great value be a luxurious and fun experience". In 2011, he also invested in the Monika Chiang fashion line. In 2013 C. Wonder sold a ten percent stake in the company to Fidelity Investments for $35 million, valuing the company at $350 million.
Real estate.
In 2004, Burch partnered with architect Philippe Stark and hotelier Alan Faena to develop the Faena Hotel+Universe in Buenos Aires. The investment into the building, first built in 1902 as a grain storage facility, was in excess of $100 million. In 2005, Burch purchased a luxury home in Southampton, New York for $14 million, and sold the home for $25 million four months later after renovating the property. Burch then founded J.B. Christopher, a supplier of construction materials to real estate developers, in 2006. In 2011, Burch and his partner Austin Hearst completed the development of a $19 million luxury home developments in Nantucket, Massachusetts. In 2013, Burch purchased the Nihiwatu resort on the island of Sumba, a 27 villa estate resort near Bali.
Other investments.
In 1993, Burch was a producer for the feature-length romantic comedy film "Watch It", directed by Tom Flynn, which received a favorable review from the "New York Times". Burch was then one of the earliest investors in the Internet IPO for Internet Capital Group, being connected to the company by a friend of his who helped managed the company. Burch has made several investments in telecommunications, including Aliph and Powermat. He was also an investor in the bottled water company, Voss Water. Burch is also an investor in the online office retailer Poppin.
Personal life.
Burch has been married twice:
Burch was on the board of the Rothman Institute Orthopedic Foundation. He is a past president of The Pierre Hotel Co-op Board, and a past board member of Guggenheim Partners, and The Continuum Group. In 2013, Burch donated $1.3 million to his alma mater the Tilton School, and was on the school's Board of Trustees from 1982-1985.

<doc id="21507777" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21507777" title="Berlin Rules on Water Resources">
Berlin Rules on Water Resources

The Berlin Rules on Water Resources is a document adopted by the International Law Association (ILA) to summarize international law customarily applied in modern times to freshwater resources, whether within a nation or crossing international boundaries. Adopted on August 21, 2004 in Berlin, the document supersedes the ILA's earlier "The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers", which was limited in its scope to international drainage basins and aquifers connected to them.
Background.
In 1966, the ILA adopted "The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers", an unenforceable guideline governing the usage of rivers and connected groundwaters that crossed national boundaries. As the guideline did not address other aquifers, various other guidelines were subsequently drafted and adopted by other organizations to replace or supplement them, including the United Nations' unratified "Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses" and the ILA's own "Rules on International Groundwaters." However, these documents were restricted to addressing international waters. In 1996, the ILA appointed Joseph Dellapenna to produce a compilation of water related laws, following the production of which in 1997 it decided to create a comprehensive document, addressing all freshwater resources as well as issues affecting the climate that impacts them.
Provisions.
The document requires that nations take appropriate steps to sustain and manage water resources, in conjunction with other resources, and minimize environmental harm. In addition to setting out various regulations for nations to follow with respect to water within their boundaries and water they may share, it regulates behavior in wartime, including damage to water installations such as dams and dikes. Nations are not permitted to take action that may result in a shortage of life-sustaining water for civilians, unless a nation being invaded is compelled by military emergency to disable its "own" water supply, or that may cause undue ecological damage. Poisoning water necessary for survival is in all cases forbidden.
Where water resources are internationally shared, it regulates equitable use with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of all bordering nations. It mandates that the first consideration in weighing needs is satisfying the requirements of human beings for water to sustain life. It requires that nations sharing water make reasonable efforts not to cause harm to one another by the ways in which the water is used. It permits free navigation by all nations sharing a water system, although it allows reasonable restriction by a nation of water navigation within its jurisdiction for security. Nations are expected to work together as needed to sustain shared water resources.
The document requires a reasonable openness to the international community of information related to water resources and their usage, particularly in those cases where nations sharing a water resource may be impacted. Except in cases of emergency, usage that may significantly impact others should be discussed in advance with all interested nations, with disagreements resolved by appeal as necessary to international governing committees. 
Regardless of the location of water, and whether or not a water resource is shared, it asserts the right of every individual to equally access water to sustain life without discrimination, even in times of war. It requires states to enable their citizens to participate in decisions affecting water access by providing reasonable information about the water resource and plans impacting it. It also mandates the compensation of those who are displaced in the interests of securing water preservation. It requires that nations be mindful of the environmental factors that affect water resources and preserve them appropriately, such as by preventing water pollution and preserving native ecosystems, even if they are occupying foreign territory during a time of war. It requires appropriate measures to address flooding and drought, both in communicating quickly about these to nations sharing a water resource and in working to eliminate or prevent harm to a water resource and the population dependent on it.
The Berlin Rules on Water Resources provides that nations must enforce its provisions through local legislation and also submit to international review as necessary to ensure that they are compliant.

Mary Foote Henderson

Mary Foote Henderson (July 21, 1842 - July 16, 1931) was an American real estate developer, and social activist.
Life.
She was born in Seneca Falls, New York, the daughter of Eunice Newton and Elisha Foote, a prominent lawyer and judge, and the niece of Senator Samuel Foote of Connecticut. Henderson was educated at Temple Grove Ladies Seminary (now Skidmore College), Saratoga Springs and at Ashgrove Seminary, in Albany, finishing at a French school in New York City. She was fluent in French and had a lifelong interest in painting and art collecting.
In June 1868 she was married to John B. Henderson, Senator from Missouri (1862–1869) who introduced the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution that abolished slavery and one of seven Republicans who voted against the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in May 1868. That unpopular decision ended his career as senator, and he and his new wife moved back to Missouri, living first in the town of Louisiana and then in St. Louis. The couple had one child, John Henderson Jr., who was born in 1870. Mary Henderson pursued many interests in St. Louis. Like her mother before her, she believed in woman's suffrage, and became president of the Missouri State Suffrage Association. She studied art at Washington University, and founded the St. Louis School of Design as well as the St. Louis Women's Exchange. Known as an excellent hostess, she wrote a guide to fine entertaining, "Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving," in 1877. In 1885, Henderson published a second cookbook, "Diet for the Sick, A Treatise on the Values of Foods."
The Hendersons became very wealthy, when John Henderson bought up enormous quantities of supposedly worthless bonds that Missouri counties had issued after the war. Purchased at ten cents on the dollar, the bonds became valuable when the courts ordered counties to pay Henderson their full face value. In 1889, after accumulating a fortune, the Hendersons moved back to Washington D.C., where they built a castle-like mansion on Sixteenth Street called "Boundary Castle" or "Henderson's Castle." The Hendersons bought up dozens of lots outside the northern boundary of the city in the area known as Meridian Hill. 
Mary Henderson’s interest in the immediate neighborhood, which coincided with the City Beautiful Movement of the early 20th century, ultimately led to the construction of the Meridian Hill Park.
Mrs. Henderson bought blocks of real estate and had elaborate residences constructed that she sold as embassies. The architect, George Oakley Totten, Jr., designed nearly a dozen buildings on l5th and 16th Streets in the Meridian Hill area to enhance the area for diplomatic uses. With a genuine interest in civic improvement, Mrs. Henderson frequently lobbied Congress for various projects to improve and beautify the Meridian Hill area. She supported two successive plans, by architect Paul J. Pelz in 1898 by Franklin W. Smith in 1900, to construct a colossal presidential mansion on Meridian Hill to replace the White House. These plans never came to fruition. She was, however, successful in lobbying Congress to support the acquisition of the land and its development as Meridian Hill Park.
Henderson became a strong advocate for temperance and vegetarianism, and published a book on health and diet called "The Aristocracy of Health." When her husband died in 1913, she had his entire wine cellar, a thirty-year collection of costly wines, emptied into the street.
In 1925, Mrs. Henderson also donated land to the District of Columbia for the construction of the Mount Pleasant Library at 3160 Sixteenth Street. Mrs. Henderson’s most well known crusade was to change the name of 16th Street to “Avenue of the Presidents,” and to line the street with busts of all the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States. While she actually succeeded in having legislation passed to change the name of the street in 1913, the Commission of Fine Arts denied her request to construct the busts. One year later, because the name “Avenue of the Presidents” proved to be unpopular, the original 16th Street name was restored.
Following her death at Bar Harbor, Maine in 1931, the Commission of Fine Arts praised her efforts and her vision of Meridian Hill. A report by the Commission stated:
“Persistently she labored during four decades, persuading and convincing Senators and Representatives; single-handed and alone she appeared before committees of Congress to urge approval for the work of development. She won.

John Jolly

John Jolly (Cherokee: Ahuludegi; also known as "Oolooteka"), was Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation–West when the 1828 constitution was adopted. He was a friend and protector of a young Sam Houston.
Background.
Jolly "was a wealthy merchant and planter. Jolly spoke no English, and dressed in buckskin with a hunting shirt, leggings and moccasins," according to the Cherokee Nation website.
John Jolly was headman of Cayuga town (on Hiwassee Island in present-day Hamilton County, Tennessee), after his brother, Tahlonteeskee's, departure for 'the west' in 1809. He eventually followed his brother to the Arkansaw Territory. There, Jolly was elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation—West upon the death of his brother, in 1819.
Black Coat, who served with Jolly as Second Chief, died in the spring of 1835, and was succeeded by Joseph Vann.
Friendship with Houston.
When the young Sam Houston came to live with the Cherokee on Hiwassee Island in 1809, Jolly adopted him and acted as his father in the Cherokee Nation. Jolly gave Houston the Cherokee name of "Ka'lanu", meaning 'the Raven'. Houston later returned to his family in Maryville, Tennessee, but he lived once again with the Cherokee in the west during the late 1820s and early 1830s.
Achievements as Principal Chief.
In 1828, during Jolly's term of office, the Cherokee Nation—West adopted a constitution establishing a tripartite government, much like that previously adopted by the Cherokee Nation—East (1827). That same year, most of the western Cherokee were moved from Indian Reserve areas in the Arkansas Territory to the newly established Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma).
In his role as leader, Jolly frequently raised issues of security and treaty rights with both U.S. government officials in Washington DC and with Arkansas territorial authorities. Shortly after being named president, Jolly wrote to Arkansas governor George Izard in alarm over rumors that the governor was about to broach the subject of the sale of Cherokee lands in Arkansas. Jolly advised the governor that the Cherokee had no lands whatsoever that they wished to sell and that, furthermore, the U.S. government was in arrears in meeting its financial obligations left over from the previous treaty of 1817. For a decade, he used diplomatic means to fend off pressures from American settlers and government representatives to restrict Cherokee lands in Arkansas and eventually to force the Arkansas Cherokee to move again out of Arkansas and into Indian Territory.
One writer states that much of Jolly's success as Chief "was due to the counsel and support of John Rogers", his brother-in-law and Cherokee headman.
Jolly served as Principal Chief until his death in December 1838. He was succeeded by John Looney, who had been his assistant principal chief.
Legacy.
Hiwassee Island, at the mouth of the Hiwassee River where it meets the Tennessee, used to be commonly known as "Jolly's Island" after the Cherokee leader. Residents in the area sometimes still call it that.

Paul Moore (banking manager)

Paul Moore is a former manager at the UK bank HBOS, who came to public attention as a whistleblower in the banking crisis of late 2008 as a result of having been dismissed from his position as head of the bank's financial risk management in 2004 after warning his employers that they were taking excessive risks, at a time before the banking crisis of 2008 demonstrated that the risks were, indeed, real, when the bank was in danger of collapse until forced into a merger and then bailed out by a multi-billion-pound infusion of capital from the Treasury.
Moore's complaints were investigated at the time (before the crisis) by accountancy firm KPMG, who concluded that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place; this was accepted by the Financial Services Authority.
He sued HBOS for unfair dismissal on the basis that the reason for his dismissal was actually his warnings of excessive risk, which if followed would have reduced the bank's profits while protecting it from what proved to be the all-too-real risk. The bank settled his claim for over half a million pounds in mid-2005.
Biography.
Educated at the Catholic boarding school Ampleforth College, Moore trained as a barrister. He was involved in UK financial regulation since it began in 1986. Between 1995 and 2002 he was a partner in KPMG's Financial Sector Practice in London specialising in regulatory services where he advised a number of FTSE100 clients on regulatory matters.
Between 2002 and 2004, Moore was head of Group Regulatory Risk at HBOS. He had formal responsibility for the bank's policy and oversight of executive management's compliance with FSA regulation.
Dismissal controversy.
In November 2004 Moore was dismissed by HBOS. He claimed this was because he had told HBOS's board that the bank was taking excessive risks with its aggressive sales culture which was out of balance with its systems and controls. He passed his concerns about HBOS to the FSA, who had it investigated by KPMG, whose conclusion, that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place, was accepted by the FSA. Following his dismissal the bank replaced him with a retail sales manager.
Still before the crisis, he sued HBOS for unfair dismissal; the bank settled his claim for over half a million pounds in mid-2005, under terms of what amounted to a gagging agreement, a specific requirement that he remain silent concerning his dismissal.
Although Moore had agreed to the non-disclosure agreement as part of his settlement, he decided to speak out after the crisis because he believed it to be in the public interest. A House of Commons Treasury Select Committee investigation later lifted the agreement under parliamentary privilege in order that his view of the events leading to the HBOS crash be presented.
On 10 February 2009 Moore submitted a memorandum of evidence to the UK's Treasury Select Committee, which was investigating risks taken by UK banks prior to the credit crunch. Following the revelation that Moore had been fired by Sir James Crosby, formerly CEO at HBOS, Crosby re-signed from his subsequent post of Deputy Director at the FSA.
Current work.
Moore runs a risk consultancy, Moore Carter and Associates, and is also non-executive Chairman of Assetz Capital, a peer-to-peer lender aimed at SMEs and property developers in the UK.
He has announced his intentions to publish a book in November 2014, about the HBOS whistle blowing and subsequent events called ""Crash, Bank, Wallop"".

The Koobas

The Koobas were an English beat group from Liverpool. Their music, and their early history, is similar in some ways to that of fellow Liverpudlians The Beatles, though they never achieved widespread popularity.
History.
The group was founded in 1962 in Liverpool by members who had previously played in local outfits such as the Thunderbeats and Roy Montrose and the Midnights. They used both the spellings "Kubas" and "Koobas" at times. Late in 1963 they began playing at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, doing a three-week stint there.
Brian Epstein signed them to a contract in 1964 and brokered them a deal with Pye Records. In 1965 they were to appear in the film "Ferry Cross the Mersey" (a Gerry & The Pacemakers vehicle) as the losers in a battle of the bands, but this footage was cut from the film's final release. Their first single was "I Love Her" b/w "Magic Potion", which did not make the charts, but the group opened for The Beatles on their last British tour to support the single.
In the summer of 1965 they played, as resident group, in the Rock Ballroom at Butlin's Holiday Camp in Ayr, Scotland.
Following the dates with the Beatles, the group did club tours of England and attracted much positive press, but further singles failed to catch on with the public. In 1966, they moved from Pye to EMI-Columbia, and the following year played with The Who at the Savile Theatre and toured with Jimi Hendrix in Switzerland.
By 1967, the band had started to change its sound from R&B-rooted beat to psychedelia, and began writing their own material with the help of new manager Tony Stratton-Smith. In 1968, they cut a version of "The First Cut Is the Deepest", but were overshadowed by P.P. Arnold's version, which hit the UK Singles chart Top 20. Near the end of 1968, the group splintered just as EMI-Columbia prepped their self-titled first LP, released early in 1969. The Koobas never made it into the official sales chart but their cover of the Gracie Fields hit "Sally" climbed as high as number 21 on pirate station Radio London's Fab 40 in January 1967. Later that spring they recorded their own composition, 'Somewhere in the night',which reached number 3 in the Radio London Fab 40.
Drummer Tony O'Reilly joined Yes in September 1968, after Bill Bruford's departure to go to university, but Bruford returned in November of that year. He went on to play with Bakerloo.
Keith Ellis later played with Van der Graaf Generator and Juicy Lucy, while Stuart Leatherwood formed the duo Gary & Stu and later played with March Hare. The group's entire post-1966 output was reissued on CD in 2000 by the Beat Goes On label.

Carl Röchling

Carl Röchling (May 21, 1855 – May 6, 1920) was a German painter and illustrator known for his representation of historical military themes.
Life.
Röchling was born in Saarbrücken, part of the Prussian Rhine Province, son of Friedrich Röchling, a judiciary worker, and Angelika Stoll. He studied from 1875 to 1880 in the Karlsruhe Academy of Arts "(Kunstschule)" with Ludwig des Coudres and Ernst Hildebrand and later in the Academy of Arts of Berlin "(Akademie der Künste)". 
While in Berlin, he was a pupil of the great master painter Anton von Werner, with whom he participated in the creation of various panoramic paintings such as "Der Schlacht von Sedan" ("The Battle of Sedan"). Later he became well known for his independent work of historical and military paintings in the turn of the 19th century. He died on May 6, 1920 in Berlin.
Works.
Among Röchling's most famous works of military themes are various depictions of battle scenes of Prussian army victories, especially those during the Franco-Prussian War.
Together with Georg Koch and Eugen Bracht a panorama of the Battle of Chattanooga is among his works. He also worked in partnership with Richard Knötel and Woldemar Friedrich in illustrating two popular children books ("Der Alte Fritz in 50 Bildern für Jung und Alt"[http://www.scribd.com/doc/83056439/Der-alte-Fritz-in-50-Bildern-fur-Jung-und-Alt-von-Carl-Rochling-u-Richard-Knotel-Berlin-1895] in 1895 and "Die Königin Luise in 50 Bildern für Jung und Alte" in 1896).

Nordy Bank (novel)

Nordy Bank is a children's adventure novel by Sheena Porter, published by Oxford in 1964 with illustrations by Annette Macarthur-Onslow. Set in the hills of Shropshire, it features children whose camping holiday seems to engage the prehistoric past. Porter won the annual Carnegie Medal for excellence in British children's literature.
Roy Publishers issued the first US edition in 1967, retaining the original illustrations.
Plot summary.
Six children plan a camping trip during the Easter holidays, deciding on Brown Clee Hill as it is out of the way of summer visitors. They set up camp on the top of the hill, which turns out to be the site of an Iron Age hill fort, Nordy Bank. Bronwen is particularly susceptible to the atmosphere of the place, and shows unexpected knowledge about its construction. Her personality begins to change, as from a quiet good-natured girl she becomes argumentative, then increasingly withdrawn and sullen. Bron is aware of the change and frightened by it. Her friend Margery believes she is possessed by the spirit of an Iron Age woman.
Meanwhile an Alsatian dog of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps escapes while on his way to retraining by the National Canine Defence League after being retired due to partial deafness. Being muzzled, he is unable to hunt and becomes increasingly hungry. When the dog appears lurking round the camp, the dog-loving Bron reacts with fear and hostility, calling him a wolf. However, his forlorn state eventually rouses her true self and she befriends him.
References to actual history and geography.
The novel is set primarily in a precisely described location, Nordy Bank on Brown Clee Hill in Shropshire. The surrounding countryside, the Shropshire Hills, the village of Clee St. Margaret, and the market town of Ludlow also feature prominently. (As of 2007 Porter lives in Ludlow.)
The ancient hill fort at Nordy Bank was designed for defence against men or wolves. The novel describes the differences between Roman, Iron Age and Stone Age camps on the site.
References to other works.
Margery and Bron quote from A. E. Housman's poem "The Welsh Marches" while looking at the surrounding landscape. The novel echoes the theme of the poem, the long history of warfare in the region, the "war that sleeps" in the land itself.
For reading in camp, Bron takes Rosemary Sutcliff's novel "Warrior Scarlet", about a boy in Bronze Age Britain whose test of manhood is the single-handed killing of a wolf. When the army dog first appears, she is reading aloud to the others a wolf attack on the boy's sheep.
Literary significance.
In "The Nesbit Tradition", Marcus Crouch calls "Nordy Bank" Sheena Porter's finest book. He describes the camping scenes as beautifully done, conveying a sense of adventure and good companionship, but he regards the novel as primarily concerned with the development of personality. "In "Nordy Bank" Sheena Porter shows how self-discovery can go hand-in-hand with the discovery of society. It is an effective lesson, the more so because the lesson is contained in an absorbing and dramatic story and the inner and outer themes are inseparable."
Porter and "Nordy Bank" won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for 1964, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.

Aviva Stadium

The Aviva Stadium is a sports stadium located in Dublin, Ireland, with a capacity for 51,700 spectators (all seated). It is built on the site of the former Lansdowne Road stadium, which was demolished in 2007, and replacing it as home to its chief tenants: the Irish rugby union team and the Republic of Ireland football team. The decision to redevelop the stadium came after plans for both Stadium Ireland and Eircom Park fell through. Aviva Group Ireland signed a 10-year deal for the naming rights in 2009.
The stadium, located adjacent to Lansdowne Road railway station, officially opened on 14 May 2010. The stadium is Ireland's first, and only, UEFA Elite Stadium and in 2011, it hosted the Europa League Final. It also hosted the inaugural Nations Cup, as well as the regular home fixtures of the national rugby team and national football team from August 2010 onwards. 
Unlike its predecessor, which was solely owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), the current stadium is controlled by the IRFU and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) through a 50:50 joint venture known as the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company (LRSDC). The joint venture has a 60-year lease on the stadium; on expiry the stadium will return to the exclusive ownership of the IRFU.
Facilities.
The stadium is a bowl shape with four tiers on three sides of the ground; the lower and upper tiers being for general access, the second and third levels feed the second tier for premium tickets and the fourth tier for corporate boxes. The northern end of the stadium, due to its proximity to local housing, incorporates only the lower tier of the bowl. The North Stand is to be the away stand for football internationals. There is one basement level and seven storeys of floors including ground level. The premium level holds 10,000 spectators, while the box level holds 1,300. The remaining 38,700 seats are shared between the top and bottom tiers. The capacity of the stadium was criticised even before its opening for being too small, particularly in light of the large supporter attendance figures for Irish rugby internationals and soccer internationals at Croke Park since 2007. The stadium's roof is designed to undulate in a wave-like manner so as to avoid blocking light to local residences.
History.
The stadium was officially opened on 14 May 2010 by then Taoiseach Brian Cowen.
In 2011, the stadium won a British Construction Industry Award.
Events.
Rugby union.
The Ireland rugby union team is playing its home games at the stadium, as it did previously at Lansdowne Road, taking over from their temporary home, Croke Park, where games were played during Aviva's construction. Ireland's first international game was on 6 November 2010 against South Africa, with the Springboks winning 23–21. The game drew a disappointing crowd of 35,515, mainly due to a backlash by Ireland supporters over the IRFU's controversial ticketing strategy for the November Test series. Initially, the IRFU announced that tickets to the November Tests would only be sold as packages for all four matches. Later, it announced that the tickets would instead be split into two packages, with the South Africa Test bundled with the following week's match with Samoa for a minimum of €150, and the New Zealand and Argentina Tests bundled for a minimum of €190. Single-game tickets were to be available only for the Samoa and Argentina Tests. On 1 November, the IRFU backed away from this plan amid heavy criticism from member clubs that had problems selling the packages in a difficult economy. 
The first rugby union game at the Aviva was an exhibition game on 31 July 2010, billed as the O2 Challenge, involving under-18 and under-20 players from all four of Ireland's provincial sides, with a Leinster/Ulster side defeating a Munster/Connacht combination 68–0. As part of the run-up to the event, O2 ran a promotion which gave the winner the opportunity to attempt to score the ceremonial first points at the Aviva via a simulated conversion kick on the day before the match. The winner of the promotion, John Baker of Ennis, was successful. The first official points at the Aviva were scored by Ulster's Craig Gilroy with a try in the O2 Challenge.
The stadium also hosts some home games for Leinster when the RDS Arena's smaller capacity doesn't satisfy demand. Leinster won their opening home game in the Aviva against Munster 13-9, in the Magners League (now PRO12) season, in front of a then record Pro12 attendance of 50,645. This league record was exceeded on 29 March 2014 when Leinster again beat Munster, 22-18, in front of 51,700 people.
Heineken Cup.
Leinster won their first Heineken Cup game in the Aviva 24–8, against Clermont Auvergne in a pool game during the 2010–11 season. During Leinster's successful run to the Heineken Cup title that season, they took their quarter-final and semi-final matches to the Aviva, defeating Leicester Tigers and Toulouse respectively.
Ulster took their 2012 Heineken Cup semi-final to the Aviva as well, defeating Edinburgh.
The 2013 Heineken Cup Final took place in the Aviva Stadium on 18 May 2013 where Toulon beat Clermont Auvergne 16-15. The Heineken Cup final was last held in Dublin in 2003 when Toulouse beat Perpignan 22–17 at Lansdowne Road.
Association football.
The stadium also hosts the home games of the Republic of Ireland, as did Lansdowne Road. The team had played most home games at Croke Park during the construction of the Aviva. The first soccer match in the Aviva was Manchester United against a League of Ireland XI side, managed by Damien Richardson, on 4 August 2010. Manchester United won the game 7–1, with Park Ji-Sung scoring the first ever goal in the Aviva Stadium. The first international game for Ireland in the Aviva Stadium was a 1–0 friendly loss against Argentina on 11 August 2010. The first competitive goal was scored by Kevin Kilbane in a Euro 2012 qualifying game on 7 September 2010 against Andorra.
FAI Cup Final.
The Aviva annually hosts the FAI Cup Final, which was shared between the RDS Arena and the Tallaght Stadium while the Aviva Stadium was being built. The first Cup Final at the new stadium was the 2010 FAI Cup Final, held on Sunday 14 November 2010. Sligo Rovers beat Shamrock Rovers 2–0 on penalties after the game finished 0–0 after extra time. A total of 36,101 attended the game making it the biggest attendance at an FAI Cup Final since 1968. Tickets for the finals are to be included as part of the ten-year international tickets.
2011 Nations Cup.
The 2011 Nations Cup took place in the Aviva Stadium. The tournament featured national football teams from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In the opening round of fixtures the Republic of Ireland beat Wales 3–0 while Scotland beat Northern Ireland 3–0. The remaining four fixtures took place in May, with the Republic of Ireland winning the tournament after beating Scotland 1–0 on 29 May, with Keane scoring the only goal.
2011 Europa League Final.
The 2011 UEFA Europa League Final between Portuguese sides Porto and Braga took place in the Aviva Stadium. Due to UEFA rules against corporate sponsorship outside the federation, the stadium was referred to as the "Dublin Arena" for this final, that ended with a 1–0 victory for Porto.
Dublin Super Cup.
The Dublin Super Cup was a pre-season football tournament which was held at the Aviva. Celtic, Manchester City, Inter Milan and a League of Ireland XI competed in the 2011 edition, with Manchester City winning the tournament.
The 'Dublin Decider'.
The 'Dublin Decider' was a game which took place on the 10th August 2013. The match was played between Celtic and Liverpool, with both teams having large support in Ireland. Celtic won the match 1-0 thanks to a goal from Amido Balde. 
There are supposed to be talks ongoing about a return of the 'Dublin Decider' in the summer of 2014 with clubs such as Barcelona, Manchester United and Celtic being mentioned as potential visitors to the Aviva Stadium.
American football.
On 1 September 2012, the stadium hosted an American college football game billed as the Emerald Isle Classic between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Navy Midshipmen. Notre Dame won 50-10.
Transport connections.
The stadium is served by public transport with Bus and DART. More remotely, it may also be reached, following a journey on foot by the Luas and Busáras. The stadium is inaccessible by car on match days due to a 1 km car-free exclusion zone in operation.

Degadoga

Degadoga, (Cherokee, ""Tatoka""), was an 1810 Cherokee emigrant to the Arkansaw area of the Louisiana Territory. He was the second Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation—West (from 1813 until 1817). Degadoga rose to the office of principal chief after the departure of his predecessor, The Bowl. The Bowl had been a past Chickamauga leader who had led Degadoga and several hundred followers into 'the west' to escape the influence and constant expansion of the United States. 
Degadoga served as war chief of the western Cherokee during the Cherokee-Osage War (1817-1823), having been replaced as principal chief by Tahlonteeskee.

Guard Mount

Guard Mount refers to two things. The first is the actual forming (mounting) of a military security group called: "the Guard". The second is the bugle call which was used to signal the formation of the group.
Military formation.
Guard mount refers to a pre-shift official formation among designated United States Air Force Security Forces or United States Army Military Police Corps members. This meeting is usually held after all security personnel have "armed up" or received their weapons and equipment for the shift. During the formation, the senior NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) such as the flight leader (known as the flight chief) or the First Seargent will discuss topics such as current unit, base or other Service (air force / army) level news, current terrorism warnings or military intelligence, and weapons, vehicle and ground safety. Members also will be inspected and assessed on their appearance, uniform and checked for required equipment. When held in a deployed combat threat environment, guardmount is somewhat akin to US Army Pre-combat Checks and Pre-combat Inspections, PCC and PCI respectively.
Bugle call.
Guard Mount is a bugle call which sounds as a warning that the guard is about to be assembled for guard mount.

The Bowl (Cherokee chief)

The Bowl (also Chief Bowles, Cherokee: ""Di'wali"") was one of the leaders of the Chickamauga Cherokee under Dragging Canoe (and later John Watts) who fought against the United States of America during the Chickamauga wars. He led the first large Cherokee emigration west across the Mississippi River in 1809, where he and his followers settled in what later became Arkansaw Territory. When the government was organized the next year, he was elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation—West, serving until his departure for Spanish Texas in 1813. He was succeeded by Degadoga.
The Bowl became leader of the Cherokee in Spanish Texas, along with Richard Fields, and ultimately died at the outbreak of war in 1839 between the "Tsalagiyi nvdagi" and the Republic of Texas. That war, which later claimed the lives of Fields and The Bowl's son, John Bowles, did not truly end until the Treaty of Bird’s Fort in 1843.

Peziza praetervisa

Peziza praetervisa, commonly known as the purple fairy cup or the fireplace cup, is a species of fungus in the genus "Peziza", family Pezizaceae. Recognized by its flattened, purple, cup-like fruiting bodies, this widespread fungus typically grows scattered or in clusters on burnt ground.
Description.
Fruiting bodies resemble flattened cups with diameters of up to . The inner spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is purple to purple-brown, but lightens to brown in age. The exterior surface is pale purple and scurfy (covered with small flakes or scales that are shed from the underlying surface). This species is sessile, and does not have a stipe. The flesh is thin and mauve-colored.
Microscopic characteristics.
Spores are elliptical, hyaline, with small, fine warts on the surface, and have dimensions of 12–14 × 7 8 micrometre. They are "biguttulate", containing two oil droplets at either end of the spore. The asci are 250–300 × 10–12 µm. Like other Pezizales, the asci open at maturity by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are club-shaped, filled with violet granules, and have bent tips; they are up to 7 µm wide.
Edibility.
The edibility of the Pezizaceae family is largely untested.
Habitat and distribution.
"P. praetervisa" is a widespread fungus that grows in scattered clusters on burned soil, and is often found on the remains of old campfires.
Similar species.
Other mushrooms resembling "P. praetervisa" include "Peziza violacea", which may be distinguished from the latter by its dark purple hymenium, and microscopically by its biguttulate warty ascospores. "Pachyella babingtonii" also has a purple brown hymenium, but is smaller, and translucent in appearance.

Gulaal

Gulaal () is a 2009 Indian thriller drama film directed by Anurag Kashyap and starring Kay Kay Menon, Raj Singh Chaudhary, Abhimanyu Singh, Deepak Dobriyal, Ayesha Mohan, Jesse Randhawa, Piyush Mishra and Aditya Srivastava. The film explores themes such as pursuit of power, quest for legitimacy, perceived injustices and hypocrisy of the powerful. The film is set in present day Rajasthan, a state in western India. The plot is provided by student politics of the university and a fictitious secessionist movement consisting of former Rajput leaders who have become present day elite.
Plot.
In the fictional town of Rajpur, Dilip (Raj Singh Chaudhary), a law student who is a Rajput from Bikaner, and his faithful servant, Bhanwar (Mukesh Bhatt), secure housing in an old, run-down British-era pub. Here Dilip meets Rananjay Singh “Ransa” (Abhimanyu Singh), a prince who despises the ideologies of his father and the aristocracy. Ransa's straightforward and fearless personality has quite an effect on the mild-mannered Dilip. Shortly, Dilip visits the university hostel where he is ragged by a gang of university thugs, led by Jadwal (Pankaj Jha). They strip him and lock him in a room with Anuja (Jesse Randhawa), a young lecturer in the same university. Both Dilip and Anuja are released naked. Dilip's brother tells him to ignore the event and that things were the same in his days, effectively stating that the society as a whole hasn’t changed much since his time. But Ransa disagrees and tells Dilip that they should avenge this act. Initially, Dilip is reluctant but finally gives in and goes along with Ransa, after Ransa provokes him to give the thugs a taste of their own medicine. But the tables are turned and both Dilip and Ransa are beaten and are ragged and thrown out of the hostel. Ransa meets Dukey Bana (Kay Kay Menon), a local figure who is trying to gather support for the Rajputana separatist movement, who allows them to proceed with the plan to injure Jadwal. Ransa and Dilip ambush Jadwal, but the other thugs corner them in a cinema hall. Dukey Bana interferes and rescues them. Dukey Bana then convinces Ransa to compete in the General Secretary Elections at the university. Running against Ransa is his father's out-of-wedlock daughter, Kiran (Ayesha Mohan).
Ransa is kidnapped by his father's out-of-wedlock son Karan (Aditya Srivastava), who asks him to withdraw from the elections. Ransa mocks him and Karan kills him. Taking advantage of the situation, Dukey Bana makes Dilip to take Ransa's place in the election. The chances of Dilip winning are minimal, so Dukey Bana bribes the electoral panel to rig the count in Dilip's favour. Dilip wins the election to become the general secretary. Kiran then seduces Dilip and convinces him to allow her to become the cultural secretary. Dukey Bana then starts using the funds for the Rajputana separatist movement. When Dilip finds out about this he goes to confront Dukey Bana about the funds. Bana lets Dilip know about the movement and tells him that the funds are being used for it. Dilip is not convinced and tries to reason with Bana. A frustrated Bana takes him to his country estate where his thugs have killed Jadwal and shows him the body to intimidate him. Anuja, is thrown out of the hostel and moves in with Dilip. Kiran gets pregnant and is angry with Dilip for being careless about it. She gets an abortion and leaves Dilip. Anuja tries to make Dilip understand that Kiran has no interest in leading a married life and leaves him. A frustrated Dilip resigns from his post and Kiran steps in. She then tries to seduce Dukey Bana, but she fails when Bhati (Deepak Dobriyal), Dukey's second-in-command, comes looking for Dukey. In a private meeting, an irate Dukey threatens Karan and Kiran by telling them that the only reason they're alive is because of their links to the local king.
Dilip, blinded by his love for Kiran, becomes violent and aggressive. Anuja also decides to leave him. Meanwhile Dilip finds out about Kiran from Bana's mistress, Madhuri (Mahi Gill). He grabs a gun, goes to Bana's house and shoots him. While dying, Bana tells him that Kiran used Dilip to get to him. At the same time, Karan reveals to his group of thugs that once Dukey Bana is out of the way, the Rajputana movement will have no choice but to choose Karan as its new leader and therefore legitimize his royal status. They conclude that to get rid of Dukey, they must first eliminate Bhati. Dilip wants to hear the truth from Kiran, so he tells Bhati to get her on the phone. Kiran refuses to answer, so Bhati goes off to find her and is killed by Karan's thugs. Dilip comes to meet Kiran who tells him that all she wanted to was use him to become general secretary. Dilip rejects her explanation and almost shoots her but gets shot by thugs. Despite his injuries, Dilip walks back to his house and dies there. The film ends with Karan as the head of the Rajputana movement, while Kiran sheds a tear as one of the loyal faithful.
Parallel to the plot there is an interesting character of Dukey Bana's brother Prithvi Bana played by Piyush Mishra. He wears bizarre dress and seems as psychic, though talks very satirically and often abused and slapped by Dukey banna for this. It is told in flashback that he was once a guitarist in his young days. Along with him there is a person characterized as Ardhanarishvara, who is killed by Dukey Bana mistakenly when Dukey Bana was outraged with his brother and aims to shoot him and misses.

Production on "Gulaal" began in 2001, when Anurag Kashyap was listening to songs from "Pyaasa" and his film "Paanch" was struggling with censors. Inspired by Mohammad Rafi songs from "Pyaasa" ("Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hai") and "Zeenat", ("Haye re duniya") the film is a dedication to Sahir Ludhianvi, the lyricist of the song and all other poets who had a vision of India. The film was also partially based on a story idea by Raj Singh Chaudhary who eventually played the role of Dilip Singh in the film. The film was delayed for three years for various reasons, but it was released in March 2009. The movie's first trailer was released with the director's other movie "Dev D".
Critical reception.
"Gulaal" received positive reviews from critics. Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave three stars and referred to Anurag Kashyap as Anti-Yash Chopra. Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it three stars and said that "fantastically watchable film that scores high on moments."
Nikhat Kazmi gave the film three stars and said that "the film scores in having taut performances and a gritty screenplay as well." Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL.in gave the film 3.5 stars and said "Anurag scripts every character cleverly providing an identity to even the smallest characters and also a contrast in form of another character – true playwright style. He even has the jesters coming in to bring some comic relief but also more importantly they bring in a message." Tamil writer Charu Nivedita said this film is the "best political film" ever in Hindi and a document of current political history..The film was screened at the 2009 London Film Festival
Since then, the film has gained significant cult following.
Box office.
Although the critics' reviews were favorable, the movie opened to only 30 percent capacity during its first week in theaters across India. In addition, word of mouth has been poor for this film, which could lead to slowdown at the box office for its subsequent runs in the weeks that followed. Box Office India stated that "Gulaal" netted in its first week, which was below expectations. The opening, at around 30% occupancy, was poor, though marginally better than some other recent films.

Shō Shitsu

The fourth son of King Shō Hō, he was named Prince of Sashiki in 1637, at the age of eight, and was granted Sashiki "magiri" as his domain. In 1645, his domain was changed to that of Nakagusuku "magiri", and his title to Prince of Nakagusuku.
Shō Shitsu succeeded his brother Shō Ken as king in 1648. His reign coincided with a period of rebellion and instability in China, as factions loyal to the Ming Dynasty, which fell in 1644, continued to fight against the new Qing Dynasty order. On at least one occasion, Ryukyuan tribute ships were attacked by pirates or rebels, who killed at least one of the Ryukyuan sailors and stole various objects; the authorities of Satsuma Domain declared the head envoy and his deputy to be at fault and had them executed. Another incident involved an attack on an Okinawan mission on the road to Beijing; the Ryukyuans defeated their attackers, and Hirata Tentsu came to be known as a national hero.
Though there was initially some uncertainty, particularly within Japan, as to whether the kingdom should support the new dynasty, or the Ming rebels, the Tokugawa shogunate left the decision up to Satsuma. The king's eldest son, Shō Tei, who would later succeed him as king, journeyed to Beijing and submitted the formal royal seal given the kingdom by the Ming rulers, to the Qing Court, which in turn granted the prince a new royal seal for the kingdom and declared its official recognition of Shō Shitsu as king.
A number of major reforms were effected in the final years of Shō Shitsu's reign, primarily at the guidance or suggestion of Shō Shōken, who was appointed "sessei", a position which has been compared to prime minister, in 1666. Shō Shōken also compiled the "Chūzan Seikan" ("Mirror of Chūzan"), the first history of the kingdom, at the king's orders.
Upon his death in 1668, he was entombed in the royal mausoleum Tamaudun, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Shō Tei.

Gravy (entertainer)

Gravy, (born Labon Kenneth Blackburn Leeweltine Buckonon Benjamin in 1955) is a former entertainer, famous throughout the cricket world, for 12 years of voluntary entertaining of the crowd through a variety of antics at the Antigua Recreation Ground in St John's, Antigua.
Performances.
For 12 years from 1988, Gravy entertained the crowd with a variety of costumes and performances in (and sometimes above) the crowd at the stadium: "Gravy is a performer. He cross-dresses and dances and writhes and swings from the rafters and puts on a show that you will not ever forget."
His act began by chance: "It started to rain during the presentation ceremony, and the podium was left open. "Something told me, Gravy, this is your time. I went down on the podium, in the rain, and started dancing. Everybody was excited about it. They loved it."" He was unpaid for his activities. When he retired in 2000, he did so while wearing a white wedding dress. Since retirement, he runs a hardware stall in St John's.
Shooting incident.
In February 2004, Gravy was shot in the arm. He was driving home at 2am when, in his own words "a car overtook me and rang out four shots at me, and then I felt a burning on my arm". Gravy believes it was a case of mistaken identity, and has stated "I thought they took me for the wrong person. I don't know anybody who could point a finger at me".

Tykocin Synagogue

The Tykocin Synagogue is an historic synagogue building in Tykocin, Poland. The synagogue, in mannerist-early Baroque style, was built in 1642. 
The synagogue was thoroughly restored in the late 1970s. The historic wall paintings, most of which are decorative texts of Hebrew prayers, were restored. The elaborate, decorative ceiling was not reconstructed although some idea of the style can be gleaned from the design of the Torah Ark.
A former Beit Medrash (study and prayer hall) located across the street has been restored and is in use as a city museum.
Although no Jews now live in Tykocin and the town has no other tourist attractions, 40,000 tourists a year come to see the old synagogue, which towers over the remote village "in lonely and unexpected splendor." The tourism has generated economic activity, including a cafe serving "Jewish-style" food and a bed-and-breakfast.

United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2010

The 2010 congressional elections in Arizona was held on November 2, 2010, to determine who will represent the state of Arizona in the United States House of Representatives. Arizona has eight seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected will serve in the 112th Congress from January 3, 2011 until January 3, 2013.
The state's 2009-2010 delegation consisted of five Democrats and three Republicans. With the exception of Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick, who had won the open seat in District 1 during the previous election, all members of the delegation were incumbents who had served for at least a full term in Congress. Also, with the exception of retiring Republican John Shadegg of District 3, all incumbent members of the states delegation ran for re-election.
As of August 17, 2010, Districts 1, 5 and 8, all currently held by Democrats, were considered to be competitive by both CQ Politics and The Cook Political Report. The primary elections for Congressional races were held on August 24, 2010.
Overview.
The table below shows the total number and percentage of votes, as well as the number of seats gained and lost by each political party in the election for the United States House of Representatives in Arizona. In addition, the voter turnout and the number of votes not valid will be listed below. 
District 1.
Democratic incumbent Ann Kirkpatrick ran for reelection, challenged by Republican nominee Paul Gosar and Libertarian nominee Nicole Patti (PVS).
Kirkpatrick and Patti ran unopposed in their respective primaries. The Republican primary featured 8 candidates seeking to take on Kirkpatrick in the general election. Mining industry lobbyist Sydney Hay, who had been the Republican nominee to run against Kirkpatrick in 2008, finished second in the primary behind dentist Paul Gosar. Gosar, a political neophyte, was buoyed by endorsements from highly visible Republican politicians, including Sarah Palin. Other unsuccessful Republican candidates included attorney Bradley Beauchamp and former state legislator Rusty Bowers. District 1 was represented by Kirkpatrick since 2009. Prior to her election in 2008, the district had been held by Republicans since 1995. Kirkpatrick lost on November 2, 2010 to Paul Gosar and the seat reverted to the Republicans.
District 2.
Republican incumbent Trent Franks was challenged by Democratic nominee John Thrasher (campaign site, PVS), and Libertarian nominee Powell Gammill (campaign site, PVS).
District 2 has been represented by Republican Trent Franks since 2003. He was challenged by US Army veteran and contractor Charles Black, a political upstart, in the Republican primary. Franks won an easy victory with over 80% of the vote in his favor.
Retired teacher John Thrasher ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Thrasher has twice attempted to unseat Franks, losing to the incumbent by 19% in 2006 and by 22% in 2008. Retired biologist Powell Gammill ran unopposed for the Libertarian nomination. Gammill had run unsuccessfully for the seat in 2008, taking in just over 2% of the vote.
Trent Franks won re-election on November 2, 2010.
District 3.
This is an open seat, as Republican incumbent John Shadegg is retiring. Candidates are Republican nominee Ben Quayle, Democratic nominee Jon Hulburd, Libertarian nominee Michael Shoen (campaign site, PVS), and Green Party nominee Leonard Clark (campaign site, PVS).
On January 14, 2010 8-term incumbent Shadegg announced his retirement at the end of his current term, making the third district an open seat.
In the wake of Shadegg's retirement, several Republicans declared their candidacy, including state legislators Pamela Gorman, Jim Waring and Sam Crump, Paradise Valley mayor Vernon Parker and former mayor Ed Winkler, and attorneys Paulina Morris and Ben Quayle. Quayle, the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle, emerged victorious with 22.8% of the vote, while businessman and political neophyte Steve Moak came in second with 18%.
Attorney and small businessman Jon Hulburd filed his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on October 16, 2009. The Hulburd campaign got off to a strong start and raised over $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009. This attracted national attention with the DCCC naming the race as one of its top 17 races to watch nationwide. Hulburd was not opposed in the primary.
Attorney Michael Shoen ran unopposed for the Libertarian nomination. Shoen had run for the seat in 2008, earning just under 4% of the vote. Iraq War veteran Leonard Clark won the Green Party nomination.
Ben Quayle won the general election on November 2, 2010.
District 4.
Democratic incumbent Ed Pastor is running for reelection, challenged by Republican nominee businesswoman Janet Contreras (campaign site, PVS), Libertarian Party nominee accountant Rebecca DeWitt (campaign site, PVS), and Green Party nominee retired economist Joe Cobb (campaign site, PVS).
District 4 has been represented by Pastor since 1991. Since taking office, he has been re-elected nine times with no less than 62% of the vote. He ran unopposed in his primary. Contreras defeated immigration attorney Joe Peñalosa for the Republican nomination by a margin of 59-40%. DeWitt and Cobb ran unopposed in their respective primaries. Both had run unsuccessfully for the seat in 2008, with DeWitt taking 3.5% of the vote, while Cobb had earned 3%.
Ed Pastor won re-election on November 2, 2010.
District 5.
Democratic incumbent Harry Mitchell ran for reelection, challenged by Republican nominee David Schweikert and Libertarian nominee Nick Coons (campaign site, PVS).
Mitchell and Coons ran unopposed in their respective primaries. In the Republican primary, former Maricopa County treasurer David Schweikert defeated businessman and political newcomer Jim Ward, and former Scottsdale city council member Susan Bitter Smith, who he had defeated in the 2008 primary election, as well as 3 other candidates. Schweikert's victory sets up a rematch against Mitchell, who defeated him 53-44% in the 2008 general election. Ryan Blackman was the Green Party nominee, but he withdrew. District 5 has been represented by Mitchell since 2007. Prior to Mitchell's victory over incumbent conservative Republican J.D. Hayworth, the district had been held by Republicans since 1985. David Schweikert defeated Democratic incumbent Harry Mitchell on November 2, 2010, returning the seat to the Republicans.
District 6.
Republican incumbent Jeff Flake was challenged by Democratic nominee librarian Rebecca Schneider (campaign site, PVS), Libertarian nominee Darell Tapp (PVS), and Green Party nominee Richard Grayson (campaign site).
In the Republican primary, Flake defeated Jeff Smith, an investor, by 65-35%. In the Democratic primary, librarian Rebecca Schneider ran unopposed.

District 7.
Democratic incumbent Raúl Grijalva was challenged by Republican nominee physicist Ruth McClung (campaign site, PVS), Libertarian banker George Keane (campaign site, PVS), and Independent high school teacher Harley Meyer (campaign site, PVS).
In the Democratic primary, Grijalva ran unopposed. In the Republican primary, McClung won with just over 50% of the vote in a field of 5 candidates. In the Libertarian primary, Keane won against Andrew Ibarra 54% to 39%.
District 7 has been represented by Grijalva since it was created in 2003. Grijalva won re-election on November 2, 2010.
District 8.
Democratic incumbent Gabrielle Giffords won her race for reelection, after a challenge from Republican nominee Marine veteran and businessman Jesse Kelly and Libertarian nominee engineer Steven Stoltz (campaign site, PVS).
In the Republican primary, Kelly defeated former State Senator Jonathan Paton 49-41%, with 2 other candidates picking up the remainder of the vote. Giffords and Stoltz ran unopposed in their respective primaries. District 8 has been represented by Giffords since 2007. Prior to her win, the seat had been held by Republicans since the creation of the district in 2003. Giffords' re-election allows the seat to be retained by the Democrats.

Bill Utterback

Bill Utterback (1931-2010) was an American illustrator most widely known for his contributions to "Playboy" and The Second City's theatre in Chicago.
Utterback was born on January 5, 1931 in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Utterback attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in the 1940s, and then The Art Center in Pasadena where he was influenced by teacher Joseph Henninger.
At the invitation of a friend, Utterback joined the design department of "Playboy" in the mid-sixties. Utterback was asked to illustrate some caricatures for publication after an art director saw a birthday card Utterback had created for a fellow employee. This led to Bill's regular feature in “That Was the Year That Was” each April issue. After leaving "Playboy", Utterback worked as a freelance illustrator from his home studio in Lisle, Illinois, servicing clients including The Second City until his death in 2010, and painted official portraits of Illinois Senator Pate Phillips which hung in the Illinois State Capitol building.
In later life, Utterback taught workshops at the DuPage Art League in Wheaton, Illinois, and sculpted a portrait likeness of Pate Phillips which was cast in bronze and unveiled in the DuPage County. Utterback died on February 8, 2010 as a result of pancreatic cancer, at 79 years of age.

National Mine Map Repository

The National Mine Map Repository (NMMR)is part of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM). The NMMR resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, and collects and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of coal mines in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania. The Green Tree facility provides and stores, digitally and in microfilm (aperture cards), over 150,000 maps of abandoned mines. This repository contains maps from the 1850s to the present day. It serves as a point of reference for mine maps and other information for both surface and underground mines throughout the United States. It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency. The NMMR provides services ranging from retrieving mine related data for economic analysis to assessing the potential risk associated with underground mining. Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction, and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests.
History of the NMMR.
The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 established a national mine map repository. The repository was funded by and assigned to the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines (BOM) in 1970. A repository was set up at a BOM office in Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and covered all states east of the Mississippi River with the exception of Louisiana and Minnesota. These two states, together with Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Missouri, and Kansas, were covered by a separate repository at the BOM Intermountain Field Operation Center in Denver, Colorado. A fourth repository, in Spokane, Washington, held the mining archives for the western states of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho.
In 1982 the responsibility of maintaining the repository and its staff was formally transferred to DOI's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Later, when BOM was dissolved in 1996, all of the maps from the BOM offices were consolidated into the current OSM Pittsburgh repository. The Wilkes-Barre repository was closed in 2011, and its collection transferred to the Pittsburgh office, which is designated as the National Mine Map Repository.
The mission of the repository has always been to obtain authoritative maps on past and current mining operations and preserve them on microfilm. Higher priority is given to maps of mines in areas where the potential for adverse impact to the environment is more significant. The NMMR, in addition to being an archival entity concerned with the preservation of mine maps, is also a basic reference file of information on mines. The information is made available to federal and state geological surveys, state mining bureaus, mining companies, oil and gas companies, conservationists, research and planning organizations, water pollution boards, city and industrial planners, highway engineers, building contractors, real estate developers and private citizens.
Today the NMMR facility is equipped with modern map scanning and archiving capability to digitize maps. The primary archival method remains microfilm although the repository's holdings are increasingly available in digital format.
Information available.
The NMMR contains digital and microfilm maps of surface and underground coal, metal, and non-metal mines throughout the United States. Some of the information that can be obtained from the repository includes:
Map acquisition and archiving.
The NMMR acquires maps through public outreach directed at state and federal environmental agencies as well as mining companies, engineering and consulting firms, surveying companies, universities, and private citizens. The repository is constantly seeking donations of mine maps to add to the microfilm/digital collection. 
When maps are received from a donor, they are scanned and stored in both microfilm and digital archives. The maps, along with a scanned images (upon request), are returned to the donor. The repository does not retain hard copies of maps.
NMMR Procedures.
As maps are obtained at the repository, they are assigned a unique six-digit identification number (document number). Data sheets are prepared for each map giving all available information including: map document number; state; county; mine name; mine ID number (MSHA); company name; mine type; and both the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid zone and the latitude and longitude of the geo-located point on the map. This information is input into the Mine Map Index System. The sorted maps are then scanned into a digital format and stored on the repository's dedicated 500 terabyte mass storage array.
The NMMR utilizes different types of scanning equipment to facilitate archiving mine maps made available in a variety of media. 
Small, portable aperture card scanners are shipped to state agencies as part of an extensive initiative to map underground mines.

Biography.
Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee was sired by Ch. Three D Genghis Khan, and his dam was Ch. Clussexx Sprinkled With Dew; his breeders were Douglas Horn, Douglas Johnson and Dee Duffy. He was nicknamed "Stump" because he is brown, has stubby legs and resembles a tree stump.
Stump is owned by Cecilia Ruggles and Beth Dowd and handled by Scott Sommer, with whom he lives in Houston along with J.R., a Bichon Frise who won the Westminster Dog Show in 2001 and is also trained by Sommer.
Stump won the Sporting Group at Westminster in 2004, a year that saw him accumulate 50 "best in show" wins. After those victories, he was retired from competition. In January 2006 Stump was hospitalized with a serious illness, with what in retrospect turned out to be a hard-to-diagnose case of multiple bacterial infections. After a visit to Brittmoore Animal Hospital in Houston, Stump was referred to clinicians at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, and arrived there with "a body-wide infection, infection on his heart valves, fluid in his lungs, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a blood coagulation disorder); he spent 13 days there, 12 of which were in intensive care.
Stump's 2009 Westminster victory was against 2500 dogs from 170 different breeds;it was his 51st career "best in show" win. Sommer said he expected Stump to return home and do little traveling following his victory, although his owner expected some travel representing the club and participating in publicity for Angel on a Leash, a New York-based program which sends therapy dogs into hospitals. According to "The Wall Street Journal", as of May 2009 Stump has accumulated over 440,000 miles from Continental Airlines frequent flyer program.
Stump has sired three pups named Root, Forest and Myrtle. Doug Johnson, Stump's co-breeder, also bred Brady, the Clumber Spaniel who won Westminster's Best in Show award in 1996. He died on September 25, 2012.
Westminster.
Stump won the Sporting Group at Westminster in 2004. Stump's appearance at the 2009 Westminster Dog Show was a last-minute decision; Sommer waited until February 4, 2009, before deciding to show Stump there, less than one week before the show began. Sommer did little more to prepare him than walking him around his Houston driveway. Westminster Judge Sarl Brewster Tietjen said of the dog's long absence from the showing scene, "To bring a dog into the Garden who hasn't been showing, (Sommer) was a little insane."
Stump was characterized in the media as a crowd favorite at the 2009 Westminister show. Stump was named "Best in Show" in part because judges felt he had a "cheerful and tractable disposition" in keeping with the breed's standard. Among the front-runners Stump defeated were Tiger Woods the Scottish deerhound, Spirit the Giant Schnauzer and Lincoln the Brussels griffon. Judge Tietjen, who did not make her decision to crown Stump the victor until the last moment, said: “I didn’t know who he was or how old he was. He’s just everything that you’d want in the breed, and I couldn’t say no to him.” Stump became the oldest dog to win the title, a distinction previously held by Kirby, an eight-year-old Papillon and the 1999 winner.
In popular culture.
Stump was the favorite of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the celebrity sex therapist, who witnessed his "Best in Show" victory. During the February 11, 2009 episode of "The Colbert Report", Stephen Colbert, whose character often complains when passed over for awards, expressed anger Stump won the Westminster dog show instead of him; Colbert said of the Sussex Spaniel, "What does he have that I don't have? Look, my ear is floppy. Look how firm my haunches are! Look how silky my coat is! The secret? I crack a raw egg in my bowl."

1926 Frankford Yellow Jackets season

The 1926 Frankford Yellow Jackets season was their third in the National Football League. The team improved on their previous output of 10–4, winning fourteen games. By virtue of their league-best record of 14–1–2, they were crowned the 1926 NFL Champions.
Incidentally, the champions of the rival American Football League that year were also based in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Quakers. There had been some brief discussion of fulfilling the crosstown rivalry by staging an interleague championship between the Quakers and Yellow Jackets, but the Yellow Jackets declined. (The Quakers instead played the seventh-place New York Giants, losing 31–0.)

Clothes-Line

Clothes-Line was an early BBC television programme broadcast live in six parts between 30 September and 3 December 1937. It is notable for being the first television programme dedicated to the history of fashion. It was produced by Mary Adams, and co-presented by the fashion historian James Laver and Pearl "Polly" Binder.
Broadcast times.
Episode 4 was broadcast on the Tuesday that week rather than the Thursday due to Remembrance Day falling that Thursday.
Concept.
"Clothes-Line" illustrated the development of fashion history through live models in original costumes from C. Willett Cunnington's collection. Laver provided verse commentary on the garments, while Binder drew lightning sketches and illustrations at an easel.
Pregnancy on the show.
In addition to being the first television programme to deal with fashion history, "Clothes-Line" may well have been the first television programme to feature a heavily pregnant woman. Binder had been pregnant with her first child when discussions for the programme first began, and a conscious decision was made to have her as a presenter. As Binder got closer to her due date, and had to stand further back from her easel, the noticeability of her condition caused consternation amongst the BBC. Binder's daughter Josephine was not born until 6 January 1938, almost a month after the last episode aired on 9 December 1937.
Controversy.
The show's last episode, "Grandmamma Looks Back", aired 9 December 1937 caused an unexpected national scandal. Micheline Patton, the actress playing the granddaughter to Nesta Sawyer's grandmother, appeared in a fashionable backless evening dress which was filmed from the back, giving the illusion of nudity. Binder recollected in her diary that viewers were outraged by this, and wrote in to complain.
Repeats ("Clothes Through The Centuries").
The first series was, as with so many early BBC programmes, broadcast live. The controversy of the final episode notwithstanding, it was so well received that it was decided to repeat the programme in early 1938. Laver, Binder, Adams, Patton and Sawyer all returned to reprise their roles for the second (revised) version, which consisted of three parts, and was renamed "Clothes Through The Centuries". The episode titles were:

Botafogo (galleon)

The São João Baptista (, commonly known as the Botafogo, was a Portuguese galleon warship built in the 16th century, around 1534, considered the biggest and most powerful warship in the world at the time.
This ship could carry 366 bronze cannons, and had an artillery power of 1,000 tons. For this reason, it became known as "Botafogo", meaning literally "fire maker" or "spitfire" in popular Portuguese.
History.
The "Botafogo" was used both in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, where it became famous during the Conquest of Tunis (1535). In that battle, the "Botafogo" was commanded by Infante Luís, Duke of Beja, brother of John III and brother-in-law of Charles V.
According to historians, it was the "Botafogo" spur ram that broke up the chains at La Goletta, which defended the port entrance of Tunis, allowing the Christian allied fleet to reach and conquer the city.
One member of the crew named João de Sousa Pereira, a noble from the city of Elvas, became famous because he was responsible for the ship's artillery, and he also got the nickname of "Botafogo", which he later included in his family name. Later, he went to live in the Portuguese colony of Brazil, fighting against the French and the local Tupi Indians. As a reward, the Portuguese Crown granted him some lands known today as the Botafogo area.

Kramers' law

Kramers' law is a formula for the spectral distribution of X-rays produced by an electron hitting a solid target. The formula concerns only bremsstrahlung radiation, not the element specific characteristic radiation. It is named after its discoverer, the Dutch physicist Hendrik Anthony Kramers.
The formula for Kramers' law is usually given as the distribution of intensity (photon count) formula_1 against the wavelength formula_2 of the emitted radiation:
The constant "K" is proportional to the atomic number of the target element, and formula_4 is the minimum wavelength given by the Duane–Hunt law.
The intensity described above is a particle flux and not an energy flux as can be seen by the fact that the
integral over values from formula_4 to formula_6 is infinite. However, the
integral of the energy flux is finite.
To obtain a simple expression for the energy flux, first change variables from formula_2 (the wavelength) to
formula_8 (the angular frequency) using formula_9 and also using
formula_10. Now formula_11 is that quantity which is integrated over formula_8 from 0 to formula_13 to get the total number (still infinite) of photons, where formula_14:
The energy flux, which we will call formula_16 (but which is may also referred to as the "intensity" in conflict with the above name of formula_17) is obtained by multiplying the above formula_18 by the energy formula_19:
for formula_21
for formula_23.
It is a linear function that is zero at the maximum energy formula_24.

"Mario & Sonic" on the Wii and DS is a collection of events based on the Olympic Winter Games. Players can assume the role of a Mario or Sonic character while competing against the others in these events. The game features all of the playable characters that were present in its predecessor, as well as four new characters.
A third installment, named "Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games", was released for the Wii on November 13, 2011 in Europe, and it was developed for the Nintendo 3DS. The 3DS counterpart was released in February 2012.
Gameplay.
"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games" retains the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor, controlling an on-screen character through authentic Olympic events with the specific tailored controls for the Wii and DS. Unlike its predecessor, some of the events in the Wii game can use the Balance Board accessory, but it is not a requirement.
All of the playable characters from the previous game return in addition to four new characters. It has been announced via the Nintendo Channel, that this game will have WiiConnect24 capability and the player can use their Miis in-game. A new feature added to the player's Mii is the ability to customize the Mii's clothes.
The sequel introduces a Festival mode in the Wii version that allows the player to make their way through the entire Olympic Games, from opening ceremony to closure. The multiplayer mode offers "co-op and competitive gameplay" whereas the DS version will use its wireless capabilities. The DS counterpart has "Adventure Tours" where players can accept quests and challenge bosses and to stop Dr. Eggman and Bowser before they can stop the Olympics by kidnapping the Snow Spirits. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game.
Development.
In January 2009, a rumor from Spanish Nintendo magazine "Nintendo Acción" mentioned a sequel to "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" would be created for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Both IGN and Eurogamer received confirmation on the games' existence, with IGN stating the game will be announced within the following month. Dennis Kim, licensing and merchandising director for the event, stated in February that a "Mario & Sonic" title " being discussed and planned for Vancouver". Kim also stated "Vancouver 2010" and the IOC will share royalties from this game.

So, The game is being developed by Sega Japan under the supervision of Shigeru Miyamoto. This title is the third video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. According to gaming site IGN, development began immediately after the initial Olympic game was released in November 2007.
An iPhone OS app version was released in January 2010 by Sega. Due to only containing Sonic characters, the game is simply titled "Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games".
Reception.
The Wii version of "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games" received a generally positive reaction from critics. The DS version had a higher score than the Wii version. GameRankings lists the average scores as 70.86% for the Wii version and 77.95% for the DS. IGN said of the Wii version that "Most of the events also use a whole lot of waggle or over-exaggerated remote tilt where controls could have made for a better experience", giving the Wii game a 6.5. X-Play's Adam Sessler asserted that the Wii version of the game is too simple and the events uninteresteing, and claimed that the controls are too easy, despite praising the Dream Events. Accordingly, he gave it a 3 out of 5. GameSpot agreed, criticizing the uninteresting mission objectives in the DS version. "Nintendo Power" was very disappointed that players can still use Wi-Fi only for worldwide rankings. No online play is available. GameTrailers also gave the Wii game a 5.2, criticizing the hit and miss motion controls. GamePro agreed, stating that "Where the original had a sense of novelty and charm, the sequel feels a little dated and tired."
"GamesMaster" praised the game, saying that it "justifies the hype." "EuroGamer" also praised the game, stating that "It's true to say that Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games is no Mario Kart. But it's a fun, polished party game with broad appeal, and a marked improvement over the previous one." Gamervision praised the game also, stating that "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games isn’t going to surprise anyone with its gameplay, graphics, controls, or concept, but it’s a perfectly serviceable party game for the Wii." Nintendo Life praised the events of the game, giving it a 9/10. IGN called the DS version "impressive", giving it a 7.5.
By December 31, 2009, the game had sold approximately 5.67 million copies, making it Sega's best-selling game in the fiscal year starting that March.

Isla de Lobos

The Isla de Lobos is a small island located about southeast of Punta del Este (Uruguay). An islet lies east of the island.
Geography.
The island is an outcropping of rocks that is a continuation of the Cuchilla Grande, in an area of Atlantic Ocean immediately at the mouth (outer limit) of the estuary of Río de la Plata. Administratively it belongs to the jurisdiction of the province of Maldonado, although it constitutes a natural reserve. Somewhat to the northwest is the smaller Gorriti Island which is the second most southern place in Uruguay.
History.
It was discovered by Spanish navigator Juan Díaz de Solís in 1516 and named "San Sebastian de Cádiz", later in 1527 was visited by the Venetian navigator Sebastián Cabot in his expedition to Río de la Plata and Paraná. In 1528 Diego Garcia Moguer sailed for the region and named the "Island of the Snapper." In 1599 the island was visited by Laurens Bicker.
In 1858 the Uruguayan government erected a lighthouse on the island, and rebuilt in 1907. With its height of 59 meters above sea level it is one of the highest lighthouses in the world. From the balcony outside, which is accessed upon authorization by 240 steps there is a wonderful panoramic view of the island and the coast of Punta del Este.
Animals.
Isla de Lobos is a nature reserve because it has the largest colony of sea lions in the western hemisphere: in 2001 there were 180,000 sea lions of the species called "two hairs" and 6,500 of the species known as the "wig". 
It is part of the "Coastal Islands National Park" administered by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries.

Banana Moon

Banana Moon is a 1971 studio album by Daevid Allen. The album is sometimes referred to as "Bananamoon" and it was also reissued as a Gong album.
The band features Allen's former Soft Machine bandmate Robert Wyatt on drums, Gary Wright from Spooky Tooth, Maggie Bell from Stone the Crows, as well as Christian Tritsch and Pip Pyle from Gong. Some of the musicians on this album would subsequently contribute to Kevin Ayers' 1973 album "Bananamour".
The track "Memories", basically a Robert Wyatt performance, was initially recorded in 1967 by Soft Machine (with Daevid Allen on guitar) and later also covered by Material on their 1982 album "One Down" with a lead vocal by Whitney Houston. "Stoned Innocent Frankenstein" was re-recorded in 1978 by Allen in collaboration with Here and Now as Planet Gong on their "Floating Anarchy Live 1977" album.
The initial issue featured the painting (of moons or planets) by Didier Léon on the front of the gatefold cover, with liner notes written by Daevid Allen Subsequent issues included even one by BYG Actuel that was credited to Gong and had the photo from the gatefold inside on the front. The first UK pressing, in 1975 on Virgin Records subsidiary Caroline, had an alternative Daevid Allen drawn cover, featuring a peeled banana/moon playing a guitar.
GAS website reported an alternate mix of the CD would be available, entitled Stoned Innocent Frankenstein, containing: "Unreleased mixes and versions. A 'Camembert Eclectique' job for Bananamoon. Stunning unreleased mixes and totally radical head-altering versions unheard for over 30 years. Robert Wyatt's drumming more obvious on a couple of the tracks is amazing. It does make you wonder whether the correct 'final' mix was sent to the pressing plant - no they wouldn't have got that wrong, would they?. With a annotated and illustrated booklet."

Clouston's hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (also known as "Alopecia congenita with keratosis palmoplantaris," "Clouston syndrome," "Fischer–Jacobsen–Clouston syndrome," "Hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia," "Keratosis palmaris with drumstick fingers," and "Palmoplantar keratoderma and clubbing") is caused by mutations in a connexin gene, GJB6 or connexin-30, characterized by scalp hair that is wiry, brittle, and pale, often associated with patchy alopecia.
Disease characteristics.
Hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2, or Clouston syndrome (referred to as HED2 throughout this entry) is characterized by partial or total alopecia, dystrophy of the nails, hyperpigmentation of the skin (especially over the joints), and clubbing of the fingers. Sparse scalp hair and dysplastic nails are seen early in life. In infancy, scalp hair is wiry, brittle, patchy, and pale; progressive hair loss may lead to total alopecia by puberty. The nails may be milky white in early childhood; they gradually become dystrophic, thick, and distally separated from the nail bed. Palmoplantar keratoderma may develop during childhood and increases in severity with age. The clinical manifestations are highly variable even within the same family.
Diagnosis.
HED2 is suspected after infancy on the basis of physical features in most affected individuals. GJB6 is the only gene known to be associated with HED2. Targeted mutation analysis for the four most common GJB6 mutations is available on a clinical basis and detects mutations in approximately 100% of affected individuals. Sequence analysis is also available on a clinical basis for those in whom none of the four known mutations is identified.
Treatment.
Treatment of manifestations: special hair care products to help manage dry and sparse hair; wigs; artificial nails; emollients to relieve palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.
Genetic counseling.
HED2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with HED2 have an affected parent; de novo gene mutations have also been reported. Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and being affected. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in an affected family member is known; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as HED2 are not common.

Philip Sheedy Affair

The Philip Sheedy affair was an Irish political and judicial controversy which resulted in the resignation of both a Supreme Court and High Court judge.
Background.
Philip Sheedy, an architect, was involved in a road traffic accident in March 1996 at the Glenview Roundabout, Tallaght Bypass, County Dublin which resulted in the death of Anne Ryan. It transpired that Sheedy, who was driving a high performance sports car that he had purchased the previous day, was intoxicated. Sheedy plead guilty to causing death by dangerous driving before His Honour Judge Cyril Kelly (as he was then) in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in October 1997 and also admitted to driving with excess alcohol. On the day of sentencing Judge Joseph Mathews was asked by Judge Kelly to step-in and sentence Sheedy. Judge Matthews imposed a four-year sentence on Sheedy with leave to apply for a review of the sentence after two years (20 October 1999), as well as banning him from driving for twelve years. On 6 November 1997 Judge Mathews granted an application on Sheedy's behalf to vacate the order which set 20 October 1999 as the review date of Sheedy's sentence.
Sheedy, after initially being incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison, was moved to Shelton Abbey, an open prison, after six months' imprisonment. There he was visited by his friend Joe Burke, a former Fianna Fáil councillor and a member of the so-called "Drumcondra Mafia", who had loaned the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern 3,500 Irish pounds as part of the "dig outs" Ahern received around the time of his marriage break-up. Burke, who worked as a building contractor, had employed Sheedy as an architectural advisor to his company J&H Burke and Son.
In July 1998 the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern contacted then minister for justice John O'Donoghue to ask him whether it would be possible for Philip Sheedy to get day release. Initially, Ahern had vehemently denied that he concealed his representations to the Department of Justice on behalf of Philip Sheedy.
Sentence review and release.
Supreme Court judge Hugh O'Flaherty intervened on Sheedy's behalf after an "entirely by chance" encounter between the judge, who was walking his dog, and the son of a neighbour Ken Anderson and Anderson's girlfriend, who was Philip Sheedy's sister, in October 1998. After the encounter, Dublin County Registrar Michael Quinlan was called to Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's chambers to have Sheedy's case re-listed.
On 12 November 1998, after O'Flaherty's intervention, Sheedy's sentence was reviewed before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, and not Judge Matthews, as would be the correct procedure. After the brief hearing Mr. Justice Kelly remitted what was left of Sheedy's sentence. Neither the gardaí nor the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) were told of the review or the fact that Sheedy was released. The only representation by the state was the appearance of a clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's office who saw a listing for the matter and brought the file to court but did not know for what purpose.
Fallout.
High Court challenge.
The DPP brought a High Court challenge to Mr. Justice Kelly's decision to release Sheedy in February 1999. Prior to the case being heard Sheedy had voluntarily returned to prison.
Hamilton Report.
On the basis of the DPP's High Court challenge John O'Donoghue, then Minister for Justice asked Chief Justice Liam Hamilton to investigate the affair. The Chief Justice's report was published 16 April 1999. In it, Chief Justice Hamilton stated that Mr. Justice Kelly's handling of the matter and Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's intervention compromised the administration of justice.
Resignations.
The first person to resign was Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty. In his report, Chief Justice Hamilton was critical of O'Flaherty whose actions he deemed to be "open to misinterpretation." Initially, O'Flaherty refused to resign, and instead wrote to the Chairman of the Oireachtas's Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs Committee asking to make a statement to the committee as soon as possible, however, the next day he resigned from the Supreme Court.
On 20 April, Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan, the Dublin County Registrar, resigned their positions.
O'Flaherty appointment to EIB.
After his resignation Hugh O'Flaherty was nominated by Charlie McCreevy, then Minister for Finance, to be Ireland's representative to the European Investment Bank (EIB), taking the position of vice-president. This appointment resulted in a massive public outcry. The appointment was eventually withdrawn by the government.

<doc id="21508827" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21508827" title="Ropalidia marginata">
Ropalidia marginata

Ropalidia marginata is an Old World species of paper wasp found in Pakistan, peninsular India, Sri Lanka, South-east Asia and Australia. It was originally described by Fabricius in 1793 under the name "Vespa" "ferruginea", but that name was preoccupied, so the oldest available name for the species is that given to it later by Lepeletier in 1836. One of its subspecies, "R. marginata jucunda "from New Guinea and Australia, was described in 1898, and two others, "R. marginata rufitarsis" from Myanmar and "R. marginata sundaica" from Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula, were described in 1941.
Biology.
The nominate subspecies ("R. m. marginata") has been studied extensively in India, though little is known of its biology elsewhere within its range, or the biology of any of the other subspecies. In India, it has an aseasonal, indeterminate and perennial colony cycle, which means that nest initiation occurs round the year, and nests are active throughout the year. 
These wasps make gymnodomous nests (open, not covered by an envelope) with one or more petioles, which they coat with ant-repellant chemicals. The nests are usually found in closed spaces with small openings, inside bushes and within various man-made structures like electric poles, broken pillars, crevices of buildings, electric cable boxes, switch boards, tube light holders, the bottom of park benches, and even from within dustbins and letter boxes. Nests that can be accessed only through very small openings are well protected from the hornets "Vespa tropica", which are the prime predators of these wasps. Nest sizes range from 0 to 722 cells (mean ± s.d.: 133.7 ± 119.2), with 1 to 200 females (mean ± s.d.: 21.9 ± 22.3) and 0 to 33 males (mean ± s.d.: 2.4 ± 5.4). 
Males are produced aseasonally, and are thus found throughout the year in a subset of nests in the population. There is only a single queen in any nest of "R. marginata", and she is not morphologically distinguishable from the workers. The nests are made of paper, which is produced by masticating cellulose (collected usually from plant sources) and mixing it with saliva. 
The queen lays a single egg per cell, and the larvae grow inside the cells, being fed by the workers. The largest larvae spin a cap of silk on their cells and pupate inside. "R. marginata" nests can be founded either by solitary or multiple foundresses, and nest usurpation, adoption and joining are also quite commonly observed. 
Behavior.
Colony Dynamics.
Colonies of "R. marginata" consist of a queen and many non-egg laying workers. The number of workers can range from 0, solitary foundress nest, to over 100. The average period of development from egg to adult is 62 days. However, a female only has a .12 probability of surviving the full 62 days. Therefore, if she is solitary nesting, her expected reproductive success is low. Gadagkar estimated that a female increases her expected reproductive success by 3.6-fold as a result of group nesting. 
There are three possible paths available to a female. She can leave the nest to form a new nest by herself or with others, she can remain in the natal nest as an altruistic worker for the remainder of her life, or she can work for her natal nest for a while and then drive away the queen to become the new replacement queen. 
Gadagkar devised a unified model that makes predictions about what proportion of the population of "R. marginata" “should opt for a selfish solitary nesting strategy and what proportion should opt for an altruistic worker strategy” (853). From this, he was able to predict that 5% should opt for the selfish solitary nesting strategy while 95% should opt for the altruistic worker strategy. 
Gadagkar et al. genotyped "R. marginata" mothers and daughters at a “few non-specific esterase loci” to infer the genotypes of the haploid fathers or estimate the number of fathers needed to produce the daughters observed (850). The researchers ultimately found, “"R. marginata" queens mate with 1–3 different males and the average relatedness among their daughters thus drops from the theoretically expected 0.75 to about 0.50, thus entirely negating the advantage of haplodiploidy for social evolution, as predicted by Hamilton” (851). Gadagkar “found no evidence for intra-colony kin recognition” (851).
Queen.
Primitively eusocial societies are typically headed by behaviourally aggressive queens, who use aggression to suppress worker reproduction. However, the queen in "R. marginata" is a "docile sitter" who does "not" use physical aggression to maintain her reproductive monopoly in the colony. Instead she uses a non-volatile pheromone to regulate the reproduction of the workers. She uses this pheromone to signal her presence and fecundity to her workers, who perceive this signal and refrain from reproducing.
The queen interacts very rarely with her workers, and direct or indirect physical interactions are not used by the workers to perceive their queen. The queen probably uses abdomen-rubbing behaviour to apply her pheromone on the nest material, through which the workers perceive her presence in the colony. 
When the queen is removed from the colony, the pheromone decays, and eventually the workers no longer perceive the queen signal. One of the workers then increases her aggression drastically; this individual, the "potential queen" (PQ), develops her ovaries within a few days and assumes the role of the queen.
Potential Queen.
Primitive wasp societies are known to have distinguishable succession hierarchies, i.e., the loss of the queen results in her successor becoming the next egg-layer. Typically, such hierarchies are based on dominance rank, age or in some cases, body size. 
However, in "R. marginata", the potential queen, or the individual who steps up her aggression immediately after queen removal and eventually becomes the queen, seems to be an unspecialized individual in the presence of the queen. She is not unique in her dominance rank, behavioural repertoire, age, body size or ovarian condition. However, within minutes of queen removal, the potential queen becomes obvious to an observer due to her heightened aggression. Interestingly, the potential queen maintains this high aggression for only a few days, and gradually reduces the levels of aggression over a week or so, while she develops her ovaries. 
Contrary to popular belief among scientists, the potential queen seems to require this heightened aggression, not to suppress the ovarian development in her nestmates, but to boost her own development. 
Typically, this heightened aggression is one-way, and shown by a single individual. She hardly even receives any aggression from the others in the colony. It has now been established that though the identity of the potential queen is cryptic to the observer in the presence of the queen, the wasps "know" who their successor is, and hence she does not face any challenge from her nestmates.
Workers.
The workers aid the queen in foraging, nest-building, and brood care. Gadagkar calculated that the genetic relatedness between the worker and the brood ranged from .0165 to .75. 
When the queen is lost or removed, one of the non-egg laying workers becomes extremely aggressive, then gradually becomes docile, develops ovaries, and begins egg laying. Gadagkar et al. observed that workers will continue working for the replacement queen. Bang and Gadagkar demonstrated that there is not just one designated worker to take over reproduction, but a long queue of potential queens that are not only daughters, but also sisters, nieces, and cousins. They found that age is a substantial predictor, though not a perfect one.
Males.
Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. However, they do consume the food and liquid brought to the nest by females. The behaviors they do perform include, “soliciting food, antennating nest, antennating another wasp, feeding self, snatching things, fanning wings, body jerks, wing jerks and dominance–subordinate behaviors” (963-4). Due to this behavior, females show physical aggression towards males in the nest.

<doc id="21508864" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21508864" title="House of Tęczyński">
House of Tęczyński

Tęczyński family was a powerful family of nobility (szlachta) in the Kingdom of Poland, during the times of the late Piast dynasty, the Jagiellon dynasty and in the early decades of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (from 14th century to early 17th century). They were an important family from Lesser Poland ("Małopolska"), active in Polish politics of their time.
Family's history and importance.
According to a legend, the family traced its origins to the 12th century magnate, Sieciech, or even to some older individuals, rumored to be powerful "princes" before Mieszko I created the Polish state. According to historians, the first verifiable member of the Tęczyński family was Nawój z Morawicy (d. 1331), castellan of Kraków, who laid the foundations of his family greatness. They used the Topór coat of arms. His son Andrzej Tęczyński (d. 1369), voivode of Kraków, begun the construction of the family's castle, continued by his descendants. Jan Tęczyński (d. 1405), starost and castellan of Kraków, was also one of the most important advisers to the first King of Poland of the Jagiellon dynasty, Władysław Jagiełło. Jan Tęczyński (d. 1470), castellan of Kraków, voivode of Kraków and Lublin, was recognized as one of the two most important Polish magnates of his time (the other one was cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki. Andrzej Tęczyński (d. 1536), castellan of Kraków, voivode of Kraków, Lublin and Sandomierz, in 1527 received a hereditary title of a count from the Holy Roman Emperor.
The family had numerous possessions, most of them in the Lesser Poland, Kraków Voivodeship (including a large latifundia near Kraków). Its members often held the posts of castellan of Kraków and voivode of Kraków. The family, recognized during the 14th to mid-17th centuries as one of the most important in Lesser Poland, lost influence after the death of its last male member, Jan Magnus Tęczyński in 1637.
The family seat was the Tenczyn Castle (also known as Tęczyn Castle), now a ruin in the village of Rudno. The castle would fall in ruin after being pillaged by the Swedes, looking for rumored treasures of the Tęczyński family, during The Deluge in the mid-17th century. Subsequently rebuilt, after a fire in mid-18th century it was never rebuilt again. 
Polish poet Józef Ignacy Kraszewski dedicated one of his works to the family: "Tęczyńscy: dramat historyczny w pięciu aktach prozą" a historical drama in five acts in prose (1844). Another Polish poet, Jan Kochanowski, wrote a poem "Pamiątka Tęczyńskiemu" memory for Tęczyński.

Cœur de pirate

Béatrice Martin (born September 22, 1989), better known by her stage name Cœur de pirate (French: "Pirate Heart") is a Canadian singer-songwriter. A francophone from Montreal, she sings mostly in French and has been credited with "bringing "la chanson française" to a whole new generation of Quebec youth".
Career.
Born in the province of Quebec, Béatrice Martin started playing the piano when she was only three years old. She entered the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal at the age of nine and studied there for five years.
At the age of 15, she played as a keyboardist in the post-hardcore band December Strikes First which starred her best friend, Francis, who would later become the subject of the song "Francis" on her debut album. Martin had a brief stint as keyboardist for Bonjour Brumaire from late 2007 to April 2008.
2007–2009: Debut album and first success.
In a report broadcast on French television, Martin explained that she chose the name "Cœur de pirate" to appear not "as an isolated musician, but to get a band identity from the start." She released her debut album "Cœur de pirate" on September 16, 2008 on Grosse Boîte. Described as "rather simple" musically, it mostly featured Martin's voice and piano playing with some minor additional instrumentation.
In February 2009, Martin attracted wider media attention when a photographer from Quebec City, Francis Vachon, used the song "Ensemble" as the soundtrack to a viral video on YouTube entitled "Time lapse of a baby playing with his toys", leading to coverage on "Good Morning America", Perez Hilton's website, "The Globe and Mail" and elsewhere.
2009–2011: Side projects Pearls and Armistice.
In March 2009, Martin released a song in English, "One for Me", under the name Pearls on MySpace. In a later interview she described the project as a joke and said she did not plan to continue it, though she did not rule out the possibility of releasing music in English at a later date.
In June 2009, she made a special appearance of CBC Radio's "Q" radio show with Jian Ghomeshi. She performed her single "Ensemble" and a new song, titled "Place de la république".
Martin performed with Jay Malinowski of Bedouin Soundclash in May 2010 on "Q", and talked about collaborating with him in the future. She was later featured in a Bedouin Soundclash song, "Brutal Hearts", on the album "Light the Horizon". Martin, Malinowski, and several members of the American rock band The Bronx subsequently collaborated on a five-song EP under the band name Armistice, which was released on February 15, 2011.
Martin contributed a new song, "La Reine", to the 2010 edition of CBC Radio 2's "Great Canadian Song Quest".
2011 to present: "Blonde", "Trauma" and "Child of Light".
On March 27, 2011, Martin revealed via her Facebook page that she was to return to the studio to commence work on her second album the following day. Her second album, "Blonde", was released on November 7, 2011 in both digital and hard copy versions. "Adieu" and "Golden Baby" were released as singles from this LP.
After announcing her pregnancy in February 2012, Martin stopped touring during the second half of the year and gave birth to a daughter in September. In early 2013, Martin returned from her hiatus with a music video for "Place de la république", the first for which she acted as director, and an international tour beginning in March.
In 2013, she recorded music for the fifth season of the Canadian drama series "Trauma", with a soundtrack album released on January 14, 2014.
In 2014, she composed the soundtrack for the Ubisoft Montreal's video game production Child of Light. This album included a song sung in English.
Awards.
Cœur de pirate received a 2009 CBC Radio 3 "Bucky" award determined by listener votes. Her song "Comme des enfants" received the 2009 "Bucky" award for "Best Reason to Learn French".
Juno Awards.
Martin has been nominated for two Juno Awards.
Félix Awards.
The Félix Awards are presented by the Association du disque, de l'industrie du spectacle québécois to artists from Quebec. Martin has won four awards from 13 nominations.
Victoires de la Musique.
The "Victoires de la Musique" is an annual French award ceremony. Martin has won one award from four nominations.
Canadian Independent Music Awards.
Martin has been nominated for five Canadian Independent Music Awards, of which she has won one.
Collaborations.
Martin has appeared in concert with French singer Julien Doré, performing a duet of the Rihanna hit "Umbrella". In 2009, she recorded a new version of her song "Pour un infidèle", with Doré featured as the male vocalist. They appeared together in the video for the song, styled as a 1960s-era celebrity couple.
Martin contributed vocals on "Brutal Hearts", the fourth track on the 2010 Bedouin Soundclash album "Light the Horizon". Frontman Jay Malinowski and Martin subsequently collaborated under the band name Armistice, releasing a five-track self-titled album on February 11, 2011.
She also appeared in Peter Peter's eponymous debut album "Peter Peter" in the song "Tergiverse".
Martin co-wrote the song "Jet Lag" with Simple Plan and a demo was recorded with her voice. The final version was recorded with Marie-Mai. The final version is shorter.
She appears on the track "Voila les anges," a cover of the song recorded originally in 1988 by Gamine, on the 2012 album "Couleurs sur Paris" by Nouvelle Vague.
Martin contributed vocals for "Peace Sign" by Canadian synth-pop artist Lights, on the acoustic version of her 2011 album "Siberia", released on April 30, 2013.
She sang the remix for The Weeknd's "Wicked Games" (HugLife remix).
On advertising campaigns.
In 2009 she collaborated with Coca-Cola, sponsor of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, to write the Canadian version of the song called "Open Happiness (Ouvre du bonheur)", for a Canada-wide advertising campaign.
In 2011, she recorded a version of Buddy Holly's song "Everyday" for an advertising campaign by Activia.
Personal life.
On February 29, 2012, Martin announced on Twitter and Facebook that she was expecting a girl with her fiancé, Alex Peyrat, a tattoo artist. Martin and Peyrat were married later that year on July 26 and their daughter Romy was born on September 4.

St Cosmas and St Damian Church, Keymer

St Cosmas and St Damian Church is an Anglican church in the village of Keymer, in the Mid Sussex district of West Sussex, England. Rebuilt in 1866 in a style similar to the Saxon building it replaced, it is the parish church of Keymer and now lies within a combined parish serving three villages in Mid Sussex. The church bears a very rare dedication to the twin Saints Cosmas and Damian, Christian martyrs of the 4th century. It is a grade II listed building.
History.
The medieval manor of Keymer was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as being held by William de Watevile for William de Warenne, who built the nearby Lewes Castle. A church existed on the present site at that time; it was associated with Lewes Priory, which had been given it by a successor of de Watevile in 1093.
The present building incorporates some 12th-century structural elements: the chancel walls and apse date from that time. Until the rebuilding in 1866, there had been little change to the structure since the 14th century. The reconstruction was undertaken by Brighton-based architect Edmund Scott, who was responsible for several churches in his home town; he matched the church's largely 14th-century style rather than redesigning the building significantly. Six bells were added at various times: one in 1791, another in 1866 and a peal of four in 1911.
The church has a large graveyard with several war graves and a war memorial. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission identifies five soldiers—three from the First World War and two from the Second World War—who are buried there. There is no longer enough space for burials to take place in the original churchyard, so a new burial ground has been established in a field opposite the church. Mid Sussex District Council acquired the land on behalf of the Parish of Keymer and Clayton, and transferred ownership to Hassocks Parish Council. The latter now manages the area, which is called the Hassocks Burial Ground and Garden of Remembrance.
The patron of the church, and holder of the advowson, is Brasenose College, Oxford.
Dedication.
The dedication of the church, to the twin Saints Cosmas and Damian, is extremely rare in the Church of England. Only three other extant churches in England bear their names: at Challock in Kent; Blean, two miles to the north of Canterbury, Kent; and Sherrington in Wiltshire. A redundant church with the same name exists near Leominster in Herefordshire. The saints are believed to have been twin brothers who worked as doctors in the Roman province of Syria. They were well-educated in science and medicine, and treated people without expecting any payment. They were known to have been put to death in 303 during the Diocletianic Persecution.
Architecture.
The church walls are built of flint in an irregular style reminiscent of crazy paving. There is a small tower and steeple topped with a small, two-stage spire at the southwest corner. The plan consists of a chancel with Norman-era apse, nave, aisles, and a porch at the south end. The south aisle was built in the 1866 reconstruction, but its counterpart on the north side was added in 1890. The ancient stone dressings in the east window were preserved during the rebuilding. The remains of what may be an original piscina, which lacks its basin, is in the apse.
The church today.
Although the churches at Clayton and Keymer have been connected since their founding, the parishes were not officially united until 25 July 1978 by means of an Order in Council. St Cosmas and Damian Church is now one of three churches in this parish, which includes the 11th-century, Grade I-listed St John the Baptist's Church—Clayton's parish church—and St Francis of Assisi's Church in Hassocks, built in 1975. The parish covers the three villages and the surrounding rural area; its eastern boundary follows the border between West Sussex and East Sussex. English Heritage granted the church Grade II listed status on 21 June 2007.
There are two Sunday services most weeks (the first Sunday of the month has no early-morning service). Other services take place on Wednesdays and alternate Saturdays. The church is always open during daylight hours.
The area around the church was designated a Conservation Area in January 1989. Mid Sussex District Council, which was responsible for granting this status, stated that "the church sited on higher land which can be seen from all approaches" was one of the character-giving features of the area, which covers the old central area of Keymer village.

Tunku Naquiyuddin studied at the Anderson School, Ipoh; Tuanku Besar School, Tampin; Junior King's School, Sturry, Kent; King's School, Canterbury; and read International Politics at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (later known as the University of Wales, Aberystwyth) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours in Economics from the same college.
He served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was posted as the 2nd Secretary with the Malaysian Embassy in Paris. Tunku Naquiyuddin later headed Antah Holdings Berhad as its Chairman, a position held till 2007, which was vacated for a 5 year period during his tenure as the Regent of Negeri Sembilan from 1994 to 1999.He also hold important position in Carlsberg Malaysia.

Bypassed to the Throne.
On 29 December 2008, The Council of Undang proclaimed Tunku Muhriz as the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Almarhum Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman who had died on 27 December 2008. 
This decision was made following intense discussions among the four Undangs. At least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed Tunku Muhriz's candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Jaafar's eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Naquiyuddin also had two younger brothers. Together with Tunku Muhriz, these four princes were the main heirs to the throne when Tuanku Jaafar died. However, Tuanku Jaafar had replaced his elder brother whose son, Tunku Muhriz, at the time was barely out of his teens. Tunku Muhriz was considered too young to replace his father and the throne was given to his uncle Tuanku Jaafar.
Due to a lifelong habit of keeping a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan compared to Tunku Naquiyuddin, who was very media friendly. However, Tuanku Muhriz established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state a few years ago. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the former Menteri Besar Tan Sri Isa Samad among his supporters.
Known for his charitable activities, Tunku Naquiyuddin was also a keen sportsman and a top corporate figure popular with the public, making him an ideal candidate to be the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan. However, he was ultimately bypassed when the four Undangs, or territorial chiefs, of the state chose his cousin Tuanku Muhriz to ascend to the throne.
He is a Pro-Chancellor of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia(UKM).

Wateni

Wateni (or Waténi) is a rural commune in the Cercle of Sikasso in the Sikasso Region of southern Mali. The commune covers an area of 211 square kilometers and includes ten villages. In the 2009 census it had a population of 6,701. The village of N'Tjila, the administrative center ("chef-lieu") of the commune, is 94 km west-northwest of Sikasso.
History.
The name Wateni was given to the commune by a meeting of the eleven village chiefs in memory of the founder of the historical kingdom of Ganadougou: Wateni Diallo (pronounced waat-e-nay djia-low)
The rural commune Wateni was created on November 4, 1996 by law No 96-059, for the creation of communes in Mali.
Geography.
The Rural Commune Wateni is located North-West of Niena.
The commune is bordered in the north by the commune of Benkadi and in the south and south-east by the rural commune of Niena, and in the north-east by the commune of Blendio, and in the west by the cercle of Bougouni.
The commune is composed of ten villages: N'tjilla (commune capitol), Bougoulaba, Tiala, M'pankourou, Fougani, Diegui, Miambougou, Mononomo, Sibirila, and Chokoro.
The capitol of the commune, N'tjilla, is located 7 km off Route 7 from Bamako to Zegoua. N'tjilla is 23 km from Niena, 98 km from Sikasso (the capital of the Sikasso region or cercle), and 295 km from Bamako, the national capital.
The commune covers an area of 200 square kilometers. It is situated in the Sahel WITH two main seasons: dry season (from the end of October to the end of April) and rainy season (from May through the beginning of October). The annual rain fall varies between 800 and 1500 mm.
Demography.
As of a 2009 Census, the commune has a population of 6,701 habitants. The population consists of 3352 men and 3349 women. In 1998, it had a population of 5,152, which is a rate of 2.4% growth.
The population is composed of a majority of Fulani and Bambara ethnic groups who co-habitate peacefully. They are farmers and animal breeders.
Social Situation.
The social structure is dominated by a traditional chief, or dugutigi. Beneath the village chief, each village has various cultural associations divided by gender and age group. In addition to village associations, there are youth associations, women's associations, and development associations.
Although Bambara language is the official language in the commune, the primary language is Gana, named after the kingdom of Ganadougou.
The illiteracy rate is very high. Stories, history, and legends are transmitted orally between generations. The caste responsible for keeping the oral tradition alive is called the griot.
Traditional musical instruments are often played at parties and holidays: balafon, boli, kamale n'goni and guida.
The commune contains several tourist sites: Djinemini, belekeli, kokoni, sacred forests, and the resting place of Ganadougou's founding father Wateni Diallo.
Civil Society.
CMDT (Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement du Textile) has created a Village Associations in every village in the commune. These groups are charged with growing, harvesting, and selling cotton to CMDT.
Former citizens of the Commune Wateni have an association called the "Association des Ressoritissants de Wateni" (ARW) which is located in Bamako.
Economy.
The principal economic activities in the Commune are agriculture, fishing, bee-keeping, gardening, and small business. The main crops are: dry cereals (millet, sorghum, rice, and corn) and revenue generating crops (cotton, peanuts, and beans).
Animal breeding is the second largest activity after agriculture. Animals bred in the commune include cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry. The cattle are traded as close as Niena and Koumantou and as far away as Bamako and Côte d'Ivoire.
There is a local market for crafts, including pottery, cloth, and leather work. These products are not of a quality that can be traded much outside of the commune.
Fishing in the area is often done by Bozo people from neighboring regions who come to fish in the river Bogoe and sell their products in neighboring Niena.
The commune Wateni has two weekly markets: N'tjilla has a market every Wednesday and Bougoulaa has a market every Saturday.
The roads in the commune, except for the road connecting N'tjilla to Dougoukolobougou on the main paved road, are poorly maintained trails which are insufficient for transport in large vehicles.
The lines of communication between the villages are also poor due to erratic cell phone coverage. The road between N'tjilla and Dougoukolobougou is the only road that is passable during all seasons without difficulty. This 7 km road was leveled, widened, and had drainage installed in 2004.
Religion.
Although Islam is the dominant religion, there are also Christians and Animists present.

Background.
CBRail was created by the takeover of the European operations of the Porterbrooks rail leasing company by a joint venture between Babcock & Brown and Bank of Scotland Corporate Europe (a banking division of HBOS) At the time of the takeover from Porterbrook the company had leasing arrangements for 28 locomotives and 67 coaches.
Under the new financial backing, the company intended to grow to have a significant market share in the European railway leasing business; in order to do this it expanded its fleet. An order for 35 diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives was placed with Bombardier Transportation in 2006 with an option for 70 more.
Through the 2000s CBRail continued to expand its fleet, including freight wagons in its portfolio.; by June 2008, the company had 118 locomotives, 785 freight wagons and 103 passenger vehicles either on lease or under construction.

Harry Piers

Harry Piers (1870–1940) was a Canadian historian. He was a long-serving and influential historian and curator at the Nova Scotia Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Piers was born on February 12, 1870 in Halifax.
He became the second curator of the Nova Scotia Museum in 1899 when he succeeded David Honeyman. Piers also served as librarian of the Provincial Science Library from 1900 and as Deputy Keeper of Public Records of Nova Scotia from 1899 until 1931, when the Public Archives of Nova Scotia opened. He did extensive work with Jerry Lonecloud documenting Mi'kmaq people's culture and history. He died on January 24, 1940 and is buried in Halifax at Camp Hill Cemetery. He was succeeded as curator of Nova Scotia Museum by Donald Crowdis.
Raddall was an active writer publishing on a wide range of subject from the history of the military to the habits of the winter wren, a tiny bird found in Nova Scotia forests. His last book, "The Evolution of the Halifax Fortress 1749-1928", was published in 1947 just after his death and played a key role in restoring the Halifax Citadel and York Redoubt.
Piers was also known for his assistance to other authors. In 1893 he edited Mary Jane Katzmann's Akins Prize-winning "History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S." posthumously for publication. History and fiction writer Thomas Raddall received crucial encouragement and assistance from Piers who became Raddall's mentor for historical research.
Piers worked with precision and diligence for many years as virtually a one-man-museum for Nova Scotia. His obituary in the "Halifax Chronicle Herald" noted, “Many called him a 'human book of knowledge'. His tall stately figure was familiar in the community life of Halifax and he played a prominent role in numerous activities in the City and Province.". Piers' museum work was multi-disciplinary, collecting artifacts and specimens for human and natural history. His collection documentation set high standards of research and description that were ahead of their time and stand out today as instructive examples of museum work. A Parks Canada historian in recent times lauded him as a “renaissance man of this province's cultural history. It matters not where the modern researcher penetrates-- history, archaeology, material culture, geology, botany-- it is almost certain that you will find his footprint of decades ago. At a time when nobody else cared, he and his museum did, and between them they preserved and recorded much that would otherwise have vanished utterly."
He was a long term member of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society.

Minneapolis municipal elections, 2009

A general election was held in Minneapolis on November 3, 2009. Minneapolis's mayor was up for election as well as all the seats on the Minneapolis City Council, the two popularly elected seats on the Board of Estimate and Taxation, and all the seats on the Park and Recreation Board. This was the first election held in Minneapolis to use ranked choice voting, a collective term for instant-runoff voting and the single transferable vote.
Because city voters approved a city charter change by referendum in 2006 to use a ranked choice voting system, Minneapolis did not hold a primary election on September 8, the 2009 date for primaries in Minnesota. 
There was a lawsuit in court to prevent the voting change; it lost by summary judgment in the first court, was appealed directly to the Minnesota Supreme Court, where it also lost. One person active in the lawsuit has filed as a candidate but is not campaigning; allegedly this is to give him legal standing to sue after the election.
Mayor.
Incumbent Democratic–Farmer–Labor Mayor R. T. Rybak announced on January 13, 2009 that he would be running for re-election. 11 candidates were on the ballot.
Previously mentioned as possible candidates for Mayor were Bob Miller, the director of the Minneapolis Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP), Minneapolis City Council members Gary Schiff and Ralph Remington, Minneapolis Park Board President Tom Nordyke, former City Council president Jackie Cherryhomes, and Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin; none of them ended up running.

The Big One (NASCAR)

The Big One is a phrase describing any crash usually involving five or more cars in NASCAR and ARCA stock car racing.
Coining the phrase.
Until the 1990s, massive crashes were referred to as "major," or "terrific" crashes.
By the mid-1990s, competitors and media began taking note of the multi-car wrecks at Daytona and Talladega. In 1997, Dale Earnhardt described a final-lap crash at the 1997 Pepsi 400 as "the Big Wreck". News articles began using the term "Big Wreck" to describe such crashes in 1998, and by 1999, its use was widespread. Drivers began to openly admit they were apprehensive of its possibility.
One of the first times the term "The Big One" was used on-air was during the Winston 500 on ESPN October 11, 1998. Commentator Bob Jenkins said during the crash on lap 134 "this is the big one we hoped we would not have." One of the first published instances of the term "The Big One," was an Apr 18, 2000, article on ESPN.com about a crash in the DieHard 500. The term was also being used informally by fans on message boards.
During the 2001 Daytona 500 Fox commentator Darrell Waltrip used the term on-air to describe an 18-car crash in the backstretch on lap 173: "It's the big one, gang; it's The Big One. It's what we've all been fearing in this kind of racing is going to happen."
By 2001, the phrase was widely used by competitors, fans, and in print and broadcast media. It soon became standard NASCAR vernacular, and became a retronym to describe past such accidents as well.
"The Big One" has been the subject of criticism of NASCAR. Some have complained that the sanctioning body, promoters, and media have celebrated the crashes.
By 2009, Talladega Superspeedway marketed itself on the notorious crashes, with a one-third-pound frankfurter sold at the track called "The Big One".

<doc id="21509389" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509389" title="Labor process theory">
Labor process theory

Labour Process Theory is a late Marxist theory of the organization of work under capitalism. It critiques scientific management as authored by Frederick W Taylor in the early 1900s, and uses central concepts developed by Harry Braverman in the 1970s. Recent attempts have been made to use labor process theory to explain workers' bargaining power under contemporary global capitalism. Labor Process Theory has developed into a broader set of interventions and texts linked to critiquing new forms of management strategy of an exploitative nature.
Harry Braverman was an industrial worker for most of his life in the United States during the height of Fordist labour management and production techniques in manufacturing. In Labour and Monopoly Capital he examines his own experiences through a Marxist perspective, drawing attention to the very small processes of work that were ignored by Marxists for much of the Twentieth century. His studies coincided with the Autonomist Marxist theory in Italy which paid similar attention to the factory floor.
Labour Process Theory looks at how people work, who controls their work, what "skills" they use in work, and how they are paid for work. Braverman posits a very broad thesis: that under capitalism, management steals workers skills, reduces the pleasurable nature of work and the power workers have through controlling skill, while cutting their wages by reducing their wages to those of unskilled workers and increasing the amount of exertion required from workers. Braverman primarily pays attention to the class-in-itself or the working class as the subject of management and capitalist brutality, acknowledging his inability to attend to working class self-emancipation in this context. Others, following in Braverman's footsteps have criticised his "deskilling" thesis as not universal; and, have attended to working class resistance to the imposition of Fordism.
A key element of labour process theory is an analysis of the local systems of management and control, and an examination of how these are used to reduce the power of sections of the working class who hold work skills that aren't reproducible by unskilled labour or machine power.

HMS Crescent (1931)

HMS "Crescent" was a C-class destroyer which was built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Home Fleet, although she was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–36. "Crescent" was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in late 1936 and renamed HMCS "Fraser". She was stationed on the west coast of Canada until the beginning of World War II when she was transferred to the Atlantic coast for convoy escort duties. The ship was transferred to the United Kingdom (UK) in May 1940 and helped to evacuate refugees from France upon her arrival in early June. "Fraser" was sunk on 25 June 1940 in a collision with the anti-aircraft cruiser while returning from one such mission.
Design and construction.
"Crescent" displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. "Crescent" carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.
The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, "Crescent" had a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt AA gun between her funnels, and two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of her forecastle deck. The AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2-pounders were relocated to between the funnels. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. Three depth-charge chutes were fitted, each with a capacity of two depth charges. After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges, delivered by one or two rails and two throwers.
"Crescent" was ordered on 30 January 1930 as part of the 1929 Naval Programme and laid down on 1 December 1930 at Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched on 29 September 1931 and completed on 15 April 1932.
Operational history.
After the ship commissioned on 21 April 1932, she was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. "Crescent" collided with her sister at Chatham on 21 July and was under repair until 27 August. "Crescent" was refitted at Chatham between 30 March and 6 May 1933, before deploying to the West Indies between January and March 1934. She was given another refit at Chatham from 27 July to 3 September 1934. "Crescent" was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis, and deployed in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936. When the ship returned, she was refitted at Sheerness between 23 April to 13 June and placed briefly in reserve.
Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy.
Together with her sister , "Crescent" was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £400,000. She was refitted again to meet Canadian standards, including the installation of ASDIC (sonar), and taken over by them on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS "Fraser" and commissioned into the RCN at Chatham on 17 February. "Fraser" was assigned to the Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt on 3 May 1937. She remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939.
When World War II began on 3 September, "Fraser" was transiting the Panama Canal and arrived at Halifax on 15 September. She and her sisters were employed as local escorts to ocean convoys sailing from Halifax. In November the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station took operational control of the Canadian destroyers. The ship escorted the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain part way across the North Atlantic in mid-December. In March 1940 she was ordered to join the Jamaica Force for Caribbean patrols before being re-assigned to Western Approaches Command two months later. On 26 May she left Bermuda for Britain and arrived at Plymouth on 3 June where she was pressed into service evacuating Allied troops from various French ports on the Atlantic coast. Sometime in 1940, the ship's aft set of torpedo tubes was removed and replaced by a AA gun.
Loss.
On 25 June 1940, "Fraser", her sister , and the cruiser "Calcutta" were returning from St. Jean de Luz after rescuing refugees trapped by the German Army (Operation Ariel), when "Fraser" was rammed by "Calcutta" in the Gironde estuary. Struck forward of the bridge by the cruiser's bow, "Fraser" was cut in half and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by "Restigouche" and other nearby ships. Many of the survivors from "Fraser" transferred that later summer to , and were lost when that vessel sank on 22 October 1940 as a result of a collision with the freighter MV "Port Fairy".

Radical compassion

Radical compassion is a term coined by the philosopher Khen Lampert, in 2003. His theory of radical compassion appeared in "Traditions of Compassion: from Religious Duty to Social-Activism" (2006). Lampert identifies compassion as a special case of empathy, directed towards the "other's" distress. Radical compassion is a specific type of general compassion, which includes the inner imperative to change reality in order to alleviate the pain of others. This state of mind, according to Lampert's theory, is universal, and stands at the root of the historical cry for social change.
"I have noted that compassion, especially in its radical form, manifests itself as an impulse. This manifestation stands in stark opposition to the underlying premises of the Darwinist theories, which regard the survival instinct as determining human behavior, as well to the Freudian logic of the Pleasure Principle, which refutes any supposedly natural tendency on the part of human beings to act against their own interests and proposes viewing such an inclination as the product of cultural conditioning..."

Rundle Group

The Rundle Group is a stratigraphical unit of Mississippian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 
It takes the name from Mount Rundle (itself taking the name from Robert Terrill Rundle), and was first described in outcrops at the northern side of the mountain in Banff National Park by R.J.W. Douglas in 1953.
Lithology.
The Rundle Group consists of massive limestone interbedded with dark argillaceous limestone. Chert nodules are observed in the shaley beds, and crinoids and brachiopods are observed in the clean massive beds. Dolimitization is observed in the Elkton Member of the Turner Valley Formation. 
Distribution.
The Rundle Group reaches a maximum thickness of at Tunnel Mountain. It thins out toward east and north and is completely eroded or absent in east central and only the lower part occurs in southern Alberta.
Relationship to other units.
The Rundle Group is disconformably overlain by the Rocky Mountain Formation in the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies and by the Fernie Formation in the foothills and by Cretaceous beds in the prairies. It conformably overlies the Banff Formation.
The Rundle Group can be correlated with the Mission Canyon Formation in southern Saskatchewan, northeastern Montana and North Dakota. 
Subdivisions.
The Rundle Group comprises the Mount Head Formation and Livingstone Formation in the Rocky Mountains; by the Turner Valley Formation, Shunda Formation and Pekisko Formation in the foothills and plains. It is equivalent to the Debolt Formation and Prophet Formation in north-eastern British Columbia and west-northern Alberta. Debolt, Shunda and Pekisko Formations are staked in the Fort Nelson area.

<doc id="21509528" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509528" title="Rhizina undulata">
Rhizina undulata

Rhizina undulata, commonly known as the doughnut fungus or the pine firefungus, is a species of fungus in the genus "Rhizina", family Rhizinaceae. The fruit bodies are dark purple brown with a bright yellow margin, crust-like and attached to the growing surface by numerous root-like yellow rhizoids. "R. undulata" has a cosmopolitan distribution, and commonly occurs on clearings or burned areas throughout central and northern Europe, North America, northern Asia, and southern Africa. It is parasitic on conifer seedlings, and has caused considerable damage to tree plantations worldwide.
Taxonomy.
The fungus was first described in 1774 as "Helvella inflata" by the German polymath Jacob Christian Schäffer. It acquired its current name in 1815 by virtue of its publication in Elias Magnus Fries's "Observationes mycologicae".
The specific epithet "undulata" means "wavy" or "undulating". Common names that have been used to refer to the species include "crust-like cup", "pine-fire cushion", "doughnut fungus", and "pine firefungus". 
Description.
Fruit bodies, which may be up to wide, are flat, with irregular lobes, and are attached to the growing surface on the entire lower side by numerous whitish to yellowish rhizoids resembling plants roots. The hymenium is dark purple brown to blackish, while the margin is pale yellow (like the underside), and wavy and irregular. The fruit body has a leathery texture when old.
The spores of "Rhizina undulata" are fusiform (fuse-shaped), apiculate, minutely verricose at maturity, with one or two oil drops, and have dimensions of 30–40 by 8–11  µm. The asci are roughly cylindrical, and 250–280 by 14–18 µm. Like most other Pezizales, the asci open at maturity by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, tips encrusted with tubular setae, thin-walled, brown, aseptate and parallel-sided, tapering to a blunt point, and are 7–11 µm wide.
Similar species.
"Disciotis venosa" has an overall similar blistered appearance, but can be distinguished by its distinct bleach-like odor. "Discina ancilis" bears a general resemblance to "Rhizina undulata", but its fruit bodies lack rhizoids on their undersurface, and are attached to the substrate at a central point.
Habitat and distribution.
This is a widespread fungus that grows on burned soil or conifer debris. Although it is regarded as a saprobic species, it can also attack conifers of varying age parasitically. "Rhizina undulata" attack in recently established conifer plantations in areas where slash burning after clear felling has been performed is a well-known phenomenon. Because the optimum temperature for spore germination is high (), the spores may lie dormant in soil for two years. As a result of these fires, the underlying soil is heated so that suitable conditions are created for the germination of ascospores. The use of hot asphalt () for paving new roads has also been observed to cause the same deleterious effect on neighboring conifers. "Rhizina undulata" has been recorded in northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It has been introduced into southern Africa.

The Eternal is the fifteenth and final studio album by Sonic Youth, released by Matador Records on June 9, 2009, their first on that label. It was their first studio album in three years (since "Rather Ripped"), making it the band's longest delay between studio albums. The album peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200 and was the band's highest charting album of their career in the United States and highest charting album since 1994's "Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star", which reached #34. The album was released digitally, on CD, and as a double LP, in both a standard and a "Buy Early Get Now" (BEGN) edition.
Background.
After "Rather Ripped", the band left Geffen Records. They signed with Matador in 2008, and began working on new music. The cover art was painted by John Fahey. The album is dedicated to Ron Asheton.
Reception.
The album so far has a score of 79 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews". An early review by "Clash" said "the album shows signs of life and heart-wrenching vitality that secures its makers’ position at the forefront of American rock music." In a "Critic's Choice" review for "The New York Times", Ben Ratliff compared the album to two of their albums from the 1990s,"Washing Machine" and "A Thousand Leaves"; he pointed out that the album demonstrates Kim Gordon's continued rise as a singer, saying she "sings all the best stuff" on "The Eternal", particularly the album's last song, "Massage the History", a song he calls the "record's sleeper stunner". The addition of Mark Ibold in the studio was praised by Monday Field of Frank Booth Review, likening the album's basslines to "a 1AM, alcohol-soaked punch in the gut".
Other reviews are positive as well: musicOMH gave the album all five stars and said that it "acts as a fitting and timeless aide-memoire of everything this mighty band has ever achieved." "Los Angeles Times" also gave it all four stars and said, "The music remains ageless and weird, fueled on chaos and clarity, but these are songs, not sound experiments for their own sake." "Chicago Tribune" gave the album three-and-a-half stats out of four and said, "Back on an independent label after nearly two decades with a major, the post-punk quartet returns to its ‘80s foundation with an album that breaks little new ground, but sounds thrilling all the same. [...] It casts aside some of the band’s fondness for the warped digression and simply moves from one thrill ride to the next, rarely pausing for breath." "The A.V. Club" gave it a B+ and said that the songs "are more conventionally rock-oriented than any in Sonic Youth’s career, yet the album doesn’t really sound like a departure."
"Under the Radar" gave it eight stars out of ten and called it "the sound of a band at its most self-aware, tuggging gently at the boundaries of their trademark sound to gorgeous effect." No Ripcord also gave it eight stars out of ten and said the album was "certainly heavier, but it's tuneful and heavy at the same time." "Q" gave the album four stars out of five and said, "Refreshingly, nothing outstays its welcome, not even nine-minute closer 'Massage The History.'" "Alternative Press" also gave it four stars out of five and said of Sonic Youth, "They're still delivering more aural discovery and attitude than both their weary, uninspired colleagues and the legion of fumbling neophyte upstarts combined." "The Guardian" likewise gave the album four stars and said of it, "There is an excitable, almost naive quality to its visceral riffs and enthusiastic name-checks of artists, poets and countercultural figures." "Now" also gave it four stars and said, "The band’s put together one of their more accessible albums, full of immediate thrills instead of drawn-out weirdness." "Billboard" gave it a favorable review and called it "a rock group playing at the peak of their powers: assured but not ‘comfortable,’ and free with each other." "The Boston Globe" also gave it a favorable review and stated, "Ingredients from those progressive forays ensure that the new tunes sound fresh even as the album is marked with such Sonic signatures as artful contrasts and angular arrangements." "Hartford Courant" likewise gave it a favorable review and called it "Sonic Youth's most compelling album in years."
"Paste" gave the album a score of 7.8 out of ten and said that its songs "aren’t purely doom and gloom; they’re not tons of fun either, but hope and curiosity abound, even if they’re not easy to spot on first listen." "Filter" gave it a score of 72% and said, "All the things you love about Sonic Youth are here, just a little fewer and further between than you'd like." Sputnikmusic gave the album a score of three-and-a-half out of five and said it was "simply just another confirmation that Sonic Youth is one of the most essential---if not the most essential---indie collectives of the past thirty years." "The Phoenix" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "a fun, superficial tangent, disappointing in its regressiveness but enjoyable as long you don't examine it too closely."
Other reviews are very average: "The Austin Chronicle" gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, "The three-guitar interplay, moderated by bassist Mark Ibold and Steve Shelley on drums, is confident if briefly indulgent ('Walkin Blue'), but Sonic Youth reigns in those tendencies for the most part, making The Eternal its most straightforward album yet." Yahoo! Music UK gave the album six stars out of ten and said it was "well-built, yes, but almost too well built, many parts sounding like they've been lifted directly from SY's vast back catalogue and slotted into place, like a jigsaw that needed completing, rather than the sprawling documents of noise and confusion this band's name is built upon." Tiny Mix Tapes gave it three stars out of five and said the album was "accessible, listenable, and all the rest: another consistent album from the consistent rock band Sonic Youth." "Slant Magazine" also gave it three stars out of five and said of Sonic Youth: "Married since 1984, the couple has reached a level of easy rapport that makes their collaborations feel warmly alive. Hopefully the band's sound won't continue to settle into the same kind of comfortable informality." "The Observer" likewise gave it three stars out of five and said, "Still sounding like an evening in your company will encompass discussions of Yves Klein and Lindsay Lohan? Check, check, check. But still cool."

<doc id="21509720" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509720" title="Moral suasion">
Moral suasion

Moral suasion (a phrase from the Latin words "moral" and "suasion" which denote respectively "conduct or character that is right and virtuous" and "to present in a pleasing manner" - sometimes known as jawboning), is defined in the economic sphere as "the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law." The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy.
There are two types of moral suasion:
Moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers. This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished. Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.
Although the present article focuses mainly on the usage of moral suasion by governments to induce behaviour from their citizens and companies, this policy tool has been used in the past by other actors for other purposes. The most famous case is the attempt to end slavery in the United States in the 1830s by using moral suasion. This tactic was attempted by William Lloyd Garrison and his New England Anti-Slavery Society.
Effectiveness of Moral Suasion.
Moral suasion will be "an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance".
There are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen.
Even when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs.
Although neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion. Indeed, companies that have been "persuaded" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.
Examples of Moral Suasion.
Regulating the financial sector.
The Bank of Canada defines moral suasion in central banking as "a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy". It could also be defined more generally as "a process whereby commercial banks co-operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions". 
Formal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to "refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank". Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried though various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial finance institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters.
The oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive. Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.
Curbing inflation.
Moral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as "open mouth operations" in the financial sector. The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank. For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations, influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.
Moral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of "democratic socialism" has been in place for some time. Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.
Promoting religious tolerance.
Moral suasion has also been effective in Singapore in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders. Thus moral suasion is effective in resolving religious disharmony especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator.
Protecting the environment.
Usage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative externalities that they cause. Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax. Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low. 
Marine debris regulations in the United States (1989–1993) revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected. The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour however is not strong unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policy makers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.
Moral suasion in different political regimes.
Although moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective.
Centralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent. Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly.
Effectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.
As fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography .
Studies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in advanced economies. It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.
Interaction of moral suasion with other policy instruments.
Moral suasion is rarely used in isolation. Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives.
Regulation.
Firms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations. In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.
Price cap.
Governments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed. This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Paul Volcker, warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level, and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.
Additional taxation.
Moral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success. The threat of additional, specific taxes was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely.
Open market transactions and other interventions by central banks.
Central banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of "appropriate" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs. Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range.
Information provision.
Governments can choose to publish information in order to "shame" certain market participants into altering their behaviour. The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging "excessive" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices. The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.
Service provision.
The threat of direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.
Privatisation and deregulation.
Large monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.
Enhancing the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy instrument.
Moral suasion is used when economically rational individual behaviours of economic agents do not maximise collective welfare. Moral suasion will therefore be a more effective policy tool if these rational economic agents can be persuaded that it is in their long-term interest to comply with the intended government policies, even when they are not profit-maximising in the short run.
This can be done in two ways. First, governments can build a high level of trust between themselves and market participants. This can be achieved through good governance, clear communication, and a delivering on their promises. Second, governments can ensure that their threats are seen as credible by acting on them and publicising their actions, so that future non-compliance will be deterred.
Gaining the support of the population is also increases the effectiveness of moral suasion. This can be done through active citizen participation in the government decisioning process as well as information and publicity campaigns.

<doc id="21509789" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509789" title="Seismic to simulation">
Seismic to simulation

Seismic to simulation is the process and associated techniques used to develop highly accurate static and dynamic 3D models of hydrocarbon reservoirs for use in predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original well logs, seismic data and production history.
Introduction.
Reservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and production planning. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, seismic surveys, and production history. 
Seismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated petrophysics and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, geostatistical inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, stratigraphic grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data.
Rock physics and petrophysics.
The first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and elastic properties of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.
Well logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface.
Insight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and core measurements provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. 
Seismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as impedance. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave reflects and refracts as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as porosity, lithology, water saturation, and permeability.
Once well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic sonic logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics algorithms including: Xu & White, Greenberg & Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle & Wang. 
When the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties.
MCMC geostatistical inversion.
In the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.
Geostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models.
All field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of probability distribution functions (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using histograms and variograms, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight.
Once constructed, the PDFs are combined using Bayesian inference, resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field. A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective.
From the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified.
Inversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind-well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential biased. 
This statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. 
The output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties.
Uncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model.
Stratigraphic grid transfer.
Following geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the seismic grid to a corner-point grid. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid.
The static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. 
An intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones.
Using the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization.
Model validation and ranking.
In the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure. Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. 
Based on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.

Cockman's mastership at University College was a contested one, with William Dennison, who also served as Master between 1722–29. There were two disputed elections held in 1722. Cockman appealed to the Crown and was declared Master of University College in 1729. The success of Thomas Cockman's appeal involved accepting that King Alfred had founded the College. This myth originated from the late 1380s but it was widely believed by Cockman's time. The ruling at the court hearing meant that the Visitor of University College, who is responsible for resolving such disputes, should be the Crown rather than the University.
In 2008, University College acquired a painting including Thomas Cockman. The painting had remained in Thomas Cockman's family, but was auctioned at Sothebys. The picture is presumed to be a celebration of the success of Cockman's appeal to the Crown to be declared Master of University College in 1729. This followed two disputed elections held in 1722.

Cold water wake

Cold water wake - in oceanography describes phenomenon of ocean cooling in the wake of a tropical cyclone passage. Cold wakes are caused by mixing of colder water below the warmer oceanic mixed layer and through upwelling, advection, and air-sea fluxes. 
Cold wakes have distinct cooling asymmetry.

Bixi (company)

Bixi, officially "Société de Vélo en Libre-Service", is a not-for-profit and public bicycle sharing system developed in Montreal, Canada.
After the 2008 implementation of the system in Montreal, Bixi began expanding around the world. Bixi systems are now found across North America. Bixi equipment in several US cities and Melbourne are operated by Alta Bicycle Share.
On January 20, 2014, Bixi Montreal filed for bankruptcy.
The name Bixi is a portmanteau of bicycle and taxi.
History.
In 2007, the city of Montreal published the "Reinvent Montreal" transportation plan, which featured a bike sharing system as a method of reducing automobile dependence. To design and operate the new system, the city created the Public Bike System Company, a private non-profit company overseen by Stationnement de Montréal known as the Public Bike System Company (PBSC), a private enterprise serving as the Montreal Parking authority.
In May 2009, the system began operation in Montreal, with 3000 bicycles and 300 stations.
From June to September 2009, the system was introduced in a pilot study in Ottawa/Gatineau. This was followed by operations in Melbourne, Australia from May 2010, Minneapolis (MN), in June 2010, and London in July 2010. Bixi launched on the Washington State University campus in August 2010, in Washington, D.C. & Arlington under the name "Capital Bikeshare" in September 2010, and in Boston under the name "Hubway" in July 2011.
In January 2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in Montreal citing $46 million in debt. Part of the issue in the bankruptcy was that Chicago and New York were withholding $5 million in payments because of software issues with the docking stations.
System components.
A complete station is made up of a pay station, bikes, and bike docks (where the bikes are housed), which are fitted into modular technical platforms that are powered by solar panels. These technical platforms are the base and electronic ports for pay stations and bike docks. Bike stations can be created, expanded, configured and removed in about half an hour, monitored by a real-time management system. Excavation or preparatory work is not required, enabling the installation of a bike station as an adjunct to on-street parking.
The bike dock and locking system.
Bike docks serve to house and lock bikes. Made from aluminium, these modular docking stations are formed by a combination of groups of four docks, which are modular themselves. Inspired by ANAT technology, the bike dock's modularity allows a pay station to be deployed in the place of a single dock. Maintenance and repair of the system is simplified thanks to a removable module present in every docking station which contains the locking system and all critical components that allow the system to function. In case of repairs, this module can be replaced with an identical one immediately, reducing the down-time of the system. The locking system is based on an energy efficient actuator used in the medical sector. The principal inventor of these systems is Charles Khairallah, president of Robotics Design,
with co-inventor Michel Dallaire, president of Michel Dallaire Industrial Design.
Pay station.
Users can rent a bike using a subscriber key (a "Bixi key") obtained through a long-term online subscription (30 days or annual) or an access code provided by the pay station (24-hour access). Pay stations are touchscreen-operated and only accept credit cards. A button is used to notify Bixi mechanics of defective bicycles.
The bike.
The bicycles are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame.
The one-piece aluminum frame and handlebars conceal cables and fasteners in an effort to protect them from vandalism and inclement weather. The heavy-duty tires are designed to be puncture-resistant and are filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. Twin LED rear lights are integrated into the robust frame, which weighs approximately 18 kg. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan.
Rates.
Rates differ by city. In general, users need to take out a subscription, which allows the subscriber an unlimited number of free trips shorter than a given time (generally 30 min). A trip that lasts longer than this incurs additional charges, on an increasing price scale. The increasing price scale is intended to discourage long trips, which helps keep the bikes in circulation.
Montreal Rates (not including the subscription):
Toronto Rates (not including the subscription):
Difficulties.
Several cities experienced hurdles in implementing BIXI systems.
A trial implementation in Ottawa and Gatineau took place in the summer of 2009, with 50 bikes and four stations available until September 2009. While the trial was successful, they did not return in 2010 since no company wanted to manage the project as the National Capital Commission wanted the contractor to buy the bicycles and locking stations. The project was revived, however, and 100 bikes and 10 stations were launched in spring 2011.
Bixi's franchise in central Boston includes the right to negotiate to expand the system to neighbouring municipalities. Central Boston will be served by a network that includes 2,500 bikes, and 290 stations with 3,750 docking spaces, with the potential to expand to a 5,000-bike system. The system was delayed, partly because of a lack of funding, but launched in Spring 2011 with 610 bikes and 61 stations. It has since grown into the neighboring communities of Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville. They had initially planned to set up a BIXI system directly, but now are using Alta Bicycle Share of Portland, Oregon to set it up. Alta Bicycle Share is a sister company of Alta Planning + Design, undertaking all the services to create and manage bicycle sharing systems. Alta Bicycle Share uses the same system of bicycles and stations that are used in BIXI through the Public Bike System Company.
The BIXI system in Montreal experienced some initial difficulties less than two months after its introduction in 2009, with damage and vandalism to some of the bikes. The newspaper "La Presse" reported on July 5, 2009 that one in five bikes had been damaged and 15% of bike racks are defective. Stationnement de Montréal communications director Michel Philibert stated the organization plans to reinforce racks and is testing prototype designs. Designer Michel Dallaire stated it never occurred to him that people would try to break the stations to steal bikes.
In 2012 a legal dispute over software from 8D Technologies brought implementation delays for Chattanooga, New York and San Francisco.
In 2013 it was reported that the Toronto Bixi system is facing financial troubles and will be operated by Toronto Parking Authority in Spring 2014 under a different name. The system has only paid back $600,000 of its $4,500,000 start up loan. The unexpectedly rapid expansion of export business created cash flow problems for the parent company, PBSC Urban Solutions, who attempted to sell the international operations in June.
In January 2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in Montreal citing $46 million in debt. Part of the issue in the bankruptcy was that Chicago and New York were withholding $5 million in payments because of software issues with the docking stations.

Inside Out (UK TV series)

Inside Out is the brand name for a number of regional television programmes in England broadcast on BBC One. Each series, made by a BBC region, focuses on stories from the local area. Commissioned by BBC One controller Lorraine Heggessey, the programme began on 9 September 2002 and replaced a number of different titles previously used on BBC Two.
Versions.
"Inside Out England" shows selected stories from the regional programmes and is shown across England which is hosted by Matthew Wright.
A different region is selected each week for broadcast on BBC One HD.
Controversy.
The East Midlands edition of show caused controversy in one programme when Ray Gosling admitted to smothering a former lover who had AIDS (this later proved to be false). The programme was filmed in December 2009 and only shown in February 2010. A debate if the BBC should have told the police before the programme aired followed. The BBC was also accused of promoting assisted suicide.
In January 2013, the writer and presenter Chris Geiger investigated a self-styled spiritual healer who claimed to be able to treat cancer using a special diet. Chris Geiger, who claims to be cancer survivor himself, used a hidden camera and posed as a client; again this programme provoked widespread debate.

<doc id="21509877" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509877" title="LBO valuation model">
LBO valuation model

The LBO (or Leveraged buyout) Valuation Model operates on your five-year financial forecast. The model's purpose is to estimate the current value of your business to a "financial buyer", based on your businesses' forecasted financial performance. Your already-completed five-year financial forecast, plus two assumptions, is all that is necessary to create your first draft of a comprehensive LBO valuation of your business.
From a processing standpoint the LBO model makes a copy of your already completed five-year forecast and uses that copy (and any changes you make to it) for projecting future operating results. As such, your original forecast is preserved.
The LBO Valuation Model analyzes the value of your business from the point of view of a "financial buyer" who owns no other businesses in your industry and, therefore, expects all of its investment return to result solely from the future operations of the business. The LBO Valuation Model assumes that the buyer has investigated your business and operating plan and believes your business will achieve the financial results you have forecasted.
From a timing standpoint, the LBO Valuation Model assumes that the financial buyer intends to purchase your business at the beginning of year two of your five-year forecast; and intends to own your business for the ensuing four years, and then sell the business.
In order to generalize the analysis across a potentially infinite range of "deal" attributes, the model assumes the financial buyer is buying only the assets of your business and assuming none of its liabilities. Therefore, the seller of the business (i.e., you) needs to payoff all of the liabilities of the business (and in all likelihood, the income tax owed as a result of the gain realized on the sale of the assets) from purchase price paid to you by the financial buyer.

Operation Sea Dragon occurred during the Vietnam War and was a series of American-led naval operations beginning in 1966 to interdict sea lines of communications and supply going south from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, and to destroy land targets with naval gunfire, as well as to give CIA officers in the area who had sited the targets room to withdraw to extraction zones. The primary purpose of Sea Dragon forces was the interception and destruction of waterborne logistic craft (WBLC), which ranged in size from large self-propelled barges down to small junks and sampans. United States Navy advisers were assigned to the South Vietnamese Navy (VNN) and American minesweepers assisted South Vietnamese Navy ships in carrying out patrols near the Demilitarized Zone. Specially modified attack helicopters were used to pursue North Vietnamese ships and disable them, leaving the ships to be boarded by American and South Vietnamese naval commandos.

Once Upon a Time in Springfield

"Once Upon a Time in Springfield" is the tenth episode of "The Simpsons" twenty-first season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 10, 2010. It was promoted as the 450th episode of the series, but is actually the 451st, and aired alongside "The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!". The episode is dedicated to Eartha Kitt, who died December 25, 2008, over one year before the episode first aired.
In the episode, "The Krusty the Clown Show" is once again reconstructed. This time, in a bid to get girls to watch the show, a female character named Princess Penelope is hired as Krusty's latest sidekick. Meanwhile, a corporate recruiter persuades Homer, Lenny, and Carl to work for a nuclear plant in Capital City, after Mr. Burns announces a moratorium on free doughnuts. The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The episode has received positive reviews from critics and received a Nielsen rating of 6.9/17 in the 18–49 demographic and in 2010 was nominated for two awards at the Primetime Emmy Award, winning one for Anne Hathaway's voice-over performance.
Plot.
Krusty the Clown is informed by his producers that his show is dropping in ratings with the demographics of young girls, and therefore they will introduce a new character named Princess Penelope. Her act features singing, glitter, and a unicorn, which — though immediately attracting a youthful female audience — disgusts the series' predominately male audience, as well as Krusty himself. Soon, the Krustylu Studio becomes almost completely filled with girls (including Lisa), and all of Krusty's merchandise is replaced by that of Penelope's. However, Bart does not like it and complains that "...women ruin all the great things" (the Army, Fantastic Four and "American Idol" "what would be better with only Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson"). Bart demands that Krusty do something in order to restore the show.
Krusty follows Bart's advice and confronts Penelope in her dressing room. Penelope admits she has followed Krusty ever since she was a young girl, who grew up in Mineola, Long Island, New York. They consequently discover that they share a mutual attraction towards one another. Subsequent episodes of "The Krusty the Clown Show" feature the two singing love songs to one another, culminating in Krusty's marriage proposal to Penelope and the latter's acceptance. On the wedding day, Bart and Milhouse attempt to sabotage the marriage by showing Penelope Krusty's former wives, Holly Hippie and Eartha Kitt (who divorced Krusty six hours after they got married), who both despise him. Penelope still wants to get married, but Krusty decides that he is not good enough for Penelope and cancels the wedding. Penelope moves to France, only to discover that Krusty is there and apologizes for leaving her. She accepts and the two float down the Seine River together into the night.
Also in this "Simpsons" episode, budgeting issues cause Mr. Burns to eliminate donuts from the lunch room, shocking Homer, Lenny, and Carl. While at Moe's Tavern, a corporate recruiter named Gator McCall offers them a job at the Capital City Nuclear Power Plant. The trio agree to take a tour, where they discover there are luxurious working conditions, including free massages, sushi, and cartoonist Gary Larson, who has come out of retirement to draw "The Far Side" cartoons for plant employees. They accept the offer.
As Homer, Lenny, and Carl carry their personal possessions from Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Burns confronts them. After begging is unsuccessful, Burns offers to reinstate even better donuts if they return to work at his power plant. The trio accepts the offer.
Production.
The episode features Anne Hathaway's return to the show, this time voicing Princess Penelope. Jackie Mason returns to voice Krusty the Clown's father Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. This is one of Eartha Kitt's final TV appearances; she recorded her part before her death on December 25, 2008. Due to this, her appearance on the episode showed her on a television screen in which Bart said it was recorded six hours before her death instead of being shown in person. Hathaway said that she grew up watching "The Simpsons" with her brothers, and said that "it stuck with me...high school, college, post, everything. I always stop whenever it's on."
Cultural references.
The opening chalkboard gag makes a reference to the 2012 phenomenon in which the world was supposed to end December 21, 2012. Homer, Lenny, and Carl get to see a comic from the comic series "The Far Side" which includes a lion and an X-ray.
While Penelope is playing the guitar in Paris, Tintin and Captain Haddock are listening at one table, crying and hugging. Penelope is not a real princess, despite her full name being Penelope Mountbatten Hapsburg Hohenzollern Mulan Pocahontas.
Reception.
In its original American broadcast, "Once Upon a Time in Springfield" earned a 6.8 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic. In all, the show was watched by 21.007 million viewers and an 18–49 rating of 8.8/22. The larger-than-normal viewership was a result of the episode following the National Football League playoffs. It was the most watched episode of the show since season 16's "Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass", which aired after Super Bowl XXXIX. The episode ranked 8th in the ratings becoming the second highest viewed show on FOX and top rated scripted show on FOX. The episode also came in 5th for the 18–48 rating becoming the top rated scripted programming of the week with a rating of 9.084 million watching and rating of 6.9. 
The episode has received positive reviews from critics. IGN's Robert Canning wrote that "it may not be turning out classic after classic after classic, but The Simpsons can still deliver smart and solid entertainment" and rated the episode 8/10. Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club", while writing that the plot was "something the show has done many, many times before", stated that the episode was "funny [...] with a nice amount of heart", and graded it a B. Jason Hughes of "TV Squad" praised Hathaway's performance, but said that he was "a little disappointed" because the anniversary episode did not focus on the Simpson family.
Tom Maurstad of "The Dallas Morning News" gave the episode a positive review writing "tonight's 450th episode, 'Once Upon a Time in Springfield' is rock solid. Maybe it's not one for the ages, but it's full of quotable lines and casually hilarious moments." "TV Fanatic" stated "Well, as compared to any other episode, "Once Upon a Time in Springfield," was a fantastic outing by The Simpsons". "TV Fanatic" gave the episode an A, calling it "An excellent episode, though its flaws won’t allow me to give it an A+. Nevertheless, it rates a solid A from me."
The episode was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010, and Anne Hathaway was also nominated for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her role as Princess Penelope running against "The Simpsons" cast members Dan Castellaneta for "Thursdays with Abie" and Hank Azaria for "Moe Letter Blues". Although the episode did not win, on August 21, 2010, it was announced that Hathaway won.

It is one of 2,509 Carnegie libraries worldwide 1,689 built in the United States. It was the sixth Library commissioned by Carnegie in the U.S. and the seventh to open. Completed in November 1898, it is the third oldest Carnegie library in continuous operation in its original structure in the U.S. after the Main Branch and Lawrenceville Branch of Pittsburgh.
The building houses a library holding over 34,000 volumes, a 1,000-seat music hall, and an athletic club with a heated indoor pool. The Carnegie Library of Homestead is an independent entity; it is not a "branch" of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which operates one main facility and 19 branches within the city of Pittsburgh.
History.
The library was constructed on a hill in Munhall, Pennsylvania overlooking the Homestead Steel Works, the site of an 1892 labor strike where Pinkerton agents fought with union workers, resulting in 16 deaths.
A library had been under consideration for several years before the strike, but unlike those at Carnegie's Homestead plant, laborers at the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock had capitulated to
his wage concession demands in 1887; the Carnegie Free Library of Braddock was founded the following year. "Our works at Homestead are not to us as our works at Edgar Thomson. Our men there are not partners," Carnegie said.
Groundbreaking for the $300,000 project took place in April 1896. The French Renaissance design was the work of Pittsburgh architects Frank Alden and Alfred Harlow. Contractor William Miller and Sons used Pompein brick for construction of the 220 by 132 foot facility.
Renovations and modifications have not altered the original physical arrangement of the building, that of three separate facilities- library, music hall and athletic club- under one roof.
While Carnegie required communities to use public funds to subsidize the operation of his libraries, Homestead was one of the few exceptions. Operation of the libraries in Braddock, Homestead and Duquesne were originally funded by Carnegie's plants in those towns. After the sale of his business to U.S. Steel in 1901, Carnegie established a $1 million trust to support the three facilities. In the 1960s, the Braddock and Duquesne libraries were turned over to the school districts in those communities by the Board of the Endowment for the Monongahela Valley. The Homestead library is now the sole beneficiary of Carnegie's gift.
USX Corporation, the successor to U.S. Steel, continued to provide major support until 1988, when the corporation terminated its regular donations and the Borough of Munhall assumed responsibility
for the library. Despite the closing of the Homestead Steel Works two years earlier and the precipitous decline in employment and tax revenue, the library remained open and operational with grants secured by community volunteers and the investment income from Carnegie's endowment. When the financial crash of 2008 reduced the value of the endowment by $300,000, the library board furloughed its executive employees and assumed management responsibilities rather than cut services. Fundraising efforts, revenue from athletic club memberships, music hall rentals, and concession sales have maintained the library's viability.
Homestead Library & Athletic Club.
In the early 20th century, the Homestead Library & Athletic Club football team, composed of many former star Ivy League players, was considered one of the top semi-professional teams in the country. Hall of Famer Rube Waddell played for the Club's baseball team. The amateur teams at the library also won national championships in wrestling and track & field.
In the 1920s and 1930s, four Olympians trained in the library's swimming pool. Susan Laird swam in 1928, winning a gold medal with the 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay team; Josephine McKim won a bronze medal in 1928 and gold in 1932; Anna Mae Gorman competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics at age 16; and Lenore Kight won silver in 1932 and a bronze in 1936. Gorman first swam in 1927 while on vacation. When she returned to Homestead she purchased a three-month membership at the library and pool for $1. At age 92 in 2008, Gorman still swam at the library.

Cembalet

The Cembalet is a type of electro-mechanical piano built by the Hohner company of Trossingen, West Germany from the late-1950s to the early 1970s. The designer of the Cembalet was Ernst Zacharias. The Cembalet was a reed-based electric piano intended for home use. It was the first keyboard produced by Hohner as a piano-like instrument rather than an instrument having the sustained note of an organ. It was adopted by popular musicians for recording and performance in the early 1960s due to its portability and ability to be amplified by electronic means.
General description.
The Cembalet is an electro-mechanical piano requiring amplification to produce a usable sound level. Cembalets have 61 keys and a keyboard range of C2 to C7 (65.4 Hz – 2093 Hz). The Cembalet had ground stainless steel reeds and a pick-up using variable capacitance. The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a plectrum and damper pad can be mounted at the end of a tuned spring steel reed. This plectrum lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Cembalet comes from the resistance of the steel reeds until they reach their point of release.
Cembalet versus Pianet.
After introducing the Cembalet Hohner produced a variation of the mechanical design named the Pianet. These two instruments were sold in parallel until the early 1970s. Case styles were identical for models C and N through the 1960s causing many to misidentify these instruments. The most obvious point of visual difference is the differing keyboard range, C to C for the Cembalet and F to F for the Pianet. 
Reed based pianos have voices that differ markedly depending on the material and geometry of the reeds, the way they are excited and the way the vibrations are converted to electrical energy. The Cembalet pushed the tip of the reed upward until it cleared the plectrum, where as the Pianet pulls the reed upward using a pad adhered over a length of one centimetre and positioned back from the tip of the reed. The attack of the note and the harmonics produced vary significantly. In addition the plate of the capacitive pickup is to the side in the Cembalet producing further differences in the way the vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal.
Models.
During the production life of the Cembalet the case, mechanical features and electronics changed to keep pace with developments in electronics manufacture, reductions in manufacturing costs, and fashion. Changes to the Cembalet were also applied to Pianet production. Dating the manufacturing envelope and availability of the various Cembalet models is confused by misidentification of Pianet models as Cembalets and by the differences in sales availability of models between Europe and the United States. 
Cembalet & Cembalet I.

Ternopil Pond

Ternopil Pond (Ukrainian: Тернопільський став, known as Komsomol Lake before 1992, non-official "Ternopil Lake") is a reservoir in Ternopil, Ukraine. It was created in 1548 by Jan Amor Tarnowski as one link in a chain of fortifications encircling his residence, the Tarnopol Castle. In the 16th century the pond stretched for up to the high dam carrying the Lwów Highway.
The pond, formerly renowned for its fisheries, had silted up by the mid-20th century and was further damaged during the Second World War. It was reconstructed and expanded in 1952 to include a network of marshes bordering the Seret River. There is an old Soviet motor ship still operating on the pond. A local version of the Jet d'Eau was inaugurated in 1975.

C-type lectin

A C-type lectin (CLEC) is a type of carbohydrate-binding protein domain known as a lectin. The C-type designation is from their requirement for calcium for binding. Proteins that contain C-type lectin domains have a diverse range of functions including cell-cell adhesion, immune response to pathogens and apoptosis.
Classification.
Drickamer "et al". classified C-type lectins into 7 subgroups (I to VII) based on the order of the various protein domains in each protein. This classification was subsequently updated in 2002, leading to seven additional groups (VIII to XIV). Most recently, three further subgroups were added (XV to XVII).
CLECs include:
The "NK Cell lectin-like receptors" are a very closely related group:
Additional proteins containing this domain include:
