Buxtehude House

The Buxtehude House is a historic property on Sankt Anna Gade in the historic centre of Elsinore, Denmark. It is named after the composer Dieterich Buxtehude who lived in the building.
History.
Buxtehude lived in the house as a child when it served as residence for the organist at St. Olai's Church, a post held by his father.
After staying for a few years in Helsingborg, on the other side of the Øresund, Dieterich Buxtehude returned to the house, living there again from 1660 to 1668 while serving as organist at St. Mary's Church. He then moved to Lübeck, where he was organist at Marienkirche for the rest of his life. 
Later the building on Sankt Anna Gade has served both as a tavern and a butcher's shop and is now a private home.
Building.
The property consists of a house from c. 1600 facing the street and a rear wing, originally of somewhat older origins but rebuilt in the 19th century. The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1950.
There is a plaque conmemarating its namesake former resident.

Pierre-Michel Duffieux

Pierre-Michel Duffieux (1891–1976) was a French physicist, known as the founder of Fourier optics.
Life and career.
Duffieux became interested in physics by listening to the lectures of Pierre Duhem in high school in Bordeaux. In 1912 he entered the École Normale Supérieure. During the first world war he was involved in military work under the supervision of Henri Bénard, applying Fourier methods to measuring the coefficients of thermal conductivity. This work resulted in his first scientific publication.
In 1920 Duffieux became an assistant of Charles Fabry in Marseille, earning his doctorate in 1925 with a thesis on band spectroscopy. Afterward he worked in interference spectroscopy, moving to Rennes in 1927. During World War II Duffieux discovered Fourier optics, presenting his ideas at a meeting of the French Society of Physics in Paris in 1941, and publishing several papers. He completed a monograph on the subject in 1943–1944, which was privately published after the war in 1946. The work gained little attention outside France until Born and Wolf called attention to it in their text, "Principles of Optics" (1959). A second edition of Duffieux's book was published in 1970 by Masson (Paris) and an English translation appeared in 1983. After the war, Duffieux moved to Besançon and became the chair of optics at the university.
Duffieux was also interested in philosophy, music, and the meaning and interpretation of quantum theory.

Angle-supported intraocular lens

Angle-supported intraocular lenses are a special kind of intraocular lens that can be implanted surgically into the anterior chamber of the eye. These lenses are called angle-supported because the footplates of the lens rest in the irido-corneal angle.
Current models of angle-supported phakic IOLs include: Acrysof AC, Phakic 6, Kelman-Duet, I-Care, ZSAL-4, Vivarte and NuVita. Neither have FDA approval yet.

Iris-fixated intraocular lens

Iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens is an intraocular lens that is implanted surgically into the eye and fixated to the iris to correct myopia (nearsightedness).
Early models were sutured to the iris with a stitch; the claw fixation method made iris stitching unnecessary. The iris-claw lens is fixated to the anterior iris surface by enclavation of a fold of iris tissue into the two diametrically opposed claws of the lens. The fixation sites are located in the midperiphery of the iris, which is immobile during pupillary movement.
This lens was modified into a convex-concave design and manufactured as Artisan/Verisyse lens and later the foldable model (Artiflex), a three-piece lens with silicone optic and PMMA claws, was developed.

Verderb (; also "Ferderb", ) is a former village in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Podlesje.
History.
Verderb was a Gottschee German village. In the Kočevje land registry of 1574, Verderb was listed as a joint settlement with Verdreng with 11 half-farms together. In 1770 Verderb had 10 houses. Before the Second World War the village had six houses. In May 1942 the first Partisan military school was established in the nearby forest. The village was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and it was never rebuilt.
Chapel.
An early 17th-century village chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and stood on Mount Verdreng (; also known as Mount Verderb, "Verderbška gora") east of the village. It had a Gothic-style chancel and a wooden ceiling in the nave, and the main altar dated from 1891. It was demolished between 1952 and 1955.

Loring Air Force Base Alert Area

The Loring Air Force Base Alert Area is a former alert area for B-52 Stratofortress aircraft of the 42d Bombardment Wing situated at the former Loring Air Force Base at Limestone, Maine. It was constructed in 1960 due to a demand by the Strategic Air Command that its bomber bases have a staging area to launch alerts from.
History.
The alert force at Loring was established on October 15, 1957. Three months later, the 42d Bombardment Wing began supporting an alert force with six aircraft, later expanding to the entire wing. During the later half of 1958, the alert force was a member of Operation Head Start, the first test in the United States Air Force of sustained airborne alert operations. At or around this time, it was decided to move the alert force to a dedicated location to the southeast of the runway. 
From 1960 until 1967, alert forces remained at the new location, until the 1965 submission of Project One Roof was implemented. The submission of this project by base staff consolidated alert functions back under the roof of Building 6000, which had previously hosted the alert forces until the alert area's construction. For the next sixteen years, the alert area would remain vacant until 1983, when a major renovation to the mole hole building allowed for the area to be occupied again. By 1972, the alert force was reduced so that 62% of the bomber and 72% of the tanker force would be on alert. Increased military funding in the early 1980s due to the domestic policies of Ronald Reagan's administration allowed for a wing to be added to the mole hole. This allowed for the building to be reoccupied until the drawdown of forces under the administration of George H. W. Bush in the early 1990s.
Buildings.
The alert area is a forty acre high-security area located to the southeast corner of the runway, and bordered to the east by forest. It also contains a Christmas tree and mole hole, among other buildings. Within the alert area, a 1994 survey identified the following buildings facilities as existing: "One Christmas tree apron (Structure No. 540), the Alert Crew Readiness Building (8970), a surveillance and control tower (8990), a Security Police Entry Control Building (8965), an electric power station building (8966), a heating fuel oil storage tank (8967), and tennis courts (14501). A road surrounds the Alert Area just inside the security fence."

ANSI Scene

The ANSI art computer art form found wide popularity and distribution on BBS systems throughout North America and the world. Its use of standard computer symbols and colors by particularly talented individuals made it somewhat of a 'cult' art form and provided a springboard for talented computer artists in later years.
This form gave rise to a 'scene', or subculture community of artists who created competitive groups, similar to hackers (and sometimes overlapping these groups). These groups would assemble their best, most current art into downloadable 'packs' for distribution on BBS systems. These could be simply zipped packs of loose art with some text files explaining them, or encoded programs that displayed the art, sometimes with music in MOD format accompanying.
A subset of the broader ANSI art scene arose in 1993-1994, known as the 'Lit Scene'. Packaged and distributed similarly to ANSI art packs, zipped and uploaded to BBS systems throughout the United States and the world, Lit packs saw increasing popularity - and rising quality - until an abrupt end of the scene coincident with the explosion of the web-driven commercial Internet. These Lit packs often also contained ANSI art by authors and guest artists, and music that could be played by reader clients provided with the packs, composed on hexadecimal sound editors using instrument samples, typically in MOD format as originally developed on the Amiga and later also used on early Soundblaster-powered PC's. The effective replacement of the BBS scene with the Internet effectively decimated both sides of the ANSI and Lit scenes, creators and users.
Two of the most well-known and prolific Lit groups were Soulz at Zero and its successor Candelabra, the latter of which restarted as a website a few years after its initial run as a traditional BBS-driven distributed 'pack'-zine. Candelabra's run as a website lasted the better part of a decade. The leader of SaZ, The Stranger, and one of its best-known writers, WiSH, joined Candelabra, whose founder and original editor The Alienist had also contributed briefly to SaZ during its run.

Hirschfeld Wildlife Park () is in Hirschfeld, part of the municipality of Voigtsgrün, near Zwickau in the German Free State of Saxony.
Records by Lady Martha von Arnim (née von Schlegell) prove that the site and its stand of trees have been protected for centuries.
Maps from 1870 show that there was already a wildlife enclosure at this site. It belonged to Lord Alexander von Arnim, who kept deer here. In 1890, a hunting lodge was built in the enclosure that still exists today and is referred to as the "log cabin" ("Blockhaus"). In 1909, his brother, Arno von Arnim, inherited Voigtsgrün and thus the animal enclosure too.
In 1956, the enclosure, which covered an area of about 6 hectares, was turned into a wildlife park. The first livestock included Red Deer, Red Fox and Badger.
Today, the area of the park has been enlarged and contains about 600 animals of 90 different species. These include Raccoon Dogs, Wild Boar, Bears, Gray Wolves, Pot-bellied Pigs, Waders, Heidschnucken, Raccoons, Porcupines, Mouflon, Bison, Snowy Owls, Monkeys and Ferrets. The area also includes a stocks of trees up to 450 years old.
In addition to the animal enclosures, the park also has a petting zoo, restaurants, a minigolf course and a children's playground. Visitors are allowed to bring their dogs to the park.

Alert crew

An alert crew is a term used in the armed forces where members of their units and formations, will maintain a level of combat readiness as a group of persons. Although it sometimes encompasses the entire unit, today the term is more used for a set group of individuals.
History.
Although alert crews were probably in use during World War I, the term came of use during World War II, as crews would be scrambled to intercept enemy aircraft. After the war ended and the Cold War began, the United States Air Force began to include bomber and tanker aircraft. Crews on alert duty would typically be on alert for seven days out of a 21 day period, while being on rotational alert duty. During their alert duty, they would fly training missions to help keep their skills sharpened and occupy the time. Crewmembers would live in a mole hole, which functioned as a home away from home for their airmen. If the klaxon was sounded, alert crews would exit the mole holes and literally run out their waiting planes, which would be ready at a moment's notice to launch. Fighter aircraft were stationed in alert hangars during the Cold War, separate from their bomber and tanker counterparts. As the Cold War ended, the latter two were taken off of constant alert.
Today, fighter aircraft still are stationed on alert throughout the world, ready to launch at a moment's notice. The Boeing E-4 fleet is also always on constant alert, due to it being designed as a mobile command post for the National Command Authority (namely the President of the United States), the Secretary of Defense, and presidential successors.

2012 Tour of Beijing

The 2012 Tour of Beijing was the second running of the Tour of Beijing stage race. It started on 9 October at Tiananmen Square and ended on 13 October in Beijing's Pinggu District after five stages. It was the 28th and final race of the 2012 UCI World Tour season.
The race was won for the second successive year by German rider Tony Martin, riding for the team. Martin won the second stage of the race with a solo attack from the end of the stage, and ultimately won the stage by 46 seconds from his nearest competitor. He held the overall lead of the race until its conclusion, eventually winning the race by 40 seconds from rider Francesco Gavazzi, who won the race's queen stage on the third day. 's Edvald Boasson Hagen completed the podium, 6 seconds behind Gavazzi and 46 down on Martin, and also won the points classification for the most consistent finisher on the stages over the race.
In the race's other classifications, fourth-placed overall Daniel Martin () won the mountains classification, seventh-placed overall Rafał Majka was the winner of the young rider classification for , and were the victors in the teams classification.
Schedule.
The race again consisted of five stages; unlike the 2011 edition of the race, there was no individual time trial stage after Tony Martin maintained his race lead from his time trial win to the end of the race. Ahead of the race, the second stage was modified following rainstorms in the region earlier in the year; the stage was originally scheduled for , but was ultimately shortened to .
Participating teams.
As the Tour of Beijing was a UCI World Tour event, all eighteen UCI ProTeams were invited automatically and obligated to send a squad. Originally, the race organisers awarded a wildcard place in the race to the team, but they withdrew from the race following political tension between China and Japan, which resulted in Japanese riders being asked to leave September's Tour of China, that was held as part of the 2011–2012 UCI Asia Tour. They were ultimately replaced by the team, and as such, formed the event's 19-team peloton.
The nineteen teams that competed in the race were:
Stages.
Stage 1.
The race-opening stage was a circuit race around several of the venues that were part of the 2008 Summer Olympics, primarily between the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube. After starting at Tiananmen Square and following a run-in, the peloton had to complete twelve full laps of a circuit measuring in length. Prior to the end of the stage on the thirteenth passage through the finish line, points – along with time bonuses – were on offer at a pair of intermediate sprint points, held on the fourth and eighth passages respectively. As a result, the stage was widely expected to finish in a bunch sprint, with very little undulation throughout the circuit. with a maximum of around in elevation changes.
A group of five riders – rider Marco Bandiera, Mathieu Ladagnous of , Adriano Malori (), 's Bert-Jan Lindeman as well as Craig Lewis for the team – was established prior to them entering the circuit, at around the point of the stage. The quintet manage to form an advantage of around two minutes, with the main field keeping the gap in check for most of the day. The breakaway swept up the bonus seconds on offer at the sprint points, with Ladagnous gaining the most as he was first across the line at both for six bonus seconds. The group were swept up on the penultimate lap, setting up the ultimate sprint for the line; Elia Viviani sprinted down the left-hand side of the road for , and managed to fend off his rivals for his seventh win of 2012, and assumed the lead of all three classifications on offer on the day. Andrew Fenn finished second for , ahead of 's Edvald Boasson Hagen.
Stage 2.
Following flooding in Beijing in July that caused the deaths of 79 people, race organisers were forced to re-route part of the stage, but maintained the stage start at the Bird's Nest and the finish in MenTouGou. Ultimately, the stage was slightly shortened from its original itinerary of to , maintaining three categorised climbs during the parcours. Prior to the start of the stage, it emerged that one of the race's competitors – rider Steve Houanard – had tested positive for the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO), a performance-enhancing drug, in an out of competition doping test and was asked to leave the race after being suspended by the Union Cycliste Internationale.
On the stage itself, five riders – 's Juan Manuel Gárate, David Tanner of , Mathias Frank (), rider Maxim Belkov and Iván Gutiérrez for the – instigated the breakaway around a quarter of the way through the stage, gaining a maximum advantage of over three minutes at one point. A small group riders bridged up to the lead group after the peloton had nearly brought them back, and they remained out front until the end. Defending race winner Tony Martin () attacked this lead group with remaining, on the climb of the Dong Gang Hong Tunnel, and sped away to win by around 45 seconds to record his first road stage win since the 2009 Tour de Suisse. His margin of victory allowed him to take the red leader's jersey, as well as the green jersey as points leader.
Stage 3.
The queen stage of the Tour of Beijing saw the riders negotiate four categorised climbs during the stage's itinerary, ending in the first summit finish in the Tour's short history. The final climb to the Great Wall of China in Badaling was another venue part of the 2008 Summer Olympics – as part of the Urban Road Cycling Course – and the climb itself was a short, punchy climb of around in length and at an average gradient of 6.3%. Smog would also play a part in the stage's proceedings; after two previously clear days during the race, hazy conditions greeted the riders ahead of the start. Prior to the race, air quality levels were at a "severely polluted" level according to figures released by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection.
With Tony Martin in the overall lead for the team, they played a prominent part at closing down attacks in the early stages, before a seven-rider breakaway was allowed to be formed, just before the quarter-way point of the stage. Best-placed of the riders was Mathieu Ladagnous of , who had featured in the opening day's breakaway, at around three minutes behind Martin. The group gained a maximum advantage of about four-and-a-half minutes before the likes of and sent riders to the front of the peloton to bring the gap down. The group was eventually caught with around remaining, with several counter-attacks occurring from then on.
Sylvain Georges () launched an attack to try and get clear, but – aiding with the pace at the front of the main group – closed him down before he could establish a sizable advantage. Defending mountains classification winner Igor Antón () was the next rider to try but he too was thwarted before the attack could fully materalise. Instead, 's all-rounder Edvald Boasson Hagen attacked with remaining, and held a near 20-second lead into the final kilometre, but was closed down in the final metres, with 's Francesco Gavazzi taking his first victory for the team and his first since winning a stage of the 2011 Vuelta a España. Boasson Hagen finished third on the stage as he was also beaten to the line by rider Daniel Martin; Tony Martin held on to his race lead, with a reduced advantage of 40 seconds over Gavazzi, following the stage-winning time bonus – introduced for the 2012 edition – for Gavazzi.
Stage 4.
The penultimate stage of the Tour of Beijing consisted of a long loop around YanQing – making up most of the itinerary for the first half of the stage, in length – before the riders had to negotiate three categorised climbs (within of racing) in the Jundu Mountains, in the second half of the stage. Each of the three climbs were third-category and equally measured in length, with average gradients for the climbs ranging from 4.2% to 5.2% respectively. From the top of the final climb – just outside Xiezishi – it was all downhill for the remaining of the parcours into the finish in Chang Ping, with the stage finishing near to the district's gymnastics stadium.
A group of five riders – made up of 's Alex Howes, rider Timofey Kritskiy, Mitchell Docker of , Alex Dowsett () and Jérémy Roy, riding for the team – were allowed to create a breakaway inside the opening of the stage, with none of the quintet threatening overall leader Tony Martin () in the general classification. The leaders had gained an advantage of around six-and-a-half minutes towards halfway through the stage, before along with the sprinters' teams started to cut into the advantage. Roy attacked his breakaway companions towards the summit of the final climb; he held almost three minutes over the field at the summit, but he was caught with to go. As a result, this eventually set up a bunch sprint that was won by Kritskiy's team-mate Marco Haller, a neo-pro, who achieved his first professional victory on the line.
Stage 5.
The final stage of the race was also its longest stage, with an itinerary consisting of of racing. Two of the day's four categorised climbs were negotiated inside the first , with the peloton having a relatively flat ride for beyond that. Two further categorised climbs – a second-category climb to Tai Hou Village, followed by the first-category ascent of Si Zuo Lou, averaging gradients of 6.7% and 5.9% respectively – featured on the parcours before a long descent towards Ping Gu's Century Square, and the end of the race. The race remained together for the first hour of racing, with mountains classification leader Daniel Martin () gaining the most, claiming maximum points at each of the first two climbs.
After that, a twelve-rider move got clear of the main field but the peloton failed to let them gain a substantial advantage over them; the maximum gap that the group acquired was around two minutes. The group started to break apart on the climb to Tai Hou Village, while Martin's team-mate Ryder Hesjedal made a solo move from the main field, and soon joined up with the lead group; on the final climb, the group was reduced to a trio as only Hesjedal, rider Jan Bakelants and 's Steve Cummings remained. Bakelants lost contact before the summit, and Hesjedal and Cummings remained clear of the field for the rest of the day. Cummings followed Hesjedal into Ping Gu, and out-sprinted him for his second victory of the season. Edvald Boasson Hagen led the main field home seventeen seconds later, to confirm himself as the points classification winner and third in the general classification – down to bonus seconds – behind 's Francesco Gavazzi, and the repeat victor Tony Martin of .

<doc id="36672016" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36672016" title="Social class in Colombia">
Social class in Colombia

History.
Since the sixteenth century, Colombian society has been highly stratified, with social classes generally linked to racial or wealth distinctions, and vertical mobility has been limited. The proportion of white ancestry has been an important measure of status for the mixed groups since the colonial era. In the nineteenth century, Colombia's rugged terrain and inadequate transportation system reinforced social and geographic distance, keeping the numerically superior but disunited masses fragmented and powerless. The nascent middle class lacked a collective consciousness, preferring to identify individually with the upper class. Except in certain instances of urban artisans and some Amerindian communities, the elite was the only social group with sufficient cohesion to articulate goals and make them known to the rest of the society. In the twentieth century, the society began to experience change, not so much in values or orientation as in broadening of the economic bases and an expansion of the social classes. Improvements in transportation, communications, and education—coupled with industrialization and rapid urban growth—opened Colombian society somewhat by expanding economic opportunities. These advances, although mixed, have continued during the first decade of the present century.
Determinants of social classes.
The many terms for color still being used reflect the persistence of this colonial pattern and a continuing desire among Colombians to classify each other according to color and social group. These terms also cut across class lines so that persons at one level define themselves as being racially similar to those at other levels. The confusion over classification has affected most Colombians because most of them do not define themselves as being white, black, or Amerindian, which are distinct and mutually exclusive groups, but as belonging to one of the mixed categories. In addition to racial and wealth factors, Colombia's classes are distinguished by education, family background, lifestyle, occupation, power, and geographic residence.
Within every class, there are numerous subtle gradations in status. Colombians tend to be extremely status-conscious, and class identity is an important aspect of social life because it regulates the interaction of groups and individuals. Social-class boundaries are far more flexible in the city than in the countryside, but consciousness of status and class distinctions continues to permeate social life throughout Colombia.
Class characteristics.
The upper class is very successful in maintaining exclusivity and controlling change through a system of informal decision-making groups called "roscas"—the name of a twisted pastry. Such groups exist at different levels and across different spheres and are linked hierarchically by personal relationships. Their composition varies according to level—municipal, departmental, or national—but each group tries to include at least one powerful person from every sphere. A rosca is a vitally important system in both the social and the political context because it is at this level of interaction that most political decisions are made and careers determined. Only as a member of such a group can an individual be considered a member of the upper-middle or upper class. Indeed, the listed names of past presidents reflect how power has remained the purview of a small number of elite families instead of a meritocracy.
Colombia has an abundance of families that belonged to the middle-class sector of society and are struggling between the need to survive and the desire to give their children a good education. The lower-middle class, constituting the bulk of the middle class, comes primarily from upwardly mobile members of the lower class. A large number are clerks or small shopkeepers. Many have only a precarious hold on middle-class status and tend to be less concerned with imitating upper-class culture and behavior than with making enough money to sustain a middle-class lifestyle. Such families tend to be just as concerned as those at higher social levels with giving their children an education. Many hope to send at least one of their children through a university, regardless of the financial burden.
Official strata divisions.
The official strata division provides another look at social classes. A 1994 law provides "an instrument that allows a municipality or district to classify its population in distinct groups or strata with similar social and economic characteristics". The law was framed this way to establish cross-class subsidies that would help those in the lower strata pay for utilities. Housing characteristics, such as a garage, a front yard, and quality of the neighborhood, are the main criteria 
used. Depending on the diversity and quality of housing, there could be six strata: level one is lower-low, two is low, three is upper-low, four is medium, five is medium-high, and six is high. Most cities have all six, but there are towns that have only three. This national classification identifies groups with similar socioeconomic characteristics. Although strata are not a direct reflection of social class, they provide useful information beyond income measures.
The great majority of the population (89 percent) lives in strata one, two, and three, and on that basis, even if not by other criteria, is considered poor. Strata four, five, and six house only 6.5 percent, 1.9 percent, and 1.5 percent of the population, respectively. In other words, only about 10 percent of the population lives in dwellings that are well built and located in well-developed neighborhoods with access to good utility services.
The overlap between these official strata and social class is not perfect. It is possible to find very high-income people living in stratum three and some stratum-six residents who have strong affinity with the lower classes. There are several reasons for these coexisting disparities, the main one being perhaps the strong upward mobility allowed by the illegal-drug industry wealth that did not necessarily lead to a change in self-perception. The living expenses of this group of drug traffickers are very high, but they retain some of the cultural identity, education, and self-perceptions of the lower classes.

Flavanol-anthocyanin adduct

Flavanol-anthocyanin adducts are formed during wine ageing through reactions between anthocyanins and tannins present in grape, with yeast metabolites such as acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde-induced reactions yield ethyl-linked species such as malvidin glucoside-ethyl-catechin.
This type of compound has a better color stability at pH 5.5 than normal anthocyanins. When the pH was increased from 2.2 to 5.5, the solution of the pigment became progressively more violet (λmax = 560 nm at pH 5.5), whereas similar solutions of the anthocyanin were almost colorless at pH 4.0.

Vinciane Despret is a Belgian philosopher of science, associate professor, at the University of Liège, Belgium.
Biography.
Vinciane Despret first graduated in philosophy. She studied psychology and graduated in 1991. She is most known for having provided a reflexive account on ethologists, observing babblers in the Nagev desert and the way they would interpret those birds' complex dance moves. 
She is considered to be a foundational thinker in what has now became the field of animal studies. More generally, at the heart of her work lies the question of the relationship between observers and the observed during the conduct of scientific research. 
Despret affiliates herself to such critical thinkers in philosophy and anthropology of science as Isabelle Stengers, Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour. She undertakes a critical understanding of how science is fabricated, following scientists doing fieldwork and the way they actively create links and specific relationships to their objects of study. 
Although she has mostly published books in French, some of her works are planned to be published in English in the course of late 2012.

Harvesting lightning energy

Since the late 1980s, there have been several attempts to investigate the possibility of harvesting lightning energy. While a single bolt of lightning carries a relatively large amount of energy (approximately 5 billion joules or about the energy stored in 145 liters of petrol), this energy is concentrated in a small location and is passed during an extremely short period of time (milliseconds); therefore, extremely high electrical power is involved. It has been proposed that the energy contained in lightning be used to generate hydrogen from water, or to harness the energy from rapid heating of water due to lightning, or to use a group of lightning arresters to harness a strike, either directly or by converting it to heat or mechanical energy, or to use inductors spaced far enough away so that a safe fraction of the energy might be captured.
Overview.
A technology capable of harvesting lightning energy would need to be able to rapidly capture the high power involved in a lightning bolt. Several schemes have been proposed, but the ever-changing energy involved in each lightning bolt render lightning power harvesting from ground based rods impractical – too high, it will damage the storage, too low and it may not work. Additionally, lightning is sporadic, and therefore energy would have to be collected and stored; it is difficult to convert high-voltage electrical power to the lower-voltage power that can be stored.
In the summer of 2007, an alternative energy company called Alternate Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEHI) tested a method for capturing the energy in lightning bolts. The design for the system had been purchased from an Illinois inventor named Steve LeRoy, who had reportedly been able to power a 60-watt light bulb for 20 minutes using the energy captured from a small flash of artificial lightning. The method involved a tower, a means of shunting off a large portion of the incoming energy, and a capacitor to store the rest. According to Donald Gillispie, CEO of AEHI, they "couldn't make it work," although "given enough time and money, you could probably scale this thing up... it's not black magic; it's truly math and science, and it could happen."
According to Martin A. Uman, co-director of the Lightning Research Laboratory at the University of Florida and a leading authority on lightning, a single lightning strike, while fast and bright, contains very little energy, and dozens of lightning towers like those used in the system tested by AEHI would be needed to operate five 100-watt light bulbs for the course of a year. When interviewed by "The New York Times", he stated that the energy in a thunderstorm is comparable to that of an atomic bomb, but trying to harvest the energy of lightning from the ground is "hopeless".
Another major challenge when attempting to harvest energy from lightning is the impossibility of predicting when and where thunderstorms will occur. Even during a storm, it is very difficult to tell where exactly lightning will strike.
Atmospheric electricity.
A relatively easy method is the direct harvesting of atmospheric charge before it turns into lightning. At a small scale, it was done a few times with the most known example being Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment. However, to collect reasonable amounts of energy very large constructions are required, and it is relatively hard to utilize the resulting extremely high voltage with reasonable efficiency.

Nikolai Ignatov

Nikolay Grigoryevich Ignatov (; 3(16) May 1901 – 14 November 1966) was a prominent Soviet politician during the 1950s.
Biography.
Ignatov was born in the village Tishanskaya of Donskaya Oblast (now Volgograd Oblast) in a family of a Russian carpenter. Since 1915 he started working as a carpenter too. In 1917, after the October Revolution, he joined the Red Army, first as a soldier and then, through the 1920s, as an intelligence officer, operating in Donskaya Oblast and later in Middle Asia. After completing his secondary education in 1932-1934, he worked as a Communist Party representative at a factory in St. Petersburg. In 1938 he became the first Secretary of the Communist Party of Kuybyshev. He was demoted in 1940 for ordering to return one third of the collected crops to farmers, in order to motivate them in the collective agriculture. During World War II he was one of the leaders of the partisan movement in Oryol Oblast, where he was the first Secretary of the Communist Party between 1943 and 1949. During 1949-1952 he took the equivalent party position in Krasnodarsky Krai. 
In October 1952, Ignatov became a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but after the death of Stalin in 1953 he was demoted and moved first to St. Petersburg, then to Voronezh, and later to Nizhny Novgorod. On 6 May 1957, the central Communist newspaper "Pravda" published an article where he proposed to reorganize the Soviet economy and generally supported the similar ideas of Nikita Khrushchev. During the next month, he was one of the most active defenders of Khrushchev during the well-organized attempt by Malenkov, Molotov and Kaganovich to demote him within the party. Khrushchev repaid for this by promoting Ignatov to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, as early as in December 1957, bypassing the usually required candidate stage. Since 1957, Ignatov fervently tried to move up in the party system, exploiting the support of Khrushchev, but met a strong opposition of the rivals, such as Alexei Kirichenko and Frol Kozlov. Later, in the 1960s, when the popularity of Khrushchev started to decline, he switched the sides and started traveling around the Soviet Union and personally persuading local party leaders against Khrushchev. He hoped in this way to gain support of the incoming party leader, Leonid Brezhnev, but failed. In 1966, while visiting Chile, he fell ill with an unknown viral infection and died shortly afterwards. 
Ignatov was awarded with the honorary title Hero of Socialist Labour, as well as with the Order of Lenin (three times), Order of the Red Banner of Labour and Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree. In recognition of his achievements before the Communist Party, he was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in the Red Square.

Lightning in religion

Lightning in cultures has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in of itself.
Deities.
One of the most classic portrayals of this is of the Greek god Zeus. An ancient story is when Zeus was at war against Kronus and the Titans, he released his brothers, Hades and Poseidon, along with the Cyclopes. In turn, the Cyclopes gave Zeus the thunderbolt as a weapon, which was near the beginning of Zeus himself. The thunderbolt became a popular symbol of Zeus and continues to be today.
The Aztecs portrayed lightning as a supernatural power of the god Tlaloc, visualized as his axe. In mythology, Tlaloc was the bringer not only of beneficial rain but of storms, killer lightning bolts, flood, and disease.
The Classic Mayas personified lightning as a rain deity classified by scholars as God K. This deity has a leg shaped like a lightning serpent, and a forehead perforated by a lightning celt. A miniature God K is often wielded as an axe by the king.
In Slavic mythology the highest god of the pantheon is Perun, the god of thunder and lightning.
Pērkons/Perkūnas is the common Baltic god of thunder, one of the most important deities in the Baltic pantheon. In both Latvian and Lithuanian mythology, he is documented as the god of thunder, rain, mountains, oak trees and the sky.
In Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and the sound of thunder comes from the chariot he rides across the sky. The lightning comes from his hammer Mjölnir.
In Finnish mythology, Ukko (engl. "Old Man") is the god of thunder, sky and weather. The Finnish word for thunder is "ukkonen", derived from the god's name.
In the Jewish religion, a blessing ""...He who does acts of creation"" is to be recited, upon sighting lightning. The Talmud refers to the Hebrew word for the sky, ("Shamaim") – as built from fire and water ("Esh Umaim"), since the sky is the source of the inexplicable mixture of "fire" and water that come together, during rainstorms. This is mentioned in various prayers and discussed in writings of Kabbalah.
In Islam, the Quran states: ""He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunder-bolts and smiteth with them whom He will."" (Qur'an 13:12–13) and, ""Have you not seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it..."" (Quran, 24:43). The preceding verse, after mentioning clouds and rain, speaks about hail and lightning, ""...And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills.""
In India, the Hindu god Indra is considered the god of rains and lightning and the king of the Devas.
In Japan, the Shinto god Raijin is considered the god of lightning and thunder. He is depicted as a demon who strikes a drum to create lightning.
In the traditional religion of the African Bantu tribes, such as the Baganda and Banyoro of Uganda, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. The Baganda specifically attribute the lightning phenomenon to the god Kiwanuka, one of the main trio in the Lubaale gods of the sea or lake. Kiwanuka starts wild fires, strikes trees and other high buildings, and a number of shrines are established in the hills, mountains and plains to stay in his favor. Lightning is also known to be invoked upon one's enemies by uttering certain chants, prayers, and making sacrifices.
Ceraunoscopy.
Ceraunoscopy is divination by observing lightning or by listening to thunder. It is a type of aeromancy. People have also sought to control lightning by conducting rituals or casting spells.

Kozice, Kočevje

Kozice (; also "Parga", or "Kositzenberg", Gottscheerish: "Afn Pargə") is an abandoned former village in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Spodnji Log.
Name.
The name "Kozice" has been explained as referring to Kozice Ridge south of the settlement, imagined to look like a goat (from Slovene "koza" 'goat'). The name "Parga" has been explained as derived from Slovene "prga" 'that which rakes (up)'. However, compare Gottscheerish "parc, parge" 'hill, mountain'.
History.
Kozice was a Gottschee German village. It was not yet mentioned in the land registry of 1576, but by 1824 it had seven houses, and in 1890 eight houses with a population of 43, all ethnically Slovene. The original Gottschee German inhabitants had gradually moved away. In 1931 it had five houses and eight Slovene residents. The village burned in 1931, after which a farmer named Kalčič built a house and barn at the site. At that point it had not belonged to the ethnic German enclave of Gottschee for a considerable time. The settlement was listed as abandoned in 1937.
Church.
The ruins of a chapel of ease dedicated to the Prophet Elijah and the Holy Spirit are located in a sparse beech forest above the former village. The building probably predated the mid-17th century. The church was struck by lightning before the Second World War and its roof burned. The church is difficult to reach, and so after the war it was not crushed into road gravel like other churches in the Gottschee region and its stones were not removed for building material.

Bunce–Deddens algebra

In C*-algebras, a Bunce–Deddens algebra is a certain type of direct limit of matrix algebras over the continuous functions on the circle. They are therefore examples of simple unital AT algebras. In the inductive system defining these algebras, the connecting maps between each stage are given by embeddings between families of shift operators with periodic weights.
Each inductive system defining a Bunce–Deddens algebra is associated with a "supernatural number", which is a complete invariant for these algebras. In the language of K-theory, the supernatural number correspond to the "K"0 group of the algebra. Also, Bunce–Deddens algebras can be expressed as the C*-crossed product of the Cantor set with a certain natural minimal action, so-called "odometer action". They also admit a unique tracial state. Together with the fact that they are AT, this implies they have real rank zero.
In a broader context of the classification program for simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, AT-algebras of real rank zero were shown to be completely classified by their K-theory, the Choquet simplex of tracial states, and the natural pairing between "K"0 and traces. The classification of Bunce–Deddens algebras is thus a precursor to the general result.
It is also known that, in general, crossed products arising from minimal homeomorphism on the Cantor set are simple AT-algebras of real rank zero.
Definition and basic properties.
Definition.
Let "C"( T ) denote continuous functions on the circle and "Mr"("C"(T)) be the C*-algebra of "r" × "r" matrices with entries in "C"(T). For a supernatural number {"n""k"}, the corresponding Bunce–Deddens algebra "B"({"n""k"}) is the direct limit:
One needs to define the embeddings
These imbedding maps arise from the natural embeddings between C*-algebras generated by shifts with periodic weights. For integers "n" and "m", we define an embedding "β" : "Mn"("C"(T)) → "Mnm"("C"(T)) as follows. On a separable Hilbert space "H", consider the C*-algebra "W"("n") generated by weighted shifts of fixed period "n" with respect to a fixed basis. "W"("n") embedds into "W"("nm") in the obvious way; any "n"-periodic weighted shift is also a "nm"-periodic weighted shift. "W"("n") is isomorphic to "Mn"("C"*("Tz")), where "C"*("Tz") denotes the Toeplitz algebra. Therefore "W" contains the compact operators as an ideal, and modulo this ideal it is "Mn"("C"(T)). Because the map from "W"("n") into "W"("nm") preserves the compact operators, it descends into an embedding "β" : "Mn"("C"(T)) → "Mnm"("C"(T)). It is this embedding that is used in the definition of Bunce–Deddens algebras.
The connecting maps.
The "βk"'s can be computed more explicitly and we now sketch this computation. This will be useful in obtaining an alternative characterization description of the Bunce–Deddens algebras, and also the classification of these algebras.
The C*-algebra "W"("n") is in fact singly generated. A particular generator of "W"("n") is the weighted shift "T" of period with periodic weights ½, …, ½, 1, ½, …, ½, 1, …. In the appropriate basis of "H", "T" is represented by the "n" × "n" operator matrix
where "Tz" is the unilateral shift. A direct calculation using functional calculus shows that the C*-algebra generated by "T" is "Mn"("C"*("Tz")), where "C"*("Tz") denotes the Toeplitz algebra, the C*-algebra generated by the unilateral shift. Since it is clear that "Mn"("C"*("Tz")) contains "W"("n"), this shows "W"("n") = "Mn"("C"*("Tz")).
From the Toeplitz short exact sequence,
one has,
where "i" is the entrywise embedding map and "j" the entrywise quotient map on the Toeplitz algebra. So the C*-algebra "M nk "("C" (T)) is singly generated by
where the scalar entries denote constant functions on the circle and "z" is the identity function.
For integers "nk" and "n""k" + 1, where "nk" divides "n""k" + 1, the natural embedding of "W"("nk") into "W"("n""k" + 1) descends into an (unital) embedding from 
"Mnk"("C"(T)) into "M" "n""k" + 1("C"(T)). This is the connecting map "βk" from the definition of the Bunce–Deddens algebra that we need to analyze.
For simplicity, assume "nk" = "n" and "n""k" + 1 = 2"nk". 
The image of the above operator "T" ∈ "W"("n") under the natural embedding is the following 2"n" × 2"n" operator matrix in "W"(2"n"):
Therefore the action of the "βk" on the generator is
A computation with matrix units yields that
and
where
So
In this particular instance, "βk" is called a twice-around embedding. The reason for the terminology is as follows: as "z" varies on the circle, the eigenvalues of Z2 traces out the two disjoint arcs connecting 1 and -1. An explicit computation of eigenvectors shows that the circle of unitaries implementing the diagonalization of Z2 in fact connect the beginning and end points of each arc. So in this sense the circle gets wrap around twice by Z2. In general, when "n""k" + 1 = "m"·"n""k", one has a similar "m"-times around embedding.
K-theory and classification.
Bunce–Deddens algebras are classified by their "K"0 groups. Because all finite-dimensional vector bundles over the circle are homotopically trivial, the "K"0 of "Mr"("C"(T)), as an ordered abelian group, is the integers Z with canonical ordered unit "r". According to the above calculation of the connecting maps, given a supernatural number {"nk"}, the "K"0 of the corresponding Bunce–Deddens algebra is precisely the corresponding dense subgroup of the rationals Q.
As it follows from the definition that two Bunce–Deddens algebras with the same supernatural number, in the sense that the two supernatural numbers formally divide each other, are isomorphic, "K"0 is a complete invariant of these algebras.
It also follows from the previous section that the "K"1 group of any Bunce–Deddens algebra is Z.
As a crossed product.
C*-crossed product.
A C*-dynamical system is a triple ("A", "G", "σ"), where "A" is a C*-algebra, "G" a group, and "σ" an action of "G" on "A" via C*-automorphisms. A covariant representation of ("A", "G", "σ") is a representation "π" of "A", and a unitary representation "t" formula_13 "Ut" of "G", on the same Hilbert space, such that
for all "a", "t".
Assume now "A" is unital and "G" is discrete. The (C*-)crossed product given by ("A", "G", "σ"), denoted by
is defined to be the C*-algebra with the following universal property: for any covariant representation ("π", "U"), the C*-algebra generated by its image is a quotient of
Odometer action on Cantor set.
The Bunce–Deddens algebras in fact are crossed products of the Cantor sets with a natural action by the integers Z. Consider, for example, the Bunce–Deddens algebra of type 2∞. Write the Cantor set "X" as sequences of 0's and 1's,
with the product topology. Define a homeomorphism
by
where + denotes addition with carryover. This is called the odometer action. The homeomorphism "α" induces
an action on "C"("X") by pre-composition with "α". The Bunce–Deddens algebra of type 2∞ is isomorphic to the resulting crossed product.

Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity &amp; Ecosystem Services

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is a science policy intergovernmental platform that was established on 21 April 2012 as an interface between the scientific community and policymakers to build capacity for and strengthen the use of science in policy making and address gaps in the science-policy interface on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
IPBES was established to provide an ongoing mechanism on biodiversity and ecosystem services, recognized by both the scientific and policy communities to bring information together and synthesize and analyse it for decision making in a range of policy fora such as the global environmental conventions and development policy dialogues.
Member States.
Members of the platform include:
Functions.
The Platform’s objective is to strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development, with the following functions: 
Operations.
UN member states present at the second session of a plenary meeting on IPBES requested the secretariat of UNEP to facilitate the Platform until the secretariat of the Platform is established, with a view to its being administered by one or more of the following: UNEP, UNESCO, FAO and UNDP
Operating principles.
It was agreed at the Panama meeting that in carrying out its work the Platform will be guided by the following operating principles:
It was also agreed that the Platform’s efficiency and effectiveness will be independently reviewed and evaluated on a periodic basis as decided by the Plenary, with adjustments to be made as necessary.
Funding.
A core trust fund to be allocated by the Plenary will be established to receive voluntary contributions from Governments, as well as from United Nations bodies, the Global Environment Facility, other intergovernmental organizations and other stakeholders such as the private sector and foundations. The platform will also accept additional voluntary contributions towards specific activities of the Platform's work programme.
Location.
On 19 April 2012, member states in attendance at the Panama meeting voted that the seat of the secretariat of the platform would be located in Bonn, Germany.
History.
Specific discussions on IPBES started following the final meeting of the multi-stakeholder international steering committee for the consultative process on an International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity (IMoSEB) in November 2007. The consultation towards IMoSEB decided to invite the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - in collaboration with governments and other partners - to convene an intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder meeting to consider the establishment of an intergovernmental mechanism for biodiversity and ecosystem services. There was also consensus among the stakeholders involved in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) follow-up initiative that the follow up to the IMoSEB process and the MA follow-up process should merge. It was the coming together of the MA follow up process with the follow up to the IMoSEB consultations that led to the process on IPBES.
Three intergovernmental and multistakeholders meetings (Malaysia 2008, Kenya 2009, Republic of Korea 2010) were held to discuss ways to strengthen the science-policy interface on biodiversity and ecosystem services. At the first two meetings, the gaps and needs for strengthening the science policy interface were identified, and at the meeting in June 2010, in Busan, Republic of Korea, governments decided that an IPBES should be established, agreed on the broad areas of its work programme, and agreed on many of the principles of its operation as part of the Busan Outcome.
The Busan Outcome was welcomed by the 10th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Nagoya in October 2010, and was subsequently considered at the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). UNGA passed a resolution requesting UNEP to convene a plenary meeting to fully operationalize IPBES at the earliest opportunity. This resolution was then taken on board by UNEP in a decision at the 26th session of the UNEP Governing Council meeting, held in February 2011.

Jannicke Systad Jacobsen

Jannicke Systad Jacobsen was born in 1975 and grew up in Høvik, a suburb in Norway. Systad Jacobsen is a screenwriter and director. She has studied film directing at The National Film School of the Czech Republic, as well as Social Anthropology and Theatre Studies at Oslo University. Systad Jacobsen has also studied at London international Film School.
Career.
Systad Jacobsen has directed many documentaries. Systad Jacobsen has said that she thoroughly plans and write scripts for her documentaries, influenced by her study of fiction film. She has recently turned to features in order to control more of the process, but still keep the sensitivity of working with real people.
"Turn me on, dammit!" was Jacobsen's first fiction feature film. It had its world premiere in 2011 at New York’s Tribeca Film Festival, where it won an award for Best Screenplay. Jacobsen wrote the screenplay, based on a book by Olaug Nilssen. Systad Jacobsen chose to cast teenagers who had grown up in a small city in the movie, instead of city kids. These teenagers were not actors. Marianne Bakke, the cinematographer of the movie, was previously a still photographer.
"Turn me on, dammit!" introduces Alma, a teenage girl growing up in a small town in Norway, living with her mom, by a shot of her lying on the kitchen floor. Next to her on the kitchen floor lies a telephone from which the voice of a phone-sex operator comes. Alma talks with the voice while masturbating. Alma has a rich imagination, and the person taking up the biggest part of that imagination is Artur, her classmate and neighbor. At a party, Artur finally approaches her with what seems to be sexual intentions and Alma tells her friends about it, but they don’t believe her. Her peers, including her closest friends, refuse to talk to her and leave her out in the cold. 
The rumor spreads fast, and soon everyone has a mean nickname for her. While on the bus, passing the sign with the name of her hometown, Alma and her friend used to raise their middle-finger to it, to show their dislike. Alma is now left alone with her dislike of her hometown.
The movie portrays young female sexuality with humor and with playfulness.
"The Clown Children" (Klovnebarna) is a documentary about two young boys who make money by dressing up as clowns and showing tricks for people in the cars at a crossing in Guatemala City. 
Systad Jacobsen wrote the script for it, as well as directed it.
Sandman - the story of a socialist Superman
Sandman - the story of a socialist Superman is a documentary directed by Systad Jacobsen about "Sandmann", a character from a television show for children in Germany. It reflects upon the ideology and history of socialism. The documentary participated in "Norwegian Documentary Film Festival Volda (2005), Norwegian Short Film Festival Grimstad (2005), Uppsala Int'l Short Film Festival (2005), M-DOX Malmö, Sweden (2005), Grenzland Filmtage (2006) and Kristiansand International Children's Film Festival (2006).
The War on Paranoia (Kampen mot paranoia)
The War on Paranoia is a short film directed by Systad Jacobsen, released in August 2003. It reflects upon the actions of the American Embassy in Oslo that took place after the September 11 attacks. It participated in many film festivals, such as the Political Incorrect Film Festival in Ljubliana, the World Wide Short Film Festival in Toronto (2004) and the Festival on Wheels in Turkey.
"Frimerket og fyret" is a documentary portraying the infrastructure in Norway, released in 2002. Systad Jacobsen wrote the manuscript, directed it and produced it. It was screened in several festivals internationally, such as Festival Cinema Delle Donne (Italy, 2003), International Documentary Film Festival Munchen (Germany, 2003), Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival (Czech Republic, 2003), and Message to Man (Russia, 2003).
Awards and Nominations.
Turn me on, dammit! won the award for Best Screenplay in the world at New York's Tribeca Film Festival. 
The movie had six nominations for Amandaprisen in the following categories: Best Norwegian Film, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Music.
Sandman - the story of a socialist Superman was nominated for Gullrutten in 2006, in the category for Best Tv Documentary.

Steward Ho for "M.net" noted that the group were about to "ditch their younger image and look more like empowered woman".
Composition.
The album contains four songs in total plus an instrumental version of the title track. The group once again worked with Han Jae Ho and Kim Seung Soo along with Sweetune who produced most of the group's past material. The title track, "Pandora", is a synth-pop dance track.
Release and promotion.
The group will be holding a showcase to celebrate the release of the mini-album at the Seoul Walkerhill Hotel on August 22. The showcase was also streamed live at M.net Global's website. The group's agency also stated that the members are devoting themselves towards the promotion of the album in South Korea.
The group began their weekly promotions for the album starting on KBS' Music Bank where they performed some of the album's songs including the title track "Pandora" and "Miss U".
A promotional truck that was entirely covered with the album's jacket cover traveled through various cities in South Korea including Seoul, Gangnam, Hongdae, Itaewon and Myungdong.
Chart performance.
Following the EP's release, its title track managed to top several popular music sites such as MelOn, Mnet, and Olleh Music. Throughout the day, the members of the group also become the most searched terms on several popular Korean search engines which includes Naver and Daum. The EP debuted at the position number 104 in Japan's "Oricon" albums chart only with importation of the EP from South Korea.

William II, Lord of Egmond

William II, Lord of Egmond or Willem II, heer van Egmond ( – 30 March 1304) was a ruling Lord of Egmond.
Life.
He was the son of Gerard, Lord of Egmond and an unknown mother, possibly Beatrix, daughter of Wouter of Haarlem, or Mabilia. He became Lord of Egmond after his father's death around Christmas 1242. Because he was still underaged, he was supervised by a regent, his second cousin Walter / Wouter "Stoutkind" ("naughty child") van Egmont until 1248.
In 1258, he transferred the ambachtsheerlijkheden of Spanbroek, Oudedorp, Oudkarspel and Wadeweij to Count Floris V of Holland. In return he is enfeoffed with the heerlijkheid of Warmhuizen. He purchased some territory to the North of Egmond, near Huisduinen and Bergen and starts to develop this area in the following years.
Willem participated in a campaign against Friesland in 1282 and was rewarded with tithes from the heerlijkheid of Hemert. John I, Count of Holland invited him over for John's wedding to Elizabeth of Rhuddlan in 1297. Later in the year William's wife died, and Gerard, his only son, died in 1300. Upon his death in 1304, he was succeeded by his grandson, William II.

Asker Dzhappuyev

Asker Dzhappuyev also known as Emir Abdullah, was the leader of the Jihadist United Vilayat of Kabarda-Balkaria-Karachai organisation in the Russian Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. 
An ethnic Balkar, Dzhappuyev became the emir of Vilayat of Kabarda-Balkaria-Karachai in 16 May 2010 following the killing of his predecessor, Anzor Astemirov, by the Russian security services. Under Dzhappuyev's command, there was a substantial increase in the number of attacks carried out by the United Vilayat of Kabarda-Balkaria-Karachai. While he encouraged his fighters to avoid civilian casualties, other young commanders like Ratmir Shameyev were more radical.
Among the attacks carried out in Kabardino-Balkaria during his tenure was a raid on the Baksan hydroelectric power station and the assassinations of the Kabardino-Balkaria mufti Anas Pshikhachev and the prominent ethnographer Aslan Tsipinov.
On 29 April 2011, Dzhappuyev was amongst 10 militants, including Emir Abdul Jabbar of the North Eastern Sector and Emir Zakaria of the South Western Sector, killed by security forces in the village of Progress in Stavropol Krai. Caucasus Emirate leader Dokka Umarov appointed Alim Zankishiev as his successor.

Acid perfusion test, also called the Bernstein test, is a test done to reproduce the pain when the lower esophagus is irrigated with an acid solution in patients with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).
There will be a negative result in normal people.
Bernstein test is obsolete nowadays. 24 hour pH monitoring is the gold standard for GERD. However, the initial management is with proton pump inhibitors. If the patient does not respond to it, and continues to have symptoms of GERD, i.e. heartburn, hoarseness, chronic cough, then 24 hr pH monitoring should be considered.

The town is known for its agriculture produce, such as grain, legumes, olives and different types of fruit. The city of Anadan is build on a hill surrounded by a plain. Anadan currently has about thirteen mosques and several elementary schools, a junior high school and a high schools for boy and girls.
During the Ayyubid period, in the 1220s, Anadan was visited by Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi who noted it was "a village near Kinnasrin, in the Kurah district of Urtik, of the Awasim Province." The 13th-century "Marasid" listed it as a village northeast of Aleppo.
Syrian Civil War.
The Battle of Anadan occurred in Anadan from July 29–30, 2012, during the Syrian civil war.
It has been the site of heavy shelling by the Syrian military during the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. Consequently, approximately 30,000 people—most of Anadan's population—have fled according to opposition sources. As a result, Anadan has been described as a "ghost town" by journalist Suleiman al-Khalidi of "Reuters". Amnesty International released satellite images which show that Anadan has come under heavy artillery bombardment during the uprising.

1981 Playa Azul earthquake

The 1981 Playa Azul earthquake occurred on October 25, 1981 at 03:22 UTC (on October 24, 1981 at 21:22 local time). It was located near Playa Azul, Michoacán, Mexico. The magnitude of the earthquake was Mw 7.2, or Ms 7.3. Three deaths were reported, two from Michoacán and one from Mexico City. Some buildings were damaged in both Michoacán and Mexico City. A small tsunami was registered in Acapulco with a maximum height of 9 cm.
Tectonic setting.
The southwestern coast of Mexico lies above the convergent boundary where the Rivera Plate and Cocos Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate along the Middle America Trench. The area is seismically very active with large thrust type earthquakes occurring along the plate interface and normal fault type earthquakes occurring at a somewhat deeper level within the descending slab. The plate interface seismicity in this area is strongly segmented, with separate Jalisco, Michoacán, Guerrero and Colima segments being recognised. The southeastern end of the Michoacan segment coincides with the broad Orozco fracture zone within the Cocos Plate. During the 1970s, with no major earthquakes recorded since at least 1911, the segment was recognised as a major seismic gap.
Earthquake.
This earthquake was an interplate earthquake that occurred in the central part of the Michoacán seismic gap. The 1985 Michoacán earthquake broke the two remaining parts of the Michoacán gap, i.e. those to the north and south of the 1981 Playa Azul earthquake rupture zone. The 1981 Playa Azul earthquake had a focal mechanism of reverse faulting from a shallow-dipping thrust fault. The maximum slip of this earthquake was estimated to be about 4.04 m. According to the calculation of C. Mendoza, along the dipping interface the area of maximum slip was concentrated below the hypocenter, and there was another area of significant slip, of about , above the hypocenter.
Damage.
Michoacan suffered widespread damage with some buildings also affected in Mexico City. There were 2 deaths and 17 people injured in Michoacán and 1 death and 11 people injured in Mexico City. One source reports a total of 9 deaths associated with this earthquake.
Power outages and telephone service interruptions were widespread in Mexico City. Thousands of people got stuck in darkness in the Mexico City Metro.

A medicinal plant, "dulcis" is used to treat diabetes in India and hypertension in Taiwan. In Brazil it has been used to treat various problems such as hemorrhoids and wounds, while it is used to manage sickle-cell disease in Nigeria and applied to a wide range of problems in Nicaragua, including anemia, burns and headaches. It is also used to protect the stomach from ulcers caused by indomethacin. 
In the laboratory, extracts of the plant have been shown to have antihyperglycemic, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties Scoparinol, an isolate of the plant, was shown to have analgesic, diuretic, and antiinflammatory activity, as well. Other active principles in the plant have been called scoparic acid, scopadulcic acid, scopadulciol, and scopadulin.
Despite its treatment as a weed in many parts of Bangladesh, "duclis"'s medicinal uses have led to overexploitation.. The plant is also found as a weed in Florida citrus groves.

Hunter High School (Scotland)

__NOTOC__ 
Hunter High School was a non-denominational secondary school which served the Calderwood, East Mains and parts of the St. Leonards and Stewartfield areas of the East Kilbride new town from 1963 to 2007. The school started as a four year Secondary school and was extended in 1966 prior to amalgamation with the old East Kilbride Village school to form a full six-year Comprehensive. In 2008, it merged with Claremont High School to form the new Calderglen High School.
History.
Hunter High School takes its name from the anatomist and physician William Hunter (1718 – 1783) and his younger brother, the surgeon John Hunter (1728 – 1793) who were both born nearby at Long Calderwood.
Architecture.
The building was designed by the Lanarkshire County architect, David Gordon Bannerman (1908-1986), and was officially opened on 16 December 1963 by John Gordon, the first-ever Provost of East Kilbride. It was the first secondary school in Lanarkshire built with specific provisions for courses leading to the "O" level certificate.
At the opening ceremony, Provost Gordon praised the architects and builders for the fine job they had done and expressed that in his opinion the new building was already out of date because he felt that ""...in the era of sputniks and moon rockets, while the school had many wonderful features, it could have been equipped with the modern closed circuit television equipment, to enable the streamlining of teaching.""
By 1968, the school building had been extended to accommodate the improved Higher Learning Certificate syllabus. 
Closure.
Hunter High was one of four former East Kilbride school sites sold to Barratt Developments by Amec, who had purchased the land from South Lanarkshire Council in 2007 as part of the local authority’s schools’ modernisation programme. Due to economic uncertainty, the abandoned building fell into an advanced state of dereliction and was later demolished in September 2009. The site was later redeveloped by Barratt along with Persimmon Homes under the marketing title "Gamekeepers Wynd".

Radioactive (Rita Ora song)

"Radioactive" is a song recorded by British recording artist Rita Ora, released as the fourth overall single from her debut studio album, "Ora" (2012). The single was released on 11 February 2013. The song was co-written by Sia Furler and Greg Kurstin, while the latter also produced the cut.
Background and composition.
In July 2012, it was announced that "Radioactive" would serve as the third single from "Ora" in the United States. In November 2012, it was confirmed that "Radioactive" would serve as the fourth single from "Ora" in the United Kingdom. The cover artwork for the song was revealed on 9 January 2013. It features Ora against a backdrop of colorful stars. Sia Furler and Greg Kurstin wrote the song, while Greg Kurstin was the producer.
Critical reception.
"Radioactive" received favorable reviews from music critics. According to a reviewer of "Metro", "Radioactive is a dancefloor-ready track that is more about the beat than the lyrics or any deeper meaning behind them". An example is when she sings: "‘I’m checking you out in your sweet desire/I’m coming over to make you mine/It’s a crime boy, you’re so fine/I’m taking you out, boy, it’s a green light/I’m glad you came over, it was about time/It feels right, boy you’re so fine".
Scott Kara from "New Zealand Herald" found it a highlight on the album and called it a "serenade" track. Robert Corpsey from "Digital Spy" said he sees her in "Guetta-style dancefloor mode". He found the song a highlight on the album. Jon O'Brien from "Yahoo! Music" called it a "gleaming neo-disco number". Laurence Green from "MusicOMH" was very positive towards his statements of the song, calling it a "David Guetta-esque euro-techno" song and branded it "excellent".
"Entertainment Focus" gave it an acclaimed review, awarding the song five stars out of five, saying "This is such a catchy track that will be sure to blow up the charts and we are sure that it will also be a massive smash in the club land too [...] This is the perfect song to stick on whilst getting ready for a big Friday night out. Well done Rita Ora, this is simply a fantastic song that will appeal to most that hear it and it makes us want to get our party shoes on!". A reviewer from "musiceyz.co.uk" stated personally: "it’s my favourite song that Rita Ora has released and I have heard by her so far, there is just something about it that makes it so easy to listen to. The simplicity of it is what makes it so big".
Chart performance.
"Radioactive" was released in UK on 11 February 2013 as the fourth single from "Ora". It reached No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was serviced to Australian radio only four weeks after "Shine Ya Light", and has peaked at No. 73 on the "Australian Radio Airplay Chart".
It was released as the third single from "Ora" in the US on 26 February 2013 via digital download .
Music video.
The music video, directed by Syndrome, premiered on YouTube on 10 December 2012, at a total length of four minutes and twenty-two seconds. The music video features intense animation and graphics, along with futuristic fashion and robotics. There are several different scenarios in the video; the first one, Ora stands in a nuclear cloud and forms the word "Radioactive" whilst animated rings circle her; the next she is in a chair in a barren wasteland, which is made to look like it has been destroyed by a nuclear explosion, and there are two men in gasmaks holding torn flags; the next, we see Ora in a high-tech room, with animated figures of people being created and a rotating head of Ora with animatronic parts; and the last scene, Ora is riding through a tunnel on a motorbike. On 18 December 2012, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on her official VEVO page.

Shine Ya Light

"Shine Ya Light" is a song recorded by British recording artist Rita Ora, and released as the third overall single from her debut studio album, "Ora". The song was released in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2012, in the form of a digital download. It was written by Chris Loco, Fraser T Smith, Laura Pergolizzi and produced by Fraser T Smith and Chris Loco. Ora performed the song on "The X Factor" on 4 November 2012 and on "" on 16 November 2012.
Background and composition.
After reaching three consecutive number ones in the UK Singles Chart with DJ Fresh's "Hot Right Now" as well as with her singles "R.I.P." (featuring Tinie Tempah) and "How We Do (Party)", Ora announced on her official Twitter that the third single from her UK No.1 debut album, "Ora", will be "Shine Ya Light". 
Chris Loco, Fraser T Smith and Laura Pergolizzi wrote the song, while Chris Loco and Fraser T Smith were the producers.
Chart performance.
"Shine Ya Light" was released as a single on 4 November 2012. It reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart, giving Ora her third UK top-ten single from her debut album, and fourth overall in 2012.
Music video.
The music video for the track was filmed in Ora's city of birth, Pristina, Kosovo, and was released on Vevo on 27 October 2012. Ora explained why she chose this location for her video, saying "I was born in a little city called Pristina which no one really knows about, so I’m proud to kind of put it on the map out there a little bit because we are a very patriotic country so we always try and mention us wherever we can because it’s such a great place". Speaking about the video (directed by Emil Nava), Ora said "The whole country was outside... I got off the plane, it was like millions of heads. I couldn't see the floor. I'm not even exaggerating. It was the most surrealest experience I've ever felt. It was more than a music video. was a moment in our history as Kosovo, it was a moment for people to see us: how we live, our landscape. It was my duty to do my video there". In the video, Ora is shown riding with a flank of bikers and gigging for excited hometown crowds in various places, such as the Newborn monument.
The single was also used to make the musical documentary "Columbia's 28". This short film, premiered on YouTube in December 2012, tells the story of the Space Shuttle Columbia's 28 missions. Filmmaker Salem Hanna chose "Shine Ya Light" as the basis for the video after hearing it on his car radio whilst wondering what music could evoke the soaring spirit of spaceflight, and was particularly drawn to the power of the lyrics as a way to describe cutting edge scientific research.

Kim Seong-Eun (; born 24 February 1989 in Seoul) is a South Korean long-distance runner who competes in marathon races. She represented her country at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Her personal best for the marathon is 2:27:20 hours, set in 2013.
Career.
She started out doing middle- and long-distance track as a teenager and broke the South Korean indoor record for the 3000 metres at the 2005 Asian Indoor Games, taking the silver medal behind India's O. P. Jaisha. She established herself nationally in 2006 at the age of seventeen by winning the 5000 metres national title and placing second over 1500 metres. She ran in both the 3000 m and 5000 m at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics and finished 15th and tenth, respectively. She also made her debut over the half marathon that year, winning a race in Incheon in March setting a best of 73:14 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in Japan.
Kim turned away from track running from 2009 onwards and focused on road running events instead. She attempted a marathon debut at the 2009 Seoul International Marathon but failed to finish the distance. She placed tenth in the half marathon at the Summer Universiade, and then came runner-up to Lee Sun-young at the JoongAng Seoul Marathon with a time of 2:37:30 hours. She only competed in two major competitions in 2010 but performed well: she ran a personal best of 71:34 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon and improved her marathon best to 2:29:27 at the Seoul International race, coming fifth.
Her marathon performances were enough to gain a place on the team for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, which was hosted on home soil in Daegu. There she came 28th in the championship marathon, Korea's best performer from their five-woman team. She ended the year with a 10,000 metres win at the Korean National Sports Festival, setting a personal best of 33:46.61 minutes. A fourth place finish in 2:29:53 hours at the 2012 Seoul International Marathon earned her a spot on the Olympic marathon team. At the 2012 London Olympics she placed 96th in the Olympic marathon with a time of 2:46:38.
At the 2013 Kagawa Marugame race she was two seconds off her half marathon best and a new marathon best followed shortly after at the Seoul International Marathon, where she was fourth overall and the first Korean with her run of 2:27:20 hours.

St Hilda's East Community Centre

St Hilda's East Community Centre is a charity based in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The centre is located in Bethnal Green and its second site, Sonali Gardens, is in Shadwell.
St Hilda's East Community Centre works with local people of all backgrounds, offering a wide range of activities. This includes advice services, youth projects, support for parents and pre-school children, work with older people, women’s projects, volunteering placement and carers’ respite.
It was originally founded as a settlement in 1889 by the Guild of Cheltenham Ladies' College.
History.
After its first building in Victoria Park Square proved unsuitable, St Hilda's East found a permanent base on Old Nichol Street near the newly built Boundary Estate in 1898.
In 1945, the settlement had also purchased another building across the road, Bruce Hall. The new building stood where St Hilda’s East is today on the corner of Old Nichol Street and Club Row.
In 1964, the building on Old Nichol Street was sold and all activities moved into the site on Club Row, which was extended in 1968. There were no more residents, no live-in Warden, and more paid staff were employed to run the centre. The buildings were replaced in 1994.
In 2005, St Hilda's became a two-site organisation when the Bengali Elders Day Centre moved to a purpose-built facility, Sonali Gardens, in Shadwell.
Current Work.
The community centre now offers a range of services and opportunities for local people of all ages and backgrounds, providing a resource for the community in the Weavers Ward in northwest Tower Hamlets, while also delivering borough wide social care services.
The work of St Hilda's East today broadly covers the areas of Older People and Care, Young People (including under 5s) and Women's Groups and Advice, Training and Resources (such as legal advice, a community archive, and training).

CGP Grey

C.G.P. Grey is an eponymous YouTube channel featuring short explanatory videos. The channel's first popular video was an explanation of the terminology of the British Isles, which went viral. The channel has also spawned several spin-offs, including a secondary channel, CGPGrey2, and a channel with playlists of Grey's favourite videos called greysfavs. In addition, Grey created the podcast Hello Internet with Brady Haran, creator of many well known educational YouTube channels.
Videos.
The channel provides, among other things, Grey Explains, which is a series of explanatory videos on a range of subjects, including politics, geography, economics and British culture. The videos feature Grey, narrating over animations and still photographs. The backing music is usually credited to Kevin MacLeod. While nearly all of Grey's videos feature his voice, Grey himself has never been filmed or photographed within his own videos (except his hands), and always has his face obscured when appearing in other people's videos; he often uses a stick figure with glasses to represent himself. His videos also often include hidden links, often leading to Monty Python videos. Many of his videos feature pop culture references such as items from the video game Minecraft and Bitcoin logos shown as analogous to money.
Grey uses Final Cut Pro X to edit and add animations to his videos and records his voice over the music playing in the background on GarageBand. Videos are released on the channel significantly less frequently than other YouTubers; Grey has said that this is due to careful rigor, with around one-in-three videos never being finished. His video debunking popular misconceptions has been featured on CBS. Two videos differentiate London, England and the City of London, while explaining certain oddities that arise from the ancient customs of the latter. Another two videos explaining copyright law and The Electoral College have been featured on Mashable. The channel has also explained the economic disadvantages of U.S. one-cent coins, in another viral video, "Death to Pennies". The video "How to Become Pope" also went viral.
Several videos explain some differences between various election procedures, and are critical of first-past-the-post voting (gerrymandering, minority rule, lack of Condorcet winner, two-party system, spoiler effect) and discussing the relative advantages of the alternative vote and mixed-member proportional representation.

Association against Bulgarian Bandits

The Association against Bulgarian Bandits () was a paramilitary organization based in Štip, then in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. 
During the World War I the Serbian Army and Chetnik movement were in conflict with the Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and Army, which occupied most of Serbia and Macedonia. Bands of Chetniks organized the Toplica insurrection, which was quickly crushed by the Bulgarian soldiers and IMRO chetas. The post-war Treaty of Neuilly denied Bulgaria what it felt was its share of Macedonia and Pomoravlje. As result the state fell in a heavy situation having lost territory to Serbia, Greece and Romania with reparations to those countries. In the new formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the Chetnik movement ceased functioning as a guerrilla force. However, the IMRO began soon sending armed bands from Bulgaria into Serbian part of Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the Bulgarian part of the local population. Also in 1921 IMRO created as a satellite organisation the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation, which operated in the areas of Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad, ceded to Yugoslavia. In 1922 a new organization called Association against Bulgarian Bandits was lunched by a former Chetniks to withstand the IMRO and the IWORO militants in the areas of Vardar Macedonia and the Western Outlands with Kosta Pećanac as leading figure in it. In 1923 and 1924 during the apogee of interwar military activity according to IMRO statistics in the region of Yugoslav (Vardar) Macedonia operated 53 armed bands. The aggregate membership of the bands was 3245 rebels, 119 fights and 73 terroristic acts were documented. At the same time IWORO carried out numerous assaults on the Tzaribrod–Belgrade railway, especially on the bridges. Violent Serb counter-measures tended merely to cement the support to IMRO.
On the other hand, the reestablished in 1920 IMRO had its own left wing and it split over the ultimate goal of its activity. The right faction sought incorporation of all Macedonian territory into Bulgaria, while the left faction sought separate Macedonia that could join future Balkan Federation. In December 1921, left-leaning deserters of IMRO formed the official Macedonian Federative Organization. Violence between the two groups reinforced a political crisis growing public impression that Bulgarian government was unstable. Meanwhile the government started military campaign against the IMRO in the Summer of 1921 using the Federative Organization as ally. The Premier Aleksandar Stamboliyski proclaimed as his aim the forming a new Balkan Federation of agrarian states. In March 1923 he signed the Treaty of Niš with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO and IWORO carried out from Bulgarian territory. As result in the Summer of 1923, IMRO aided by radical officers organized coup d'état in Bulgaria. The fall of the pro-Yugoslav government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski was a great success to the power of IMRO. Subsequently part of the fleeing from Bulgaria federalists placed themselves in Serbian service, joining the Association against Bulgarian Bandits and fighting against IMRO. Serbian Prime Minister Ljubomir Davidovic openly disagreed with such policy but Zika Lazic, head of the team that mobilized such guerillas, responded he did not find a better mechanism for mutual annihilation between current and former Bulgarian Komitadjis.
As a consequence, aided unofficially by the new government, the IMRO acted as a "state within a state" in Bulgaria, which was used as its base for new hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia. Because of this, at the end of the 1920s the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier was turned into the most fortified one in Europe. The Serbian actions led to a significant reduction of the IMRO attacks. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. Afterwards the Association against Bulgarian Bandits was gradually dissolved.

Gaius Vettius Gratus Atticus Sabinianus

Gaius Vettius Gratus Atticus Sabinianus (fl. 3rd century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 242.
Biography.
A member of the newly established Patrician Gens Vetti, Atticus Sabinianus was probably the son of Gaius Vettius Gratus Sabinianus who was a Roman consul in AD 221. His career followed almost exactly that of his father’s. After serving as the "Quattuorvir viarum curandum" (responsible for the upkeep of Rome’s important roads) in around AD 228, he then had a brief turn in the military, serving as the "sevir equitum Romanorum" (or commander) of the 3rd "Turmae".
Returning to Rome, Atticus Sabinianus was selected as an imperial candidate for the office of Quaestor in around AD 234, followed by his nomination for the office of Praetor, probably around AD 239. He was possibly appointed to the role of "Praefectus frumenti dandi" (or Prefect responsible for the distribution of Rome’s free grain dole) in around AD 240.
Atticus Sabinianus’ next appointment was as the curator of the Via Flaminia, and included responsibility for the supply of food into Rome, probably in AD 241. He was then elected as "consul prior" alongside Gaius Asinius Lepidus Praetextatus in AD 242.
It has been speculated that Atticus Sabinianus was married to the sister of Gaius Asinius Lepidus Praetextatus and that they had a son who may have been the Virius Gratus who was consul in AD 280.

1 Thibault Square

1 Thibault Square, formally known as the LG Building and originally known as the BP Centre, is a 126.5 metre modernist skyscraper on the European-style Thibault Square at the end of St George’s Mall, Cape Town.
Work on the building began in 1969 and was completed in 1972. As of 2012 it is the tallest building in Cape Town and will be the second tallest once the Portside Tower is complete in 2014. The 34-degree diagonal twist, which puts it on a north-south axis, reduces sun loads on the façades, thereby reducing pressure on the air-conditioning system. To further shield the façades, a pre-cast screen is mounted on every floor, allowing good air flow and cutting off direct sun rays. This unique orientation also means that all the offices have views of either the mountain or the harbour, and that none stare straight into the façades of the surrounding buildings.
Flanked by John Skotness’s Mythological Landscape steel-and-bronze sculpture the piazza below is a favourite public space for office workers and visitors to the city, who flock to its cafe's and coffee shops throughout the day. The building provides a focal point for Thibault Square. In 2008 the building was acknowledged in a national survey by the South African Institute of Architecture to be one of the country’s "good buildings".

List of clubs in the 2. Bundesliga

This is a List of clubs in the 2. Bundesliga, including all clubs and their final placings from 1974–75 to 2013–14. The league is the second-highest football league in Germany and the German football league system. It replaced the Regionalligas as the second division in Germany in 1974. Initially played in a two-division format, north and south, it was merged into a single division in 1981 and has remained at this format ever since with the exception of the 1991–92 season, when the league was briefly split again to accommodate the influx of clubs from former East Germany.
Overview.
After the inroduction of the Fußball-Bundesliga in 1963 the second division was initially formed by five Regionalligas with a promotion round at the end. In 1974 this system was changed to two regional divisions which were named 2. Fußball-Bundesliga Süd and Nord. This halved the number of second division teams from a nominal number of 40 to 20. In the 1991–92 season the league was briefly split into a northern and southern division of 12 clubs each to allow for the entry of the East German clubs into the league system. Since 1992 the league has always operated as a single division, initially with 20 clubs, later with 18.

Douady–Earle extension

In mathematics, the Douady–Earle extension, named after Adrien Douady and Clifford Earle, is a way of extending homeomorphisms of the unit circle in the complex plane to homeomorphisms of the closed unit disk, such that the extension is a diffeomorphism of the open disk. The extension is analytic on the open disk. The extension has an important equivariance property: if the homeomorphism is composed on either side with a Möbius transformation preserving the unit circle the extension is also obtained by composition with the same Möbius transformation. If the homeomorphism is quasisymmetric, the diffeomorphism is quasiconformal. An extension for quasisymmetric homeomorphisms had previously been given by Ahlfors and Arne Beurling; a different equivariant construction had been given in 1985 by Pekka Tukia. Equivariant extensions have important applications in Teichmüller theory, for example they lead to a quick proof of the contractibility of the Teichmüller space of a Fuchsian group.
Definition.
By the Radó–Kneser–Choquet theorem, the Poisson integral "F""f" of a homeomorphism "f" of the circle defines a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk extending "f". If "f" is quasisymmetric, the extension is not necessarily quasiconformal, i.e. the complex dilatation
does not necessarily satisfy
have an upper bound strictly less than one.
On the other hand if "f" is quasi-Möbius and fixes 1, "i" and −"i", then "f" satisfies a Hölder continuity condition:
for another positive constant "C" independent of "f". The same is true for the "f"−1's. But then the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem implies these homeomorphisms form a compact subset in C(T). The non-linear functional Λ is continuous on this subset and therefore attains its upper bound at some "f"0. On the other hand Λ("f"0) < 1, so the upper bound is strictly less than 1.
The uniform Hölder estimate for "f" is established in as follows. Take "z", "w" in T.

John III Potho of Pothenstein

John III Potho of Pothenstein (also spelled "Pottenstein"; d. 1390) was Bishop of Bishopric of Münster from 1379 to 1382. He was then officially appointed Bishop of Schwerin, however, he was never able to actually exercise power there.
Life.
Potho was a member of a Czech-speaking Bohemian noble family based at Pottenstein Castle (now Potštejn in the Czech Republic). They were possibly related to the Bavarian Counts Palatine. It is not known whether he spoke German himself.
In 1356, he was appointed canon of the cathedral in Olomouc. In 1371, he was mentioned as Archdeacon in Prague and papal chaplain. He originally supported the Popes in Avignon, however, after King Wenceslaus proposed him as the next Bishop of Münster, he changed sides and support Pope Urban VI in Rome.
En route to Münster, Potho and his entourage was attacked near Hamm by the Count of the Marck. He lost his valuables and barely managed to evade being taken prisoner. King Wenceslaus tried in vain to exert his influence to have the stolen money returned.
Immediately after his arrival in Münster, he created several indulgences, with papal permission. He urged the faithful to try to acquire these. A diocesan synod was probably not held during his time in office. He was later described as greedy, however, contemporary documents suggest that he was genuinely interested in religious affairs.
On the other hand, he showed little interest in the castles in his territory. When he was short of money, he had to pledge Horstmar Castle to the Count of Hoya. He probably never signed a treaty with the Estates of his bishopric.
Potho took no notable initiatives for the temporal government of his bishopric. During his reign, Rheda was besieged by an alliance between Münster and several other bishops against the Counts of Tecklenburg, however, this alliance had already been created before his arrival. During his reign, a Public Peace was agreed, and a peace treaty was agreed with the counts of Tecklenburg. However, the dispute with Tecklenburg would erupt again shortly afterwards.
As he was unfamiliar with the political situation in his bishopric, the cathedral chapter tasked his provost Heidenreich Wolf of Lüdinghausen with the administration of the bishopric . It is not clear whether the chapter demanded his resignation. In any case, he realized that he was unable to fulfill his duties as prince-bishop and on 13 October 1382, he resigned. He recommended Rupert of Jülich-Berg as his successor, however, the chapter elected Lüdinghausen instead.
His contemporaries generally held a negative view of his performance. Several epigrams accuse him of greed and insobriety. One cause of his bad reputation may have been his lack of language skills. He did not understand the Low German dialect spoken in Münster and this made relations with his subjects problematic.
After his resignation in Münster, Potho moved to the episcopal see of Schwerin. At the time, Bützow Castle was the residence of the bishops of Schwerin. However, the cathedral chapter refused to recognize him and elected John IV Junge instead. John IV was murdered in 1389 by one of his captains. Even after John IV's death, Potho was unable to take up government. He lived in Stralsund until his death.
It is unknown where Potho was buried.

Mondo Sex Head is a remix album by Rob Zombie, containing remixes of the tracks of various past albums both by Zombie and his former band White Zombie. It was curated and executive produced by Jason Bentley. The original cover art depicted Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie. It caused controversy and was replaced by the image of a cat. Rob Zombie explained, "I never thought it would be a problem since it seemed tame to me... but it was. No one would carry the CD. Anything with death and violence is totally fine, but anything with sex, forget about it. So instead of censoring that cover and ruining it, I just removed the ass shot and replaced it with a pussy shot." Though the vinyl release remained unchanged with the original cover art.

Prior to the release of "Mondo Sex Head", two digital-only EPs were released that featured tracks from the full-length version in addition to exclusive bonus tracks.

James Wasserstrom is a US diplomat who currently serves as an anti-corruption officer at the US embassy in Kabul.
UN "whistleblower".
He was posted to Kosovo to fight corruption but in 2007 he witnessed misconduct involving UN officials and a local utility company. He later reportedly uncovered evidence that two senior UN officials had received bribes for awarding a contract for the building of a coal fired power plant and mine. After complaining to the UN's oversight office his job was effectively abolished and he was investigated for misconduct. Wasserstrom then went to the UN's Ethics Office where it was eventually ruled that he was maltreated but that this did not count as retaliation against a whistleblower.
After a lengthy legal battle, documents backing his version of events were uncovered and the UN's Dispute Tribunal overturned the original decision. Whilst a judgement was not made on the alleged corruption in the UN's Kosovo mission, it was decided that the UN's original evidence was conflicted and that the mechanisms for dealing with whistleblowers within the UN were fundamentally flawed. United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the UN personnel tribunal, despite repeated orders by the tribunal to do so.
Wasserstrom has been critical of the pace of reform in the UN and also of Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon for allegedly undermining support for whistleblowers by trying to limit the jurisdiction of the UN dispute tribunal.

He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music in 2004 for a significant contribution to the music profession.
Life and career.
Shearman studied composition and arranging with Nick Ingman and conducting with Denise Ham at the Royal Academy of Music, where he won the Eric Coates prize for light composition. In his final year of studies, as part of the Academy’s annual music festival, he was commissioned to compose a piece honouring the career of legendary film composer John Williams. The piece was premiered to John Williams himself, by the Royal Academy of Music Symphony orchestra as part of the British Film Festival 1996. 
It was during this period of study that Shearman, at the age of 22, established a professional reputation for himself as a skilful orchestrator. He assisted and co-orchestrated for TV and Film composers on projects such as the hit TV Series Cracker (UK TV series) (1995), and films "Othello" (1995) and "Wind In the Willows" (1996). Upon graduation, Shearman was immediately hired to composed soundtracks for TV commercials, as well as supplying string arrangements and conducting for popular recording artists such as Gary Barlow (Twelve Months, Eleven Days. Album 1999), Connor Reeves Earthbound (Conner Reeves album), and Oasis.
1997 saw the beginning of what was to become a longstanding collaboration with Academy Award nominated composer Patrick Doyle. Shearman was asked to supply arrangements of Doyle’s music for his score for Great Expectations (1998 film) (1997), directed by Alfonso Cuaron. The success of this led to him supplying further Arrangements and orchestrations for Doyle’s next movie, Quest for Camelot (1998), where he worked on both the arrangements of songs for the movie, written by David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager, and co-orchestrated Doyle’s score along with Larry Ashmore (Doyle’s long time orchestrator from 1989) at the 20th century fox studios in Los Angeles.
Shortly after returning from Los Angeles, Shearman was approached to compose his first feature film score The Misadventures of Margaret (1998), a romantic comedy directed by Brian Skeet and starring Parker Posey, Jeremy Northam and Brooke Shields. The film gave Shearman an opportunity to compose a quirky, melodic score, which he also orchestrated and conducted. The score was recorded by the London Session Orchestra at Air Lyndhurst Studios, London.
Numerous orchestrations and the conducting of scores for films continued, most notably, "Shakespeare in Love" (1998) music by Stephen Warbeck, Les Misérables (1998 film) music by Basil Poledouris, Mansfield Park (film) (1999) music by Lesley Barber, Lost Souls (film) (2000) music by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek and Bridget Jones's Diary (film) (2001) music by Patrick Doyle.
In 2000 Shearman, along with long-term songwriting collaborator Sam Babenia, had notable commercial success as a songwriter, co-writing (with Simon Greenaway) Dream a Dream for Charlotte Church. Based on the melody of Faure’s Pavane, the song became the title track of the album and as of Dec 5, 2008 Dream a dream had accumulated sales of 1,630,00 copies in the U.S. alone, according to SoundScan, and certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Dream a Dream also featured on the album "Prelude", a ‘best of’ album by Charlotte Church, released in 2002. With Babenia, he also co-wrote, arranged and produced the song Prayer in the Night for Amici Forever, a band of four classically trained singers who mixed opera with pop music. Prayer in the Night became the album’s (The Opera Band) much featured song and was performed at the Classical BRIT Awards where the album was nominated for ‘Album of the Year’ 2004.
Shearman collaborated with Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, conducting the epic symphony orchestra and choir backing for the Platinum selling album Once Once (Nightwish album) (2004) and continuing this role on subsequent albums Dark Passion Play (2007) and Imaginaerum (2011). 
As a Conductor, in 2004 Shearman made his début at Birmingham symphony hall with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducting a concert of music by Academy Award Winning composer AR Rahman.
Throughout 2002 to 2006 Shearman continued to orchestrate and conduct film scores, notably "Calendar Girls" Calender Girls (2003), Alfie (2004 film) (2004), Nanny McPhee (2005) and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) (2005). Additionally, Shearman conducted Mark Isham scores; The Black Dahlia (film) (2006), In the Valley of Elah (2007) and Reservation Road (2007). Further orchestrations of Doyle’s scores included As You Like It (2006 film) (2006) Eragon (film) (2006) The Last Legion (2007) and Kenneth Branagh’s Sleuth (2007 film) (2007). After Larry Ashmore’s retirement in 2007, Shearman and Doyle completed the orchestrations for all further Doyle scores largely alone.
Throughout 2005-2006, in addition to his film work, Shearman, together with Sam Babenia, wrote the songs and score for the musical "Taj: The Story of the Inconsolable Emperor". In 2007 the musical went into pre-production with the Belgian theatre producer Geert Allaert, though due to escalating stage production costs, work ceased and the production was put on hold. 
In 2008 Shearman collaborated with American Composer Paul Cantelon on the scores for the films The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)' and "Oliver Stone’s W. (film)." The soundtrack for "The Other Boleyn Girl" was nominated for best soundtrack at the 2009 Classical Brit Awards.
Shearman orchestrated and conducted two Doyle scores for 2011, notable blockbusters Thor and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. In addition to this he conducted Mark Isham’s score for Dolphin Tale (2011) and orchestrated and conducted Lesley Barber’s score for The Moth Diaries (film) (2011).
In 2012 he completed orchestrations and conducted the score for Pixar’s Brave (2012 film)", and more recently arranged the "Brave" orchestral suite for ‘Pixar in Concert’, a concert featuring the films and music of Disney Pixar, premiered by the San Francisco symphony orchestra in July 2012.
He continues to diversify, working in Film, Pop and Classical music genres.

Kyoto Protocol was formed in 2008 by Fuad, Gael, Hairi, Shaq and Shan. The band won 1st place in the Yamaha Asian Beat 2009 Central Regional Finals. In the subsequent National Finals, however, they narrowly missed out on the top spot and the change to represent Malaysia in the Asian Beat Grand Finals in Japan, settling for runner-up instead. In 2011, they were hand-picked to be the opening act for in MGMT's maiden concert in Kuala Lumpur, their first exposure to the big stage. Since then, they adapted quickly and in the process racked up impressive accolades including coveted slots at Future Music Festival Asia, Rockaway and Urbanscapes.
2011-2012: An Album.
In June 2011, Kyoto Protocol released “An Album”, a 5-track EP, under Monsoon Records who spotted them making the rounds in the local gigging circuit.

Subsequently, the band received a nomination for “Best New Artist” from Anugerah Industri Muzik (AIM) in the same year, building on the success of “An Album”.

2013-Present.
In March 2013, the band kickstarted proceedings at the Flamingo Stage of Future Music Festival Asia, held in Sepang, Malaysia. They shared the stage with big international acts that included Grammy nominees Fun., British indie rock band Bloc Party, and Australian goliaths The Temper Trap, amongst others. Future Music Festival Asia is currently the only instalment of the Future Music Festival franchise outside of Australia. The band performed a couple new tracks, in a preview to a potential upcoming album rumoured to be released in late 2013. On April 2013, they joined a reality show competition between bands in Malaysia that called "Versus" for the second season show. They end up being in a second place after they had a battle with Manifesto. August 2013 will be their lucky month as they are sharing the same stage with big international acts like Smashing Pumpkins and Modest Mouse for Good Vibes Festival that held in Sepang. Also, they officially released brand new EP entitled "Pahlawan" features few songs from "Versus" show and also a brand new track with Liyana Fizi, "Jelita".

The Birthday Suit

The Birthday Suit is a Scottish indie rock band from Edinburgh, formed in 2011 by Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones. Alongside Jones, the band's line-up includes Jacqueline Irvine, David Jack, Steve Morrison, Séan McLaughlin and Catrin Pryce-Jones.
To date, the band has released two studio albums, "The Eleventh Hour" (2011) and "A Conversation Well Rehearsed" (2012), with a third, "A Hollow Hole Of Riches", due for release on March 4, 2014.
History.
Formation and "The Eleventh Hour" (2011).
In late 2010, Idlewild entered an indefinite hiatus. Guitarist and backing vocalist, Jones, subsequently formed The Birthday Suit the following year after writing material for his second solo album. Jones noted:
I started making a second solo record, then got sick of it. I began writing a set of completely new songs which turned out to have more of an indie rock sound, and it felt more like band material than solo stuff. Even though I wrote it by myself at home, it wouldn’t have been right to record it alone, so I got a small band together. The name of The Birthday Suit was sort of an in-joke that stuck.
Jones elaborated, "With the addition of a few friends and local musicians it took on a new life and it was really apparent that it was a group of people I really wanted to play with."
The band released its debut album, "The Eleventh Hour", in late 2011, and followed its release with multiple performances in Glasgow and Edinburgh during the next year. The band perfored at T in the Park and Wickerman Festival, and subsequently began working on a follow-up album.
"A Conversation Well Rehearsed" (2012).
A single, "Less Worthless Years", was released in July 2012, with an accompanying EP release that features full-band versions of songs from Jones' debut solo album, "A Sentimental Education" (2010).
The band's second studio album, "A Conversation Well Rehearsed" was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the "Clean Slate Music" website's "Top 21 Albums of 2012" list, although the website write that the second album "doesn’t carry the punch" of the band's debut album.
"A Hollow Hole of Riches" (2013-present).
In October 2013, the band released a new single, "A Bigger World", featuring Scott Hutchison of Frightened Rabbit, and announced the release of its third studio album, "A Hollow Hole of Riches".
Musical influences.
Jones revealed in a 2012 interview that Thurston Moore, of American band, Sonic Youth, was a seminal influence as Moore facilitated a realisation that "there was more to the guitar than just playing really fast and learning scale".
Perspectives.
Journalists have queried Jones on his approach within the Birthday Suit in relation to Idlewild and the frontman has been open about his thoughts. In his interview with "Fame" magazine, Jones revealed that starting "at the bottom again" was the most difficult aspect of starting a new band; while in a guest column for "Q Music", Jones explored the past in greater detail:
I honestly think we made some great records, and maybe we will do again some day, but without the rose tinted glasses I probably had fixed to my face at the time, I realise there were definitely opportunities squandered. Too late in the bands life came the notion that throwing yourself around the stage and making a racket was great in a club but maybe didn't translate to an arena or stadium crowd. We needed to be more ambitious with our shows. It wasn't just about having a laugh. Being a stadium band was an artform. One all too foreign to us.
In an interview with the website, "Street Savvy", Jones focused on The Birthday Suit, stating that he thought that "if you can make yourself recognisable by your music and your playing then you must be doing something right", in response to a question on what his band can offer the "music industry"; Jones further explained, in respect to his aspirations for the Birthday Suit's music, "Enjoyment. That's all I can ask. I'm not going to pretend I want to change the world with my songs because I wouldn't know where to start. All I hope for is that people listen to the music and enjoy it."

Grand Masti

Grand Masti also referred to as Masti 2 is a Bollywood adult comedy film directed by Indra Kumar and produced by Ashok Thakeria. The film is a sequel to the 2004 film "Masti", and features Riteish Deshmukh, Vivek Oberoi and Aftab Shivdasani reprising their roles from the original, along with Bruna Abdullah, Karishma Tanna, Sonalee Kulkarni, Kainaat Arora, Maryam Zakaria and Manjari Fadnis. "Grand Masti" released on 13 September 2013. The film received largely negative response from critics, but was received well at the box office. "Grand Masti" is the highest grossing Bollywood film with an A (Adults Only) certificate in India, subsequently entering Bollywood's "100 crore club" in India. The film was declared a "Super Hit" in India by Box Office India.
Plot.
Three friends – Meet (Vivek Oberoi), Prem (Aftab Shivdasani) and Amar (Ritesh Deshmukh), who are married and don't like their wives: Meet thinks his wife Unatti (Karishma Tanna) is having an affair with her boss, Prem doesn't like it when his wife Tulsi (Manjari Fadnis) doesn't spend quality time with him and Amar hates his marital life because his wife Mamta (Sonalee Kulkarni) is more concerned about their son, Pappu.
One day, the trio receive an invite from their college, SLUTS (Sri Lalchand University of Technology And Science), to attend their college reunion. Their wives don't come with them, so the trio decide to have Grand Masti there to escape their boredom.
When they arrive, they see the women full clothed and the boys too afraid to express their love for them. This all due to the fear of a Principal Roberts (Pradeep Rawat), who hangs people naked on a tree if they disagree with his rules. They find out that their former colleague, Hardik (Suresh Menon), is in the mental asylum because of the principal. Meanwhile, Prem meets one of his former teachers, Rose (Maryam Zakaria), and is attracted to her. Meet meets Marlow (Kainaat Arora) and is attracted to her. Amar meets Mary (Bruna Abdullah) and is attracted to her. The trio then goes to the girl's place to have sex with them. But just when they were about to do it, they find out that Marlow, Mary and Rose are relatives of the principal. The principal chases them down thinking they had sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose, but they get away as their wives come to spend time with them.
The trio then get an MMS showing them the footage of them having sex. Luckily, the video doesn't meet the eyes of their wives. They then find out that it was Hardik who sent them the video, and he blackmails them. Their task is to kill the principal to fulfill Hardik's revenge. They fail in killing him, so they decide to try and delete the videos off Hardik's phone. They succeed, and continue to spend their time at the reunion.
It's the last day, and the principal has put pills inside the soup which attract people to the ones they love. The trio end up being with the girls, and the principal catches them red handed. The girls then reveal that the principal is impotent. The trio then get chased by the principal, but then when the trio end up on the roof of a building, Hardik pushes the principal and the principal slides down the roof and hangs on to a bar. The trio try to save him but Hardik pushes them too and they hang on to the principal. The girls come and push Hardik off the roof and he hangs on to Meet. The trio then tell principal the truth about not having sex with Marlow, Mary and Rose. The girls try to make a rope out of their clothes, but the boys fall and end up in the hospital. The trio get back with their wives and the principal's blood starts flowing to the right places after the pressure put on him. Hardik gets with Marlow and marries her.
Production.
The production of the film was to begin in the first week of August 2012, but due to actor Riteish Deshmukh's father Vilasrao Deshmukh's critical health condition, the film's commencement was put off by a few days. Says a source close to the project, ""Grand Masti", the sequel to "Masti" has been in the writing process for the last one and a half years. Finally, writers Milap Zaveri and Tushar Hiranandani cracked an idea and scripted the sequel. The film brings back the Riteish Deshmukh-Aftab Shivdasani-Vivek Oberoi trio, along with four new girls. "Grand Masti" was supposed to kick start this week. Then, Ritesh's father fell ill. He can't be expected to act funny at a time like this."
A suggestion that the film take off without Riteish was also put forward. However, producer Ashok Thakeria and director Indra Kumar refused, arguing that a comedy is a happy occasion and therefore all the actors needed to be comfortable. Reportedly, the film then started filming on 9 September 2012. The film's original release date was put between 31 July-late August 2013.
According to the print version of "Hindustan Times" (dated 18 July 2013), "Grand Masti" ("Masti 2") was set to release on 13 September 2013. The first official theatrical trailer was uploaded on the official YouTube channel on 18 July 2013. The stadium scene was shot in DY Patil Stadium apparently.
Soundtrack.
The film's music was composed by Anand Raj Anand and Sanjeev Darshan, and the lyricists are Kumaar and Manoj Darpan. It contains 3 songs, one remix song of the title track and one mash up.
Release.
"Grand Masti" was made at a budget of 310 million, including the production cost of 190 million and the remaining 120 million for Print & marketing. "Grand Masti" was submitted to the censor board three months ahead of its release date in June 2013. The film was not released in the UAE. "Grand Masti" was released huge on 13 September 2013 across approximately 2100 screens in India.
Controversies.
The Punjab and Haryana High Court had stayed the release of "Grand Masti" in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on 10 September 2013, but later lifted the stay order on the film and the film was released on 13 September 2013. A division bench of the HC has vacated the stay after hearing an appeal filed by the movie's producer Ashok Thakeria against the orders of the single bench. After a complaint about vulgar and obscene dialogue in the film, the Central Board of Film Certification on 16 September 2013 said it had constituted an inquiry against the movie. A 22-year-old youth Vasai resident, Mangesh Bhogal died to heart attack caused by excessive laughing.
Marketing.
The film was promoted on TV shows like "Comedy Nights with Kapil". The star cast also visited theatres upon the release of the film. A book on the film written by Neha Puntambekar, basically chronicling the various escapades of Amar, Meet and Prem, the three principal characters of Masti franchise was also released. Mumbai Indians cricketers Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha attended a screening of the film in Ahmedabad during preparation for 2013 Champions League Twenty20.
Critical response.
The film received mostly negative responses from critics due to its adult content but a polarised welcome from the general public, while youngsters constituted most of the film's viewership, it was criticised from the family audience's point of view.
Taran Adarsh of "Bollywood Hungama" gave the film 3.5/5 and stated that "Grand Masti" "crosses all limits and boundaries vis-a-vis adult humor. This one's strictly for those who relish naughty jokes, outrageous lines and scandalous visuals." Anupama Chopra of the "Hindustan Times" gave the film a 0.5/5 stars. Mohar Basu of "Koimoi" gave it 0.5/5 and called it a "grand tapestry of trash". Rohit Khilnani of "India Today" awarded the film with 1.5/5 stars. Abhishek Mande of "Rediff" introduced 0/5 and remarked, "there is no way you can enjoy this movie and still claim you respect women". "Access Bollywood" gave the movie 0/4 stars as well and criticised the movie's "tone-deafness and sexism", and summarised, "t's hard to believe that a movie this out-of-touch could be made in 2013." "Bollywood3" rated "Grand Masti" 3/5 and judged that "Indra Kumar has gone a step ahead with this one and made it a point to incorporate some of the boldest humor ever projected in Indian cinema".

An Adventure in Space and Time

An Adventure in Space and Time is a British television docudrama commissioned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the science fiction series "Doctor Who", which tells the story of its creation. It is written by the "Doctor Who" and "Sherlock" writer Mark Gatiss. Details of the film were announced by the BBC on 9 August 2012, with the programme airing on BBC Two in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2013, on BBC America in the United States and Space in Canada on 22 November 2013, on UKTV in New Zealand on 22 November 2013 and on ABC1 in Australia on 24 November 2013. The TV programme was shown in a pre-screening at the British Film Institute's Southbank centre on 12 November 2013.
Synopsis.
In 1966, William Hartnell (David Bradley) is in his dressing room at the BBC. He insults a stagehand who calls him to the set, where the delay caused by his absence is noticed. Hartnell enters in costume, ready to film his last moments as the Doctor and stands in front of the TARDIS console.
Three years earlier, BBC executive Sydney Newman (Brian Cox) is asked to create a show that will fill the gap between "Grandstand" and "Juke Box Jury". He has an idea for a science-fiction series with the central character being a "doctor", although he does not know of what. When he tells his colleague Verity Lambert (Jessica Raine) she is hesitant to join the project. She changes her mind when Newman asks her to be the producer, not his assistant. Lambert and the show's director, Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan), meet William Hartnell to offer him the lead role in what will eventually be titled "Doctor Who" and, despite some trepidation, he accepts.
During a rehearsal, Hartnell is dissatisfied that the TARDIS lacks an interior set. Newman then compliments Hartnell's acting ability to save his producer from a troublesome conversation. However, Newman has misgivings about Lambert's handling of her job. This inspires Lambert to become more assertive and she forces the set designer to finally create the TARDIS interior. He does so effortlessly, impressing Lambert. The recording of the pilot episode is beset with difficulties; Newman dislikes the result and orders a re-shoot. Following this, he is finally contented and schedules a transmission date.
After the broadcast of the first episode, Lambert and Hussein are nervous, as it occurs the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and its potential audience is diminished. Newman summons Lambert and tells her of Controller of BBC1 Donald Baverstock's (Mark Eden) request to cancel the show, but Lambert emphasises her belief in it and asks him to repeat the first episode before the second is screened. For the next serial, Newman expresses his concern about the Daleks, referring to them as "bug-eyed monsters", which he refused to allow on the show since its creation. However, Lambert eventually convinces him. Following the transmission of the first Dalek story, Lambert realises its popularity when she spots children impersonating the creatures' catchphrase, "Exterminate". Newman is pleased to tell her that the programme achieved a viewership of 10 million and continued production is now assured.
As most of the original cast and crew (including Hussein and Lambert) gradually move on to other projects, Hartnell's health declines, which leads to him forget lines and require scenes to be re-shot — something the BBC can ill-afford. Hartnell meets with Newman and asks for a reduced workload, but the decision has already been taken to replace him. Hartnell has grown to embrace playing the Doctor and struggles with his emotional attachment to the character. However, he reluctantly accepts the situation. As he later informs his wife, Heather (Lesley Manville), of the news he breaks into tears, admitting that he doesn't want to leave the role.
Before his final scene, Hartnell shares a brief exchange with his successor, Patrick Troughton (Reece Shearsmith). As the cameras are about to record, Hartnell looks across the main console. He sees Matt Smith, who will play the same role nearly 50 years later, and who silently acknowledges Hartnell's legacy.
Production.
The drama is produced by Matt Strevens, and directed by Terry McDonough. Filming began in February 2013. The production was based at the Wimbledon Studios in London, with shooting also taking place at BBC Television Centre. The drama was the final one ever to be recorded at the famous Television Centre, which closed one month after the filming had concluded.
On Sunday 17 February 2013, location filming for the drama took place early in the morning on Westminster Bridge in London. This involved replicas of 1960s Dalek props crossing the bridge, in a recreation of a famous scene from the 1964 "Doctor Who" serial "The Dalek Invasion of Earth". Interior scenes replicating early "Doctor Who" production at Lime Grove Studios were also filmed, showing 1963-era cameras and studio equipment.
To make the drama understandable to a general audience not knowledgeable about the history of "Doctor Who", not all of those involved in its creation are represented in the script. For example, the programme's original story editor David Whitaker does not appear, and his role is merged with that of associate producer Mervyn Pinfield. Also absent were "Doctor Who" co-creators Donald Wilson, who was head of BBC serials between 1962–65 and C.E. Webber, who was a BBC staff writer during the 1960s.
Part of the production involved the recreation of scenes from the classic series, some of which are from missing episodes such as "Marco Polo." Mark Gatiss had stated that his ambitions included filming the death of Sara Kingdom from the missing episode 12 of "The Daleks' Master Plan", using actress Jean Marsh (who originally played the character in 1965) to play the increasingly aging Sara, and using Super 8 footage of a recreation of the "Radio Times" publicity photo-shoot for "The Three Doctors", but the budget could not accommodate them.
Cast.
A number of the cast have appeared in "Doctor Who" at one time or another, most notably William Russell and Carole Ann Ford. David Bradley appeared in the Series 7 episode "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", while Jessica Raine was in the Series 7 episode "Hide", both alongside Matt Smith as the Doctor; Jeff Rawle was in the Season 21 serial "Frontios" with Peter Davison; Mark Eden appeared as the title character in the Season 1 serial "Marco Polo" with William Hartnell; Nicholas Briggs has played the voice of the Daleks since the series was revived in 2005 and Brian Cox voiced the Elder Ood in "The End of Time". Jean Marsh and Anneke Wills, who both played companions to Hartnell's First Doctor also appeared during Verity Lambert's leaving party scene.
Earlier proposals.
Gatiss first pitched the idea of such a drama to the BBC for the programme's fortieth anniversary in 2003, submitting a proposal to BBC Four. However, the proposal was rejected by the BBC, and Gatiss was told there was no available slot or budget for such a programme. Ten years prior to Gatiss's pitch, at the time of "Doctor Whos thirtieth anniversary in 1993, film-maker Kevin Davies had proposed a similar project called "The Legend Begins" to the BBC. "The Legend Begins" would have mixed documentary interviews with those responsible for the creation of "Doctor Who" with a dramatised strand showing the programme's beginnings. Eventually, the dramatisation idea was abandoned in favour of a standard documentary format looking at the entire history of "Doctor Who", which was eventually broadcast on BBC1 as ' in November 1993. When interviewed in 2003, Mark Gatiss said that he was unaware of Davies's earlier "The Legend Begins" proposal when he first came up with the idea for his programme.
Reception.
Ratings and reviews.
The drama was watched by 2.71 million viewers in the UK. It was generally well-received by critics, garnering a 95% "Fresh" rating (based on 14 reviews) at review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a 77 out of 100 weighted average score (based on 11 reviews) on Metacritic, indicating "Generally favorable reviews."
Awards and nominations.
On Monday 24th March 2014, "An Adventure in Space and Time" was nominated for three BAFTA Craft Awards; Suzanne Cave for 'Best Costume Design', Philip Kloss for 'Editing - Fiction' and Vickie Lang for 'Make Up and Hair Design'. Lang was successful in her category, with Gemma Chan presenting her the award on Sunday 17 April 2014. Speaking to Jenni Falconer, she described how she 'absolutely loved the project, that it was a hair and make up artist's dream.' 
Further nominations for the production from the BAFTA Awards for 'Best Single Drama' and the Hugo Awards for 'Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form' were received on Monday 7th and Saturday 19 April 2014. The BAFTA Award was won by Channel 4's "Complicit" at the ceremony on the 18th of May. The winner of the Hugo Award is due to be announced on Sunday 17 August 2014.

<doc id="36673881" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36673881" title="Oregon Rail Heritage Center">
Oregon Rail Heritage Center

The Oregon Rail Heritage Center (ORHC) is a railway museum in Portland, Oregon. Along with other rolling stock, the museum houses three steam locomotives owned by the City of Portland: Southern Pacific 4449, Spokane, Portland & Seattle 700, and Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. 197, the first two of which are restored and operable. The center opened to the public on September 22, 2012. The project to establish the center was led by the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation (ORHF), a non-profit organization established in 2002.
Background.
ORHF was tasked with finding a new home for the three city-owned locomotives, after planned changes by Union Pacific Railroad (UP) made it apparent that the locomotives would need to be moved out of their longtime home in the UP's (and formerly Southern Pacific's) Brooklyn Roundhouse (), a 1941-built roundhouse in Southeast Portland's Brooklyn neighborhood. ORHF comprises several entities, including railway preservation and railfan groups as well as the city's Bureau of Parks & Recreation.
Proposals to construct a new enginehouse to house the historic locomotives were expanded to encompass a visitor center and eventually an interpretive center. After considering other potential sites for an enginehouse, ORHF reached agreement in 2009 on a site near the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), encompassing about .
Construction.
Ground-breaking for the enginehouse took place in October 2011. The three steam locomotives were moved to the site from the Brooklyn Roundhouse on June 26, 2012, and were temporarily placed outdoors, awaiting completion of the enginehouse. With the house fully enclosed (though not completed), the locomotives were moved inside on July 28. Several vintage rail passenger coaches have also been moved to the site from the Brooklyn Yard (surrounding the roundhouse), where they had been outdoors, and they will continue to be kept outdoors at the new center. The budget for the initial phase of construction is $5.9 million, and funding has come mainly from donations, but with the City of Portland loaning $1 million. The Brooklyn Roundhouse was demolished in early September 2012, but its turntable was removed and placed in storage, and ORHF plans to install it at the new center in a later phase.
The Oregon Rail Heritage Center opened to the public on September 22, 2012. It is open for visitors Thursday through Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and for the time being, admission is free.
Collection.
The centerpieces of ORHC's collection are the three steam locomotives: Southern Pacific 4449, Spokane, Portland & Seattle 700, and Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. 197. All were donated to the City of Portland in 1958 and were on static display at Oaks Amusement Park until the mid-1970s or later. No. 4449 was moved to the Burlington Northern Hoyt Street Roundhouse in 1974 for restoration and proceeded to become famous nationwide, when it hauled the American Freedom Train throughout the country during the United States Bicentennial celebrations of 1975–76. It was thereafter stored and maintained at the Brooklyn Roundhouse between excursions. SP&S 700 moved to the roundhouse from Oaks Park in 1986, and OR&N 197 followed in 1996. SP&S 700 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Several pieces of privately owned rolling stock also reside at the new center, including a diesel switcher, other locomotives and several vintage passenger and freight cars. One of the locomotives is Nickel Plate Road 190.
Public facilities at the new enginehouse are expected to be minimal initially, consisting of a few exhibits and an area where restoration work on the locomotives and other equipment can be observed, but ORHF plans to install a full interpretive center later, on the building's second floor.
The operational steam locomotives are occasionally used on excursion trips, including an annual "Holiday Express", and the new enginehouse was sited and designed in such a way as to enable these trips to continue. Union Pacific Railroad's north–south main line runs past the building, and is connected to the Heritage Center's tracks, allowing the locomotives and other rail cars to be moved onto or off of the mainline tracks. The rail cars will also have access to Oregon Pacific Railroad (OPR) tracks at the new location.
Location and access.
The museum site is in Southeast Portland, at 2250 S.E. Water Avenue, adjacent to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and to Union Pacific's north–south main line. Public transit service is provided by the new CL Line of the Portland Streetcar system, which opened on the same day as the museum, September 22, 2012. The streetcar's OMSI stop is located one block west of the ORHC. The center is open Thursday through Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Aram of the Two Rivers

Aram of the Two Rivers is an album by bass guitarist Jonas Hellborg, released in 1999 through Bardo Records. It was recorded live at two concerts played in Syria in 1996 - in the Al Azam Palace in Damascus, and in one of the oldest caravanserais in Aleppo.
Composed of six highly improvised suites that flow evenly from one movement to the next, the album is an "infectious" (Eric Saidel, All About Jazz) fusion of Jazz and Arabic music, melding Hellborg's polyrhythms and Middle Eastern modal harmonic structures with authentic sounds of ethnic instruments played by talented local musicians.
Darbukas (Tarek Malas and Mahfouz Al Hosaini) and riqq (Nabil Khaiat) are assisting Hellborg's acoustic bass in its rhythmic and melodic drive, joined by ney player Mased Sri al Den on the first three tracks and violinist Hadi Backdonas on the last three. The result is a collection of intriguing, though pleasantly accessible, silence-breathing arrangements with virtuous melodic exchanges, unison played ideas and haunting (at times even dance-like) rhythms.
Instruments.
Jonas Hellborg plays here an acoustic bass, custom built by luthier Abraham Wechter, an exquisite work of art also to be heard on some of his other albums ("Silent Life", "Octave of the Holy Innocents").
In his hands, the instrument receives the versatility of a wider sounding, deeper range guitar, capable of appealing melodic runs, chordal approaches, but also of the thumb slapping, string pulling and popping one would expect from an electric bass.
"It makes me wonder if he's not some sort of demonic half-organic machine, performing a myriad of calculations before lifting a finger to play not quite the thing you expected." concludes Carl Glaser for Ink19 Music Reviews.
Darbuka is a hand-drum heard in the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, similar to a clay pot (it can also be made of metal or wood);
Riqq is a small percussion instrument similar to a tambourine used in traditional Arabic music, originally built as a wooden frame with jingles, covered with fish or goat skin;
Ney is a traditional Middle-Eastern end-blown flute, with a fluid, sensual and floating sound.
Title etymology.
"Aram of the Two Rivers" (original: "Aram-Naharaim") designates a Syrian region better known today as Mesopotamia, ancient home of the Arameans and primordial cradle of human culture and civilization, stretching between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and referenced as far back as the Old Testament.

America (Dan Deacon album)

America is a studio album by American electronic musician Dan Deacon, released August 27, 2012 on Domino Records. The album cover is a photo of Lake Placid.
Recording.
Production.
"America" was recorded using both electronic sounds and live recordings. An anechoic chamber was built in Baltimore to record the orchestral track "Rail." The reason Deacon decided to incorporate live instruments onto the album was that Deacon felt that electronic beats were limited by its lack of flaws and that he wanted the "slight imperfection in timing" human musicians have. Because he wanted the album to sound "more like a rock record" than an electronic one, Deacon enlisted King Crimson engineer Simon Heyworth to master the album.
Themes.
In an interview with NPR, Deacon said that the album was inspired by the politics and geography of the United States, saying: 
Deacon described the album as "political," saying that the lyrics were "[..] inspired by my frustration, fear and anger towards the country and world I live in and am a part of." However, Deacon also said that he did not want the political nature to be overt, arguing that people do not respond to overt political messages.
Lyrics and inspirations.
"Rail" was inspired by an empty train ride Deacon was on while traveling from Seattle to New York City. "Rail" was also inspired by an orchestral work Deacon wrote for the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony. "Manifest" was about "figuring out where I fit in regards to the way my mind perceives me," while "True Thrush" was "about confusion and loss of self" and the "homogenization of culture." The track "USA I: Is A Monster" took its name from the rock band The USA Is a Monster.
Release.
The first song from the album, "Lots," was uploaded to Soundcloud by Domino Records on May 29, 2012. A second song, "True Thrush," was released on July 10, 2012. On July 18, 2012, a music video for "True Thrush" was released. The music video, directed by Ben O' Brien and Deacon, featured teams of people playing a skit-based game of telephone. On August 21, 2012, the album was streamed in its entirety on The Guardian.
Music from this album was used in the Adult Swim television series "Off the Air" for a special entitled "", which aired on July 6, 2013.
Reception.
"America" has received mostly positive reviews. On the review site Metacritic, the album has a score of 82 out of 100, indicating "Universal acclaim."
Chris Mincher of The A.V. Club gave the album a grade of A-, calling the it "[..] one of the more thoughtful and complex albums so far this year." Mincher continued: "[..] "America" ultimately embraces splendor and nobility, even as it acknowledges personal and social anxiety." Allmusic's Gregory Heaney also praised the album, writing ""America's" artful merging of the electronic and the acoustic shows that these tools we dedicate so much time and brain space to can also be used to create something free and emotionally invigorating. NME's John Calvert called "America""[..] a profound statement," writing "Deacon proves once and for all that there’s nothing wrong with being cool, as long as you’re awesome." Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound gave the album a grade of 8 out of 10, writing "After taking in an album like this, there’s no remaining uncertainty about how he got here. There should only be reveling in the achievement, the artistic growth, and the pleasure of the experience. This is a sonic representation of the grandeur of "America" as it stands, a classically inspired composition built with all the tools available." While criticizing the lyrics for being "hard to discern," Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound concluded his review with: "No one concept album, even one with the complexity of "America," could ever hope to fully address the manifold problems of the USA, but in searching for his own answers Dan Deacon has crafted an unique testament to this fact and to his own inimitable, and ever increasing, talents."
Not all reviews were entirely positive. Rolling Stone's Jon Dolan gave the album a mixed review, writing: "[..] most enjoyable bits here are the least grandiose, like the zippy, pastoral 'True Thrush.'" Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote "[Though "America" is an explosive document, half the time it’s a lot of smoke and bang, and it treads on territory that others have explored more thoughtfully." Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell, while still giving the album a positive review, criticized the album's middle section, writing "It's the middle of the album that fizzles slightly after the bracing crunch and buzz of the first three songs [..]"

Tri-R Technologies

Tri-R Technologies was an American aircraft manufacturer that produced kit aircraft for homebuilt construction.
Tri-R Technologies was founded by Richard Trickel to develop composite homebuilt aircraft kits that were in the middle of the price and performance range averages. The company's first products were composite subassemblies for Berkut aircraft and Lancair 235, Lancair 320 and Lancair IV homebuilts. The company's aircraft products were named KIS, short for "Keep it Simple (Stupid)".
Trickel originally drew a new aircraft as a set of three-views for a customer in Australia who was looking for a new, conventional aircraft concept. The customer liked the design, but never paid for the drawings, so Trickel brought them home and completed the design work himself. Eventually the new design became the Tri-R KIS TR-1.

Cocosates

The Cocosates were an Aquitani pre-Roman tribe settled in what today is southwestern France, at north of the river Adour. They were surrounded by the Tarbelli at south and the Boiates at north. They inhabited what today is the western part of the French department of Landes.
History.
They were called "Cocosates sexsignani" by the Romans, meaning "Cocosates of the six banners", which means they were actually a confederacy of six tribes. They lived in present-day Landes, at north of the Adour, in Brassenx.
Their name, "Cocosates" is similar to the Basque word "kokots", which means "chin". It probably comes from the Aquitanian or Proto-Basque root "koiz" or "coç", meaning "hill", or "height", root which is also present in "Cossium", the capital of the Vasates (tribe).

Sprinkler strategy

The sprinkler strategy (also known as sprinkler diffusion strategy) is a market entry strategy based on the principle of diversification in which a company attempts to achieve market entry in as many markets as possible in a relatively short time. 
A successful implementation of the sprinkler strategy requires a high standardization of marketing activities due to the extreme difficulty implied in the simultaneous maximization of marketing activities' customization and of the number of successful market entries. Usually, a certain amount of failed market entries and withdrawals from some markets is accepted if a sprinkler strategy is used. In case a waterfall strategy and a sprinkler strategy are used together, this yields a combined waterfall-sprinkler-strategy.

United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction

Created in December 1999, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) is the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). It is the successor to the secretariat of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction with the purpose of ensuring the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (General Assembly (GA) resolution 54/219).
UNISDR is part of the United Nations Secretariat and its functions span the development and humanitarian fields. Its core areas of work includes ensuring disaster risk reduction (DRR) is applied to climate change adaptation, increasing investments for DRR, building disaster-resilient cities, schools and hospitals, and strengthening the international system for DRR.
UNISDR's vision is based on the three strategic goals of the Hyogo Framework for Action: integrating DRR into sustainable development policies and planning, developing and strengthening institutions, mechanisms and capacities to build resilience to hazards, and incorporating risk reduction approaches into emergency preparedness, response, and recovery programmes.
UNISDR leads the preparation and follow-up of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, establishment in 2006 (GA resolution 61/198). The Global Platform has become the main global forum for disaster risk reduction and for the provision of strategic and coherent guidance for the implementation of the Hyogo Framework and to share experience among stakeholders. Other areas of work for UNISDR includes issuing the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction every two years, supporting countries in monitoring risk trends and the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action, and leading global campaigns on disaster risk reduction for safer schools, safer hospitals and safer cities.
Management.
Margareta Wahlström is the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction.
Created in 2008, the functions of this post includes leading and overseeing UNISDR in the executions of its functions entrusted by the General Assembly (GA), Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), as well as policy directions by the Secretary-General, overseeing the management of the Trust Fund for the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and carrying out high-level advocacy and resource mobilization activities for risk reduction and implementation of the HFA. The Special Representative also ensures the strategic and operational coherence between disaster-reduction and humanitarian disaster preparedness and response activities, as well as socio-economic activities of the UN system and regional organizations.
Educational Games.
The UNISDR has invested in game based learning to engage with schools and educational bodies by developing a range of physical board games, educational packs and digital online games to help promote awareness of how to reduce disaster risk 
In 2007 the UNISDR commissioned the Stop Disasters simulation game by Playerthree, a UK based games studio.
The Stop Disasters game is a web-based serious game in which players can select from a range of disaster scenarios around the world such as earthquake, flood, tsunami, wildfire and hurricane. Players have a limited budget with which to house a given population as safely as possible.

1088 Tmogvi earthquake

The 1088 Tmogvi earthquake () occurred on April 16 or April 22, 1088, on Easter Sunday, in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Georgia. It takes its name from the castle of Tmogvi, in Javakheti, whose destruction is specifically noted in the medieval annals of Georgia. Its magnitude is estimated as 6.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale. 
History.
The Tmogvi earthquake was one of the largest recorded earthquakes in the history of Georgia, associated with the active faults of the Javakheti Plateau in the Lesser Caucasus.
According to the anonymous 12th-century "Life of King of Kings David", the earthquake shook Georgia on the "last day of Holy Week, on the very resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ". The chronicle reports widespread destruction and many casualties and adds that "fearsome trembling of the earth lasted for a year". The author specifically notes the collapse of the castle of Tmogvi, trapping its lord Kakhaber son of Niania and his wife underneath.

United Arab Airlines Flight 749

United Arab Airlines Flight 749 was a scheduled international passenger flight on 13 March 1966 that crashed while attempting to land in Cairo, Egypt. All thirty passengers and crew on board were killed.
Crash.
Flight 749 took off from Nicosia Airport bound for Cairo International Airport. En route, the aircraft encountered bad weather and conditions were poor in Cairo due to the presence of sandstorms. The crew of Flight 749 contacted Mirsair's Operations about diversion options. The flight crew also reported they were flying through thunderstorms with icing conditions, that two of the aircraft's altimeters were giving different readings, the magnetic compass being unserviceable, and that there was a crack in a cockpit window panel due to the thunderstorms. After diverting was discussed, Flight 749 continued on to Cairo. The Flight was cleared for a Runway 23 approach but crashed approximately 5 kilometers from it. Everyone on board Flight 749 perished in the accident.
After the crash, the sandstorm hampered rescue operations. Visibility was near zero and rescue vehicles became bogged down in the drifting sands. 
Among those killed in the crash was Yemen's Agriculture Minister, Ali Mohammad Abdou.
Investigation.
Accident investigators determined that "the accident arose from the descent of the aircraft below the safe flight altitude in the final approach and the impact of the port wing against the sand dunes lying to the northeast of the aerodrome. As a result the pilot lost control of his aircraft and hit the ground.
It is probable that the cause of descent of the aircraft below the safe level was due to the change from IFR to VFR, taking into consideration that considerable time would have been needed for the pilot to have adapted to this change in the prevailing weather conditions."

Lucky Devils

Lucky Devils is a 1941 film from director Lew Landers. Maria Montez has a small role.
Plot summary.
A sly pair of newsreel reporters, Dick McManus (Richard Arlen) and Andy Tompkins (Andy Devine), who work for the Mercury News Reel Company, has made a profession of photographing stories featuring daredevil acts by ordinary people. One of the exciting places for doing these acts is the Phillips Dam and it's often visible in the two reporters' photos. This fact is used by two foreign saboteurs, R. W. Ritter (Ralf Harolde) and Berko (Dick Terry). The saboteurs are planning to destroy the dam and have great help from the reporters' footage. At the same time, reporters Dick and Andy are informed by their editor, K. W. Momsen (Tim Ryan), at the Mercury News Reel Company offices, that they may be held responsible if anything does happen to the dam. 
Norma Bishop (Dorothy Lovett) is a teletypist for the Consolidated News Service and also Dick's go-to girlfriend. She finds out that Dick has used inside information in her possession once again, to photograph the dam. She is upset by this and worries that she may lose her job if word gets out. 
Dick and Andy are sent by their editor to photograph the maiden flight of a new and technically groundbreaking robotics airplane, but Dick accidentally sabotages its first voyage when he sneaks aboard the plane and knocks out its radar. After being bailed out of jail, Dick and Andy are told that their recently awarded $1,000 bonus is going toward the plane's repair. 
Dick pays a visit to Norma's office, to say hello and perhaps pick up some leads at the same time. During his sneak visit, he finds out that the Duke and Duchess of Vere are arriving incognito by boat to the city. To get an exclusive on the coverage, Dick tricks Norma into leaving her desk, and then he sends out a fake news item that quintuplet colts have been born at a nearby farm. The result is that all the other newsreel reporters go to cover the fake story at the farm, and Dick and Andy cover the royal couple's arrival alone. At the pier, Dick and Andy get involved in the news story by fending off an attempt to assassinate the royal couple and the subsequently become heroes. The two reporters enjoy their success, but the news of their heroics gets out and the fake story sent out from Norma's desk gets her fired. Hoping to get even, Norma sends Dick and Andy out on a fake story of her own, about an airplane pilot. As luck would have it, the two reporters make the news anyway, when they rescue the pilot Gordon Douglas after his plane crashes during an around-the-world flight. Despite her attempt to get even, Dick feels sorry for Norma and manages to get her a new job as a radio announcer. 
Saboteurs Ritter and Berko go to the Mercury offices and offer to buy the Phillips Dam footage, but are turned down by the editor. Dick and Andy are out taking live photos and come across a mining disaster where another newsreel reporter has been murdered. After photographing the murder story, Dick and Andy are almost killed themselves by Ritter and Berko when the spies are caught stealing the dam footage. The spies get away though. Dick and Andy find out that F.B.I. agent Chandler is put to investigate a sabotage attempt on the dam. In a desperate attempt to stop the saboteurs from blowing up the dam Dick calls on Norma, who fakes a radio broadcast that the dam has already been blown up. Dick rushes to the dam, while Andy goes to a museum to photograph its model. Having been told that no photos are allowed, Andy instead steals the model by pretending to be a repairman. 
As Dick learns that the dam is still intact, Andy accidentally blows up the model while photographing it. That footage is then mistakenly sent to the theaters as "exclusive" footage of the real dam's sabotage. Because of this Dick becomes the laughing stock of the news world. He returns to the radio station, claiming to have footage of the real saboteurs planting explosives at the dam. Bradford (Jack Arnold), who is Dick's newsreel rival, hires the private detective Aloysius K. Grimshaw (Gus Schilling) to follow Dick on his next story. While driving to Andy's farm, Dick realizes he is being followed, and he and Andy scare off Grimshaw by projecting footage of man-eating lions. Ritter and Berko, pretends to be FBI agents, and pay a visit to Norma at the radio station to learn Dick and Andy's whereabouts. Not seeing through the disguises Norma tells them about Andy's farm, and the fake agents insist she take them there. 
Back at the Mercury offices, Momsen is being bombarded with returned newsreels of the fake dam blow-up from angry agencies. Sinve Dock and Andy has gone underground at Andy's farm, both Chandler and Gwendy Wimple (Janet Shaw) - Andy's clueless airhead of a girl friend - seek Andy. Chandler wants him for the theft of the museum dam model, and Gwendy for breaking his promise to her. Bradford and Grimshaw returns from their horrible experience at the farm, and tells all about the lions. Soon the entire group heads for the farm. 
Norma and the two fake agents/saboteurs arrive at the farm, only to learn from Dick that there is no real sabotage footage. Inside the barn, a fight breaks out, and Andy attacks the saboteurs by using model airplanes launched from the hay-loft. The saboteurs are taken care of before the rest of the ensemble arrives, and Ritter and Berko are arrested on the spot by the real agents. Back at the newsreel offices, Norma arrives, having been fired from her broadcasting job. As Andy and Gwendy watch, Dick offers to take Norma "off the air for life" with a marriage proposal.

Lohafex

LOHAFEX was an experiment initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Research and carried out by the German Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) 2009 to study sea fertilization in the South Atlantic. It was also an Indo-German cooperation project. The word itself is also an acronym and portmanteau word composed from the Indian word for iron, FEX LOHA for "Fertilization EXperiment". LOHAFEX should be a contribution to POGO, the Partnership for Observation of the oceans (P artnership for O bservation of the G lobal O Ceans). AWI in the expedition under the name ANT XXV / 3 is performed. These reports were also published weekly on the website of the Institute.
As part of the experiment, the German research vessel Polarstern deposited 6 tons of iron in the form of ferrous sulfate in an area of 300 square kilometers. It was expected that the iron sulphate would distribute through the upper 15 m of the water layer and trigger algal bloom. A significant part of the carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water would then be bound by the emerging bloom and sink to the ocean floor. 
The ship left Cape Town 7 January 2009. The expedition ended after 70 days on 17 March 2009 in Punta Arenas, Chile.
The technique to fertilize the ocean with iron sulphate is controversial, the Federal Environment Ministry called for a halt to the experiment, partly because environmentalists feared damage to marine plants and pets by an artificial algal bloom. Most critics feared long-term effects which would not be detectable during short-term observation. Other critics feared the entry into large-scale manipulation of ecosystems with these large geo-engineering experiments.
LOHAFEX was not the first experiment of its kind. In 2000 and 2004, comparable amounts of iron sulfate were discharged from the same ship ( EisenEx experiment). 10 to 20 percent of the algal bloom died off and sank to the sea floor. This removed carbon from the atmosphere, which is the intended carbon 'sink'.
The algal bloom also stimulates the growth of zooplankton that feed on them. These in turn are eaten by krill, and these in turn are eaten by fish.

Information technology

Information technology (IT) is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, e-commerce and computer services.
Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term "information technology" in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the "Harvard Business Review"; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940) and electronic (1940–present). This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic), which began in about 1940.
History of computer technology.
Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick. The Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism. Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.
Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed during the Second World War to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring. The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.
The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.
Data storage.
Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete. Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from the Second World War, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line. The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube, but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.
IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system. Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs. Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally: 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007, doubling roughly every 3 years.
Databases.
Database management systems emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. One of the earliest such systems was IBM's Information Management System (IMS), which is still widely deployed more than 40 years later. IMS stores data hierarchically, but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. The first commercially available relational database management system (RDBMS) was available from Oracle in 1980.
All database management systems consist of a number of components that together allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity. A characteristic of all databases is that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema.
The extensible markup language (XML) has become a popular format for data representation in recent years. Although XML data can be stored in normal file systems, it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort". As an evolution of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable.
Data retrieval.
The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra.
The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully. Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats even within a single organization. Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organised in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems (DSS).
Data transmission.
Data transmission has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception. It can be broadly categorized as broadcasting, in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or telecommunications, with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels.
XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s, particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented protocols such as SOAP, describing "data-in-transit rather than ... data-at-rest". One of the challenges of such usage is converting data from relational databases into XML Document Object Model (DOM) structures.
Data manipulation.
Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of Moore's law): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years.
Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited". To address that issue, the field of data mining – "the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data" – emerged in the late 1980s.
Academic perspective.
In an academic context, the Association for Computing Machinery defines IT as "undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations ... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization’s computer users."
Commercial and employment perspective.
In a business context, the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems". The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.
The business value of information technology lies in the automation of business processes, provision of information for decision making, connecting businesses with their customers, and the provision of productivity tools to increase efficiency.
Ethical perspective.
The field of information ethics was established by mathematician Norbert Wiener in the 1940s. Some of the ethical issues associated with the use of information technology include:

Jon Davison

Jon "Juano" Davison (born January 16, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist musician, who is the current lead vocalist of progressive rock bands Yes (since 2012) and Glass Hammer (since 2009). He has also been the bass guitarist of Sky Cries Mary.
He has, since childhood, been a friend of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins. He currently lives with his wife Maewe and his son Aleph in Laguna Beach.
Biography.
Early Years.
Davison's earliest involvement with music began when he sang in the church youth choir led by his mother. From an early age, she instilled in him an appreciation for music and love for singing. Soon after he took up guitar and bass, which eventually led him during High School to perform in various original and cover bands with his childhood best friend, Taylor Hawkins (currently the drummer for Foo Fighters). It was Hawkins who gave Jon the nickname "Juano" that has stuck to this day.
Sky Cries Mary.
Davison then attended the Art Institute of Seattle to study audio and video production where he landed the gig of bassist for Northwest group Sky Cries Mary. Throughout the 1990s, he continued recording and touring with the band. Some highlights of this period were traveling to Japan, and appearing on late night talk shows including "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" and "The Daily Show".
In 1998, Davison met his wife, Maewe, in Seattle at a meditation circle. In 2001, they moved for a year to Maewe's home of Brazil. While living there, Davison played bass with Ronald Augusto.
Glass Hammer.
Davison remained a member of Sky Cries Mary, but also joined the now-disbanded Yes tribute band Roundabout. In 2009, Glass Hammer discovered Davison singing Yes music online and asked him to join the band as "the voice we were always writing music for", according to founding members Steve Babb and Fred Schendel. He has since recorded five albums with them, "If", "Cor Cordium", "Perilous", a new version of "The Inconsolable Secret" and "Ode to Echo". He was the lead vocalist on the first three, but has been sharing that role in the band latterly given his engagements with Yes.
Yes.
In February 2012, Davison was announced as the new lead singer of Yes, replacing Benoît David, who left the group because of illness. "Strangely enough, Jon's name came up when we started working with Benoit," Yes bassist Chris Squire recalled. "In fact, my friend, Taylor Hawkins, had been telling me for years: 'If you ever need a replacement (singer), I know exactly the guy.'" Davison has toured with Yes since early 2012 and has recorded "Heaven & Earth", the band's new album which is set for a release in July 2014.

Masonic Shogi

Masonic Shogi is a shogi variant invented by George R. Dekle, Sr. in 1987. The game is played on a modified shogi board whereby alternating ranks are indented to the right—resembling masonry brickwork. The moves of pieces are adapted to the new geometry; in other respects the game is the same as shogi.
Masonic Shogi was included in "World Game Review" No. 10 edited by Michael Keller.
Board characteristics.
Indentation of alternating ranks results in "cants" (oblique files) approximately 30 degrees from the vertical and "diagonals" approximately 30 degrees from the horizontal, the same as hexagon-based chessboards when cell vertices face the players. (For example, rooks have six directions of movement. Masonic bishops, however, are limited to the four diagonal directions to the sides.)
Game rules.
All normal shogi rules apply, including initial setup (see diagram), drops, promotion, and so on. But the pieces have specially-defined moves.
Piece moves.
The diagrams show how the unpromoted pieces move. As in shogi, a "dragon king" (promoted rook) moves as a rook, or as a king. A "dragon horse" (promoted bishop) moves as a bishop or a king.

Gymnasium Schwertstraße

The Gymnasium Schwertstraße in Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was established on 15 October 1841 as the Höhere Bürgerschule, and is the oldest and most traditional of the four gymnasiums in the city.
History.
The school opened with 23 pupils with lessons being held in the Rathaus, and later in the Catholic "Pfarrhaus" in the Brunnenstraße and the former Vollmannschen Lateinschule on the corner of Klosterwall and Neustraße. In 1859, it moved into its own building in Friedrichstraße, and in 1897 to the new building in Schwertstraße. In 1899, it changed to being a gymnasium, and in 1902, it had pupils completing the abitur for the first time. From 1918 to 1924, the school building was used to accommodate a Scottish regiment, and lessons were held in the local court and in a vocational school. In 1930, 28 pupils from the school and from the Junior Technical School in Chatham each visited the other school. This is claimed to be the oldest proven instance of schools in Germany and England having a student exchange. In 1935, the school was renamed Moeller-van-den-Bruck-Schule. From 1943 to 1945, lessons were held in Salzungen und in Goethe-Schule in Ilmenau. The school building was destroyed in air strikes on 4 and 5 November 1944. From 4 October 1945, lessons were held in a shift system in Schule Zweigstraße und in der August-Dicke-Schule. In January 1946, the school was renamed Gymnasium Schwertstraße. On 27 October 1952, the school moved into the rebuilt site in Schwertstraße. In 1971, the school became co-educational by accepting girls for the first time.

M/M/∞ queue

In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, the M/M/∞ queue is a multi-server queueing model where every arrival experiences immediate service and does not wait. In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals are governed by a Poisson process, there are infinitely many servers, so jobs do not need to wait for a server. Each job has an exponentially distributed service time. It is a limit of the M/M/c queue model where the number of servers "c" becomes very large.
The model can be used to model bound lazy deletion performance.
Model definition.
An M/M/∞ queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers currently being served.
The model has transition rate matrix
The state space diagram for this chain is as below.
Transient solution.
The transient distribution can be written using moment generating functions and formulas for transient means and variances computed by solving differential equations. Assuming the system starts in state 0 at time 0, then the probability the system is in state "j" at time "t" can be written as
from which the mean queue length at time "t" can be computed (writing "N"("t") for the number of customers in the system at time "t" given the system is empty at time zero)
Response time.
The response time for each arriving job is a single exponential distribution with parameter "μ". The average response time is therefore 1/"μ".
Maximum queue length.
Given the system is in equilibrium at time 0, we can compute the cumulative distribution function of the process maximum over a finite time horizon "T" in terms of Charlier polynomials.
Congestion period.
The congestion period is the length of time the process spends above a fixed level "c", starting timing from the instant the process transitions to state "c" + 1. This period has mean value
and the Laplace transform can be expressed in terms of Kummer's function.
Stationary analysis.
The stationary probability mass function is a Poisson distribution
so the mean number of jobs in the system is "λ"/"μ".
Heavy traffic.
Writing "N""t" for the number of customers in the system at time t as ρ → ∞ the scaled process
converges to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with normal distribution and correlation parameter 1, defined by the Itō calculus as
where "W" is a standard Brownian motion.

Nights of Labor

Nights of Labor: The Workers Dream in Nineteenth Century France ("La Nuit des prolétaires: Archives du rêve ouvrier") is a 1981 non-fiction book by Jacques Rancière, which was based upon his doctoral thesis. The book was re-released in 2012 by Verso under the title "Proletarian Nights".
Synopsis.
The book collects a series of paraphrasing, quotations and summaries of worker writings that discuss a series of three experiments in worker association in mid-19th-century Paris. In the book Rancière looks at the beginnings of today's socialism and early proletarian class consciousness.
Reception.
Labour/Le Travail praised the book, calling it "an important statement". The American Historical Review wrote that the translation of the book was "excellent" and thought the foreword by Donald Reid was a highlight. The Oral History Review stated that "Nights of Labor" was "a powerful, piercing, and radical argument". The Journal of Modern History stated the book was "more a work of philosophical meditation than conventional historical analysis." Spiked Magazine praised Rancière for not taking a "hero-centric view of history" but stated that the book was "a very dense text as Rancière, seemingly unwilling to interpret or even distil the great wealth of evidence he has uncovered, gives us it all".

Semachrysa jade

Semachrysa jade is a species of green lacewing from the Malaysian states of Perak, Selangor and Sabah. So far, very few specimens have been found, all female. They exhibit extensive black markings on the basal portion of both wings, which differentiates them from the 14 other species in the genus "Semachrysa".
The species was discovered when a Malaysian amateur photographer posted a picture of it to the online photo-sharing site Flickr. A California state entomologist saw it and was unable to identify the species; nor were any colleagues he shared the image with. Eventually, he contacted the photographer and was able to obtain a specimen. Further testing at the Natural History Museum in London confirmed that it was indeed a new species. Its discovery has been described as a triumph of citizen science.
The species was listed among the "Top 10 New Species 2013" discovered in 2012 as selected by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University out of more than 140 nominated species. Its distinctiveness is its resemblance to a poisonous snake and its presence in an area of anthropogenic exploitation. The selection was publicised on 22 May 2013.
Description.
"S. jade"'s usual coloration is yellow to pale green. It has forewings long and hindwings long. Its antennae have approximately 50 flagellomeres. Like all other species in its genus it is distinguished by its veined wings, and the dark markings in the center. It most resembles "Semachrysa wallacei".
Discovery.
In May of 2011, Hock Ping Guek, a Malaysian photographer was hiking in Selangor State Park near Kuala Lumpur taking macrophotographs of the insects in the woods. He was focusing on somewhat rare lacewings as they perched on branches and leaves. On that trip, he was able to get a picture of a yellowish-green one with a black spot on its wing resembling another insect. He had seen it before, but it had flown away before he had been able to photograph it. 
When he returned, he posted the images to Flickr, with a comment about how lucky he felt to finally get the image in four years of macro photography. Shaun Winterton, a senior entomologist at the California Department of Food and Agriculture, happened across the image shortly afterward. He was struck by the black marks on the wing, which he had never seen on a lacewing before. Despite his extensive field experience, he was unable to identify the species. Colleagues he emailed the link to were also baffled.
He emailed Guek and asked him if he had a specimen, as it was possibly an undiscovered species. Guek told him that the lacewing had flown off shortly after he took the picture, so he did not have one. A year later, Guek emailed Winterton and said he had seen the lacewing again and this time he had captured it. Winterton told him to send it to Steven J. Brooks at the Natural History Museum in London.
Brooks not only confirmed that it was a previously unknown species, he found a specimen that had been sent to the museum many years earlier from the Malaysian province of Sabah, on the island of Borneo, but had never been classified or studied. The three collaborated on a paper describing the new species with Google Docs. Winterton named the species not after its color but his daughter. He said there were likely to be more such discoveries. "There's thousands of images a minute uploaded on Flickr," he told National Public Radio.
In the abstract of the paper, published in "ZooKeys" in August 2012, the authors called the find "a joint discovery by citizen scientist and professional taxonomists." They elaborated on this in the paper itself:

Country-of-origin effect

The country-of-origin effect (COE), also known as the made-in image and the nationality bias, is a psychological effect describing how consumers' attitudes, perceptions and purchasing decisions are influenced by products' country of origin labeling. Since 1965, it has been extensively studied by researchers.
History and origins.
Country of origin labelling originated in 1887 when the British government, in an effort to reduce sales of German and other non-English products to English consumers, passed a law requiring products manufactured outside England to be labeled with their country of origin.
Description and strength.
Research shows that consumers' broad general perceptions of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. This image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant of whether or not someone buys a product.
The country of origin effect is strongest on older consumers and those who don't know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for "low involvement" product categories such as shampoo, candy, light bulbs, toilet paper and athletic shoes. When the countries of design, manufacture and the parent brand are different, research suggests all three matter to consumers, but the country of manufacture may matter most.
Some research suggests that younger consumers care significantly less than older people about country of origin, but other studies resulted in different findings. The research on whether men or women care more about country of origin is also inconclusive.
A U.S. study found American college students more willing to buy a "made in China" teddy bear when it was sold at an American store they believed was benevolent, competent and honest, suggesting that negative country of origin effects may be offset when consumers trust the store selling the product.
Associations.
Consumers have a relative preference or aversion for products, depending on the products' country of origin (this is called affinity and animosity).
In some countries consumers tend to prefer products made in their own country (also known as consumer ethnocentrism) and in others foreign-made products tend to be preferred. A preference for locally-made products has been linked to a collectivist culture, and a preference for foreign-made products is associated with a more individualistic, competitive culture, and also with countries that are less economically developed.
Preferences also vary by product category. Most consumer prefer to buy meat from their own country. French consumers prefer to buy wine, refrigerators and footwear that was made in France rather than elsewhere. Japanese consumers prefer Japanese skin care products but non-Japanese beauty care products. Chinese consumers prefer to buy Western luxury brands rather than Chinese ones.
A 2007 Anderson Analytics study found that American college students believe Japan makes the world's highest-quality consumer goods, followed by the United States and Germany.
Consumers are generally felt to perceive Chinese products as low-quality, and to associate "made in China" labelling with value pricing, unskilled labour and inexpensive materials. In 2007 and 2008 China's reputation suffered worldwide due to product safety institutions in many parts of the world recalling Chinese-made products, such as pet food, toys, toothpaste and lipstick, because of concerns about their quality and safety.
Some products are strongly associated with a particular country, such as (in the Western world) silk with China, spices with India, wine with France, chocolate with Belgium, cars with Germany, fashion with Italy and electronics with Japan. Such products labeled as originating in that country will benefit from a halo effect, with consumers assuming they are high quality.
Countries that are less economically developed tend to have a negative country image and a negative country-of-origin effect.
Associations vary by country and region. Japan is universally understood to manufacture high-quality products, and yet historical animosity between it and some other Eastern Asian countries may reduce those countries' purchasing of Japanese products. A1965 study found Guatemalan students gave lower evaluations to products from El Salvador and Costa Rica than to domestic and Mexican products because of a general negative attitude toward people from El Salvador and Guatemala. French consumers avoid buying American products due to animosity towards U.S. politics and perceived U.S. passivity during the French Revolution. Throughout Southeast Asia, Korean goods are very highly valued.
COO marketing.
Companies are seeking to communicate the COO and to increase their customer's COO awareness with a number of different strategies:
Fluctuations.
Perceptions of countries and their products change over time. Since the late 19th century the German reputation for quality and attention to detail has helped it sell products internationally, but its reputation was significantly damaged during the First World War and Second World War.

Kamwenge Trading Centre shooting

The Kamwenge Trading Centre shooting was a mass murder that occurred in Kamwenge, Uganda on December 26, 1994, when police constable Alfred Ogwang shot at revelers in a disco at Kamwenge Trading Centre, killing 13 people and wounding 14 others. He escaped to Dura afterwards, where he was arrested.
Shooting.
On the evening of December 25, 1994, at about 9 p.m., 28-year-old police officer Alfred Ogwang, who was stationed at the Kamwenge Police Post, went to attend a disco dance at the Kamwenge Trading Center. When he tried to enter the canteen to get some beer at about 11 p.m. he found the door blocked from the inside by several guests. After he was finally let in, he got into an argument with Geofrey Ruhara for this provocation, whereupon all the guests were taken out of the canteen. Outside Ruhara apologized to Ogwang, who, still angered about the incident, then went home. Upon returning to the barracks he fetched his gun, which was described as an SMG rifle, and made his way back to the Trading Centre.
Just after midnight Ogwang began shooting in the canteen, where he first shot dead Geofrey Ruhara, before killing John Rutaro, Patrick Kugonza and Stephen Chance. Yelling "I will finish you all!" he then turned his rifle against the crowd in the dancing hall. When the generator was switched off, and the lights went out in the building, Ogwang stopped firing and fled. By then he had killed 13 people and wounded 14 others. 
In the morning, at about 7 a.m., he was met at the barracks by Inspector Kisembo, who said he was awakened by some shots. Ogwang aimed his rifle at Kisembo, who managed to wrest it from the gunman's hands after a short struggle. While Kisembo went back to sleep, Ogwang escaped to Dura where he had a brother at an army post. There he was arrested the next day and brought back to Kamwenge. An examination of his mental state, conducted on December 29, found him to be sane.
During his trial Ogwang denied having committed the murders, saying that he had handed his rifle to a member of the Local Defence Unit at the entrance of the disco, not knowing what had happened to it afterwards. He also stated that he was too drunk to remember anything that night, and that he only learned about the shooting the next morning, when an angry crowd appeared at the barracks, accusing him of killing people at the disco, though the judge dismissed all of these claims and found him guilty of 13 counts of murder.

Tityus exstinctus

Tityus exstinctus is an extinct species of scorpion belonging to the family Buthidae. It is only known from a single male collected in 1884 in the northern range of Martinique. The species epithet based on the fact that this taxon was already extinct when it was described. 
The holotype has a carapace length of 6.9 mm, a metasomal segment I length of 6.6 mm, a metasomal segment V length of 11.1 mm, a vesicle width of 3.2 mm, a femur length of 7.3 mm, a femur width of 2.3 mm, a tibia length of 8.2 mm, a tibia width of 3.3 mm, a chelae length of 14.2 mm, and a chelae width of 4.0 mm. The movable finger with the sting has a length of 8.2 mm.
It was first thought to be a close relative of "Tityus trinitatis" Pocock, 1897 (from Trinidad and Tobago) but a later study revealed its close relationship to "T. pictus" and "T. smithii".
Prior to its description in 1995 three experts have examined the specimen which is preserved in the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle. Eugène Simon synonymized it with "Centrurus insulanus" in 1890. Embrik Strand (no date) mentioned it as "Scorpio marmoratus". In 1900, Karl Kraepelin was the first who identified it as a new and undescribed species within the genus "Tityus".

Mutant Night

Mutant Night is an arcade platform shooter game released in 1987 by UPL. The player controls a small white creature named Mutron-kun. The creature has a large eye from which bubbles can be shot.
These bubbles then kill the various and diverse enemies that attack, for example skeletal monkeys, space ships and spinning discs. Mutron-kun also has the ability to jump and remain floating for a period of time by the repeated pressing of the jump button.
Gameplay.
Mutant Night is a shoot'em up game of the "run & gun" type : the players controls a walking character shooting at enemies while avoiding their attacks.
Unlike most run&gun games, Mutant Night has almost no platform part and the character's shooting power is very limited : short range and not multi-directional, the bubble are always shot in the direction the character is facing.
The game is divided in various levels or acts and focuses on fast-paced action and memorization.
The levels are very short and straightforward, with a level design relying only on enemies attack patterns and on the game's physics to challenge the player.
Mutron-kun can walk left or right, shoot bubbles and jump, and hurries to reach a small trapdoor at the end of each level. The difficulty curve of the game increases significantly after the first level and can be somewhat unforgiving.
Power ups are available in the form of small pink pods on the ground which when shot release a coloured orb into the air, which can do one of the following: make Mutron-kun very large and invincible for a short period, transform Mutron-kun into multiple creatures, award extra points or grant increased fire power in a scatter shot pattern.
The size changing bonus is one of the most notable feature of the game : the character grows into an invincible giant, destroying all enemies on its way. Similar bonuses appear in later games from various editors like Red Company's (1993) for the TurboGrafx 16 or New Super Mario Bros. (2006) for the Nintendo DS by Nintendo.
Another notable feature is the "cumulative jump" : by pressing the jump button multiple times while still in the air, Mutron-kun can chain several jumps, reach higher positions and float in the air. Doing so, Mutron-kun is however subject to a certain inertia which makes control more difficult.
The game makes use of this feature by challenging the player to get the bonuses : colored orbs released from the pink pods immediately float away, forcing the player to jump higher to reach them.
If the "cumulative jump" ability is limited in the three first levels, it becomes unlimited from level 4, allowing Mutron-kun to literally walk in the air for as long as wanted.
In several of the following levels, the gameplay will make use of this feature : some levels have to be completed mostly air-walking, as touching the ground outside of a few safe spots means immediate death.
While there's no limitation in time when using "air walking", after a long walk in the air Mutron-kun will need to rest for a few seconds after landing, making him very vulnerable to enemies attacks.
Legacy.
Mutant Night was only available as an arcade system and was never ported to any other system.
The game Atomic Robo-Kid from 1988, another side scrolling shoot'em up game by UPL, could be considered a sequel to Mutant Night as it bears interesting similarities :

Fatwa controversy.
During an interview on the Arabic television station Al Mayadeen in June 2012, Laghzioui supported a call by the Moroccan Association for Human Rights to repeal s490 of the Moroccan penal code, which criminalises sex outside marriage. He added that he would not object to his mother or sister having sex without being married. Following the broadcast, an imam from Oujda, Abdullah Nahari, posted a YouTube video, in which he issued a fatwa calling for Laghzioui's death. His call was subsequently supported by Morocco's three most senior Salafi clerics, Abou Hafs, Omar el-Heddouchi and Hassan al-Kettani. 
On 17 July, Nahari was indicted for incitement to murder. However, Laghzioui remained concerned for his safety: "I am very scared for myself and my family. It's a real blow to all the modernists who thought Morocco was moving forward."

The Lítla Dímun sheep was a primitive short-tailed type of sheep living on Lítla Dímun, a small and almost inaccessible island in the Faroes archipelago. It became extinct in the mid-19th century.
It was a feral sheep, probably derived from the earliest sheep brought to Northern Europe in the Neolithic Period. The last of these very small, black, short-wooled sheep were shot in the 1860s.
It was similar in appearance and origin to the surviving Soay sheep, from the island of Soay in the St Kilda archipelago off the west coast of Scotland. Soay is an island of very similar size and topography as Lítla Dímun, and has similarly difficult access.
The sheep now living on Lítla Dímun are Faroes sheep, a more domesticated short-tailed type.

Partysaurus Rex

Toy Story Toons: Partysaurus Rex is a 2012 Pixar computer animated short film directed by Mark Walsh. It was first screened in theaters ahead of "Finding Nemo 3D". "Partysaurus Rex" is the third short in the "Toy Story Toons" series, based on the characters from the "Toy Story" feature films. The other two films are "Small Fry" and "Hawaiian Vacation". The short involves Rex getting left in the bathroom and making friends with bath toys.
Plot.
Rex disrupts the other toys playing and blowing soap bubbles, worried they may ruin Bonnie's house. He is chastised by the other toys, with Mr. Potato Head calling him "Partypooper Rex". The other toys sense Bonnie approaching, and scatter, leaving Rex alone when she enters. She takes him to play with while she takes a bath. Rex enjoys being played with along with the other bath toys, but soon Bonnie's mom comes to turn off the bath and take her out. Once alone, the bath toys wish they could continue to have fun, but all of them lack arms and can only function if afloat in the water. Rex initially thinks drawing a new bath is a bad idea, but recalling Mr. Potato Head's insult, he asserts that he is "Partysaurus Rex", and helps the bath toys to start a new bath.
The toys quickly start to sing and dance in a rave-like fashion, aided by a carefree Rex throwing a bubble bath solution into the tub, and blocking the overflow drain with a sponge. However, he suddenly realizes that if the tub overflows, it will leak out into the hall; the bath toys care little if this happens and continue to party. He tries to turn off the water, but only causes the handle to fall off, and the drain stays plugged when he tries to pull it out. Finally, he spots the knob on the faucet that stops the flow from the faucet, but realizes too late that this only diverts the water to the shower head. The tub starts to overflow, the other bath toys oblivious to the problem. Outside the bathroom, Woody and the other toys go to see how Rex is doing when suddenly the bathroom door bursts open and a flood of water pours out.
Later, Bonnie's mom is paying to have plumbing repairs done to the house. Though he knows he was at fault, Rex enjoys the short-lived fame with the other toys in Bonnie's room as Mr. Potato Head is still getting the water out of him. Outside, several pool toys have heard of Rex's exploits from the bath toys and get him to agree to help turn on the outside faucet to let them party as well. Rex quickly joining in on their fun.
Music.
Electronic artist Brian Transeau composed the music for the short. He said in an interview: "I'm in the middle of scoring a film for Pixar right now. It's a short for "Toy Story", and I'm not allowed to say the whole story, but quite literally, it's like a "Toy Story" rave, and I'm actually not kidding either. Like, the toys get into all these shenanigans and it's like pounding club music, this thing. So it's really not very Pixar, but in like a really hysterical way, everyone laughs so hard when they see it. It's really exciting to work with those guys."
The song from the short, titled "Partysaurus Overflow", was released as a digital download on November 19, 2012, on iTunes and Amazon. Beside BT, the cover art also credits electronic dance producer Au5.
Release.
"Partysaurus Rex" premiered with the 3D theatrical re-release of "Finding Nemo", on September 14, 2012. It had its television premiere on October 8, 2012, on Disney Channel, and was available for video streaming to the Internet via Disney's website on October 10, 2012. As of October 2012, the short is also available on iTunes, Amazon and YouTube. The short made its home video debut as a special feature on the 3D Blu-ray release of "Monsters, Inc.", which was released on February 19, 2013.
Reception.
The short was very well received. Ben Kendrick of The Christian Science Monitor said that "Partysaurus Rex" is "easily the most enjoyable franchise spin-off to date."

Outlaw Run

Outlaw Run is a wooden roller coaster located at the Silver Dollar City amusement park in Branson, Missouri. The ride was the first wooden roller coaster manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction and the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright. The ride features three inversions and a top speed of , making "Outlaw Run" the second-fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. The first drop of the ride is the steepest in the world, at 81° beyond horizontal.
Planning for "Outlaw Run" began in 2009, three years before its official announcement in August 2012. Rocky Mountain Construction were contracted to manufacture the ride as their proposal best suited Silver Dollar City's available space and budget. The ride's track layout was designed by Alan Schilke. "Outlaw Run" opened to the public on March 15, 2013, to generally positive reviews.
Planning and marketing.
Planning for a new 2013 attraction in the Silver Dollar City amusement park began in 2009 with the owners, Herschend Family Entertainment, approaching Rocky Mountain Construction and other manufacturers for ideas for "a ride with marketing appeal". Joel Manby, CEO of Herschend, wanted a "world first", to have a wooden roller coaster that would be "the first to do a double barrel roll", which is when the train goes twice through a combination of a loop and a roll. In 2011, Rocky Mountain Construction showcased their new steel roller coaster, New Texas Giant, to park executives. This demonstration secured the contract.
Marketing began in 2011 when the public were made aware at the 2011 trade show of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions that Rocky Mountain were working on a wooden roller coaster; it being later revealed that this roller coaster would be built at Silver Dollar City. Following the beginning of construction at the park, Silver Dollar City launched a teaser website for a new attraction to open in 2013. The website featured a public notice indicating that the ride's theme would be stagecoaches and the wild west. The teaser website also stated that an announcement would be made on August 9, 2012. As part of its teaser campaign leading to the announcement, the park released two clues; the first clue was a handwritten letter, while the second was a photo of the park's attraction and the nearby Table Rock Lake. On August 9, 2012, Silver Dollar City officially announced that "Outlaw Run" would open in the second quarter of 2013. At its opening, the ride would be the only wooden roller coaster to feature inversions and would feature the steepest drop on a wooden roller coaster. At a cost of $10 million, the ride would be the most expensive Silver Dollar City attraction in more than a decade.
On September 26, 2012, the last piece of track was installed on "Outlaw Run". The ride opened to a limited audience on March 13, 2013, with a public opening two days later. Official opening celebrations were held in April.
Characteristics.
"Outlaw Run" was Rocky Mountain Construction's first wooden roller coaster. It is the second-fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, reaching speeds of up to . Throughout the course of the ride, riders go through three inversions, including a double heartline roll. The park's existing terrain (the park is located in the Ozark Mountains) is used to allow a lift hill to be translated into a first drop stretching .
The of track is made primarily of layers of laminated wood, with a steel plate located in the upper layers of the track. The steel plating is known as Topper Track and is found on many roller coasters that Rocky Mountain Construction has renovated. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster and to provide a smoother ride experience. Rocky Mountain Construction spent four years developing technology to allow them to twist beams of wood, that make up the lower layers of the track. This track configuration allows for more dynamic roller coaster elements to be performed on a wooden roller coaster.
"Outlaw Run" consists of two trains, each featuring twelve pairs of riders. Riders, who must be or taller to ride, are restrained in their individual fiberglass seats with a U-shaped lap bar. Unlike most roller coaster trains, which have polyurethane wheels, "Outlaw Run" features steel wheels. Also new for the 2014 season outlaw run updated their trains with a new curved shin bar and added seatbelts that made dispatch times longer which made it have the slowest line in the park.
"Outlaw Run" features a Western stagecoach theme. The ride's station is themed as a stagecoach depot located in the outskirts of Silver Dollar City. According to the ride's storyline, stagecoaches depart daily heading west, where they are intercepted by outlaws who want to steal the riders' belongings. "Outlaw Run" riders are law enforcement personnel tasked with stopping the outlaws. To keep their family-friendly image, Silver Dollar City uses a variety of theming to advertise that the "good guys" will always win.
Ride experience.
The train exits out of the station and ascends the chain lift hill. The track then goes through a small pre-drop, similar to that on Bolliger & Mabillard steel roller coasters, before dropping at an angle of 81°. The train then ascends into the first element, an outside banked turn, where the track is banked over to 153° before rolling back out of the bank. After going around a low-to-the-ground curve, the train enters a double down followed by a double up. After more turns, the train enters a small air-time hill. Outlaw Run's final two inversions are heartline rolls, turns in which the axis of rotation is approximately at the riders' hearts. The train then enters the brake run and returns to the station. A single ride cycle is completed in approximately 1 minute and 27 seconds.
Records.
"Outlaw Run" debuted with the steepest drop, 81°, on any wooden roller coaster in the world at the time. Although the creators of "Outlaw Run" originally planned to claim the record for the only operating wooden roller coaster to feature inversions, the announcement of Hades 360 at Mt. Olympus Water & Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, forced Silver Dollar City to modify their claim; they now cite "Outlaw Run" as the only wooden roller coaster to feature multiple inversions. It is also tied with Colossos at Heide Park as the second fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, with a top speed of . It is expected, however, that some of these records will be broken by "Goliath" at Six Flags Great America in the first half of 2014. "Goliath" is another Rocky Mountain Construction roller coaster and is expected to feature the steepest drop, longest drop, and fastest speed of any wooden roller coaster in the world. "Outlaw Run" will retain the record for the wooden roller coaster with the most inversions.
Reception.
Following the announcement of "Outlaw Run", the ride's layout received favorable reviews. Arthur Levine of About.com said that "the coaster appears to have a great layout and should provide the kind of ride that fans adore". Brady MacDonald of the "Los Angeles Times" ranked "Outlaw Run" in his top 13 most anticipated new theme park attractions in the United States for 2013. Robb Alvey of "Theme Park Review" described the ride layout as "fantastic", saying that "whatever those guys at Rocky Mountain are doing, they are doing it right".
"Outlaw Run" received largely positive reviews following the ride's opening in 2013. Marcus Leshock of "WGN-TV" was among the first to ride "Outlaw Run". Despite his high expectations, he described it as "a great ride; an incredible ride". Brandy McDonnell of "The Oklahoman" described "Outlaw Run" as the highlight of Silver Dollar City: "it's a speedy and spine-tingling ride worth waiting a few hours to take". Tim Baldwin of "Roller Coaster Magazine" described "Outlaw Run" as "exhilarating but not intimidating" and "satisfying to the thrill seekers and fun for moms as well". Justin Garvanovic of "First Drop Magazine", after describing pacing as an important characteristic of a roller coaster, said "So many coasters get it wrong. Outlaw Run gets it right."
In its debut year, "Outlaw Run" ranked highly in "Amusement Today"'s Golden Ticket Awards. The ride won the Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride with 45% of the vote. It also ranked at position 7 for the world's best wooden roller coasters.

William Tyler (architect)

William Tyler RA (18 April 1728 – 6 September 1801) was an English sculptor and architect, and one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.
Early life.
Tyler went to Westminster School, and then studied for some years with leading sculptor Louis François Roubiliac. He married, aged 22, and is said to have initially lived in Dean Street.
Sculpture.
Tyler's office was in Vine Street, St James's, London from 1763 to 1784, and, as a sculptor, he produced various monuments, including that to George Lee, 3rd Earl of Lichfield at Spelsbury in Oxfordshire, and one to Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet of Stamford, Speaker of the House of Commons (1770). A monument in York Minster to vice-admiral Henry Medley is also attributed to Tyler.
Tyler also worked with one of his pupils, Robert Ashton, with whom he produced a monument to scholar Dr Martin Folkes.
Architectural work.
During the late 18th century, he worked as an architect. His designs included:
Royal Academy.
Tyler was a foundation member of the Royal Academy in 1768. Though nominated to the Royal Academy as an architect, he was usually represented at its exhibitions by busts and low reliefs. He exhibited there between 1869 and 1800, starting with a work described in the catalogue as "a marble bas-relief, an Indian, representing North America, offering the produce of that country to Britannia". In later years he did show some architectural drawings, for the "Garden front of a villa" (1782); Dorchester prison (1784); "a Belvidere to be built in a shrubbery" (1785); "the front of a prison" (1786); Bridport Town Hall (1789) and the "Villa Maria" (1800). His address is given in the catalogues as Vine Street until 1784, Gower Street from 1785, and Caroline Street, Bedford Square in 1800.
He appears to have played a leading in a revolt against Sir Joshua Reynolds over the latter's attempts to have Joseph Bonomi elected a full academician and appointed professor of perspective, a dispute which led to Reynolds' temporary resignation from the academy in 1790. In 1795 Tyler and George Dance, were appointed to examine the accounts of the academy following the resignation of Sir William Chambers. The following year Tyler and Dance became the Academy's first auditors, helping put the institution on a sounder financial footing, for which Tyler was presented with a silver cup in 1799.
Tyler died at his home in Caroline Street, Bedford Square, on 6 September 1801.

The Jacob C. Spores House was a house located between south of Coburg and north of Eugene, Oregon, formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was removed from the register on August 1, 2001. The classical revival house underwent an "exceptional" restoration in 1975, but a September 1996 fire "destroyed most, if not all, of the historical value of the house". By 1998 the owners were again restoring the house, but according to the Oregon State Historic Preservation office, as of 2013 the house has been demolished.
Jacob Spores was an early settler of the Coburg area, who started the first ferry across the McKenzie River at the site. The house was thought to be the oldest in Lane County.

Nicole Schmitz

Nicole Cassandra Maturan Schmitz is a Filipino-German beauty titleholder who represented the Republic of the Philippines in the Miss International 2012 pageant on Okinawa, Japan in October 21, 2012 where she placed on the Top 15 semifinalist. It was the same day that Blessed Pedro Calungsod, the second Filipino to be already canonized for sainthood. She is also the third representative of the Philippines who has German blood after Miss International 2010 Top 15 semifinalist Krista Kleiner and Miss International 2009 Top 15 semifinalist Melody Gersbach who died in August 21, 2010 in a car accident.
She is under Rodgil Flores who handled and trained Miss International 2005 Precious Lara Quigaman, Miss International 2008 Top 12 semifinalist Patricia Fernandez, Miss International 2011 Top 15 semifinalist Dianne Necio, Miss World 2005 Top 15 semifinalist Carlene Aguilar, Miss World 2004 Top 5 finalist Karla Bautista, Miss Earth Air 2009 Sandra Seifert and Miss Earth 2008 Karla Henry.
Biography.
She won the title Binibining Pilipinas (Miss Philippines) - International through Binibining Pilipinas 2012 where she was also titled as Best in Swimsuit and Best in National Costume from that edition. In the question-and-answer portion, Schmitz, a law student, was asked by one of the judges John Martin Miller, "Which you would rather be, someone who's respected or someone who is loved and why?" Her answer: "I would rather be someone respected because that means you maintain your integrity, dignity and self-respect and that means that in turn you will be loved by whoever matters and everyone around you." At that time, 'Nicole Schmitz' trended on Twitter both Worldwide and Philippines. Here's an article of an interview after her win: "It was actually a very surreal feeling. It didn’t even sink in for a week and when it did, I just started to cry. I was so happy I was able to make it,” she said. Nicole shared that months before the pageant, she underwent rigorous training in walking, talking and exercise – saying, “I took this pageant seriously and I wanted to make sure that I gave it my best. Luckily, it paid off. It’s really all about determination and perseverance.” <br>[...]<br>
Of course, keeping her busy nowadays are her preparations for the Miss International that will be held in Japan on October. Nicole is undergoing another round of pageant training under the Binibining Pilipinas Foundation, and is brushing up her fluency in Nippongo as well. “I just want to live without regrets,” Nicole said ardently. “There are a lot of things I want to achieve in my life. I don’t want to miss out, I don’t want to look back and go: I should have done that when I could have,” “That’s why I came back to do this pageant,” she explained. “If I don’t do it now, I know I’ll regret it.” Nicole described her pageant experience as a “great” one, as it taught her many valuable things and at the same time, through the foundation’s charity works, she was able to give back to the community. To those who wish to follow her footsteps, Nicole’s simple message was: “I would definitely encourage it. It’s a great experience. More than anything, you learn to be a woman and you develop self-confidence and independence. Then for those girls who are unsure, it doesn’t really matter if you’re the prettiest or the tallest, because it’s really about how you shine on stage.”
After winning, she got a courtesy call from the mayor of her hometown Cebu City specifically in Liloan. She received a token of appreciation. She also had a homecoming on her mother's hometown Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Mindanao. This is where she was also invited as a judge for the Search for BB. Jimenez 2012. She also answered in a different event the question of why "It's More fun in the Philippines": "To be honest, I've just never been anywhere else in the world where the people are so friendly, warm, and able to just have a laugh and joke about themselves. That's truly a unique experience in the Philippines, I think." She adds that the Filipinos find joy in the simplest things and this is one more reason why it is more fun in the Philippines.
Sun.Star said "She has everything one would expect from a beauty queen. She has a statuesque figure, a magnetic doll-like face, and an evident knack for style. Likewise, she has everything that is befitting of a lady who carries the name “Binibining Pilipinas.” She bears the true inner beauty of a Filipina – charm, brilliance, and poise – and indeed, she is a suitable representative to this year’s Miss International beauty pageant." Elaine Kay Moll, Binibining Pilipinas 2012 1st runner-up and Miss Supranational 2012 3rd runner-up believes her fellow Binibining Pilipinas 2012 winner will do great. "Nicole is very determined. All she has to do is be confident, be herself, be fierce, and she'll surely shine." Dianne Elaine Necio, Binibining Pilipinas 2011 - International thinks Nicole will return to the Philippines victorious. She added: "During the coronation night, when they were about to announce my successor, Nicole was one of my top bets. I felt she has what it takes to get the Miss International title," "Nicole was very focused and disciplined all throughout the training. She's ready to battle even before she was given a crown, but she never stops improving and eagerly listens to suggestions. I'm sure she will do well in the competition and bring us the Miss International crown."
Full details about her preparations were later on revealed. What does a day in the life of a beauty-queen-in-training look like? For Nicole, it’s never-ending beauty sessions. She wakes up at 7am to get ready for her Japanese lessons. With the Miss International 2012 being held in Japan, knowing the language will make it easier for her to charm them. After an hour of Domo Arigato Gazaimus etc., Nicole Schmitz heads off to her skin doctor for a facial or a body pampering session. Next on the itinerary: fitting sessions and clothes, clothes, clothes! Bb. Pilipinas tends to be secretive about what their candidates will wear in their international competitions but based on past experience, I’m guessing that Nicole Schmitz will be wearing a competitive gown made by a top South American designer and branded outfits ordered from New York. All will be refitted to make sure they fit her every curve. The outfits a beauty queen brings with her to an international pageant are of prime importance. Many pageants start judging the girls on Day 1, so looking fashionable all the time and wearing the appropriate outfits can add points to Nicole’s scoreboard. Also, knowing that you look great everyday can boost your confidence level which is exactly why the Bb. Pilipinas team takes fashion requirements seriously. After the fittings, it’s time to practice the catwalk. We all know how Shamcey Supsup dominated the stage with her Tsunami Walk in the Miss Universe 2011 so developing a smashing sashay for the stage is crucial for Nicole Schmitz if she is to stand out in a crowd of beauties. It is no easy task to perfect one’s catwalk and even top models in the world continue to find ways to improve the way they move on stage. Physical training is last on the agenda and that involves practicing her talent portion or working out in the gym under the tutelage of fitness guru to the beauty queens, John Jay Cuay. As for preparing for the Q&A, I have no doubt that the well-spoken law student will perform with high marks in this area given her educational background and her great command of English.<br>

Nicole Schmitz has the natural grace of a dancer simply because she happens to be a student of Salsa! The first time I saw her dance was at the Talent Show of Bb. Pilipinas 2012 at the Ali Mall. But Nicole Schmitz won’t be Salsa-ing her way to Okinawa, Japan; she’ll be performing a Poi Dance with flags and LED balls at the Talent Competition of Miss International 2012. Poi is a Maori dance involving the creative swinging of balls or weights that are attached to strings. <br>

For Nicole, getting physically ready for a pageant as big as Miss International involves not just dancing but also some serious gym work. Under the strict eye of fitness expert John Jay Cuay who specializes in training beauty queens for pageants Nicole Schmitz has been able to develop trimmer arms and a leaner waistline. John was able to help her whittle down her abs from 24.5 to 23 inches. In order to maintain her lean and competitive body, Nicole Schmitz has gone Vegan and has temporarily removed bread and rice from her diet. It’s her first time to go Vegan and she’s seriously considering it as a lifestyle even after the Miss International 2012 beauty pageant is over.
<br>
[...]<br>
Indeed, Nicole Schmitz has a solid gameplan for the Miss International 2012: keep positive, do as many preps as possible and make adjustments along the way. But she’s not leaving it all to that; Nicole believes hard work still needs a smile from lady luck. So her prep team actually includes a Feng Shui expert who has been instructing her as to what charms to wear, what colors will give her good joss, what things to do and avoid and even what direction to sleep in at night! According to the Feng Shui expert, after looking at star charts based on her birth date and time, Nicole Schmitz has luck on her side as she competes for the Miss International 2012 title.
Schmitz had a send-off party last September 27, 2012. She will depart to Japan on October 1, 2012 for the said international pageant. It will be a second trip to Japan for Nicole who went on a winter tour of Tokyo, Nagoya, Hiroshima and Osaka in 2008. But before that, she was interviewed and she answered: “I’ve been preparing myself for several months mentally, spiritually, emotionally and of course, physically,” “We have won four Miss International titles so far so it’s a big challenge for me to bring home a fifth one. But I’m keeping my fingers crossed,” “Precious Lara is my role model,” “I will meet up with her for some tips. If I’m lucky enough to win, the first thing I’d do is board the next plane home so I can share the crown and celebrate with my kababayan,” She was also asked if she would join showbiz like her predecessors, she replied: “I love to sing and dance but don’t know how to act. I prefer TV hosting.” In another interview that talked about her preparations for the pageant: "There are a lot of preparations. It's getting a little bit scary now, because it's closer, but we're doing a variety of things. We go to the gym to get more toned, more fit, and healthier. We also get health checkups, eating well to make sure I don't get sick, and recently we started to have personality development classes, language, history about the Philippines, and just interviewing skills, things like that," Nicole reveals.
[...] In addition through Philippine Star: “I’m just so thrilled about the opportunity to bring honor to our country. If I’m lucky enough to win, the first thing I’d want to do is celebrate my victory with my fellow Filipinos,” said Nicole who believes that the modern Filipina is someone who confidently pushes for what she believes in. She also revealed her plans after she’s done with her beauty queen duties. “In the near future, I’d like to focus on Psychology here in the Philippines as it’s something that’s not really touched upon. My law degree would also come in handy for the legal aspects of it. Of course, the possibilities after the Miss International tilt are endless, and the future is open to just about everything, even show business.” Cosmopolitan Philippines had a chat with her before her departure for Japan:Name one common misconception people have about beauty queens?
<br>
I think probably one of the most obvious ones is that we’re all beauty and no brains. But you know, if you really pay attention watching beauty pageants these days, you’ll really see that we’re all trying to achieve a lot, we’re all college students or graduates, and we all want to make a difference.
<br>[...]<br>
You're a law student and a beauty queen. Is it easy or hard to reconcile the two?
<br>
I think you can always find a way to integrate all aspects of your life, and being a lawyer definitely helps me in the question and answer portion, and I think both are having advocacy, arguing for what’s right.
<br>[...]<br>
How does being a law student influence your beauty queen persona?
<br>
I think both require a strong stance and a strong personality and a strong aura. So I guess being a law student has given me the confidence to be able to stand in front of a crowd and you know get my point across.
<br>[...]<br>
What’s your number one advocacy?
<br>
I think I really love to focus on children; they’re really my passion. Even in the psychology side, that’s what I’d like to focus on. really want to help their welfare, their health, their interests and inspire them to really reach their potential.
<br>[...]<br>
What’s your everyday style?
<br>
I think I have a very feminine look. I like clothes that flatter my shape especially, I guess, highlighting my small waist. I also like to feel comfortable. Relaxed yet feminine.
<br>[...]<br>
Flats versus stilettos? Dresses versus jeans?
<br>
Well, as a beauty queen, we should always wear stilettos. Generally, I enjoy wearing flats; more comfortable. I feel more relaxed day to day. [As for dresses versus jeans, there’s a time and place for both, but I like dresses; they’re more feminine and girly.
<br>[...]<br>
Who is your style icon?
<br>
Especially since I’m joining the 2012 Miss International Pageant, I would say that my style icon is Audrey Hepburn. She’s very timeless, classic, beautiful, feminine--all things that I want to embody as well.
<br>[...]<br>
Beauty queens are always viewed as eternally poised, perfectly polished ladies. Tell us a fun, un-beauty queen-like fact about you?
<br>
Well, I really like outdoor activities and extreme sports. I love the thrill of those types of things. I love rollercoasters. I love going camping. I hiked to the top of Mt. Pinatubo. I love adventure like water rafting, bungee jumping, things like that.
<br>[...]<br>
What’s the most fearless thing you’ve done so far in terms of sports?
<br>
I’ve done whitewater kayaking by myself in a small town in Boracay area, Antique. And they have really wild rapids. I’ve never done it before but I just went there, put on my helmet and went by myself and went kayaking. It was really fun.
<br>[...]<br>
Any advice for fun, fearless Cosmo girls?
<br>
Well I think as a young, independent Filipino woman of today, you can be anything you want to be. So just continue being fun and fearless. Try extreme sports like me; you can still be feminine, poised, and beautiful like a beauty queen. Don’t be discouraged. Just do it Put yourself out there and give it a shot.
She also entered Top 13 in Binibining Pilipinas 2007. In the question-and-answer portion, she was asked by one of the judges Miss Universe 1994 Philippines' representative Charlene Gonzales: "What is your biggest fear and what have you done to overcome it?" Her response: "My greatest fear is actually having regret. In anyone's life, it doesn't benefit them if they're gonna regret something so what I do to combat that is that I just make sure that everything I do its because I want to do it. I don't do something with any doubts in my mind. I do it with sureness and I'm very confident in myself and in that way, that's how I combat that. Thank you." Having joined the pageant for the second time, Nicole already knew what to expect, something that helped her stay focused during the Binibining Pilipinas pageant. Her experience is also a plus when she starts preparing for the Miss International pageant. “It showed me more what to expect in terms of the length of the pageant, the importance of getting proper rest and eating right. But I guess the biggest thing for me, is knowing that you really have to be focused from beginning to end, every step of the way. And if you give your heart to it the entire time, that’s the biggest difference. I did that this time, and luckily, I got one of the crowns,” she says.
She entered the top 15 on Miss International 2012 continuing the streak of the Philippines now for five years. She had her final speech as: “Peace, love, unity, these 3 words are the Miss International pageant. Having spent the past 3 weeks in Okinawa, I have witnessed the special connection it has with the world. Globalization and multi cultural diversity can exist. We can be uniquely global and globally unique. This is my mission. I want people to appreciate that we not only belong to local communities but world at large. By this understanding we can contribute to global goals. I am standing here in front of you open to offer my heritage and myself, as a strong compassionate responsible and independent woman in this quest for global harmony. And I can stand here proudly and consider myself an international citizen.”
She has been doing modelling internationally on the side for 7 years now. As a result, She has extensive experience in ramp and print. She described herself as a "pretty laid-back and easy-going, although she is not into nudity or sleazy pictures. Sophisticated sexy and edgy attitude is what she's into. She believes with this mixture gives me unique look, something that can be played upon and developed in pictures." Nicole is currently studying Law/Psychology at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia and is expected to graduate with honors.

Brattain–Hadley House

The Brattain–Hadley House was located in Springfield, Oregon and was formerly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fire destroyed much of the house in 1997, and in 2012 a demolition contractor removed the house for safety reasons.
Paul Brattain, an 1852 pioneer, obtained a 160-acre donation land claim soon after moving from Iowa to Oregon. The Brattain farm was entirely within modern Springfield city limits. 
When Brattain died in 1893, his descendants built the Queen Anne style house. Paul Hadley, Brattain's grandson, was the last of Brattain's descendants to occupy the house in the 1940s. Hadley's daughter, Mary Hadley Callis, allowed vagrants to occupy the house until the 1997 fire. The house was removed from the National Register on May 8, 2012.

Plantwise

Plantwise is a global programme of the Centre for Agriculture Bioscience International (CABI) to reduce crop losses and improve food security by collecting and sharing information about plant health. Plantwise aims to establish plant clinics to help smallholder farmers lose less of what they grow to pests and diseases. It also brings together detailed pest and disease distribution data and plant health information from around the world, making it available in a global Knowledge Bank. Plantwise is an alliance of international partners, who provide content or funding to support the programme.
Methodology.
The Plantwise methodology is about sharing knowledge. At 'plant clinics' farmers present their failing crops to CABI-trained 'plant doctors', who seek to diagnose and recommend treatment for the 'patient'. The plant doctors are well-trained but are also locals and are thus able to offer advice that is relevant and actionable, overcoming any resourcing, cultural or logistical challenges. This knowledge and advice provided by the plant doctors' can help to prevent the losses of crops (up to 40%) which are so dangerous to small-holder farmers.

Gambia Colony and Protectorate

The Gambia Colony and Protectorate was part of the British Empire in the New Imperialism era. The colony was the immediate area surrounding Bathurst, and the protectorate the inland territory situated around the Gambia River, which was declared in 1894. The foundation of the colony was Fort James and Bathurst, where British presence was established in 1815 and 1816, respectively. For various periods in its existence it was subordinate to the Sierra Leone colony, however by 1888 it was a colony in its own right with a permanently appointed Governor.
The boundaries of the territory were an issue of contention between the British and French authorities due to the proximity to French Senegal;. this was resolved in 1889. Additionally, on numerous occasions the British government had attempted to exchange it with France for other territories, such as on the upper Niger River.
The colony ended in 1965 when Gambia became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations, with Dawda Jawara as Prime Minister.
Economy.
The economy of the Gambia, like other African countries at the time, was very heavily orientated towards agriculture. Reliance on the groundnut became so strong that it made up almost the entirety of exports, making the economy vulnerable. Groundnuts were the only commodity subject to export duties The export duties resulted in the illegal smuggling of the product to French Senegal.
Attempts were made to increase production of other goods for export: the Gambian Poultry Scheme pioneered by the Colonial Development Corporation aimed to produce twenty million eggs and one million lb of dressed poultry a year. The conditions in the Gambia proved unfavourable and typhoid killed much of the chicken stock, drawing criticism to the Corporation.
Transport.
The River Gambia was the principal route of navigation and transport inland, with a port at Bathurst. The road network was mainly concentrated around Bathurst, with the remaining areas largely connected by dirt roads.
The only airport was at Yundum, built in World War II. Post war it was used for passenger flights. Both British South American Airways and the British Overseas Airways Corporation had services, the former moving its service to Dakar, which had a concrete runway (as opposed to pierced steel planking). The airport was rebuilt in 1963 and the building is still in use today.
Independence.
In anticipation of independence, efforts were made to create internal self-government. The 1960 Constitution created a partly elected House of Representatives, with 19 elected members and 8 chosen by the chiefs. This constitution proved flawed in the 1960 elections when the two major parties tied with 8 seats each. With the support of the unelected chiefs, Pierra Sarr N'Jie of the United Party was appointed Chief Minister. Dawda Jawara of the People's Progressive Party resigned as Minister of Education, triggering a Constitutional Conference arranged by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The Constitutional Conference paved the way for a new constitution that granted a greater degree of self-government and a House of Representatives with more elected members. Elections were held in 1962, with Jawara's Progressive Party securing a majority of the elected seats. Under the new constitutional arrangements, Jawara was appointed Prime Minister: a position he held until it was abolished in 1970.
Following agreements between the British and Gambian Governments in July 1964, Gambia became independent on 18 February 1965.

Władysław Łuszczkiewicz

Władysław Łuszczkiewicz (September 3, 1828 – May 23, 1900) was a Polish historical painter of the late Romantic era from Kraków, active in the period of the foreign partitions of Poland. He was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts and served as its principal in 1893/95. One of his best students was Jan Matejko, the eminent Polish historical painter and later, his close associate. Łuszczkiewicz taught painting, drawing, anatomy and architectural styles. Highly educated, he also worked as conservator of architectural monuments in the city later on in his career, and wrote historical dissertations.
Life.
Władysław Łuszczkiewicz was born in Kraków in 1828 and after graduating from St Anne High School (where his father Michał of the Rola coat of arms was a professor), he enrolled at the Department of History of the Jagiellonian University. At the same time, he began to study painting at the School of Fine Arts with Wojciech Stattler and Jan Nepomucen Głowacki. His talent was rewarded with a scholarship which enabled Łuszczkiewicz to continue his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1849. While in France, he also developed his lifelong interest in historicism.
Łuszczkiewicz began to teach art while still a student himself. His beloved Kraków was under the military rule of Austria-Hungary, and all fields of education were grossly neglected. He often gave private art classes for free to struggling artists. Łuszczkiewicz was nominated as professor at the Academy in 1877. Among his students (aside from Matejko) were the future luminaries of Polish art of the turn-of-the-century including Artur Grottger, Aleksander Kotsis, Józef Mehoffer, Jacek Malczewski, Stanisław Wyspiański and Wojciech Weiss. He introduced them to plein-air painting by organizing trips to places of historical significance outside the city. In 1883 he was chosen as director of the National Museum in Kraków. In 1893/95 he served as rector of the Academy of Fine Arts. His own historical paintings filled with knowledge of period artifacts and costume, were a great source of inspiration for Jan Matejko. They often came into being as pictorial representations of his scientific discoveries and literature on the subject. He stopped painting towards the end of his life and turned entirely to writing and art conservation advocacy. In recognition of his work, Łuszczkiewicz was awarded the title of doctor honoris causa of the Jagiellonian University in 1900, and died in Kraków prior to award ceremony in the same year. He was married to Malwina Ramloff (1858) and had four children: Napoleon, Zofia, Wojciech Józef, and Maria.

Acadian Civil War

The Acadian Civil War (1640-1645) was fought between competing governors of the French province of Acadia. Governor Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour (a Protestant) had been granted one area of territory by King Louis XIV, and Charles de Menou d'Aulnay (a Catholic) had been granted another area. The divisions made by the king were geographically uninformed, and the two territories and their administrative centers overlapped. The conflict was intensified by personal animosity between the two governors, and came to an end when d'Aulnay successfully expelled la Tour from his holdings. D'Aulnay's success was effectively overturned after his death when la Tour married D'Aulnay's widow in 1653.
Historical context.
In 1635, Governor of Acadia Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay moved settlers from present-day LaHave, Nova Scotia to Port-Royal (present day Annapolis Royal), and the Acadian people began to establish their roots. Under d'Aulnay, the Acadians built the first dykes in North America and cultivated the reclaimed salt marshes.
During this time, Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war; the two main centres were Port-Royal (present day Annapolis Royal), where d'Aulnay was stationed, and present-day Saint John, New Brunswick, where Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour was stationed.
The strategic location at the mouth of the St. John River was fortified by Charles de la Tour in 1631. The fort was named Fort Sainte Marie (AKA Fort La Tour) and was located on the east side of the river. To the west of the St. John River, Fort Saint-Jean was later built (c. 1790).
Both La Tour and d'Aulnay had claims of some legitimacy to the governorship of Acadia because the French Imperial officials made their appointments with an incomplete understanding of the geography of the area. LaTour had a fortified settlement at the mouth of the Saint John River while d'Aulnay's base was at Port Royal some 45 miles across the Bay of Fundy. In adjoining New England, the people supported LaTour's claim since he allowed them to fish and lumber in and along the Bay of Fundy without let or hindrance while d'Aulnay aggressively sought payment for that right. Word came to LaTour that d'Aulnay was concentrating men and materials for an attack on LaTour's fort and fur-trading operation at the mouth of the Saint John River. La Tour went to Boston to ask John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts Bay colony, for help. Winthrop arranged for several merchants to advance loans unofficially to La Tour for his purchase of men and material to defend the Saint John River fort from d'Aulnay's attack.
War.
Battle of Port Royal (1640).
La Tour arrived from present-day Saint John, and attacked Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal) with two armed ships. D'Aulnay's captain was killed and La Tour and his men were taken prisoner. In response to the attack, d'Aulnay sailed out of Port-Royal to establish a blockade of La Tour's fort at present-day Saint John.
Blockade of St. John (1642).
For five months, the Governor of Acadia d'Aulnay, who was stationed at Port Royal, created a blockade of the river to defeat La Tour at his fort. On 14 July 1643, La Tour arrived from Boston with four ships and a complement of 270 men to repossess Fort Sainte-Marie. After this victory, La Tour went on to attack d'Aulnay at Port Royal, Nova Scotia. LaTour was unsuccessful then in catching d'Aulnay and the rivalry continued for several more years.
Battle of Penobscot (1643).
D'Aulnay was stationed at Penobscot (present-day Castine, Maine). La Tour attacked in July with 140 men on four ships. Several on both sides were killed in the action.
Battle of Port Royal (1643).
In 1643, La Tour tried to capture Port-Royal again. La Tour arrived at Saint John from Boston with a fleet a five armed vessels and 270 men and broke the blockade. La Tour then chased d'Aulnay's vessels back across the Bay of Fundy to Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal). D'Aulnay resisted the attack, and seven of his men were wounded and three killed. La Tour did not attack the fort, which was defended by twenty soldiers. La Tour burned the mill, killed the livestock and seized furs, gunpowder and other supplies.
Siege of St. John (1645).
While La Tour was in Boston, on Easter Sunday 13 April 1645, d'Aulnay sailed across the Bay of Fundy and arrived at La Tour's fort with a force of two hundred men. La Tour's soldiers were led by his wife, Françoise-Marie Jacquelin, who became known as the Lioness of LaTour for her valiant defence of the fort. After a five-day battle, on 18 April, d'Aulnay offered quarter to all if Francoise-Marie were to surrender the fort. On that basis, knowing she was badly outnumbered, she capitulated and d'Aulnay had captured La Tour's Fort Sainte-Marie. D'Aulnay then reneged on his pledge of safety for the defenders and treacherously hanged the La Tour garrison while Madame de la Tour was forced to watch with a rope around her neck. Three weeks later, while still in d'Aulnay's hands, she died. With the death of his wife and the loss of his fort, La Tour did not return to Acadia for the next four years, until after d'Aulnay died in 1650.
Afterward.
After defeating La Tour at Saint John, from the capital Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal), d'Aulnay administered posts at LaHave, Nova Scotia; Pentagouet (Castine, Maine); Canso, Nova Scotia; Cap Sable (Port La Tour, Nova Scotia); the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) and Miscou Island. He died in 1650, opening the governorship of Acadia, and prompting La Tour to return. He married d'Aulnay's widow in 1653, ending the rivalry. The couple had five children, and hundreds of their descendants live in the Canadian Maritimes today.
Four years later, Colonel Robert Sedgwick led one hundred New England volunteers and two hundred of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers to capture Port Royal, Nova Scotia. Prior to the battle, Sedgewick captured and plundered La Tour's fort on the St. John River and took him prisoner.

Kiruna dialect

The Kiruna dialect () is a dialect of Swedish spoken in the northern city of Kiruna and the surrounding municipality.
The pure Kiruna dialect is strongly influenced by Finnish and Meänkieli, presumably as a result of immigration from the east. Northern Sami, the original language of the area, has left comparatively little impact on the dialect. In addition, the Kiruna dialect bears a patchwork of small influences from numerous other dialects and languages from the south, including Varmlandic, Jamtlandic, Westrobothnian, Scanian, Danish, Västgötska and Angermanlandic. This is because Kiruna had become a prominent settler town by the end of the 1800s, with immigrants flocking to it from across the country.
A characteristic trait of the dialect is the word "jo" ("yes", especially after a negative question or in quick conversation), pronounced approximately as [] (found in many places in northern Norrland). This is not always used, however, and is only pronounced with ingressive airflow. Another distinctive trait of the Kiruna dialect is a heavy alveolar trill.
The Kiruna dialect is fairly commonly spoken in comparison to more endangered North Swedish dialects such as the genuine dialects of Norrbotten and Westrobothnia Lower Luleå dialect and the Lower Kalix dialect. Unlike these dialects, the Kiruna dialect does not drop word endings. The Kiruna dialect is not a genuine dialect but standard Swedish with mixed regional influences, this is in contrast to the genuine Nordic dialects spoken in the coast of Norrbotten (Piteå, Luleå and Kalix) that form a part of the Westrobothnian dialect continuum that differ from standard Swedish to the extent of not being mutually intelligible without prior knowledge.

Philemona Williamson

Philemona Williamson (born 1951) is a well-known artist from New York City.
Biography.
Williamson was born in New York City in 1951.
Her African-American parents were employed by a wealthy Greek family, and she grew up in their Manhattan home.
She recalls a diversity of cultures but no racism when growing up.
Her father was the chauffeur and her mother the housekeeper.
She said of the environment in the home on Sutton Place that she and her parents maintained "a kind of quiet gentility" while their employers were involved in an endless "Greek passion play."
She attended Bennington College, earning a Bachelor's degree in 1973, and went on to New York University where she obtained a Master's in painting in 1979.
At Bennington College she embraced post-modernism, despite the fashion for abstraction in the art department.
Williamson has worked at Parsons School of Design, The Getty Institute for Education in the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Bard College, Rhode Island School of Design and Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
She was awarded a Joan Mitchell Foundation grant in 1997.
Other awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Painting (1988), Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (1990) and New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship (1991). 
Williamson belongs to the Brooklyn Art Association.
As of 2010 Williamson lived and worked in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, with a studio in Bloomfield.
Work and reception.
Williamson prefers to paint with oil on linen.
Many of her pictures show children and adolescents, drawing on her imagination and her own childhood. 
The paintings, in vibrant colors, may be interpreted as showing sadness or childhood innocence. 
Her work is postmodernist, figurative art in which she explores her private identity.
She has said, "I do not make 'black art'. If my work bridges racial gaps, it is because I am sharing a part of myself and I happen to be black. My paintings are about my fascination with color and shape."
In her words, "My paintings are of pre-adolescent girls and boys, children on the cusp of adulthood. The figures struggle to balance their innocence and awkwardness with their newfound sexuality. The figures are involved in their own drama when the observer discovers them; it is a surprise to both. The questions begin at this point…Who are these children? What are they doing and why? Ethnicity and gender are questioned."
According to art essayist Nina Felshin, "Life, in Philemona Williamson's paintings, appears to be a balancing act in which there are two sides to every coin and the action intentionally raises more questions than it answers." 
Art critic Catherine Bernard has said, "The tension of the figures, the colors, and the distortion of space are all shadows, however faint, of our dismembered memories." 
In 1992 she received an Arts in Transit Poster Commission at New York's Union Square Station.
Her "Folktales from Around the World" (2003) is a set of four glass mosaic murals at the Glen Oaks Campus School in Queens.
Her work is held by the Sheldon Museum of Art in Lincoln, Nebraska; the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina; Hampton University museum in Hampton, Virginia; Mott-Warsh Art Collection, Flint, Michigan; Reader's Digest Art Collection and AT&T. 
Her "Seasons" decorates the Livonia Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line) subway station in New York City.
This 2007 work is a set of stained glass windows on the platform windscreens depicted events related to the four seasons of meteorology.
Her pictures have been published as illustrations in "Harper's Magazine".
Exhibitions.
In 1994, Williamson's work was shown as part of the American contingent at the IV Bienal Internacional de Pintura en Cuenca, Ecuador. Other American artists exhibiting at this show were Donald Locke, Whitfield Lovell, Emilio Cruz and Freddy Rodríguez. 
Williamson's work has been displayed in many group and individual exhibitions in locations such as SUNY College in Old Westbury, New York; the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the African American Museum in Hempstead, New York; the Queens Museum of Art in New York City, the Montclair Art Museum and the Bronx Museum of the Arts in New York City.
