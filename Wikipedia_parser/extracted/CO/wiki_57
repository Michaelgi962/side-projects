Nova Scotia Highway 125

Highway 125 is a 28 km long controlled-access highway located in Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The provincial government named it Peacekeepers Way on August 18, 2008.
Part of the provincial 100-series arterial highway network, Highway 125 encircles the west side of Sydney Harbour, from an interchange with Highway 105 (the Trans-Canada Highway) at Sydney Mines to Trunk 4 (Grand Lake Road) immediately east of Sydney.
Route description.
The northern third of the highway was upgraded during the late 1990s and early 2000s from a two-lane freeway to a twinned 4-lane freeway. Particularly problematic was the fact that the highway passes in proximity to Pottle Lake, the water supply reservoir for North Sydney, which required installation of pollution control monitoring and containment systems.
Approximately 6 km of the highway near its midpoint is currently slated for similar upgrading. As well, the province is completing the planning and design for the twinning of the remaining two-lane section of the highway, between Exit 6 (with Trunk 4/Kings' Rd) and Exit 9 (also with Trunk 4/Grand Lake Rd).
In 2002 a connector road was built from the Grand Lake Road interchange which gives access to the port of Sydney at the former Sydney Steel Corporation property which is now an industrial park.
In the fall of 2006, an additional interchange was opened at Coxheath Road, offering direct access to the communities of Coxheath, Blacketts Lake, and the Cantley Village subdivision.
In January 2008, a public meeting was held to discuss the required infrastructure to finally twin Highway 125 from its six lane divided portion in Sydney River to its eastern terminus at Grand Lake Road. The design work and implementation will require the construction of a roundabout at the George Street exit (in addition to the roundabout at the Alexandra Street exit that was completed in December 2009), as well as over-pass structures for George Street, and Cow Bay Road/Upper Prince Street. The Cow Bay Road/Upper Prince Street overpass has now been cancelled, and a round-a-about is being proposed for Exit 9. At-grade intersections will be eliminated, and access roads will be constructed for a DND small arms range between Exits 8 (George Street) and Exit 9 (Grand Lake Road/SPAR), as well as the fresh water reservoir. The project is expected to be completed in 2012.
On December 4, 2010, twinning was completed from Exit 4 near Balls Creek to Exit 5A near Coxheath.
History.
The highway was built in the late 1950s - early 1960s and extended from North Sydney to Point Edward but branched off in Point Edward and continued along Nova Scotia Route 305 then Trunk 5 until Sydney River. When Highway 125 bypassed the Trunk 5 sections of 125 in the late 1960s - early 1970s it became a controlled access highway for a lot of the highway. In 1970 the highway extended to Grand Lake Road bypassing Sydney to Nova Scotia Trunk 4. In the 1990s the highway became twinned from Balls Creek - Upper North Sydney and from the late 1990s- early 2000s it was twinned around North Sydney and waterlines were placed around Pottle Lake. In 2010 the highway was twinned from Point Edward to Sydney River. Currently, the Province of Nova Scotia is working on dividing the highway between Sydney River and Grand Lake Road.

Carbol fuchsin

Carbol fuchsin, carbol-fuchsin, or carbolfuchsin, is a mixture of phenol and basic fuchsin, used in bacterial staining procedures. It is commonly used in the staining of mycobacteria as it has an affinity for the mycolic acids found in their cell membranes. 
It is a component of Ziehl-Neelsen stain.
Carbol fuchsin is used as a dye to detect acid fast bacteria because it is more soluble in the cells wall lipids than in the acid alcohol. If the bacteria is acid fast the bacteria will retain the initial red color of the dye because they are able to resist the destaining by acid alcohol.
Carbol-fuchsin is also used as a topical antiseptic. 
Its CAS number is . It is also known as Castellani's paint in the US.

Non-abidance

In Buddhism, especially the Chan (Zen) traditions, non-abidance (in Sanskrit: "apratiṣṭhita", with the "a-" prefix, ‘unlimited’, ‘unlocalized’) is the practice of avoiding mental constructs during daily life. That is, other than while engaged in meditation ("zazen").
Some schools of Buddhism, especially the Mahāyāna, consider "apratisthita-nirvana" ("non-abiding cessation") to be the highest form of Buddhahood, more profound than "pratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa", the ‘localized’, lesser form.
Term.
Here, "abide" is used to translate "pratiṣṭhita", meaning "to be contained in locale" or "situated", from the prefix "prati-" ('towards', 'in the direction of') and "ṣṭhita" ('established', 'set up').
To translate "pratiṣṭhita", Chinese Buddhists used "zhù" (住), literally "to reside, lodge, remain". Both "wúsuǒzhù" (無所住 'no means of staying') and "wúzhù" (無住 'not staying') are used for "apratiṣṭhita".
Sutras.
The "Diamond Sutra", a classic Buddhist text, is primarily concerned with the idea of non-abidance. The concept seems to have originated with the 1st-century Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, whose version of "śūnyatā", or emptiness, entails that entities neither exist, nor do they not exist.
Realizing the depth of this concept was also responsible of a Chan master's sudden enlightenment. The "Platform Sutra" relates how the spiritual patriarch Huineng was enlightened after hearing his master Hongren reciting from the "Diamond Sutra":
Huineng then responded that self-natures are intrinsically pure, cannot be genereated or extinguished, are self-sufficient and capable of generating "dharma".
However, this key incident, though found in the majority of texts, is absent in the older Dunhuang version.
The scholar-monk Qisong (契嵩) also noted in his foreword of the "Platform Sutra":
Non-abiding leads to "prajñā" (wisdom), as it enables one to consider that worldly issues are empty, so there is no point in retaliation or disputes.

Artena

Artena is a town and "comune" in the province of Rome, Italy. It is situated in the northwest of Monti Lepini, in the upper valley of the Sacco River. It is approximately southeast by rail, and direct from Rome. 
Economy is based on agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism.
History.
The name of the original village of the Volsci is uncertain; "Ecetra "or "Fortinum" are possible suggestions. 
In the Middle Ages it was a fief of various Roman baronal families, such as the Colonna, the Orsini and the Borghese.
The modern village was called Monte Fortino until 1873. It owes its present name to an unproven identification of the site with the ancient Volscian Artena, destroyed in 404 BC. Another Artena, which belonged to the district of Caere, and lay between it and Veii, was destroyed in the period of the kings, and its site is unknown.
Main sights.
On the mountain above the village are the fine remains of the fortifications of a city built in the 6th or 5th century BC, in cyclopean blocks of local limestone. Within the walls are traces of buildings, and a massive terrace which supported some edifice of importance. 
Other sights include the "Palazzo Borghese" (17th century), and the churches of Santa Maria delle Letizie, Santa Croce, Santo Stefano Protomartire and San Francesco.

Camille Rose Garcia

Camille Rose Garcia (born November 18, 1970) is a Los Angeles-based lowbrow artist. She produces paintings, prints and sculpture in a gothic, "creepy" cartoon style. She cites as influences Walt Disney and Philip K. Dick.
Biography.
Garcia's parents met in music school. Her father was a film producer and anti-Vietnam activist, and her mother was a muralist from Northern California. Garcia's parents had divorced when she was young and her mother raised her and her sister, within close proximity to Disneyland.
Camille Rose Garcia received her Master of Fine Arts degree at University of California at Davis in 1994 and her BFA from Otis College of Art and Design in 1992. Six years of art school left her disillusioned and bitter, so she decided to move back home to Huntington Beach, California, and started a band, The Real Minx.
Garcia's work has appeared in "Modern Painters, Juxtapoz, Rolling Stone, Flaunt," and "BLAB!" magazines. She also contributed work to ohGr's second album, "SunnyPsyOp".
She has published three books, "The Saddest Place on Earth," (Last Gasp, 2006), "The Magic Bottle: A BLAB! Storybook," (Fantagraphics, 2006) and "Tragic Kingdom " (Last Gasp, 2007) .
She illustrated a version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in 2010. "The original illustrations by John Tenniel have always been some of my favorites," said Garcia in a recent interview when asked about the book. "I have three copies of the book here because I collect children's stories. That's one of my favorite stories because it's actually a real dark story. She falls down the hole and no one is really nice to her at all. Pretty much every character she encounters, they're not really on her side. So re-reading it I realized I could do a little bit darker of an interpretation than the original illustrations."
Her work also appears in the permanent collections of LACMA and the San Jose Museum of Art.
On November 2, 2013, Garcia was part of a four woman show in Los Angeles called "Black Moon" with fellow female artists, Jessicka Addams, Elizabeth McGrath and Marion Peck.
Critical reception.
Paula Rogers, a KQED art critic and self-styled fan of Camille Rose Garcia, reviewed Garcia’s mid-career retrospective, "Tragic Kingdom: The Art of Camille Rose Garcia at the San Jose Museum of Art": 
“Garcia’s pretty pictures (lack) specific meaning and specific context…their insistent vagueness, smugness, blanket pronouncements, lack of nuance and grating self-righteousness add up to a static portrait / shallow response to something complex: "I get it; things are bad". It's disappointing to find out that the impetus for these works isn't skillful.”

Asciano

Asciano is a "comune" and hill town in the province of Siena in the Italian region Tuscany. It is located at the centre of the Crete senesi between the river Ombrone and the torrent Copra, some southeast of the town of Siena by rail.
History.
Asciano has origins as Etruscan, Roman and Lombard settlements. A 5th century BC Etruscan necropolis has been excavated nearby and remains of Roman baths, with a fine mosaic pavement, were found within the town in 1898. During the medieval period its location made it a site of contest between Siena and Florence: the Battle of Montaperti was fought in the nearby on 4 September 1260. The village was purchased by the Sienese in 1285 and surrounded by walls in 1351, and has some 14th-century churches with paintings of the same period.
Main sights.
Asciano has the 11th century Romanesque basilica of Sant'Agata which was built of travertine. The church, with its aisleless nave topped by a truss roof, is adorned with decorative elements of the Lombard type. Outside is its 13th century campanile. The interior houses two 16th-century frescoes, one by Il Sodoma and a "Pietà" attributed to Bartolomeo Neroni.
Adjoining the church is the Museo d'Arte Sacra where works by painters in the Sienese manner of the 14th and 15th centuries are exhibited. The Museo Archeologico contains finds from the excavation of chamber tombs from the cemetery of Poggio Pinci.
10 kilometers (6 mi) to the south is the large Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, mother-house of the Olivetans and founded in 1320. The cloister is famous for the series of frescoes illustrating scenes from the legend of St. Benedict begun by Luca Signorelli and completed by il Sodoma in 1505. The latter master's work is perhaps nowhere better represented than here. The church contains fine inlaid choir stalls by Fra Giovanni da Verona. The buildings, which are mostly of red brick, are conspicuous against the grey clayey and sandy soil—the "" which give this area of Tuscany its name. The monastery is described by Pope Pius II in his "Commentaria".

Joel Hirschhorn

Joel Hirschhorn (December 18, 1937 – September 17, 2005) was an American songwriter. He won the Academy Award for Best Song on two occasions. He also wrote songs for a number of musicians, including Elvis Presley and Roy Orbison. Hirschhorn was born in the Bronx and attended the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan. After graduating, Hirschhorn became a regular performer on New York’s nightclub circuit, both as a solo singer and as a member of the rock & roll band, The Highlighters. 
During the mid-1960s, Hirschhorn branched out into writing film soundtracks. The first score he wrote was for "Who Killed Teddy Bear?" (1965), which was directed by his friend Joseph Cates. He worked with Cates again the following year in "The Fat Spy". However, the film was received so badly that Hirschhorn struggled to find work in Hollywood for a number of years afterwards.
Hirschhorn, along with songwriting partner Al Kasha, did not work on another film until 1970’s "The Cheyenne Social Club", which was directed by Gene Kelly. It was the pair’s next effort, for "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), that really made their name. "The Morning After", a song they wrote in a single evening, won them their first Oscar and also topped the Billboard chart.
"The Towering Inferno" (1974) provided Hirschhorn and Kasha with their second Oscars, this time for the "We May Never Love Like This Again". Following this success, the pair received two further Oscar nominations, both for their work on "Pete's Dragon" (1977).
Hirschhorn and Kasha continued to work together until the late 1990s, their final collaboration being "Rescue Me" (1998). The pair also worked together on a number of Broadway musicals, receiving Tony Award for Best Original Score nominations for both "Copperfield" and "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers". Late in his career, Hirschhorn wrote "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Songwriting", which was first published in 2001.

<doc id="2891978" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2891978" title="Multi-chip module">
Multi-chip module

A multi-chip module (MCM) is a specialized electronic package where multiple integrated circuits (ICs), semiconductor dies or other discrete components are packaged onto a unifying substrate, facilitating their use as a single component (as though a larger IC). The MCM itself will often be referred to as a "chip" in designs, thus illustrating its integrated nature.
Overview.
Multi-Chip Modules come in a variety of forms depending on the complexity and development philosophies of their designers. These can range from using pre-packaged ICs on a small printed circuit board (PCB) meant to mimic the package footprint of an existing chip package to fully custom chip packages integrating many chip dies on a High Density Interconnection (HDI) substrate.
Multi-Chip Module packaging is an important facet of modern electronic miniaturization and micro-electronic systems. MCMs are classified according to the technology used to create the HDI (High Density Interconnection) substrate.
Chip stack MCMs.
A relatively new development in MCM technology is the so-called "chip-stack" package. Certain ICs, memories in particular, have very similar or identical pinouts when used multiple times within systems. A carefully designed substrate can allow these dies to be stacked in a vertical configuration making the resultant MCM's footprint much smaller (albeit at the cost of a thicker or taller chip). Since area is more often at a premium in miniature electronics designs, the chip-stack is an attractive option in many applications such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). After a thinning process, as many as ten dies can be stacked to create a high capacity SD memory card.

Sony eVilla

The Sony eVilla is a discontinued Internet appliance from Sony. After 18 months of development, it was released to the public on June 14, 2001 for $499 USD. With the additional $21.95 USD monthly fee, users could access the Internet, send and receive e-mail, play audio and video, and save files to Sony's Memory Stick.
After less than three months in the market, Sony discontinued the product on September 13, 2001. Customers received full refunds for the product and the monthly subscription fee. Spokesman John Dolak remarked that " product did not meet our expectations, it did not operate as planned."
Sony entered the Internet appliance market as other manufacturers were getting out, canceling their plans, and discontinuing their offerings. By the time the Sony eVilla shipped, only 150,000 internet appliance devices had shipped within the past year. In addition, many customers could not justify the purchase of an inherently limited internet appliance when other manufacturers were offering more capable personal computers for the same price.
Hardware and Software.
The Sony eVilla was powered by a 266 MHz Geode GX 1 CPU, with 64 MiB DRAM, and 24 MiB flash memory. It weighed 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) and measured 11.81 × 16.18 × 15.82 inches (30 × 41.1 x 40.2 cm).
There was no hard disk, but the system could read and write to Sony's Memory Stick cards. The included keyboard and mouse were connected by two PS/2 ports, and additional devices could be connected with two USB ports. A 56K V.90 modem was built into the case, which also housed an unused Ethernet port.
The display was a portrait-style 15 inch (38 cm) Sony Trinitron, with 800×1024 pixel resolution.
The system used the BeIA 1.0 operating system from Be Inc., and supported Java applications, Macromedia Flash animations, and some Microsoft Office file formats. Also included was RealNetworks's RealPlayer.
One of the major drawbacks of the eVilla was the inability to save pictures and media from internet sites.

Neuroma

A neuroma (plural: neuromata or neuromas) is a growth or tumor of nerve tissue. Neuromas tend to be benign (i.e. not cancerous); many nerve tumors, including those that are commonly malignant, are nowadays referred to by other terms. 
Neuromas can arise from different types of nervous tissue, including the nerve fibers and their myelin sheath, as in the case of genuine neoplasms (growths) like ganglioneuromas and neurinomas.
The term is also used to refer to any swelling of a nerve, even in the absence of abnormal cell growth. In particular, traumatic neuroma results from trauma to a nerve, often during a surgical procedure. Morton's neuroma affects the foot. 
Neuromas can be painful, or sometimes, as in the case of acoustic neuromas, they can give rise to other symptoms.
Other nerve swellings.
Some of the benign varieties of neuroma, in the broadest sense of the term, are not neoplasms.
Etymology.
The stem "neuro-" originates from the Greek word for "nerve" (νεῦρον), while the suffix "-oma" (-ωμα) denotes "swelling". The stem does not imply that neuromas necessarily arise from neurons; neuromas generally arise from non-neuronal nerve tissues.

Black Fork Mountain Wilderness

Black Fork Mountain Wilderness is located in the U.S. states of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Created by an act of Congress in 1984, the wilderness covers an area of 13,139 acres (53 km²). The Arkansas portion contains and the Oklahoma portion contains . Located within Ouachita National Forest, the wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The area is about north of Page, Oklahoma, and about north of Mena, Arkansas. 
This infrequently visited wilderness follows the main ridgeline of Black Fork Mountain for 13 miles (21 km) which rises to more than 2,400 feet (731 m). Steep cliffsides provide sanctuary to groves of Dwarf Oak, Serviceberry and Granddaddy Greybeard (known as the fringe tree "Chionanthus") which have a few unique species represented here.
There are few trails through the wilderness and none at all in the Oklahoma sections. Visitors should expect difficult hiking conditions and few sources for water as there are only two springs along the higher mountain slopes. Black bears are known to inhabit the wilderness, along with White-tailed deer, bobcat, skunk and Pheasant.
The wilderness contains extensive areas of unlogged, old-growth forest. Along the ridge of Black Fork Mountain are several thousand acres of stunted old-growth Post Oak, Shortleaf Pine, and Hickory.
U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are usually allowed with a proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.
The mountain was the site of the crash of Texas International Airlines Flight 655 on September 27, 1973, in which 11 persons died.

Alta Vista, Ottawa

Alta Vista is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Its boundaries can be broadly described as: Smyth Road in the north, St. Laurent Boulevard in the east, Walkley Road and Heron Road in the south, and Bank Street and Riverside Drive in the west. However, the name is ambiguous, as there are several sub-neighbourhoods in this area, (see list below), as well as a core Alta Vista area, (which could be defined as south of Pleasant Park Road, north of Heron Road, and west of the eastern greenspace corridor), centered on Alta Vista Drive.
Alta Vista Drive is a major street running through the neighbourhood, and shares its name. Both are named for their relative height, as the neighbourhood is generally higher than most of the city. Alta Vista is a highly residential neighbourhood with a strong community, several schools, churches, and community centres. It also has a vast amount of greenspace and parks, much of which is part of the Alta Vista Transportation Corridor Environmental Assessment [http://www.ottawaeast.ca/AVC.html].
The OC Transpo Transitway also runs through Alta Vista, with two stations in the neighbourhood itself (Pleasant Park and Riverside) as well as two just outside (Billings Bridge and Smyth), serving as a vital transit link to the rest of the city.
The General Campus of the Ottawa Hospital, and The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario are located just on the north side of Smyth Road, in Riverview, while the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital is located at Smyth and Riverside Drive. There are two shopping malls in and around Alta Vista: the Billings Bridge Plaza Shopping Centre at Bank Street and Riverside and the Elmvale Shopping Centre at St. Laurent and Smyth.
Alta Vista had a population of about 24,047 as of the Canada 2011 Census.
Sub neighbourhoods.
The Alta Vista area encompasses many smaller neighbourhoods:
Schools.
There are several schools in the area, including:
Public elementary schools
Public secondary schools
Catholic schools
Demographics.
If Alta Vista is defined as Smyth on the north, St. Laurent on the east, Bank St. on the west, and Walkley on the south (excluding Heron Gate), then Alta Vista corresponds to Census Tracts 5050005.00, 5050006.00, 5050007.03, 5050007.01, 5050008.00, and 5050009.00 which have has a combined population of 24,047 (2011 census). Census Tract 5050009.00 corresponds to Elmvale Acres which had a population of 3280 Census Tract 5050008.00 corresponds to Urbandale (Canterbury) which had a population of 4,597 Census Tract 5050007.01 corresponds to Playfair Park which had a population of 2,254 Census Tract 5050007.03 corresponds to the Featherston Drive area (Guildwood Estates and Urbandale Acres) and had a population of 3,719 Census Tracts 5050006.00 and 5050005.00 make up the remaining core of Alta Vista, west of the greenspace running from Smyth Road to Walkley Road. These two census tracts had a combined population of 10197. Of those 10197, 2185 live in Ridgemont, which is south of Heron Road and west of Heron Gate. This corresponds to Dissemination areas 35061702, 35061701 and 35061700.

<doc id="2892020" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892020" title="Ljudevit Posavski">
Ljudevit Posavski

Ljudevit Posavski ("Trans-Savian") was a Duke of Pannonian Croatia from 810 to 823. The capital of his realm was in Sisak. As the ruler of the Pannonian Slavs, he led an unsuccessful resistance to Frankish domination. He held close ties with the Carantanian and Carniolan tribes and with the Timočani tribe.
Rebellions against the Franks.
In 818 Ljudevit sent his emissaries to Emperor Louis in Heristal. They described the horrors conducted by Cadolah and his men in Pannonia, but the King of Franks refused to make peace.
Ljudevit raised a rebellion against his Frankish rulers in 819 after he was seriously accused by the Frankish court. The Emperor Louis the Pious (814-840) sent Margrave Cadolah of Friuli (800-819) to quell the rebellion. The Frankish Frontier forces led by Cadolah have raided the land and tortured the population, most notably the children.
As the Pannonian Slavs were amassing forces, so did the Franks led by Cadolah return in 819. But the Frankish forces were soon defeated; and Cadolah himself had to retreat back to his home Friuli, where soon he died of disease.
In July 819 on the Council in Ingelheim Ljudevit's emissaries offered truce conditions, but Emperor Louis refused; demanding more concessions to him. Ljudevit started to gather allies for his plight. His original ally was Duke Borna (Dux Dalmatiae et Liburniae) - the leader of the Guduscani (Gačani), but the Frankish ruler had promised Borna that he would make him "Prince of Pannonia" if he helped the Franks to crush Ljudevit's rebellion; so Borna accepted. Ljudevit found assistance among the Karantanian and Carniolan Slavs who, as neighbours of the margravate of Friuli, were jeopardized the same as the Pannonians. The Serbs around the valley of Timok - Timočani also joined him, because they were jeoperdized by the neighbouring Bulgars.
The Franks sent a large army led by the new Margrave of Friuli, duke Baldric of Friuli to meet Ljudevit in autumn, the same year while he was conscripting more Carantanian troops along the river of Drava. The Frankish forces had numerical advantage, so they pushed Ljudevit and his men from Carniola across the Drava. Ljudevit had to fall back to central parts of his realm. Balderic didn't push to chase Ljudevit, since he had to pacify the Karantanians. Duke Borna moved with Ljudevit's father-in-law Dragomuž and their forces from the south-west. At the heat of the Battle of Kupa, his own Guduscani abandoned Borna and crossed to Ljudevit's side; while Dragomuž was killed. Borna escaped from the battlefield with the help of his bodyguards.
Ljudevit seized the opportunity and breached into Dalmatia in December. His forces raided Dalmatia. Borna was too weak, so the Dalmatian Croats defended themselves through sneaky tactics and used attrition as their best ally to exhaust the Pannonian forces. Harsh winter came to the hill areas, so Ljudevit was forced to return. According to Borna's reports to the Frankish Emperor, Ljudevit suffered heavy casualties: 3,000 soldiers, over 300 horses and lots of food.
War continues.
In January of 820, Borna made an alliance with the Frankish Emperor in Aachen. The plan was to crush Ljudevit's realm with a joint-attack from three sides. As soon as the winter retreated, massive Frankish armies were being amassed in Italia, East Francia, Bavaria, Saxony and Alemannia that were going to simultaneously invade Ljudevit's lands in the spring. The northern Frankish group moved from Bavaria across Pannonia to make an invasion across the river of Drava. Ljudevit's forces successfully stopped this Army at the river. The southern group moved across the Noric Alps, using the road from Aquileia to Emona. Ljudevit was successful again, as he stopped them before crossing the Alps. The central group moved from Tyrol to Carniola. Ljudevit attempted to halt its advance three times, but every single time would the Franks win, using numerical advantage. When this Army reached the Drava, Ljudevit had to fall back to the heart of his realm.
The Franks have opened ways for the southern and northern Armies, so they launched a total invasion. Ljudevit concluded that all resistance would be futile, so he retreated to a stronghold that he built on top of hill that was heavily fortified; while his people took shelter in local forest and swamps. Ljudevit did not negotiate with the Franks. The Franks eventually retreated from his lands, with their ranks thinned by disease which the northern forces caught in the marshes of Drava. The Slavs from Carantania lost their internal independence and were forced to recognize the Friulian margrave Balderic as their ruler, while some remained loyal to Ljudevit. Prince Borna died in 821, and was succeeded by Ljudevit's nephew, Vladislav. Emperor Louis recognized as "Prince of Dalmatia and Liburnia" in February 821 at the Council of Aachen.
The Emperor discussed again about war plans against Ljudevit on that Council. The Franks decided to repeat the progress, and push towards Ljudevit from three sides again. Ljudevit saw that it was obvious that he couldn't fight the Franks on open field, so he began to construct massive fortifications. He was helped by the Venetian Patriarch Fortunat who sent him architects and masons from Italy.
During the last and final Frankish invasion of 822, the Patriarch from Grad, Fortunat, who was a supporter of Ljudevit, fled to Zadar into exile with the Byzantines.
Flight to the Serbs.
According to Einhard, the writer of the Royal Frankish Annals, following the final Frankish attack, Ljudevit escaped from his seat in Sisak to the Serbs who controlled a great part of Dalmatia ("Siscia civitate relicta, ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur, fugiendo se contulit."). The notion of Serbs in the relative vicinity of Ljudevit has puzzled numerous historians because the relevant area wasn't otherwise known to have been inhabited by Serbs. At the same time, the Royal Frankish Annals did not mention the Croats at all, causing historians to have to cross-reference other sources to compensate.
Tadija Smičiklas did not attempt to define the area where Ljudevit fled, while Vjekoslav Klaić wrote it was beyond Sava and Bosna. Konstantin Jireček only indirectly mentioned that the Serbs had a fort around 820, but didn't specify its location. Ferdo Šišić put the "ad Sorabos" to the southeast of Sava and Vrbas, near the Dalmatian Croats. Vladimir Ćorović mentioned the flight to the Serbs, but didn't expound on it. The 1953 "History of the peoples of Yugoslavia" published by "Školska knjiga" added apparently fictitious details to the original story. Anto Babić discussed the original text and whether it was a reference to a single fort or a territory. Svetislav M. Prvanović tried to connect Ljudevit and the Guduscani with the Roman city of Guduscum in eastern Serbia, but using only the interpretation of a single comma in Franjo Rački's text and conjecture. Sima Ćirković thought there was a consensus that the place was somewhere in Bosnia, but called the claims of exact locations speculation. Nada Klaić thought that the place Ljudevit fled to was actually the medieval county of Srb by the river Una. Relja Novaković analyzed Einhard and concluded that the area could be somewhere near Kozara, Grmeč, Una and Kupa. Ivo Goldstein acknowledged and accepted the theory that it was located in Srb, but advocated against misinterpreting the scarce historical records. Radoslav Katičić argued against the theory, and Tibor Živković concurred with him.
Ljudevit was welcomed at the unnamed Serbian ruler's court, but he tricked him, killing him and then taking the power for himself. Some believe the Serbian ruler was an ally of the Franks and Ljudevit thought that he was about to betray him. Ljudevit soon sent an envoy to the Frankish court, claiming that he is ready to recognize the Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious as his supreme ruler.
Ljudevit's reign was not very well accepted amongst the Serbs, so he fled to Borna's uncle, Ljudemisl of Dalmatia. Ljudemisl had Ljudevit killed in 823.

2006.
With 5 sacks in his first 4 games, he was thought to start at the right end position, but with the signing of Darren Howard, Cole would only play on pass downs during the 2006 season. But this changed in week 2, two weeks after star left end Jevon Kearse went out with a fractured tibia, the Eagles announced that Cole would start for Kearse. Since then, Cole has had 1.5 sacks, 26 tackles, 18 of them solo tackles, helping the Philadelphia Eagles carry themselves to 5 straight wins and an NFC East title.

2007.
Cole recorded 12.5 sacks in the 2007 season which broke his personal single-season record. He was the first defensive end since Clyde Simmons in 1986 to make the Pro Bowl as an Eagles draft pick. Cole is already 15th in team history in sacks. As impressive are his tackling numbers, his 70 tackles also put him first among all defensive ends in the NFC. On January 24, 2008 it was announced that he would be replacing Patrick Kerney in the 2008 Pro Bowl.
2008.
In 2008 Cole led the team in hurries (22), and TFLs (9), was 2nd in sacks (9.0), and 3rd with 3 FFs while making 98 tackles (59 solo).

Attic base

Attic Base is the term given in architecture to the base of Roman Ionic order columns, consisting of an upper and lower torus, separated by a "scotia" (hollow concave molding) and fillets.
It was the favorite of the Romans, and was also employed by them for columns of the Corinthian and Composite orders. The style can be seen in Byzantine architecture as well; in the Romanesque period a great number of antique Roman columns were salvaged and reused in the interiors and on the porticos of churches, often incorporating the Attic base.

Eaglebrook has a student body of approximately 260 boys in grades six, seven, eight, and nine (forms 3 through 6). Girls may only attend if their parents work or live on campus. Eaglebrook has its own alpine ski area (the Easton Ski Area), indoor 25-yard six-lane swimming pool, and a state-of-the-art hockey rink arena indoors. Whipple Pond, located in the center of campus, is stocked with trout and bass for fishing in the spring and fall. In the winter the pond serves as the water source for snow making. The Chase Learning Center, at the heart of campus, includes classrooms and a multi-purpose assembly area which is called the "Pit". There are three other classroom buildings for science, language, and arts, including digital photography, woodworking shops, stained glass, stone carving, black and white photography, and many more.
Part of Eaglebrook School's mission is "to help each boy come in to full and confident possession of his innate talents, to improve the skills needed for the challenges of secondary school, and to establish values that will allow him to be a person who respects individual differences and acts with thoughtfulness and humanity."
History.
Eaglebrook School was founded in 1922 by Howard Gibbs, a friend of Headmaster Frank Boyden of Deerfield Academy. Gibbs, who graduated from Amherst, envisioned a younger boy's boarding school that allowed boys to develop their innate abilities, discover new interests, and gain confidence.
Thurston Chase, an Eaglebrook teacher and Wlliams College graduate, took over the school after Mr. Gibb's unexpected death. Student enrollment was expanded, and the school grew to include a gymnasium, tennis courts, a learning center, a science building, and four new dormitories.
After Thurston Chase's retirement, his son, Stuart Chase, became the headmaster. The school continued to grow as it bought 500 adjacent acres and added new playing fields, a track, a ski area with snow making and chair lift, a swimming pool, and two new dormitories.
In 2002, Andrew Chase, son of Stuart and Eaglebrook’s former director of development, became the current headmaster.
The campus has undergone extensive massive upgrades since the mid-1990s. Baines House and the Thurston C. Chase Learning Center have been renovated. The Schwab Family Pool, and the McFadden Rink at Alfond Arena and a new track and field facility have been built in the late 1990s. Two new dormitories, Kravis House and Mayer House, were completed in the early 2000s. In 2007, a major renovation was undertaken on Flagler House, Halsted House, and Taylor House. The Learning Center was also extensively renovated at that time. During the summer of 2010, the Sports Center was renovated, adding two new international squash courts, bringing the total to six, a new student lounge and student fitness room, and a 50-kilowatt solar panel system on the roof of the gym.
Governance.
Eaglebrook is owned by the Allen-Chase Foundation, a nonprofit educational trust. Andrew Chase is a descendant of the Allen and Chase families, both leaders in 19th-century American education. The foundation receives gifts from parents, friends, and alumni of the school and uses those gifts to enhance facilities, create endowed chairs for many faculty positions, provide a fund for professional development, and maintain a scholarship program.

Marlon Samuels

Marlon Nathaniel Samuels (born 5 February 1981) is a West Indian cricketer. He is primarily a right-handed middle order batsman. Samuels made his Test debut in Australia in 2000, and his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka in Nairobi during the ICC Knockout Trophy in the same year.
At the launch of the Caribbean Premier League he was announced as one of the first franchise players for the 2013 tournament.
On 10 April 2013 he was named one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in 2013.
Family.
He is the younger brother of Robert Samuels, also a West Indian Test and one-day cricketer.
Career.
Samuels scored his maiden Test hundred at Kolkata against the Indians in 2002/03. His innings of 104 helped the West Indies to draw the 3rd Test and was made against the likes of Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. His first ODI ton came in the series which followed and turned out to be a series winning innings. With the series level at 3–3 going into the final match at Vijayawada on 24 November 2002, Samuels smacked 108 not out off just 75 balls. The West Indies finished with 315 and went on to win by 135 runs.
During the West Indies tour of Australia, on 9 October 2005 Samuels registered his highest first-class score with an innings of 257. It was made in a tour match against Queensland at the Gabba. His effort was a record score at the ground, beating Martin Love's 250. Showing his allround abilities, he followed it up with 5 wickets in the next innings. He played in two Tests on the tour, with a highest score of 29, before he was sent home with a knee injury.
Against Pakistan at Multan in late 2006, Samuels scored his second ODI century. His unbeaten 100 led the West Indies to victory as they successfully chased the Pakistani total. He fell just short of another century a month later against the Indians in Chennai but his quick fire 98 helped his side chase down India's 268. Samuels also played as part of the Pro Cricket league in the United States for the Chicago Tornadoes.
In January 2007, Samuels was named man of the match after scoring 94 and 40 in the first Test against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, a match the West Indies won by 128 runs. He went on to score his second Test hundred, in the final match, hitting 105 although it wasn't enough for his side to win the match or the series. Samuels was involved in the run-out of Brian Lara in his last international match, against England during the 2007 World Cup. Lara was on 18, when Samuels signalled for a quick run but was unable to reach the other wicket in time as Kevin Pietersen underarmed the ball to hit the stumps. After the World Cup, the West Indies toured England in May. Unexpectedly Samuels was not initially included in the squad for the Test leg, but was called up as a replacement when Ramnaresh Sarwan suffered an injury. On 4 July Samuels made 77 runs from 104 balls against England in the second Natwest ODI. He and Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored a record third wicket partnership of 175 runs at Edgbaston in a game West Indies won.
Ban (2008–2010).
On 25 February 2008 Samuels was suspended from bowling in international cricket until he corrects his bowling action, which has been deemed suspect. Indian police accused Samuels of giving out team information to a known bookie prior to the 1st ODI between the West Indies and India in Nagpur on 21 January 2007. It was claimed that they have taped telephone conversations between a bookmaker, Mukesh Kochchar, and Samuels. The transcript was later released by the police. After a hearing into the matter, in May the International Cricket Council enforced a two-year ban on the 27-year-old for "receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute". Samuels maintained his innocence.
Return (2010–present).
Samuels' two-year ban expired on 9 May 2010 and subsequently returned to playing for Jamaica and West-Indian chief selector Clyde Butts stated that the door was open for Marlon Samuels to serve the West Indies in international cricket provided that he proves himself on the domestic circuit. During the 2011 World Cup in February and March, all-rounder Dwayne Bravo suffered an injury and the West Indies Cricket Board asked Samuels to fly out to act as a replacement. Samuels declined, stating that he did not yet feel ready, but that he was targeting a return during India's tour of the West Indies in June and July. The West Indies were knocked out in the quarter finals of the World Cup, and in the team's first engagement after was hosting Pakistan in April and May. When the T20I squad was announced four uncapped players were included and Samuels was recalled, marking a return to the squad for the first time since the expiration of his ban. Samuels returned to the Test side for the second Test and scored a half-century in his first innings.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. An auction was held for teams to buy players, and Samuels was bought by the Duronto Rajshahi for $360,000. He was the team's highest run-scorer with 242 from 11 innings in the competition. In February 2012, Samuels signed a contract with Pune Warriors India to play for them in the 2012 and 2013 Indian Premier League (IPL). The 2012 IPL clashed with Australia's tour of the West Indies, and Samuels was granted permission to skip the three Test series and play in the league. During the tournament he was reported for having a suspect bowling action, and suspended from bowling in the rest of the competition.
Samuels was selected in the West Indies Test squad to tour England after the IPL. In the first Test Samuels combined with Chanderpaul in a 157-run stand. However, with England batting on the final day to win the match Samuels was asked to bowl. His part-time off spin was called upon as the West Indies had entered the match without a specialist spinner, while Shannon Gabriel was injured and Fidel Edwards ineffective. Samuels scored his third Test century in his next innings, and combined with captain Darren Sammy to score 204 runs, the second-highest partnership for the West Indies' seventh wicket.
In October 2012 he was selected for the Melbourne Renegades in the 2012/2013 Big Bash T20 League.
2012 ICC World Twenty20.
Samuels was named man of the match in the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, in which the West Indies beat Sri Lanka by 36 runs to claim the title. He scored 78 off 56 balls, an innings which included six sixes and three fours.

Subdivisions of Senegal

Senegal is subdivided into four levels of administrative divisions. At the top level are the Regions of Senegal and their elected administrative body, subdivided into Departments, which are strictly administrative entities with no independent political power. Departments are made up of Arrondissements (also purely administrative structures, with Prefects appointed by the central government), and further in Communes, roughly equivalent to cities. In rural areas, these are titled "communautés rurales", but maintain the same powers: city councils and mayors, directly elected. In the Dakar Region, since 1996, the four Arrondissements have been subdivided into Communes d'arrondissement, with appointed Sub-Prefects, answerable to their Arrondissement Prefects.
The 11 regions ("régions", singular - "région"), are administered by a "Conseil Régionaux" elected by population weight at the Arrondissement level. 
Senegal's subvisions number 34 départements, 103 arrondissements, 19 Communes d'arrondissement, 11 "régions", 110 "communes", and 320 "communautés rurales".

<doc id="2892078" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892078" title="Ferrate(VI)">
Ferrate(VI)

Ferrate(VI) is the inorganic anion with the chemical formula [FeO4]2-. It is photosensitive, contributes a pale violet colour to compounds and solutions containing it and is one of the strongest water-stable oxidising species known. Although it is classified as a weak base, concentrated solutions containing ferrate(VI) are corrosive and attack the skin and are only stable at high pH. 
Nomenclature.
The term "ferrate" is normally used to mean ferrate(VI), although it can refer to other iron-containing anions, many of which are more commonly encountered than salts of These include the highly reduced species disodium tetracarbonylferrate Na2[Fe(CO)4 and salts of the iron(III) complex tetrachloroferrate Although rarely studied, ferrate(V) [FeO43- and ferrate(IV) [FeO4]4- oxyanions of iron also exist. These too are called ferrates.
Synthesis.
Ferrate(VI) salts are formed by oxidizing iron in an aqueous medium with strong oxidizing agents under alkaline conditions, or in the solid state by heating a mixture of iron filings and powdered potassium nitrate.
For example, ferrates are produced by heating iron(III) hydroxide with sodium hypochlorite in alkaline solution:
The anion is typically precipitated as the barium(II) salt, forming barium ferrate. 
Properties.
The ferrate(VI) anion is unstable at neutral or acidic pH values, decomposing to iron(III):
The reduction goes through intermediate species in which iron has oxidation states +5 and +4. These anions are even more reactive than ferrate(VI). In alkaline conditions ferrates are more stable, lasting for about 8 to 9 hours at pH 8 or 9.
Aqueous solutions of ferrates are pink when dilute, and deep red or purple at higher concentrations. The ferrate ion is a stronger oxidizing agent than permanganate, and will oxidize chromium(III) to dichromate, and ammonia to molecular nitrogen.
Ferrates are excellent disinfectants, and are capable of removing and destroying viruses.
The ferrate(VI) ion has two unpaired electrons, and is thus paramagnetic. It has a tetrahedral molecular geometry.

Basij

The Basij (; full name Sazmane Basij-e Mostaz'afin, literally "The Organization for Mobilization of the Oppressed") is a paramilitary volunteer militia established in 1979 by order of the Islamic Revolution's leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The original organization comprised the civilian volunteers whom the Ayatollah Khomeini urged to fight in the Iran–Iraq war. The force consists of young Iranians who have volunteered, often in exchange for official benefits. Currently Basij serve as an auxiliary force engaged in activities such as internal security as well as law enforcement auxiliary, the providing of social service, organizing of public religious ceremonies, and policing of morals and the suppression of dissident gatherings. "Basij" is the name of the force; a "basiji" is an individual member.
The Basij are set up as subordinate to, receiving their orders from, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to whom they are known for their loyalty. They have also been described as "a loosely allied group of organizations" including "many groups controlled by local clerics." They have a local organization in almost every city in Iran.
History.
Origins.
During the Iranian revolution, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a decree founding the Basij as "a large people's militia", in November 1979. He is reported to have stated that "a country with 20 million youths must have 20 million riflemen or a military with 20 million soldiers; such a country will never be destroyed." This "people's militia" was established on 30 April 1980. The Basij was open to those above the age of 18 and below the age of 45, and all women in that age category. According to author Baqer Moin, the group "which was formed as a civil defence force, but in practice became a grass-roots intelligence organisation, was largely made up of young boys aged between ten and sixteen and, during the war, unemployed old men, some in their eighties."
During the Iran-Iraq War hundreds of thousands volunteered for the Basij, including children as young as 12 and unemployed old men, some in their eighties. These volunteers were swept up in Shi'i love of martyrdom and the atmosphere of patriotism of the war mobilization. They were encouraged through visits to the schools and an intensive media campaign. The Basij may best be known for their employment human wave attacks which cleared minefields or draw the enemy's fire. It is estimated that tens of thousands were killed in the process. Some reports have the Basiji marching into battle marking their expected entry to heaven by wearing plastic "keys to paradise" around their necks.
The typical human wave tactic was for Basijis (often very lightly armed and unsupported by artillery or air power) to march forward in straight rows. While casualties were high, the tactic often worked. "They come toward our positions in huge hordes with their fists swinging," an Iraqi officer complained in the summer of 1982. "You can shoot down the first wave and then the second. But at some point the corpses are piling up in front of you, and all you want to do is scream and throw away your weapon. Those are human beings, after all."
According to Dilip Hiro, by the spring of 1983 the Basij had trained 2.4 million Iranians in the use of arms and sent 450,000 to the front. Tehran Bureau estimates the peak number of Basijis at the front at 100,000 by December 1986. By the end of the war between 700,000–800,000 Basij volunteers were sent to the front. In 1985 the IRNA put the number of Basijis at 3 million.
Duties after the war.
By the end of the war, most of the Basijis left the service and were reintegrated back into their lives, often after years of being in the front. After the war, the Basij was reorganized and gradually developed into one of the Islamic regime's "primary guarantors of domestic security." By 1988 the number of Basij checkpoints dramatically decreased, but the Basij were still active in monitoring the activities of citizens. They enforce hijab, arresting women for violating the dress code, arrest youths for attending mixed gender parties or being in public with unrelated members of the opposite sex, seized 'indecent' material and satellite dish antennae.
In 1988 college Basiji organizations were established on college campuses to fight "Westoxification" and potential student agitation against the government. Basij members played "a central role" in breaking up the student riots in Tehran in 1999. They were also instrumental in quelling several outbreaks of ethnic unrest in the oil-rich province of Khuzestan, which is home to the majority of Iran's ethnic-Arab population.
Basij also act as an emergency management service, being mobilized in case of earthquakes or other natural or human-made disasters. It may supplement law enforcement by setting up street inspection posts in urban areas to intercept drug smuggling and potential insurgency.
The Ashura Brigades are reported to have been created in 1993 after anti-government riots erupted in various Iranian cities. These Islamic brigades were made up of both Revolutionary Guards and the Basij and by 1998 numbered 17,000.
Revival.
According to the New York Times, after the spontaneous celebrations following Iran winning a spot in the in 1998 FIFA World Cup, and the student protests in July 1999, the Islamic government felt that it had lost control of the streets, and "reinvented" the Basij to correct this problem. Giving a slightly different timeline, GlobalSecurity.org reports that it was under the administration of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad (elected in 2005) that the Basij appeared "to be undergoing something of a revival."
In late September 2005, the Basij staged a series of urban defense exercises across the country. Its first deputy commander announced the creation of 2,000 "Ashura battalions" within the Basij that will have "riot-control responsibilities." Some speculated the "revival" of the Basij was connected "with preparations for possible civil unrest."
The Iranian Government has drawn up a number of different plans to keep the Basij alive. Among these plans is the emphasis on ideas such as Development Basij (Basij-e-Sazandegi). Fars News Agency reported. "Among the most important tasks of the Basij are boosting everlasting security, strengthening development infrastructures, equipping resistance bases, increasing employment," Hejazi added. He described the prohibition of vice and the promotion of virtue in society as the "divine policy" of the Basij.
Along with the Iranian riot police and the Ansar-e-Hezbollah, the Basij have been active in recent years in suppressing student demonstrations in Iran. The Basij are sometimes differentiated from the Ansar in being more "disciplined" and not beating, or at least not being as quick to beat demonstrators. Other sources describe the Ansar-e-Hezbollah as part of the "loosely allied group of organizations" that make up the Basij.
Some believe the change in focus of the Basij from its original mission of fighting to defend Iran in the Iran-Iraq War to its current internal security concerns has led to a loss in its prestige and morale. According to an unnamed "seasoned analyst" quoted by csmonitor.com, "You define yourself by your enemies, and those were the superpowers back then. ... But now they are fighting young people who put gel in their hair. That's the enemy. So it's demeaning, and not at all elevating for their self-image."
The Basij came "under the formal authority of the Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) commander in 2007 and were incorporated into IRGC ground forces in 2008."
2009 election protests.
Mir Hussein Moussavi, opposition presidential candidate in 2009, has "decried the violence carried out by the Basij" during protests following the disputed presidential election, complaining that the basij attack the demonstrations "with hoses, clubs, iron bars, truncheons and sometimes firearms," 'just before the police show up.' The tactics used by the Basij against election demonstrators have been described as involving choosing "targets at the edges of the crowds, going for the vulnerable and unwary stragglers," attacking "surreptitiously ... jumping demonstrators as they return home on darkened streets at night," and also wielding "tiny knives or razor blades to use against protestors from behind their backs." There have also been reports of poor performance by basij after the 2009 election, with some basij failed to suppress demonstrations, "deserted their assignments", and being unwilling "to beat up neighbors who protested against the election result by chanting 'God is great' from their homes." According to Tehran Bureau, "from June 22 onward, the Basij constituted only a minority of the forces cracking down on protesters," after having had "trouble maintaining order in major urban centers" particularly Tehran. This was thought to be a reason for the replacement of commander Hossein Taeb and the Basij's formal integration into the Revolutionary Guards ground forces in October 2009.
Following the protests, Hojjatoleslam Hossein Taeb, commander of the Basij, "cautioned" Iranians that the US was "hiring agents and mercenaries in an effort to continue its plots for a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic," according to the Iranian Fars news agency. Taeb has also stated that the anti-government riots "killed eight members of the Basij and wounded 300 others."
Syrian Civil War, 2011–present.
Syria's geopolitical importance to Iran and its role as one of Iran's crucial allies prompted the involvement of Basij militiamen in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. The Basij militia, similar to Hizballah fighters, has been working side by side with the Syrian army against rebel forces. Such involvement poses new foreign policy challenges for a number of countries across the region, particularly Israel and Turkey as Iran's influence becomes more than just ideological and monetary on the ground in the Syrian conflict. The Basij involvement in the Syrian Civil War reflects previous uses of the militia as a proxy force for Iranian foreign policy in an effort to assert Iranian dominance in the region and frightens Salim Idriss, head of the Free Syrian Army.
As of December 2013, a Western analyst believed thousands of Iranian paramilitary Basij fighters were stationed in Syria.
Organization and membership.
Organization.
Subgroupings of the Basij include the Pupil Basij ["Basij-e Danesh-Amouzi"], the Student Basij ["Basij-e Daneshjouyi"], the University Basij, the Public Service Basij ["Basij-e Edarii"], and the Tribal Basij, (aka "Basij-e Ashayer" or the former tribal levies incorporated into the Basij). In the Student Basij, middle-school-aged members are called "Seekers" ("Puyandegan"), and high-school members are called the "Vanguard" ("Pishgaman"). Tehran Bureau also lists a "Basij of the Guilds" ["Basij-e Asnaf"], and a "Labor Basij" ["Basij-e Karegaran"].
Basij has been called "a quasi-decentralised network". Its organizational structure and training "varies from one province to another, according to the nature and severity of the potential threats identified by the IRGC and Basij commanders in different regions." The Basij have "branches in almost every Iranian mosque", with rooms marked "Paygah-e-Basij" or Basij base, "which serves as a kind of Islamic club where students study the Koran, organize sports teams and plan field trips." According to the Tehran Bureau, the Basij "statute distinguishes between three types of members":
Basij form the fifth branch of the Army of the Revolutionary Guard, and the "three main armed wings" of the Basij are the Ashoura and Al-Zahra Brigades, the Imam Hossein Brigades (composed of Basij war veterans who cooperate closely with the IRGC ground forces) and the Imam Ali Brigades (which deal with security threats). According to Radio Free Europe, the "backbone" of the Basij comprises 2,500 Al-Zahra battalions (all women) and Ashura battalions (male), numbering 300–350 personnel each. The IRGC aims to arm 30 percent of these battalions with semi-heavy and heavy weapons. However, all members of the battalions are trained to use light arms and rifles. They are trained "in riot-control tactics and how to deal with domestic uprisings," and officially tasked with "defending the neighborhoods in case of emergencies."
In addition, since 2007 the Basij have established "30,000 new combat cells, each of them 15–20 members strong, named Karbala and Zolfaqar". The cells "cooperate closely" or in emergency situations are "controlled by" the Revolutionary Guard.
Commanders.
The current commander of the Basij is Mohammad Reza Naqdi, who replaced Hossein Taeb in October 2009. Hossein Taeb was appointed commander of the Basij on 14 July 2008.
The first deputy commander General Mirahmadi was formally installed on 4 September 2005. The Tehran commander is Seyyed Mohammad Haj Aqamir. The deputy Basij commander for Tehran, General Ahmad Zolqadr, was formally installed on 5 September 2005; the new Basij commander in Tabrizi, Brigadier General Mohammad Yusef Shakeri, on 29 September 2005.
Size.
Estimates of the number of Basij vary, with its leadership giving higher figures than outside commentators. According to RFERL, According to a former commander of the Basij, Brigadier General Mohammad Hejazi, the strength of the force in 2004 was 10.3 million. By 2007, its strength stood at 12.6 million. The current commander of the Basij, Hasan Taeb, told the semi-official Fars news agency on November 25 that the force now numbers 13.6 million, which is about 20 percent of the total population of Iran. Of this number, about 5 million are women and 4.7 million are schoolchildren. ... In fact the Basij may be able to mobilize no more than 1.5 million men and women of military age.
An earlier study in 2005 by a Washington think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, put "the number of full-time, uniformed, and active members at 90,000, with another 300,000 reservists and some 1 million that could be mobilized when necessary."
Duties and activities.
In their capacity of maintaining law and order, Basiji act as "morality police" in towns and cities by "enforcing the wearing of the hijab; arresting women for violating the dress code; prohibiting male-female fraternization; monitoring citizens' activities; confiscating satellite dishes and 'obscene' material; intelligence gathering; and even harassing government critics and intellectuals. Basij volunteers also act as bailiffs for local courts."
Duties may vary by province, with Basij deployed against drug traffickers in the eastern border regions, banned goods smugglers in Hormuzgan and Bushehr, and "carrying out border-guard duties" on the border with Iraq.
As of 2008, "government construction and economic projects can be contracted to the Basij", and in 2010, "thousands" of basiji "were educated in blogging and filtering of dissident websites" on the internet.
Benefits and profile of members.
According to a 2006 report from Globalsecurity.org Basij membership is thought to comprise "mainly boys, old men, and those who recently finished their military service," while in 2009 the New York Times describes them as "ranging in age from high school to about 30 years old."
Benefits for members of the Basij reportedly include exemption from the 21 months of military service required for Iranian men, reserved spots in universities, and a small stipend. Members of Basij are more likely than non-members to obtain government positions, especially security related positions within government controlled institutions. Many Iranians reportedly join Basij only to take advantage of the benefits membership and to get admission to university or as a tool to get promotion in government jobs.
In past elections militia members have voted for both hardliners and reformists. President Ahmadinejad enjoys significant support from militia members, many of whom have benefited from his policies.
As the Basij is a volunteer paramilitary organisation, most Basiji are not permitted to carry a firearm except for special requirements. This means that only about 25% of Basij carry firearms, usually an AK-47. However there is no rule saying that they cannot use any other weaponry, an issue which has brought major controversy.
Human rights and political activism.
Politics.
In theory the Basij are banned from involvement in politics by the Iranian constitution, but its leadership is considered active, particularly during and after the 2005 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. According to American state-sponsored broadcaster RFERL, "Basij support contributed to Ahmadinejad's victory in the 2005 presidential election". In the March 2008 parliamentary elections, the Basij and IRGC commanders
"openly backed Ahmadinejad's principalists (osulgarayan)". In February 2008, Major General Jafari was quoted as saying that "the principlists are in control of the executive and legislative branches and, God willing, the judiciary will soon follow suit." Hasan Taeb, then deputy commander of the Basij, similarly stressed that Basij members should have a "maximum presence" in the elections.
Supreme Leader Khamenei, to whom the Basij have been described as very loyal to, described Basij as "the greatest hope of the Iranian nation" and "an immaculate tree".

George Bassman (February 7, 1914 – June 26, 1997) was an American composer and arranger.
Biography.
Born in New York to a Ukrainian- and Lithuanian-Jewish émigré couple, Bassman was later raised in Boston and began studying music at the Boston Conservatory while still a boy.
He studied orchestration and composition formally, but in his teens he left home against his father's wishes to play piano in an itinerant jazz group, and subsequently worked as an arranger for Fletcher Henderson in New York.
Through that gig, he became part of the burgeoning swing/big band scene and was soon writing songs as well. Bassman peaked in that career when he and Ned Washington wrote "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You" for the bandleader Tommy Dorsey. Bassman also worked in radio as an arranger for Andre Kostelanetz, and made the move to Hollywood in the mid 1930s.
Among his earliest film jobs was orchestrating the Gershwin songs in the Fred Astaire movie "A Damsel in Distress" at RKO. He later went to work at MGM, where he composed music for the Marx Brothers vehicles "A Day at the Races", "Go West", and "The Big Store", as well as writing or arranging music for such musicals as "Lady Be Good" and "Cabin in the Sky". He also worked on the Judy Garland musical "The Wizard of Oz" (for which he orchestrated the background music used in the cyclone and poppy-field scenes and many of the Emerald City sequences), "Babes in Arms", and "For Me and My Gal". During his work at MGM, he returned to RKO to supervise the adaptation of the Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart musical "Too Many Girls" to the big screen. He also worked on dramas, including Vincente Minnelli's "The Clock" and Tay Garnett's "The Postman Always Rings Twice".
Bassman's career was interrupted in the midst of the Red Scare, however, when he admitted in testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee that he had been a member of the Communist party (it was virtually a family legacy, his mother apparently having been a dedicated Communist in the 1910s, when it had a very different meaning than it did in the 1950s).
Bassman left Hollywood after the studios closed their doors to him and returned to New York where he found the theater still open to him. He was engaged to orchestrate the show "Guys and Dolls" (with Ted Royal), and also composed music for various shows and revues. Ironically, although Hollywood was closed to him, Bassman was able to work in television in its early days, as a composer for various live shows and also as a conductor; he eventually composed the music for the live television anthology series "Producers' Showcase" as well. He also quietly kept his hand in movies, where independent producers were willing to hire him. Among his best scores during this period was his music for "The Joe Louis Story" (1955); he also got hired to write some music for the Hollywood movie "Marty" (1955), and Columbia hired him in 1958 to score "Middle of the Night".
Bassman had seemingly beaten the blacklist, and without too much inconvenience, but then his professional luck ran out, oddly enough upon his return to MGM for the first time in more than a decade. He clashed with the makers (including director Sam Peckinpah) of what could have been a triumphant comeback, on "Ride the High Country" (1962). He closed out his film career with "Mail Order Bride" (1964), and saw several of his scores (including one for "Bonnie and Clyde") rejected.
Late in his career, he re-orchestrated the 1922 one-act jazz opera by George Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva, "Blue Monday". This version has been recorded.
Death.
Bassman's later life was marred by tragedy—his personal life involved three marriages, and the last had a duration of scarcely a year. By the late 1970s, he was cut loose from his career, and he later fell in with the wrong people. He died forgotten by his profession and alone in Los Angeles in 1997.

Union for Traditional Judaism

The Union for Traditional Judaism is an ostensibly non-denominational Jewish educational, outreach and communal service organization. The UTJ, as it is known, sees itself as trans-denominational, and works to encourage traditional observance among all Jews. The UTJ maintains various educational and religious programs, and makes these available to the wider community. Though officially non-denominational, the UTJ is understood to have many components typically associated with a religious denomination, i.e. a seminary, an association of clergy, and a committee which has authority over religious issues. The UTJ is often viewed [http://www.bnaibrith.ca/institute/millennium/millennium11.html as representing a denomination or inhabiting an ideologic space nestled between Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism.
The UTJ is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, USA.
Origins.
The Union for Traditional Judaism, originally known as the Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism, began as a rabbinic rather than a lay movement. It was founded by a group of traditionalist Conservative rabbis, led by former Jewish Theological Seminary of America Talmud professor David Weiss Halivni, who broke with the movement because of ideological differences, including the Conservative's approach to changes in Halakha and the manner in which the issue of admitting women to the rabbinate was addressed.
Halivni and other traditionalists claimed that in this and other decisions the Conservative movement had made decisions to change from traditional practices in a legislative rather than a judicial fashion, by poll or majority vote. Traditionalists believed that halakhic decision-making should be made by Talmud and Halakha scholars following a process of legal reasoning. 
While still a Conservative rabbi, Halivni had written a responsum supporting the ordination of women as rabbis, although by a more gradual process than the one approved by the Conservative movement. Halivni withdrew this responsum prior to leaving the Conservative movement and founding the UTJ. The UTJ issued a responsum opposing the ordination of women as part of its first volume of responsa.
The Union originally intended to form the elements of a separate denomination, including an association of rabbis, a rabbinical school, and an association of synagogues. The organization subsequently described itself as being trans-denominational in character.
Beliefs and practices.
The Union for Traditional Judaism attempts to combine modern approaches to studying Judaism's sacred texts, including the use of critical methods and the study of approaches such as the Documentary hypothesis, with what it regards as classical approaches to interpreting and making decisions regarding Jewish law. As such, it stands in between Modern Orthodox Judaism, which retains a belief that the current written Torah and Oral Torah were transmitted in an unbroken tradition from what was received by Moses on Mount Sinai through Divine revelation, and Conservative Judaism, which in the UTJ's view has sometimes permitted personal views to override classical halakhic scholarship. The Union endorsed women's prayer groups [http://www.utj.org/faq.html#q9]. The Metivta, its rabbinical school, does not ordain women as rabbis. 
David Weiss Halivni, one of the Union founders and the head of its rabbinical school, has written extensively on an approach to harmonizing the perspectives of contemporary biblical criticism (as well as critical study of the Talmud) with traditional religious belief. In his books "Peshat and Derash" and "Revelation Restored", he developed the concept he called "Chate'u Israel" ("Israel sinned"), in which he argued that the biblical texts were originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai, but they subsequently became irretrievably corrupted and the texts we currently have were redacted by editors in an effort to restore them.
Relationship to Conservative Judaism.
Major differences between UTJ and USCJ exist due to UTJ rabbis generally choosing halakhic options with regards to issues related to women, or in the use of siddurim. For instance, UTJ synagogues follow the practice of having separate seating for men and women, and women not acting as a shaliach tzibbur, both positions still considered halakhically valid by Conservative rabbis. 
In "Jewish Choices" (Bernard Melvin Lazerwitz et al.) The Union for Traditional Judaism is viewed as a denomination within Conservative Judaism, p. 8.
When describing the creation of the UTJ Stefan Reif refers to the founding members of the UTJ as "traditionalists" within the Conservative movement.
Many other sources, however, describe the Union for Traditional Judaism as a new religious movement positioned between Orthodoxy and the Conservative movement.
The Institute of Traditional Judaism/The Metivta.
The Institute of Traditional Judaism, also known as the Metivta, is the rabbinical school sponsored by the UTJ. The Metivta trains men for the rabbinate, and also offers study programs for men and women which do not lead to ordination. 
Graduates of the rabbinical program have been hired by both Conservative and Orthodox synagogues.
Financial Difficulties.
The Union for Traditional Judaism filed for bankruptcy in 2010 following a decrease in donations. It emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011, but had to sell its headquarters building in Teaneck, NJ in order to pay its debts. The building was purchased by Congregation Netivot Shalom, which had been UTJ's Teaneck congregation. Netivot Shalom subsequently broke from the UTJ.

Pedro Valle Carlo

Dr. Pedro Valle Carlo (born 1944 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), is a retired college professor and noted environmentalist leader based in western Puerto Rico. 
Pedro Valle Carlo was born in Santurce. His mother was Blanca Carlo and his father Pedro Valle Bonilla. He was raised in Cabo Rojo, attending the local public grammar school and high school. 
Valle Carlo enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez as a civil engineering major in 1962. He soon changed majors to management. He earned his degree in 1966. After graduation, he married Dafne Javier Montalvo, whom he had met at a local social event. Valle Carlo then moved on to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras while Javier Montalvo worked on her own graduate degree in psychology at the same institution. 
After graduation, the couple first moved to Spain and then to New York City to pursue doctoral studies. Valle Carlo earned a PhD in labor management from New York University in 1984.
From 1976 to 1995, Valle Carlo was a professor at the Business Administration department of the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. In 1995, he was named director of the graduate program at his alma mater in Mayagüez. He retired from active academics in 2005.
Environmental work.
Valle Carlo began his involvement with the environmentalist movement in the early 1990s by joining the Sociedad de Historia Natural, a local environmentalist group. With the group, Valle Carlo was involved in several initiatives, including protesting the use of El Yunque forest by the US Armed Forces.
In 1996, Valle Carlo was the driving force behind the formation of the West Chapter of the Asociacion de Acampadores de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Campers Association.)
In 2000, Valle Carlo became involved with Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente, a local environmentalist group. He was part of the movement to save the Los Morrillos Lighthouse and the surrounding salt mines. He was instrumental in the acquisition and creation of the "Centro Interpretativo", a visitor's center that offers tourists free guided tours to the surrounding forest and natural preserve.
Valle Carlo also spearheaded the initiative to save Isla de Ratones (Mice Island), a small key off the coast of Cabo Rojo that israpidly losing its surface area through erosion. He led the effort to replant mangroves and repopulate the coral reef in order to stop the island's erosion.
In 2005 he was named president of Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente.
Community work.
In 2000, following a conversation with famed Puerto Rican painter Alfonso Arana at the local plaza, Valle Carlo and his wife decided to do something to help the local artistic community. The couple, and a group of local volunteers, incorporated Arte en la Plaza Betances, a unique community group dedicated to bringing art to the urban center of Cabo Rojo, specifically the Ramón Emeterio Betances plaza at the town's center. 
The group sponsors a yearly art open air exhibit and competition of young local painters as well as other activities, such as a concert by the Arturo Somohano Philarmonic Orchestra at the Betances plaza. The example of Arte en la Plaza Betances has been well received and other Arte en la Plaza organizations have begun to prop up around the island of Puerto Rico.

Apple Remote

The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities. The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. Apple TV ships with and uses the Apple Remote as its primary control mechanism.
Design.
The original Apple Remote was designed with six buttons and made of white plastic. Its shape and layout resembled the first-generation iPod Shuffle. A circular Play/Pause/Select button sat in the center of a larger four-button circle of (clockwise): Volume Up, Next/Fast-forward, Volume Down and Previous/Rewind. A separate Menu button was positioned below. The price was set at US$29.00.
In October 2009, the remote was redesigned as a thinner and longer aluminum version. The new remote was released along with the 27 inch aluminum iMacs and multi-touch Magic Mouse. The Play/Pause button was moved out of the center of the directional buttons and put beside the Menu button (under the directional buttons). The symbols for the Volume Up/Down and Next/Fast-forward buttons were replaced with small dots, to make it clear that the buttons were also used to move up, down, left, and right within menus. All of the buttons became black and embossed within aluminum. Along with the new design, the price was dropped to US$19.99.
The battery is accessed by pushing a small, blunt object, such as a paper clip or a 3.5 mm headphone plug, into a tiny indent at the bottom right edge of the remote, revealing the compartment which houses the CR2032 lithium 3.0 V button cell (1st Gen). Use a coin to access the battery on the back of the remote (2nd Gen)
Functions.
The Apple Remote's original function was to enable navigation in Front Row, which allows users to browse and play music, view videos (DVDs and downloaded files) and browse photos. Although Front Row was removed from OS X 10.7 and later, some Apple software still works with the remote. It can still be used to control presentations in Apple Keynote (on both Intel Macs & PowerPC Macs), picture slide shows in iPhoto and Aperture, DVD films via DVD Player, and to play video and audio in iTunes and QuickTime. Other software that is still compatible includes Elgato's EyeTV 3.5, and VLC media player. The remote can also be used to run presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint 2008 or in OpenOffice.org Impress. 
Other functions controlled by the remote can include putting a device into sleep mode, selecting a partition to boot from on startup, and ejecting optical disks. A device can be configured to respond only to a particular remote.
iPods.
An iPod placed in a dock featuring an IR sensor can be used with the remote for music and media control. The remote's menu functionality does not work on the iPod. The Apple Remote can also be used to control the iPod Hi-Fi or third party devices tailored to it.
Boot Camp.
Starting with Boot Camp 1.2, the remote has had some functionality when a user is running Windows. If iTunes is installed on the Windows partition, pressing the Menu button on the remote will load the program. The remote's media controls also support Windows Media Player, as well as system volume control. Other third party programs may also utilize the remote's capabilities; media applications such a foobar2000 and Media Player Classic allow users to control their functions via the remote. Applications must be in focus for the remote to control them. Boot Camp 5, the latest version of the software, also includes drivers for the remote control.
iOS App.
Apple offers a free 'Remote' app for iOS devices (available in the iTunes App Store) which allows for wireless control of iTunes on Mac/Windows computers or the Apple TV.
Compatibility.
Earlier models of the iMac (Polycarbonate iMac) featured a magnetic rest for the remote, which was later removed. The remote can be held instead from magnets in the bezel.
The polycarbonate MacBook includes a magnet halfway down the left edge of the screen bezel to hold the remote. The remote may also be placed on the magnets at the top of the screen which are intended to hold the laptop shut, however in this position the remote will hang down and obscure part of the screen.
Older Macs.
Using the third-party remote software mira (from Twisted Melon) or Remote Buddy (from IOSPIRIT GmbH) users of older Macs can use the Apple Remote with a USB-based IR receiver. Most new Mac models come equipped with a built-in infrared receiver, but previous generation products lack any such IR device. Using Remote Buddy or mira, it is possible to connect an external USB receiver such as the Windows Media Center Edition eHome receiver, and use the Apple Remote on older machines with full support for sleep, pairing, low battery detection, and Front Row. In addition, Remote Buddy is able to emulate events of an Apple Remote on these systems, enabling users to use software written for the Apple Remote in exactly the same way as with newer Macs.
Infrared interference.
Because many electrical appliances use infrared remote (IR) controls, concurrent use of the Apple Remote with other IR remotes may scramble communications and generate interference, preventing stable use. Remotes should be used individually to circumvent the problem.
Technical details.
The Apple Remote uses an NEC IR protocol[http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol] which consists of a differential PPM encoding on a 1:3 duty cycle 38 kHz 950 nm infrared carrier. There are 32 bits of encoded data between the AGC leader and the stop bit:
The first two bytes sent are the Apple custom code ID (0xEE followed by 0x87), which are followed by one byte command and one byte remote ID (0-255) making a total of 32 bits of data. All bytes are sent least significant bit first. The least significant bit of the command byte is an odd parity bit over the command byte and the ID byte. The commands consist of:
The aluminium Apple remote control has 7 buttons, one more than the previous white plastic model; the extra button is a play/pause button that sends the same code as the center button. However, in order to distinguish these, both buttons prepend their code with another 32 bit sequence containing the commands 0x5f/0x5e and 0x5d/0x5c, respectively.
The remote ID consists of one byte and is used to distinguish codes sent by multiple remotes. The remote ID is changeable by holding the Next/Fast-Forward and Menu buttons for 5 seconds. The sequence of remote IDs is non-sequential but predictable following the hexadecimal digit ordering 0, 8, 4, C, 2, A, 6, E, 1, 9, 5, D, 3, B, 7, F. With the opposite bit-endianness, the order is sequential from 0 to F. The byte has least significant bit first so remote ID 04 would be followed by 84 and FA would be followed by 06 Note: this ordering only verified on older, white remote model.

A.C. Pisa 1909

Associazione Calcio Pisa 1909 (formerly Pisa Calcio) is an Italian association football club, based in Pisa, Tuscany. 
The club was founded in 1909 as Pisa Sporting Club and refounded in 1994 as Pisa Calcio (and registered to the "Eccellenza", that is the sixth football division in Italy), after the cancellation of the old one because of economical troubles. It was excluded again from Italian football in 2009, after the property failed to collect enough money to pay off the club's debts. In summer 2009 it was refounded with the current denomination. 
Pisa has won two Mitropa Cups, in 1985 and 1988. They play their home matches at Arena Garibaldi - Stadio Romeo Anconetani, named after Romeo Anconetani, the chairman who brought and led the club in Serie A during the 1980s and the 1990s.
At the end of the 2008 season, Pisa lost to U.S. Lecce in a two-legged promotion playoff final to Serie A. The club marked its last Serie A appearance in 1991.
The team currently plays in Lega Pro Prima Divisione.
History.
Pisa S.C..
After promotion to Serie B in 1965, Pisa took three years to reach Serie A for the first time. Despite a brave effort, Pisa were relegated on the final day of the 1968–69 season.
Spending much of the 1970s in Serie C, Pisa returned to Serie B in 1979 (by which time the club had come under the presidency of the much-loved Romeo Anconetani) and were promoted to Serie A in 1982, embarking on a period of six out of nine seasons in Serie A. With Danish international Klaus Berggreen among their stars, Pisa managed a credible 11th place in the 1982–83 Serie A with 27 points and 27 goals scored and conceded in 30 games. The following season brought relegation (during which they recorded just 3 wins and 16 draws) with 10,000 fans travelling to Milan for the fateful penultimate game.
Promotion followed in 1985, and the team seemed capable of staying up until losing their last three games. The cycle was repeated in 1987, only for a side containing players like Dunga and Paul Elliott to stay up. The last promotion to Serie A was achieved in 1990, and with the talents of players like Maurizio Neri, Michele Padovano and Lamberto Piovanelli up front and Diego Simeone and Aldo Dolcetti in midfield, the side started well and was briefly atop the standings, only to suffer another relegation.
Relegation brought considerable financial strains to the club, and by 1994 they had lost a relegation play-off and were condemned to Serie C1.
Pisa Calcio.
Bankruptcy saw Pisa reformed in Eccellenza, only to return to Serie C2 in 1996 and C1 in 1999. Pisa have since worked towards attaining Serie B status, which was achieved in 2007. Their crowds have been among the better in Italy's lower divisions owing to the dedication of their fans.
In 2005–06, the team, initially thought to be a protagonist for the promotion, were in continuous struggles, and avoided relegation after playoffs in two dramatic regional derbies against Massese. The 2006–07 season, with new boss Piero Braglia, brought Pisa back to fight for a promotion spot: the "nerazzurri" ended the regular season in third place, and eventually won the promotion playoffs by defeating Venezia in the semi-finals and Monza in the finals. 
For the 2007–08 Serie B campaign, the first in 13 years, Giampiero Ventura was named to replace Braglia at the helm of the "nerazzurri". Despite initial predictions of a mid-low table place, Pisa's impressive performances brought the team to fight for a direct promotion spot, also thanks to a forward line composed by Alessio Cerci, José Ignacio Castillo and Vitali Kutuzov which proved to be among the finest in the league. The club ended the regular season in sixth place, therefore achieving a spot to the promotion playoffs, where Pisa was later defeated by Lecce.
In 2008–09, the club was acquired by Rome entrepreneur Luca Pomponi, who initially failed into appointing Alessandro Costacurta as new head coach, thus confirming Ventura as "nerazzurri" boss. The club, which was weakened by the departures of Cerci, Castillo, Kutuzov and several other players, did not manage to repeat its performances, with Ventura being ultimately sacked on March 2009, with the club in mid-table place. The appointment of Bruno Giordano, which was made to improve the team results, however proved to be disappointing in terms of results, as Pisa slowly lost positions in the table, and shockingly got directly relegated in the final game of the season due to an injury-time home defeat to Brescia which left the Tuscans in 18th place. The unexpected relegation also unveiled a number of massive financial issues which prevented the club from registering in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione, and on July 2009 the club was excluded by the Italian Football Federation for the second time in its history.
A.C. Pisa 1909.
Pisa has been refounded with the current denomination of A.C. Pisa 1909 S.S.D. to start again from Serie D under a new property. At the end of the season Pisa won Group (Girone) D of Serie D and was promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione (formerly Serie C2) for 2010–11 season.
The team was then admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione for the 2010–11 season to fill vacancies created by a row of club exclusions in second and third tier of Italian football league system.

Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh

Tirupati is a major pilgrimage and cultural city in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. It is the largest city in the Rayalaseema region and also the third largest growing city of the Indian state Andhra Pradesh next to Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. It is located at the foothills of the Eastern Ghats, from Chittoor, from Chennai, from Bangalore and from Hyderabad. It is one of the richest pilgrimage cities of any religious faith in the world.
Tirupati is famous for Venkateswara Swamy temple dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, located about north west of Tirupati in the Tirumala hills at an elevation of . One of the most important pilgrimage centers in the world, the temple draws millions of pilgrims and is the busiest pilgrimage center in the world. Tirupati has several temples and is a major economical and educational hub in the state.
Etymology.
The word Tirupati is derived from both Tamil and Sanskrit. In Sanskrit husband is called as Pati or Pathi, of his Pathni Sri Lakshmi devi and Tiru literally means 'Holy' or 'Sacred' in Tamil and together the temple is called as Tirupati.
Vaishnavites, commonly known as Vaikhanasas of Andhra pradesh wear thirunamam on their body, which represents the lord's sign. Later it eventually attracted many Vaishnavites who formalized the temple affairs. Saint ramanujacharya, a Tamil Vaishnavite, has aggregated and started Shri Vaishnavites settlement around the Govindarajaswamy temple in the city in the 11th century. He also regularized the pujas according to aagama saastras and named the mountain as Tirumala.
History.
There is no clear history on the origin of the temple of Lord Venkateshwara, but it was maintained and upgraded by various kingdoms. These include the Pallava Kingdom around 9th Century AD, Chola Kingdom around 10th century AD and the latest one being Vijayanagara Empire around 14th to 15th century AD. It was during the rule of Vijayanagara Empire that the temple received increased contributions.
The site was an established center of Vaishnavism around 5th century A.D. during which it was praised by Alvars (Vaishnava saints). The temple rites were formalized by the Vaishnavite saint Ramanujacharya himself, in the 11th century AD. Tirupati survived the Muslim and British invasions. It is believed that during the invasions the deity of Sriranganatha from Srirangam was brought to Tirupati for safekeeping at Ranga Mandapam.
The Madras legislature passed a special act in 1933 whereby the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) committee was invested with powers of administration and control through a commissioner appointed by the Government of Madras.. Currently it is headed by Executive officer, an IAS of Andhra Pradesh cadre appointed by Govt of Andhra Pradesh. The current executive officer is M.G. Gopal.
Climate.
Monsoon remains moderate and summer experiences temperatures ranging from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius. In winter the minimum temperatures will be between 18 and 20 degrees Celsius. Usually summer lasts from March to June, with the advent of rainy season in July, followed by winter which lasts till the end of February.
Demographics.
As per provisional reports of Census India, population of Tirupati is 459,985 and is the 9th most populous urban agglomeration in Andhra Pradesh. The sex ratio of Tirupati city is 969 females per 1000 males.
Language and culture.
Telugu is the official language. Hinduism is the major religion and most of the temples in Tirupati are of Dravidian architecture. Panche (Dhoti) and Cheera (Saree) are traditional attire of people here.
Transport.
Road.
Sri Hari bus station is one of the largest in the state and has direct bus services to nearby towns and major cities across South India. There is a dedicated bus stand at Alipiri for buses to Tirumala. A number of buses are operated by government operator APSRTC and private operators connecting Tirupati to other major cities and towns such as Chennai, Vellore, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Bangalore. Due to its proximity with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, buses from KSRTC, TNSTC, SETC also operate to Tirupati. Tirupati city, itself has a wide network of well organised roads.

<doc id="2892141" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892141" title="Horseball">
Horseball

Horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a hoop (diameter 1m). The sport is like a combination of polo, rugby, and basketball. It is one of the ten disciplines officially recognized by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.
Origins.
The sport's predecessor, pato, originated in Argentina in the early 1700s. It was outlawed in 1790 due to high mortality among players. In 1941 the Federacion Argentina de Pato was created. In 1953 was declared as Argentina's national game. The name of the game "pato" derives from the use of a live duck instead of the six-handled ball which is used in the modern sport. The game as its known today, including the use of a ball instead of an animal, was defined in the 1930s. It gained success and has spread across Europe and overseas. The International Horseball Federation has eighteen members including eight outside of Europe: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Kyrgyzstan and Mexico.
Rules of play.
The basic rules involve a team of 4 players (plus 2 substitutes if necessary) making a minimum of 3 passes between 3 different players of their team and then scoring a goal through a vertical hoop goal. The game is played on a soft, non slip surface, usually sand. The pitch is rectangular, approximately 65m x 25m.
A match begins with a pick up, the rules for the first pick up are simple; the horse has to be cantering (or at a trot when the teams are of a much younger category, usually when the players are less than 13 years of age).
The opposing team can defend by preventing them from being able to score by either pushing opponents out of the playing area using their horse's weight or by getting alongside a player and grabbing the ball from the attacker. In this situation, each rider must remain seated in the saddle; if a player leaves the saddle they will give away a penalty. If both stay seated and the defender manages to keep hold of the ball for 3 seconds then their team earns a penalty.
Simple tactics of the game involve the attacking team going towards goal crossing paths as this method helps to manoeuvre the defence and create space for attacking team members to take advantage of. Players can return 'home' if they feel an attack is failing and can cross past each other offloading the ball to form another attack. This method is quite often used because a defender trying to get the ball will usually follow the player with the ball and are no longer a threat once the ball has been passed and is travelling in the opposite direction.
When the ball is dropped or falls to the ground, anyone can pick it up so long as they are travelling in the same direction as play was when the ball was dropped. This is to avoid any riders coming head on whilst someone is picking up and to prevent a collision. Whilst picking the ball up during the game the player must not come to a stand still.
International competitions.
There are several international competitions organized by the International Horse-Ball Federation: the European Championship, the World Championship, and the clubs FIHB Champions League
The European Senior Championship is the older international tournament, the first was in 1992 in Paris. This is a mixed-sex teams tournament. There have been seventeen editions of this tournament with Saint-Lô 2013 (France), being the latest.

<doc id="2892152" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892152" title="Tulsa Sound">
Tulsa Sound

The Tulsa Sound is a musical style that originated in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was a mix of rockabilly, country, rock 'n' roll, and blues sounds of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Tulsa Sound artists include JJ Cale, Rocky Frisco, Leon Russell, Elvin Bishop, Roger Tillison, Jack Dunham, Gene Crose, David Gates, The Tractors, Steve Ripley, David Teegarden, Dwight Twilley, The Gap Band, Jim Byfield, Clyde Stacy, John D. Levan, Bill Pair, The Zigs (previously The Notions), Gus Hardin and Don White.
History.
The first appearance of note by a Tulsa Sound musician was Rocky Frisco's Columbia Harmony vinyl album "The Big Ten" under the name "Rocky Curtiss and the Harmony Flames." The album was recorded in New York at Columbia's studio at 33rd and 3rd Street in 1959 during a time when Rocky lived in Pennsylvania. Clyde Stacy was one of the first, if not the first, Tulsa Sound musician to score a nationally charted record, {Hoy Hoy b/w So Young}. This was actually a double sided hit released by Candlelight Records in 1957. Don Wallace, a popular Tulsa disc jockey, was instrumental in landing the recording contract for Clyde. Members of the NiteCaps during that period were John D. Levan, Rick Eilerts and Bill Torbett. John D. Levan was one of the first Tulsa lead guitarist having played for both Clyde Stacy in 1955, and Gene Crose 1956, then again with Stacy in 1957. Levan was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in Aug. 2004 along with Tulsa Radio Personality "rockin' John Henry. Another Tulsan, Billy Reynolds Eustise, scored a hit with his 1957 recording of "Cherry Pie."
A note from Rocky Frisco: It's my opinion that the real roots to the Tulsa Sound lead to Flash Terry and his band. Flash played at the Flamingo Lounge, on Greenwood. In 1957, Flash invited me to the weekly jam, on Tuesday nights, so I showed up and sang a few songs. I told Cale and Bill I had enjoyed the visit, so the next time I went, they came too. As time passed, more of the guys came and played. I was with Cale at a radio station in California when he said, "There really isn't a 'Tulsa Sound;' we were just trying to play the blues and didn't know how."
Leon Russell was the first member of the Tulsa scene to make inroads into the L.A. music scene, playing for Ricky Nelson along with James Burton. He then joined Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew and then produced Garry Lewis and Jan & Dean. Russell brought many Tulsans out to Los Angeles including Jimmy Karstein, Bill Raffensperger, Tommy Tripplehorn, Carl Radle, and Larry Bell. Russell was later co-owner of the Church Studio in Tulsa and of Shelter Records, which signed a number of significant Tulsa Sound artists.
Influence.
Eric Clapton was the most prominent non-Tulsa artist associated with the Tulsa sound. For ten years, Clapton's band consisted of Tulsans Carl Radle on bass, organist Dick Sims and drummer Jamie Oldaker. During that time, Clapton was a frequent performer at a variety of venues in the Tulsa area. In his review of Clapton's 1978 album "Backless", critic Robert Christgau wrote, "Whatever Eric isn't anymore . . . he's certainly king of the Tulsa sound."
In addition to Clapton, Cale's influence has been cited by Mark Knopfler, among others. His songs have been recorded by many artists, including Clapton, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Deep Purple, The Allman Brothers Band, Johnny Cash, The Band, Kansas, Santana, Captain Beefheart, Widespread Panic, and Bryan Ferry. The songs of Tulsan Elvin Bishop have often been covered by other artists, including Starship. Taj Mahal had two Tulsans in his band: Chuck Blackwell and Gary Gillmore, and one Oklahoma City native, Jesse Ed Davis.
Music journalist John Wooley and others have noted that the Tulsa Sound has directly and indirectly contributed to various other genres of music, including genres outside of rock music like alt-country and Red Dirt music.

Power and Glory

Power and Glory was a professional wrestling tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1990 to 1991. The team consisted of Hercules (Power, strength) and Paul "Romeo" Roma (Glory, looks). The team was managed by Slick.
History.
In early 1990, Paul Roma had come off a breakup of The Young Stallions and was used as an "enhancement talent" for wrestlers getting a push. Roma was paired up with the Mighty Hercules into a regular tag team. At this point they were not given a name, nor did the two faces get much air time as a team, being relegated to a few matches against jobbers. One of matches the new team had was against the other newly formed team of Jim Powers and Jim Brunzell, in which Roma and Hercules were victorious.
During the summer of 1990, Paul Roma faced Dino Bravo on "WWF Superstars of Wrestling", losing after being hit with Jimmy Hart’s megaphone and then pinned. Due to the blow to the head Roma was still in the ring feeling groggy when The Rockers came out for their scheduled match. Roma got mad at the Rockers over coming out and was soon joined by Hercules as the two sides argued. Moments later, Roma and Hercules turned heel by attacking the Rockers, beating them down before leaving the ring together.
Shortly after their attack on the Rockers, Roma and Hercules unveiled their new manager Slick (who briefly managed Hercules a few years prior), and a new name to go with their attitude - Power and Glory, along with matching outfits. Power and Glory clashed with the Rockers at SummerSlam 1990 with Marty Jannetty being forced to wrestle the match on his own after Power and Glory injured Shawn Michaels' knee before the match (this was a storyline excuse to give Michaels some time off to heal a previously suffered knee injury and he had a noticeable limp on his way to the ring for the SummerSlam match). Once Michaels returned, the feud continued, with the two teams being on opposite sides at Survivor Series, with Power and Glory once again coming out as the victors.
Despite having a number of shots at the WWF Tag Team Champions, The Hart Foundation, Roma and Hercules never won the gold. Their misfortune continued at WrestleMania VII where they lost to the Legion of Doom in 59 seconds.
Soon after, Power and Glory teamed up with Slick’s other charge, The Warlord, for a series of 6-man tag team matches that usually saw the team on the losing side. Their last pay-per-view outing came when they teamed with The Warlord to face Ricky Steamboat, Kerry Von Erich and Davey Boy Smith at SummerSlam 1991 in a losing effort. In one of their last recorded matches together as a team, they lost to the Legion of Doom at the Royal Albert Hall in England. Roma left the WWF soon after and later appeared as one of the Four Horsemen in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), while Hercules would remain with the company for a few months before departing as well.

Surgency

Surgency is a trait aspect of emotional reactivity in which a person tends towards high levels of positive affect. It has been linked to the Big Five personality trait of Extraversion in children. In children, surgency is an emotional dimension that is characterized by high levels of activity and positive emotion, impulsivity, and engagement with their environment.
Even though nowadays surgency is referred to as a self-reported construct, it was also associated to an ability. High surgency in children is often identified by parental self-report and has been associated with lower levels of effortful control. Thurstone and Thurstone identified surgency by the word "fluency". This concept of fluency is very broad, and includes facility both in speech and in writing. Cattell found that of all of the objective tests developed for assessing temperament, the fluency tests were the most valid for testing Surgency. Studman had also come to similar conclusions.

Caimin Douglas

Caimin Christian Douglas (born May 11, 1977 in Rosmalen, North Brabant) is a Dutch Antillean sprinter.
Biography.
Douglas was born in Rosmalen, out of a Dutch mother and an Antillean father. At the age of five the family returned to his father's roots in Curaçao. There he played football from the age of 11 for his local team in Willemstad and the Antillean youth squad. His pace was his main technique on the pitch and this formed the basics for his running career. In 1997 as a newcomer he won the 100 metres and 200 metres during the Curaçao Championships; he also won several other medals at other disciplines during the games. Inspired by fellow Curaçao sportsman Andruw Jones, Douglas ran his first international meeting in Puerto Rico and impressed a delegation of the University of Texas. After finishing his civil engineering study in Curaçao he made the move to Texas. During a test race he ran the fastest time ever run over 100 metres at the University and at the end of his first year he was named "All American". 
In 2000 Douglas was determined to achieve his international breakthrough, but due to injuries this was set on hold. He kept on fighting and eventually he qualified himself for the 100 and 200 metres of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney representing the Netherlands Antilles. In the series of the 100 metres he did not finish due to a groin injury. He was unable to recover from the injury before the start of the series for the 200 metres and had to cancel his participation. In his final year at the University of Texas he won another two "All American" titles and together with his 4 x 100 metres relay team he broke a 29 year old University record.
In 2001 he became Dutch national champion over 200 metres and he qualified himself for the World Championships in Edmonton, where he reached the second round still representing the Dutch Antilles. After his 2001 outdoor season he decided to represent the Netherlands in the future and he defended his 200 metres national title straight away. He ran the qualification times for the European Championships over 100 metres, 200 metres as well as for the 4 x 100 metres relay team, but due to his nationality switch he was not allowed to perform in international competitions for a year.
The next mission of Douglas, together with Patrick van Balkom, Timothy Beck and Troy Douglas was to reach the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris with the 4 x 100 metres relay team. Despite missing the national limit (after already having broken the international limit) with only a few hundreds of a second the Dutch Athletics Association (IAAF) decided to send the team to the World Championships anyway. Douglas missed the series due to tootache and the team with Guus Hoogmoed as his substitute ran a new Dutch record in 38.72 seconds. In the semi finals Douglas felt fit enough to participate and the record was broken again, to 38.63 this time. In the final, when they ran to the fourth place they came to 38.87 seconds. Due to the positive test of Dwain Chambers the British team that finished second was disqualified and the Dutch were awarded the bronze medal.
With the same team he participated at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but they were eliminated in the series due to a mistake at the changing area between him and Van Balkom. In December 2004 he graduated at the University of Texas for his Environmental Science study. After this he moved to the Netherlands to settle himself there and he did not participate in many athletics events that year. In 2006 he achieved a silver medal at the Dutch national indoor championships by finishing second behind Hoogmoed. Douglas became Dutch national champion over 100 metres in 2006 and with a groin injury he still participated in the European Championships in Gothenburg where he disappointed in the individual events, but managed to become eighth with the Dutch national 4 x 100 metres relay team. Just days after the European Championships he had a groin surgery.
After recovering from his injury he won the silver medal over 100 metres and 200 metres in 2007 at the Dutch National Championships. He was unable to qualify himself for the World Championships in Osaka and he also failed to qualify for the individual sprint events for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The 4 x 100 metres relay team together with team mates Maarten Heisen, Patrick van Luijk and Guus Hoogmoed (Gregory Sedoc and Virgil Spier as reserves) did qualify for the Olympics. Initially they finished in 17th position during the qualification process while only the first 16 teams would qualify, but due to the cancellation of the Australian team they were allowed to start in Beijing. In their qualification heat Heisen, Hoogmoed, Van Luijk and Douglas placed third in behind Trinidad and Tobago and Japan, but in front of Brazil. Their time of 38.87 was the fifth fastest out of all sixteen participating nations in the first round and they qualified for the final. In the final, the second baton change between Hoogmoed and Van Luijk failed, resulting in a slow time. They still finished the race to place seventh, before the disqualified Chinese team.

Discovery Islands

The Discovery Islands are the islands in the Discovery Passage between Vancouver Island and the mainland in British Columbia. These islands are sometimes considered to be part of the Northern Gulf Islands.
The Discovery Passage starts where the Strait of Georgia narrows between Quadra Island and Vancouver Island and continues north until it widens somewhat into the Johnstone Strait. The complex geography of the area can make it difficult to determine when travelling by boat if a sighted coastline belongs to the mainland, Vancouver Island, or one of the Discovery Islands. 
Most of these islands have very few residents. The primary attraction to visitors is the salmon fishing and there are numerous fishing lodges. Only Quadra Island and Cortes Island have ferry service. The remainder are served by private boat or float plane.
The Discovery Islands are all located within the Strathcona Regional District, except for a few of the southernmost, such as Hernando Island and Savary Island, which are in the Powell River Regional District. The larger islands within the Discovery Islands are (roughly from west to east, then north to south, with some of the smaller islands indicated next to a nearby larger island):

Alfonso Arana

Alfonso Meléndez Arana (1927–2005) was a
Puerto Rican painter.
Arana was born in New York City from Mexican father and Puerto Rican mother. When he was young, the family moved to San Sebastián, Puerto Rico, where the young painter spent his youth. At age six, Arana made his first picture and presented it to his mother. His father, a businessman, did not want his son to become an artist. This caused a major rift between father and son.
As a young man, Arana studied art in Mexico at the Atelier de Jose Bardasano, at the Manhattan School of Arts in New York, the Académie Julian and L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Paris, and did post graduate work at the American University in Washington, D.C..
As an artist, Arana became known for his style of almond-shaped, hollow yet expressive eyes in a face without a skull and with a slightly oversized body. He is also well known for his use of light, sophisticated and almost transparent colors. Arana himself defines his style as expressionism and mannerism. The artist once explained that his alive and expressive human figures do not have any skulls because "they are receptacles of the active things in the world as is God, nature, life, whatever we want." [http://www.elcoquigifts.com/newsletter2.htm]
His works are often unsettling for the degree of expression shown by his silent figures. Most initiates to his style might find his paintings to be disturbing. However, after an initial period, viewers of his paintings often find beauty within the figure's expressions.
Arana has exhibited his work in Tokyo, Paris, New York, Mexico City, Puerto Rico, and Spain. In 1986, he created the "Fundación Francisco Arana", an organization dedicated to foster art in young people. Once a year, the "Fundación" gives an outstanding art student a scholarship to live and study in Paris.
Arana suffered Parkinson's disease for quite a few years and died of associated complications on November 18, 2005 in his house in Paris in the company of his wife Simone Christophe, and daughter Rosa Meléndez Ibarra.
Of his art, Arana said:

Fontinettes boat lift

The Fontinettes Boat Lift (French: "Ascenseur des Fontinettes") was built in 1888 on the 
Canal de Neufosse and connected the River Aa and the Neufossé Canal in Arques, near Saint-Omer in the Pas-de-Calais to connect in France.
It was capable of lifting vessels of 300 tonnes displacement.
It was designed to avoid the need to use five locks which took some 90 minutes to change height by 13 metres. It was inspired by the similar Anderton Boat Lift built in 1875 in Cheshire, England.
It consists of two caissons each weighing 792 tonnes, including the lifting piston of 90 tonnes. 
Doors on the caissons and on the canal end are hydraulically powered, and sealing is effected by inflatable seals. 
In operation, the upper caisson is lowered and 64 tonnes of extra water is added. It is then raised again by hydraulic pressure from an accumulator, and when released, the two caissons exchange position. Six men were required to operate the lift, the balancing operation took only 5 minutes.
All power, including to the workshop, came from water turbines. 
The Boat Lift was built between 1885 and 1888 and worked until 1967. It was then replaced by a big, single lock built further upstream. The lift was rescued from demolition by a local conservation group and guided tours are available during the summer months for a small fee.

Torre Astura

Torre Astura, formerly an island called by the ancients merely Astura (Greek: ), is now a peninsula in the "comune" of Nettuno, on the coast of Latium, Italy, at the southeast extremity of the Bay of Antium, on the road to Circeii. The name also belongs to a medieval coastal tower in the same site, as well as to the river which rises at the southern foot of the Alban Hills, and has a course of about 33 km before flowing into the sea immediately to the southeast.
It is called Storas () by Strabo, who tells us that it had a place of anchorage at its mouth. It was on the banks of this obscure stream that was fought, in 338 BCE, the last great battle between the Romans and the Latins, in which the consul Gaius Maenius totally defeated the combined forces of Antium, Lanuvium, Aricia and Velitrae. At a much later period the little island at its mouth, and the whole adjacent coast, became occupied with Roman villas; among which the most celebrated is that of Cicero, to which he repeatedly alludes in his letters, and which he describes as "locus amoenus et in maria ipso", commanding a view both of Antium and Circeii, and to which he retired on the death of his daughter Tullia in 45 BCE It was from thence that, on learning his proscription by the triumvirs, he embarked, with the intention of escaping to join Brutus in Macedonia; a resolution which he afterwards abandoned. We learn from Suetonius also that Astura was the occasional resort both of Augustus and Tiberius, but due to its unhealthy climate, both Augustus and Tiberius contracted here the illnesses which proved fatal to them. Existing remains prove that many of the Roman nobility must have had villas there. There is scholarly conflict as to whether there was a town of the name, as asserted by Servius. Up to 1911, the remains of only one villa had been found on the island itself, but along the coast c. 1.5 km to the north-west a line of villas begins, which continues as far as Antium. To the south-east, on the other hand, remains are almost entirely absent, and this portion of the coast seems to have been sparsely populated in Roman times.
The island was at some time or other joined to the mainland by a bridge or causeway, and it thus became, as it now remains, a peninsula projecting into the sea. It is surmounted by a fortified tower, called the Torre di Astura, a picturesque object, conspicuous both from Antium and the Circeian headland, and the only one which breaks the monotony of the low and sandy coast between them. The medieval castle of the Frangipani family, in which Conradin vainly sought refuge after the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268, is built upon the foundations of a very large villa, of opus reticulatum with later additions in brickwork, and with a small harbour attached to it on the south-east. The castle was later a fief of the Caetani, the Orsini and the Colonna. Remains of buildings also exist behind the sand dunes, which possibly mark the line of the channel which separated the island from the mainland, and these may have belonged to the post-station on the Via Severiana.
The "Tabula Peutingeriana" reckons Astura c. 10 km from Antium, which is rather less than the true distance. The island seems to have existed as such in the time of Pope Honorius III.

Heliochrome

A heliochrome is a color photograph, particularly one made by the early experimental processes of the middle 19th to early 20th centuries. The word was coined from the Greek roots "helios", the sun, and "chroma", color, to mean "colored by the sun". It was applied to images as technologically diverse as Levi Hill's "Hillotypes" of the 1850s (Hill's instruction book was entitled "A Treatise on Heliochromy"), the three-color carbon prints made by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the 1870s, and the interference color photographs made by Gabriel Lippmann in the 1890s. It was also occasionally misapplied to images whose color was non-photographic, i.e., due to local coloring by handwork of some kind.

Carmen Maura

Carmen García Maura (born 15 September 1945) is a Spanish actress. In a career that has spanned six decades, Maura is best known for her collaborations with noted Spanish film director Pedro Almodóvar.
Early life.
Maura was born in Madrid to Salvador Garcia Santa-Cruz and Carmen Maura Arenzana. Her great-grandfather was the Count of Fuente Nueva de Arenzana, who lived in the Palace of Arenzana in Madrid, currently the embassy of France. Her other great grandfather from her mother´s side was the artist Bartolome Maura Montaner, brother of Antonio Maura, a former prime minister of Spain on five occasions and a noted orator.
Maura studied philosophy and literature at the "École de Beaux-Arts" in Paris. From 1964 to 1970, she was married to a lawyer, Francisco Forteza, with whom she has two children, Carmen and Pablo.
Career.
Maura began her career as a cabaret singer.
Maura's film career was launched in 1970 with an appearance in the film "The Man in Hiding". This was followed by a major role in the 1977 film "Tigres de papel". Although Maura has played dramatic roles, she is often noted for her comedic roles in films like "Sal gorda" (1984), "Sé infiel y no mires con quién" (1985) or "Tata mía" (1986).
Maura appeared in the first film by Pedro Almodóvar, "Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del montón", in 1980. They went on to collaborate on five additional films in the 1980s, the last of which was "Women on The Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (1988), for which she was awarded the European Film Award "Felix" for best actress.
Maura and Almodóvar appeared to have had a falling out after "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown". They did not work together for over a decade, but joined forces again in 2006 for "Volver". 'Volver' means 'Return' in Spanish, and one of the many returns the title alludes to is Maura's return to Almodovar's movies. The female cast of "Volver" won a collective prize for Best Actress at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.
Maura also appeared in "800 Bullets" where she played the mother of the boy who is the main character of the story. Kevin Severson is her son.
Maura is cited as a gay icon for the role of a transsexual she played in Almodóvar's "Law of Desire", strengthening her image as a strong woman who is never afraid to break through boundaries.
Maura has won more Goya Awards for Best Leading Actress than any other actress in the history of Spanish film.
She has won recently the "Locarno Excellence Award" for all her cinematographic career.
Maura has worked under the orders of major directors like Almodovar, Ford Coppola, Amos Gitai, Yasmina Reza, Alejandro Agresti, Carlos Saura, Étienne Chatiliez and Alex de la Iglesia.

Shahadat Hossain

Kazi Shahadat Hossain () (born 7 August 1986) is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He made his Test debut in 2005 during Bangladesh's first tour of England. When he came onto the international scene he was cited by then coach Dav Whatmore as the fastest bowler in the team. The following year, Hossain made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Kenya. At times Hossain has struggled with conceding too many runs, and for that reason was dropped in 2009. In November 2010, Hossain was a member of the squad that won Bangladesh's first gold in any event at the Asian Games. A broken toe prevented Hossain from playing for Bangladesh in July 2011, but after more than a year since his last Test he returned to the squad in October that year.
Early years.
Born in Narayanganj, Hossain began playing cricket during his teenage years in his home town, and his father, a banker, agreed to send him to a training camp. Whilst at the training camp he was spotted by a scout and was referred to the Bangladesh Institute of Sports to improve.
Hossain soon found himself called up for the Bangladesh U-19 cricket team for the 2003–04 Asian U-19 Tournament in Pakistan, but he didn't find much success, taking only 2 wickets in 3 appearances, as Bangladesh lost all their group stage matches and failed to progress to the final. His run in the team continued, however, as he was picked for the 2004 U-19 Cricket World Cup as Bangladesh played hosts. In the group stage he played in all 3 matches, taking 5 wickets, as the team progressed to the Plate competition of the Cup. For the Plate final, he took a wicket as Bangladesh defeated Australia to finish ninth out of sixteen. He finished with six wickets at an average of 28.50, and was named by Cricinfo writer Rabeed Imam as the fastest bowler and one of the most promising players in the tournament.
International career.
His debut Test against England at Lord's in 2005 was something of a sober experience, as he conceded 101 runs in 12 overs without taking a wicket, an economy rate of 8.41.
On the tour to Zimbabwe in July 2006, Hossain became the first Bangladeshi to take a hat-trick in One Day Internationals.
South Africa toured Bangladesh in February 2008 for two Tests and three ODIs. Though they were expected to win with ease, South Africa were made to work hard for victory in the opening Test. Cricinfo recorded that Hossain "bowled at a lively pace and with tremendous control" to help Bangladesh gain a first-innings lead. He claimed career-best figures of 6/27, and despite a further three in the second innings South Africa won by five wickets. Bangladesh lost the second match by an innings and 205 runs with Hossain taking 3/107. In January 2009 Shahadat was dropped from the national side. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam stated that Shahadat was too expensive, having conceded runs at 6.63 an over in 18 ODIs in 2008, and believed he would benefit from returning to domestic cricket.
When July–August 2009, Bangladesh toured the West Indies, Hossain was included in the 15-man squad. By winning the first Test, Bangladesh secured their first win against the West Indies, their first overseas Test victory, and only their second Test win. The West Indies side was very inexperienced due to the fallout of a dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and the West Indies Players' Association over pay. The first XI had made themselves unavailable for selection and a new squad had to be chosen. Seven West Indies players made their Test debut in the match and the side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. Hossain was fined 5% of his match fee for excessive appealing, one of three Bangladesh players reprimanded after the match for the same reason. Bangladesh went on to win the second Test, and in the process secured their first overseas series win. Having played in both Tests, Hossain took three wickets at an average of 42.66.
The next time Shahadat played was when Bangladesh hosting India for two Tests in January 2010. In the lead up to the first match Indian batsman Virender Sehwag called the Bangladesh bowling attack ordinary, provoking anger amongst the team. India were dismissed for 234 in the first innings, with Shahdat taking 5/71. It was the third time he had taken a five-wicket haul in a Test innings. Captain Shakib Al Hasan remarked that " didn't bowl all that well; he can bowl much better than this. But it's good for his confidence that he got wickets, as he is on a comeback." Bangladesh were unable to build on their early success and went on to lose the series 2–0. Shahadat was his team's second-highest wicket-taker across the two Tests, but after taking a five-wicket haul in the first innings of the series he managed just two more. Between October 2008 and March 2010, Shahadat endured a lean spell in which he took 18 Test wickets at an average of 67.50. His bowling average in this period was amongst the worst for the 20 innings before a bowler took a five-wicket haul in Tests.
Bangladesh toured England in May 2010 for two Tests and three ODIs. Hossain played in the first Test at Lord's and was one of three Bangladesh players still in the team five years after the team's first tour of England. Contrasting with his debut effort, Shahadat took five wickets for 98 runs and in the process became the first Bangladeshi cricket to be added to the Lord's honours board. England won the series 2–0 and Hossain took a single wicket in the second Test. He finished as his team's second highest wicket-taker with six wickets in the series. Hossain was part of the 13-man Bangladesh squad that played in the 2010 Asian Games in late November. They played Afghanistan in the final and won by five wickets, securing the country's first gold medal at the Asian Games.
Dhaka Division won the One-Day National Cricket League in November 2010, with all the matches held in the space of three weeks. Hossain took ten wickets from six matches in the tournament, producing his best figures of 4/39 in the final against Barisal Division to help his team to victory. Hossain was not included in Bangladesh's 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, having lost his place in the ODI side to younger fast bowlers Shafiul Islam and Rubel Hossain. A broken toe, sustained during a game of beach football, prevented him from taking part in Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe in July and August 2011, a series which marked Zimbabwe's return to Test cricket and Bangladesh's first Test match since the tour of England over 14 months earlier. National captain Shakib Al Hasan lamented Hossain's absence, saying "I think Hossain Rajib is a huge loss. He's been our best Test bowler for quite a while." He returned to action in the Bangladesh Cricket Board Cup in September, taking six wickets in four games for Bangladesh A against a team of academy players and the full national side. Hossain was recalled to the Test squad in October to face the West Indies in a two-match series. He also played in both of Bangladesh's Tests against Pakistan in December. During the second Test against Pakistan, Hossain bowled several no-balls. In the first four Tests of his comeback Hossain took just two wickets whilst conceding 394 runs.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. An auction was held for teams to buy players, and Hossain was bought by the Khulna Royal Bengals for $30,000. When Bangladesh hosted the 2012 Asia Cup Hossain was included in the squad and played his first ODI since February 2010. He conceded the more runs than any other bowler in the tournament and his four wickets cost on average 62.00 runs each; when the BCB announced its central contracts in April Hossain's was not renewed.
Bowling style.
Noted for his height and aggression, Hossain was cited as the fastest bowler in the Bangladesh team by former coach Dav Whatmore in 2005. By 2010 his bowling rarely exceeded . His run-up is smooth, his deliveries come in at an angle and bowls with pace. He has become renowned for hurting batsmen with his bouncer, having hit international players such as Mathew Sinclair and Ricky Ponting over the course of his career. His bowling has come in for criticism from fellow bowler Mashrafe Mortaza for conceding too many runs. He has said his idols include Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar, Steve Harmison and Brett Lee (all fellow fast bowlers).

1939 Pacific hurricane season

The 1939 Pacific hurricane season ran through the summer and fall of 1939. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes are extremely unreliable. Most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land. However, 1939 saw a large number of storms threaten California.
Storms.
Hurricane One.
On June 12, a hurricane was detected. The lowest pressure reported by a ship was . The hurricane was last seen June 13.
Possible Tropical Cyclone Two.
A possible tropical cyclone was located off the coast of Mexico on June 27. A ship reported a gale and a pressure of . The system was last seen on June 28.
Tropical Cyclone Three.
On July 19, a tropical cyclone was detected. A ship reported a pressure of .
Tropical Cyclone Four.
On July 29, a tropical cyclone was located midway between Manzanillo and Acapulco. It moved up the coast, and a ship reported a pressure of on July 29 as the cyclone made landfall in the vicinity of Manzanillo.
Tropical Cyclone Five.
A small tropical cyclone was detected on August 31. A ship reported gales and a pressure of .
Hurricane Six.
From September 4 to 7, the remnants of a hurricane brought heavy rain to Southern California. The storm delivered over a year's worth of rainfall to Blythe, while Imperial received more than two year's worth. The flooding caused major damage in Mecca, California, and of water swamped Thermal.
Hurricane Seven.
A tropical cyclone was first detected south of Acapulco on September 5. It intensified into a hurricane and moved northwestward. A ship sailing through the eye reported a pressure reading of . The tropical cyclone made landfall somewhere along the Baja California Peninsula. It dissipated inland over the northern part of the peninsula on September 12. Remnants of this tropical storm, in association with a trough, caused rain of up to in southern California on September 11 and 12.
Tropical Cyclone Eight.
On September 5, a tropical cyclone formed off the coast of Costa Rica. It also headed northwest and dissipated over the southern part of Baja California on September 15. The lowest reported pressure was . From September 19 to 21, remnants of this tropical cyclone caused rain measuring up to in Southern California.
Hurricane Nine.
On September 14, a tropical cyclone formed off the coast of Central America. This tropical storm tracked northwestward and intensified into a hurricane. The sea-level pressure dropped to or lower. The hurricane recurved gradually to the northeast and weakened over cool seas. On September 25, this tropical storm made landfall near Long Beach, California, and dissipated inland.
The tropical storm caught Southern Californians unprepared. It brought heavy rain and flooding to the area, which killed 45 people. At sea, 48 were killed. The storm caused heavy property damage amounting to $2 million (1939 USD) in total, mostly to crops and coastal infrastructure.
Hurricane Ten.
On October 23, a tropical cyclone formed south of Cabo Corrientes. It intensified and headed roughly due north. A steamer, the "Nevadan", caught in the eye of this extremely intense hurricane, recording a corrected central pressure of . Even with modern tropical cyclone observation techniques available, this reading still qualifies this cyclone as one of the most intense on record. Besides battering the "Nevadan", this hurricane also disrupted shipping. It made landfall near Cabo Corrientes on October 25 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The hurricane onshore caused heavy damage to crops, lines of communication, and several coastal towns.

Grażyna Miller

Grażyna Miller (Jedwabne, 29 January 1957 – 17 August 2009) was a Polish poet and translator who lived in Italy.
She lived in Italy, where she wrote poems and translated publications from Polish into Italian. She was also a literary critic whose work was published by the most prestigious Italian press media. Her most notable accomplishment was the translation of Roman Triptych (Trittico romano (Meditazioni) by Pope John Paul II). This book was published by the Libreria Editrice Vaticana and, on March 6, 2003, presented by the (then) Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.
Biography.
Grażyna Miller, born in Poland, started to write poetry in her early childhood, exactly at the age of seven. During her high school years she incessantly wrote poetry while continuing her studies. Her passions were literature and pedagogy, and soon after finishing her studies she started to teach Polish literature.
In 1983 she moved to Italy. From the beginning of her stay she started to study the Italian language at the University for Foreigners of Siena in Tuscany. During her stay in Sicily (1990–1999) she distinguished herself for her admirable cooperation with the Polish-Sicilian Association by promoting her native culture, the arts and literature. She currently resides in Rome where she has become a journalist and she writes for few of the best literature inspired newspapers and cultural magazines, such as the "Corriere Romano" (The Roman Courier), "La Scena Illustrata" (The Illustrated Scene) and "Il Giornale dei Poeti" (The Poets' Journal). She is studying and translating a variety of contemporary authors, but first of all she is translating Carol Woityla's poetry. 
In January 2003 she translated to Italian the "Trittico Romano.Meditazioni" (The Roman Triptych: Meditations) written in Polish by Pope John Paul II and published by the Vatican, with the presentation of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. The official inauguration took place the March 6, 2003 in the Sala Stampa of the Vatican in the presence of the author, Pope John Paul II. In 1998 she published her first collection of poems "Curriculum" which was presented in the International Book Showcase in Turin. The artist's second collections of works, "Sull'onda del respiro" (On breath's weave), was published in 2000 and presented for the first time in the honorary suite of the St.Mary of Angels Basilica, nearby Piazza Republica in Rome. The latest published collection of poems "Alibi di una farfalla" (A butterfly's alibi) was admitted to the Vatican Book Archives. This last book was presented and inaugurated in the Sicilian city of the most prominent regional authorities and the Mayor of Piazza Armerina in Sicily. In 2003 the book was also presented at the Book Showcase of Frankfurt, in Germany.
Also in Italy Grażyna Miller received many national as well as international recognitions. Grażyna Miller received an award from the Minister of Italian Culture in 2002.
She won the international "Luigi Vanvitelli 2001" award for "her poetic creativity that and to serve as an inspiration culturally and humanists to the current generation of artists. Other awards received were: First National Award for religious poetry, first "Forum Interart" award for artists, poets and narrators and the "Fiore di Roccia" award for romantic poetry. In 2004 Grażyna Miller received the National literature and Journalism award, during which she was cited for her excellent Italian version of the Roman Triptych.
In Spain the book received the international "Cartagena 2003" award. The book was also recognized at the Jagiellonian University of Cracow, in Poland where Grażyna Miller received the "Zloty Medal" (Golded Medal) for her crativity and her Polish-Italian involvement. At the same time she was given the international "Najlepsi Roku 2001" (Best of the Year 2001) award in her native country.
Not only Polish and Italian media such as "Zycie Warszawy", "Dziennik Polski", "L'osservatore Romano", and "Il Messaggero" are interested in Grażyna Miller, but Spanish and American newspapers write about her work as well. The Italian-American bilingual newspaper "Bel Paese" published in USA dedicated a permanent column on one of its pages to her poetry.
For some time Grażyna Miller also read her poems live on the Italian television: RAI, local network "Antenna Sicilia" and the religious TV network Telepace transmitted live the presentation of her latest book "Alibi di una farfalla", where right after her collection of unedited works she added her translations of some of K.Wojtyla's poems. She released many interviews for both the Italian and the Polish Vatican radio stations, where her poems were read and broadcast.
Grażyna Miller was also interviewed by the national Italian radio and TV station (RAI) which dedicated considerable attention to her work.
She participated in the "International Poetry Contest - A poem for peace", organized by the Anna Kuliscioff Study Center of Turin, Italy with the participation of the Italian President, many Embassys and many international organizations where the author proved her commitment to her humanitarian mission as a poet.

Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness

The Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness is located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Created by an act of Congress in 1988, the wilderness covers an area of 9,754 acres (39.47 km2). Contained within Ouachita National Forest, the wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.
The wilderness has both Pine Mountain and Rich Mountain which are two long mountain ridges that rise to over 2,600 feet (792 m) above sea level. Several streams and waterfalls flow off the ridges creating the headwaters of the Kiamichi River. Beech trees, usually found much farther north, along with pine and dense stands of oak dominate the forest. Black bears can be found in the wilderness, along with White-tailed deer, bobcat, skunk and Pheasant.
About 7 miles (11.3 km) of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail pass through the wilderness allowing hikers access to the highest mountain ridges in eastern Oklahoma.
U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are usually allowed with a proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.

Eta Aurigae

Eta Aurigae (η Aur, η Aurigae) is a star in the constellation Auriga. It has the traditional name Hoedus II or "Haedus II". With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.18, it is visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this star is approximately distant from the Earth.
Eta Aurigae is a larger star than the Sun, with more than five times the Sun's mass and over three times the Sun's radius. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of B3 V, which is a B-type main sequence star that is generating its energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. It is radiating 955 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 17,201 K. Based upon its projected rotational velocity of 95, it is spinning with a rotation period of only 1.8 days. Eta Aurigae is around 39 million years old.
Etymology.
Along with ζ Aurigae it represents one of the Kids of the she-goat Capella, from which it gets its Latin traditional name Hoedus II or "Haedus II," from the Latin "hædus" "kid"; Zeta Aurigae is Hoedus I. It has the less common traditional name "Mahasim," from the Arabic المِعْصَم "al-micşam" "wrist" (of the charioteer), which it shares with Theta Aurigae. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.18 and is located at a distance of around from Earth.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Pillars", refers to an asterism consisting of η Aurigae, ε Aurigae, ζ Aurigae, υ Aurigae, ν Aurigae, τ Aurigae, χ Aurigae and 26 Aurigae. Consequently, η Aurigae itself is known as (, .)

The Dream Team (professional wrestling)

The Dream Team was a World Wrestling Federation tag team from 1985 to March 29, 1987 consisting of Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine managed by ”Lucious” Johnny Valiant. The New Dream Team, also managed by Johnny Valiant, saw Dino Bravo replace Brutus Beefcake and competed from March 1987 until the winter of 1987/1988.
History.
Prior to creation of the Dream Team, Greg Valentine, managed by Jimmy Hart, had won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Tito Santana and was in the middle of a brutal feud with Santana. Brutus Beefcake had entered the WWF in 1984 under the management of Johnny Valiant.
The Dream Team.
Managers Johnny Valiant and Jimmy Hart first put Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake together in May 1985. Early on Beefcake teamed with Valentine to fight off Tito Santana and the Junkyard Dog, both high ranked contenders for Valentine's Intercontinental title. In Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on April 21, 1985 the Dream Team lost to Santana and Ricky Steamboat in approximately 15 minutes in what many consider one of the best tag team matches of the 80s. The match appears on the WWF's Coliseum Home Video release "Best of the WWF Vol. 4". On July 6, 1985 Santana regained the Intercontinental Title in a steel cage match and shortly afterwards the Dream Team set their sights on the reigning WWF World Tag Team champions, the US Express (Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda).
Not long after Johnny Valiant became the sole manager of the Dream Team as the two started to team more and more regularly. Their initial shots at the tag team champions were unsuccessful but on August 24 at The Spectrum in Philadelphia the Dream Team won the tag team titles from the U.S. Express when Beefcake rubbed Luscious Johnny’s lit cigar in Windham’s eye (only a storyline).
Immediately after their title win, the Dream Team were challenged by the British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid), often escaping with their titles due to underhanded means. Besides defending against the Bulldogs the Dream Team also put the gold on the line against such teams as The Killer Bees as well as the former champions the US Express (both versions). The Bulldogs remained a constant threat to the Dream Team as 1985 turned to 1986, finally the Dream Team agreed to give the Bulldogs one final tag team title shot at WrestleMania 2. On April 7, 1986 the two teams met in the Chicago section of WrestleMania broadcast from the Rosemont Horizon, with the addition of “Prince of Darkness” Ozzy Osbourne in the Bulldogs’ corner the Dream Team finally ran out of tricks and lost the gold.
Finding themselves in the challengers position the Dream Team now chased the Bulldogs in the months following WrestleMania 2 climaxing in a series of steel cage matches during the summer of 1986. A running gag on the WWF's weekly television was Gorilla Monsoon's constant suggestion that the Dream Team never mentally got over the lose at WrestleMania 2, likely in acknowledgement of what many consider the best match on the card that night. Gorilla would always make a point to mention it happened in Chicago's Rosemont Horizon, the location Gorilla himself was stationed at for the event. As the summer passed the Dream Team found themselves facing the Killer Bees and the 2nd version of the US Express instead of challenging for the gold. As 1986 turned to 1987 the Dream Team found themselves feuding with The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jaques and Raymond). The team was also joined by Johnny Valiant’s newest addition Dino Bravo in six-man tag matches. Lack of championship success, not to mention Beefcake feeling muscled out by Bravo, began tension within the team.
At WrestleMania III the Dream Team and the Rougeaus clashed once again with the Dream Team winning due to Dino Bravo’s interference. After the match Dino Bravo and Greg Valentine argued with Brutus Beefcake, kicking him off the team.
The New Dream Team.
After dumping Beefcake, Valentine and Bravo began wrestling as “The New Dream Team”, starting out strong by defeating The Islanders in a series of house show matches after which they continued the long running feud with the Rougeau brothers splitting matches between them over the summer, often in six man matches with Beefcake joining the Rougeaus to take on Valentine, Bravo and Valiant. The Dream Team also had a couple of shots at the world tag team champions The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) but did not manage to repeat the success of the original Dream Team
The New Dream Team's last major appearance as a team was at the inaugural Survivor Series where they took part in a 10 team, tag team elimination match. Valentine was pinned by Paul Roma of the Young Stallions, eliminating the team from the match.
After Survivor Series the New Dream Team broke up quietly, they simply stopped teaming up and went their separate ways. One of the main reasons for this split was because Valentine and Bravo legitimately did not get along outside the ring. Johnny Valiant left the WWF, Greg Valentine began working as a singles wrestler reuniting with Jimmy Hart, and Dino Bravo came under the guidance of Frenchy Martin. Valentine and Bravo would later be team-mates in Randy Savage's "King's Court" team at the Survivor Series (1989), by which time Bravo had joined Valentine under Hart's management.

Operation Paraquet

Operation Paraquet was the code name for the British military operation to recapture the island of South Georgia from Argentine military control in April 1982 at the start of the Falklands War. 
The official name "Paraquet" is an alternative spelling of Parakeet, but the operation is perhaps more widely known as Operation Paraquat, an unofficial name adopted by troops in the South Atlantic who feared the operation would prove as lethal to them as the weedkiller Paraquat. This view prompted the exclamation ""kill Paraquat before it kills us.""
The operation, a subsidiary of the main Operation Corporate (recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina) was successful, leading to the island being restored to British control on 25 April 1982.
Operation.
The operation was ordered by Admiral Fieldhouse on 12 April 1982. It was to involve Mountain Troop from D Squadron Special Air Service (SAS) from Ascension Island, 150 Royal Marines on the tanker "Tidespring", 2SBS on and 6SBS in the submarine . This was known as CTG 317.9, commanded by Captain Brian Young. "Conqueror" was first on the scene and carried out a survey of key areas of the South Georgia coast.
The operation was originally supposed to involve both SAS and Special Boat Service (SBS) forces being infiltrated onto South Georgia by helicopters from the "Tidespring" and , but the plan had to be changed when the two Wessex helicopters transporting the SAS troops to an ambitious location on the northeast coast crashed in bad weather on Fortuna Glacier; the troops and aircrew were rescued by "Antrim"'s Wessex helicopter, the last remaining to the expedition.
On 9 April the submarine left port in Argentina with a detachment of marines on board to reinforce the South Georgia garrison, and arrived safely in Grytviken on 24 April. However, on 25 April the "Santa Fe" was intercepted while sailing away and disabled by depth charges from Antrim's Wessex helicopter and subsequent attacks by task force Wasp and Lynx helicopters, which fired at least six AS-12 missiles on the submarine. The "Santa Fe" was forced to limp back to Grytviken.
There followed an immediate assault by an improvised group of Special Forces and Royal Marines, with two Royal Navy vessels ("Antrim" and ) conducting a naval bombardment demonstration on the low hills opposite Grytviken. The garrison at Grytviken and the crew of the disabled "Santa Fe" surrendered to M Company, 42 Commando, Royal Marines, after fifteen minutes at 17.15 GMT, although the garrison at Leith Harbour, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Alfredo Astiz, surrendered the following day. Sweden and France requested Astiz's extradition from the British authorities after learning about his capture, but his captors rejected the petition.
An Argentine prisoner of war, Navy Petty Officer Felix Artuso, a crewman of the "Santa Fe", was mistakenly shot dead on 26 April after a British marine thought he was sabotaging the submarine. He is buried at Grytviken Cemetery.
A message that was widely publicised in Britain was made by the Task Group Commander, Captain Brian Young, after the surrender at Grytviken:
Wildlife film maker Cindy Buxton and her assistant Annie Price, who had been filming in an isolated part of the island before the invasion, were evacuated by a helicopter from on 30 April.

<doc id="2892360" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892360" title="Cambodian coup of 1970">
Cambodian coup of 1970

The Cambodian coup of 1970 refers to the removal of the Cambodian Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, after a vote in the National Assembly on 18 March 1970. Emergency powers were subsequently invoked by the Prime Minister Lon Nol, who became effective head of state, and led ultimately to the proclamation of the "Khmer Republic" later that year. It is generally seen as a turning point in the Cambodian Civil War. No longer a monarchy, Cambodia was semi-officially called ""État du Cambodge"" (State of Cambodia) in the intervening six months after the coup, until the republic was proclaimed.
It also marked the point at which Cambodia became substantially involved in the Second Indochina War, as Lon Nol issued an ultimatum to North Vietnamese forces to leave Cambodia.
Background.
Since independence from France in 1954, Cambodia had been led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whose Sangkum political movement had retained power after winning the 1955 parliamentary election. In 1963, Sihanouk had forced the National Assembly to approve a constitutional amendment that made him head of state with no fixed term of office. He had retained domestic power through a combination of political manipulation, intimidation, patronage, and careful balancing of left- and right-wing elements within his government; whilst placating the right with nationalist rhetoric, he appropriated much of the language of socialism to marginalize the Cambodian communist movement, whom he called the "Khmers Rouges" ("Red Khmers").
With the Second Indochina War escalating, Sihanouk's balancing act between left and right became harder to maintain. Cross-border smuggling of rice also began to have a serious effect on the Cambodian economy. In the Cambodian elections of 1966, the usual Sangkum policy of having one candidate in each electoral district was abandoned; there was a huge swing to the right, especially as left-wing deputies had to compete directly with members of the traditional elite, who were able to use their local influence. Although a few communists within the Sangkum – such as Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan – chose to stand, most leftists were decisively defeated. Lon Nol, a rightist who had been a longstanding associate of Sihanouk, became Prime Minister.
By 1969, Lon Nol and the rightists were growing increasingly frustrated with Sihanouk. Although the basis for this was partly economic, political considerations were also involved. In particular, the nationalist and anti-communist sensibilities of Lon Nol and his associates meant that Sihanouk's policy of semi-toleration of Viet Cong and Vietnam People's Army activity within Cambodian borders was unacceptable; Sihanouk, during his swing to the left in 1963–66, had negotiated a secret arrangement with Hanoi whereby in return for the guaranteed purchase of rice at inflated prices, the port of Sihanoukville was opened for weapons shipments to the Viet Cong. As well as the rightist nationalists, the liberal modernising elements within the Sangkum, headed by In Tam, had also become increasingly alienated by Sihanouk's autocratic style.
There is evidence that during 1969 Lon Nol approached the US military establishment to gauge military support for any action against Sihanouk. Lon Nol's appointee as deputy Prime Minister, Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak – a US-friendly nationalist and leader of the Cambodian business community – is thought to have suggested that Sihanouk should be assassinated, though Lon Nol rejected this plan as "criminal insanity". Sihanouk himself thought that Sirik Matak (who he characterised as a jealous rival claimant to the Cambodian throne) backed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and in contact with exiled Sihanouk opponent Son Ngoc Thanh, had suggested the coup plan to Lon Nol in 1969. CIA involvement in the coup plot remains unproven, and Henry Kissinger later claimed that events would take the US government by surprise, but it seems likely that at least some military intelligence agents were partly culpable. 
Declassified documents indicate that, as late as March 1970, the Nixon administration was hoping to garner "friendly relations" with Sihanouk.
Overthrow of Sihanouk.
In March 1970, while Sihanouk was touring Europe, the Soviet Union and China, large-scale anti-Vietnamese demonstrations erupted in Phnom Penh. Crowds attacked the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong (Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam) embassies. Sihanouk initially gave a certain degree of support to the demonstrators; he hoped Moscow and Beijing would pressure North Vietnam to reduce its presence in Cambodia. Indeed, it has even been suggested (by William Shawcross and others) that Sihanouk and Lon Nol may have planned the first demonstrations to gain political leverage against Hanoi.
The riots, however, escalated beyond the government's control – although this was likely done with a degree of encouragement from Lon Nol and Sirik Matak – and the embassy was sacked. Inside, a "contingency plan" was allegedly found for the communists to occupy Cambodia. On 12 March, Sirik Matak cancelled Sihanouk's trade agreement with North Vietnam; Lon Nol closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them: all PAVN (People's Army of Vietnam aka. North Vietnamese Army) and NLF (National Liberation Front aka. Viet Cong) forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action. When, by the morning of 16 March, it was clear that this demand had not been met, some 30,000 youths gathered outside the National Assembly in Phnom Penh to protest against the Vietnamese presence.
From this point, events were to move with increasing rapidity. On the same day, the Cambodian Secretary of State for Defence, Colonel Oum Mannorine (Sihanouk's brother-in-law), was scheduled to be questioned by the national legislature on allegations of corruption; the proceedings were adjourned to hear the demonstrators' resolutions. According to Sihanouk, Mannorine had received information that Lon Nol and Sirik Matak were about to precipitate a coup; a group of Mannorine's men, under the command of Phnom Penh's Chief of Police Major Buor Horl, attempted to arrest the plotters, but it was by then too late. Mannorine, and other key security personnel loyal to Sihanouk, were placed under arrest. After the Assembly adjourned for the day, Sihanouk's mother Queen Kossamak, at Sihanouk's request, summoned Lon Nol and Sirik Matak to the Royal Palace and asked them to end the demonstrations.
It appears to have been sometime during 16 or 17 March that Sirik Matak finally swayed Lon Nol to remove Sihanouk from the government. Lon Nol, who until that point may have been merely hoping that Sihanouk would end his relations with North Vietnam, showed some reluctance to take action against the Head of State: to convince him, Sirik Matak allegedly played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. However, the Prime Minister remained uncertain, with the result that Sirik Matak, accompanied by three army officers, finally compelled a weeping Lon Nol to sign the necessary documents at gunpoint.
The next day – 18 March – the army took up positions around the capital, and a debate was held within the National Assembly under In Tam's direction. One member of the Assembly (Kim Phon, later to be killed by pro-Sihanouk demonstrators in Kompong Cham) walked out of the proceedings in protest, though was not harmed at the time. The rest of the assembly voted unanimously to invoke Article 122 of the Cambodian constitution, which withdrew confidence in Sihanouk. Lon Nol took over the powers of the Head of State on an emergency basis, while the position itself was taken by the President of the General Assembly, Cheng Heng. In Tam was confirmed as President of the Sangkum. The coup had, therefore, followed essentially constitutional forms rather than being a blatant military takeover. These events marked the foundation of the Khmer Republic.
Demonstrations against the coup.
On 23 March, Sihanouk (via Beijing Radio) called for a general uprising against Lon Nol. Large-scale popular demonstrations calling for Sihanouk's return began in Kompong Cham, Takéo Province, and Kampot Province. The demonstrations in Kompong Cham became particularly violent, with two National Assembly deputies, Sos Saoun and Kim Phon, being killed by demonstrators on 26 March after driving to the town to negotiate. Lon Nol's brother, police official Lon Nil, was set upon in the nearby town of Tonle Bet by plantation workers and was also killed.
The demonstrations were suppressed with extreme brutality by the Cambodian army; there were several hundred deaths and thousands of arrests. Some witnesses spoke of tanks being used against crowds of unarmed civilians.
Aftermath.
Following the coup, North Vietnam forces invaded Cambodia in 1970 at the request of Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea. These events would earmark the start of the Cambodian Civil War pitting Lon Nol's regime backed by US air power against the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnam. The end result was Lon Nol's flight from Cambodia in 1975 right before the Khmer Rouge's seizure of power.

Joshua Silver

Professor Joshua D Silver is a UK physicist whose discoveries have included a new way to change the curvature of lenses, with significant application for the low-cost manufacture of corrective lenses.
In 2007 he was leading a group of researchers in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the University of Oxford.
Professor Silver is currently the director of the Centre for Vision in the Developing World at the University of Oxford, working to research the scope of and potential solutions to the problems of refractive error and low vision in the developing world.
Research.
While studying mirrors, Silver discovered a new way to change the curvature of lenses. He applied this to create a new form of liquid-filled corrective lens, that could be easily adjusted by the wearer to correct the vision of over 90% of people requiring correction. This is particularly useful for people in developing countries where specially trained optometrists are not available. In 1996 he formed a company, Adaptive Eyecare, to develop these adaptive ophthalmic lenses in partnership with the UK Government's Department for International Development, for distribution in developing countries. The company has developed prototype adaptive spectacles (called AdSpecs) that can correct both far-sighted and near-sighted people, and these spectacles have been trialled in several countries in Africa and Asia. So far 30,000 of Silver's lenses have been distributed in 15 countries.
In 2007 his research focused on using spectroscopy to understand the physics of highly charged ions (produced using the university's electron beam ion trap (EBIT)). This research has application in understanding extreme plasma environments such as fusion tokamaks and stellar atmospheres.

Dehkhoda Dictionary

The Dehkhoda Dictionary () is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27000 pages). The complete work is an ongoing effort that entails over forty-five years of efforts by Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and a cadre of other experts. Although Dehkhoda covers a big part of literary terms and words in Persian language, it also lacks most of scientific and technology terms coined and loaned during the past decades. Dehkhoda states in the preface of the dictionary that "Not only this book misses 2/3 of today’s entire Persian vocabulary, at least half of the words I knew were forgotten and not mentioned in this book." Many of those words were added after his death.
The series initially consisted of 3 million records ( "fish" or "bargeh" in Persian) (up to 100 records for each word or proper noun) until Dehkhoda's demise in November 1955, and currently contains 343,466 entries that according to the latest digital release of the dictionary by Tehran University Press (version 3.0) are based on an ever-growing library of over 2300 volumes in lexicology and various other scientific fields.
It was first printed in 1931. Dehkhoda also was helped by prominent linguists Mohammad Moin, Jafar Shahidi, and Dabirsiyaghi.
The work became so significant that in 1945, a bill was proposed in the Majles, signed by numerous Members of Parliament, including Mohammed Mossadegh, to allocate a special budget and staff to completing the project. Offices were provided for the task inside the compounds of the Majles itself, and later on, the entire project was moved to University of Tehran College of Humanities, with additional staffing, where the Dehkhoda Institute was founded, and where it remains until this day.

Carmel Busuttil

Carmel Busuttil (born 29 February 1964 in Rabat, Malta) is one of Malta's most experienced football players. Now retired from playing, he is assistant coach of the Malta national football team.
Career.
Busuttil started his career with Rabat Ajax and won 2 titles there. He then went on to have a short one year spell at Verbania Calcio in Italy, where he was capped 20 times and scored 8 goals. He then moved on to spend 6 years playing for Belgian Club FC KRC Genk (322), four of them as captain, and finishing as the club's top scorer for three seasons. In 1994 he returned to play for the Maltese club Sliema Wanderers, where he scored 78 goals, helping his team to win the Maltese Premier League and also the Maltese Cup. He was capped 113 times for the Malta national football team and was their top scorer with 23 goals, until recently Michael Mifsud broke Busuttil's record.
He is known as 'Il-Bużu', an abbreviation of his surname. After he retired, he was football coach at a couple of respected Maltese private schools, most notably St. Michael's Foundation for Education. He then formed his own youth training academy, The Buzu football school. In November 2003, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of UEFA, he was selected as the Golden Player by the Malta Football Association as the most outstanding player of Malta in the last 50 years. Busuttil has also won wider acclaim. In 2000 he received the prestigious Order of Merit of the Republic from the then president of Malta, Professor Guido de Marco, for his contribution to Maltese sport.
As a coach, Busuttil had a stint with the Maltese Football League side Pietà Hotspurs, and assisted Horst Heese in the guidance of the Maltese national team between 2003 and 2005. He return to the position in 2009 as assistant to John Buttigieg. They are both on a 5-year contract. However, in 2011, they were both sacked and replaced by the Italian Pietro Ghedin.

Systematics – study of multi-term systems

Systematics is the name given by John Godolphin Bennett (1897-1974) to a branch of systems science that he developed in the mid-twentieth century. Also referred to as the theory of Multi-Term Systems or Bennettian Systematics, it focuses on types, levels, and degrees of complexity in systems, the qualities emergent at these levels, and the ability to represent and practically deal with ("understand") complexity using abstract models. Thus to understand the notions of sameness and difference requires a system or universe of discourse with a minimum of two terms or elements. To understand the concept of relatedness requires three, and so on.
Bennettian Systematics evolved through various stages of formulation as described in his major, four-volume work "The Dramatic Universe" (initially published 1955-1966) and in various articles in "Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences," published from 1963 to 1974. Bennettian Systematics has been further refined and advanced by students such as Anthony G. E. Blake, Anthony Hodgson, Kenneth Pledge, Henri Bortoft, Richard Heath, and others.
Overview.
Bennett has described his discipline of Systematics in quite general terms as "the study of systems and their application to the problem of understanding ourselves and the world." He notes in this general context four branches of Systematics:
Bennett's use of the term "Systematics" is basically synonymous with what today falls under the terms "systemics", "systemology", "systems science," and "systems theory." However, his own specific work under the name "Systematics" takes approaches that are still unfamiliar to many current systems specialists, making his work a specialty in a much broader field. In addition, the use of the term "systematics" in biology to refer to the classification of types and forms of organisms creates ambiguity and rather overwhelms the term's current viability within general systemology. Thus reference can be made simply to "Bennettian Systems," "Bennettian Systemics," "Bennettian Systematics," or to "Multi-Term Systems” to describe his work and its continuations.
Formal Bennettian systems are defined around and focus on the idea of logical or qualitative complexity rather than quantitative complexity. There is thus a possible analogy to the philosophical program of logical atomism. ("Quantitative complexity," as contrasted with "qualitative," results from the presence in a practical setting of two or more actual components of the same qualitative type. However, in practical Systematics, the quantity or amount of a component also has concrete qualitative effects, and the two categories cannot always be separated.) 
Thus in formal Systematics, Bennettian systems are abstract, and each system represents a qualitative or logical "type" or level analogous to the logical levels used by Bertrand Russell in his Theory of Types. 
Each formal level consists of qualitatively independent but mutually relevant "terms" that constitute a "universe of discourse" specific to that level, and terminology suitable at one level can cause category confusion when used in other contexts.
Every multi-term system so-defined has its special system-level attribute or characteristic emergent quality, such as "dynamism" for the triad, or "significance" for the pentad. The emergence of these qualities, according to the work of Anthony Blake in what he calls Lattice Systematics, is mysterious but not random and occurs within a process involving both increasing "spiritualization" of will and increasing specification or "materialization" of function.
The logical level of the system depends on the number of the qualitatively different but mutually relevant terms in the system. Bennettian systems thus increase in qualitative complexity, and display new emergent qualities, in a quantized, progressive series as the number of qualitatively distinct terms within the system increases. 
Conversely, the "terms" of a given formal system correlate in a general way with the specific degree, type, or level of the system they occur in, so that the terms of a dyad are characterized as "poles", those of a triad as "impulses," those of a tetrad as "sources," those of a pentad as "limits," and so on. 
Each system beyond the first contains subsystems and all systems, theoretically, are embedded in supersystems with a higher number of terms.
In practical Systematics, Bennett carried this process of elaboration up to the 12-term system as best he could within the constraints of the very limited technical vocabulary currently available to make such distinctions. Beyond the 12-term system he spoke of “societies.”
Bennett correlates the logical levels or leaps of qualitative complexity with what he calls the "concrete" or "qualitative" significance of number, perhaps again analogous to what Russell calls "relation number" in "Principia Mathematica" and in looser reference to Pythagorean traditions, although Bennett was at pains to distinguish what he was doing from various kinds of mere "numerology."
The series of Bennettian systems includes the monad, dyad, triad, tetrad, and so on, open-endedly. 
In Bennettian Systematics, systems progress in complexity from the monad up, and from vague wholeness to increasingly articulate structure that reaches into society, history, and the ontological fabric of the cosmos. 
Practical and Applied Bennettian Systems.
The series of Multi-Term Systems can serve in applications as simplified but progressively complex outer checklists to ascertain the objective diagnostic completeness of a survey and analysis of a system or situation. However, conversely, the system models can also be used "inwardly" as an aid to subjectively assessing one's own impartiality, wisdom, and adequacy of comprehension. They thus can point toward real structures and processes in the outer world of fact as well as, yogically, those structures and processes in the inner world of values and human capacities. 
The Enneagram of Process of Gurdjieff is a central but partial part of the Bennettian Systematics of the ennead.
History.
Systematics came in part out of the Pythagorean historical tradition but was influenced by twentieth century movements such as A. N. Whitehead's philosophy of organism, C. S. Peirce's pragmatism, and Bertrand Russell's logical atomism, theory of types, and logic of relations. However, it was independent of Bertalanffy's general systems theory and other systems thinking work. The strongest personal influence was from Gurdjieff and his writings. Gurdjieff had taught the significance of the 'law of three' and the 'law of seven' in a meta-scientific context, but Bennett proposed that there was a 'law' for every integral number, and that this could help people understand practical things such as management and education.
Parallels can be drawn between Bennettian Systematics and the work of C. G. Jung and Marie Louise von Franz on number as archetypal, as well as with the philosophies of engineers such as Buckminster Fuller and Arthur Young.
Programme.
Bennettian Systematics has an integrative programme. Throughout all cultures and throughout all disciplines there are discernible threads of meaning associated with multi-term systems that might otherwise be missed. Bennettian Systematics links with understanding which is connected with structural unity and how insight from one area of experience can be transferred to another without distortion. A journal called "Systematics" was launched by Bennett’s Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences in 1963 to publish a diversity of articles relating to this programme. Systematics also led into the development of a new learning system called structural communication, which later became a broad methodology called logovisual thinking (LVT).

Ateste

Ateste (modern Este, Italy) was an ancient town of Venetia, at the southern foot of the Euganean hills, 43 feet above sea-level and 22 miles southwest of Patavium (modern Padua). The site was occupied in very early times, as archaeology begun in the late 19th century showed.
Overview.
Large cemeteries have been excavated, which show three different periods from the 8th century BCE down to the Roman domination:
The many important objects found in these excavations are preserved in the local museum.
Inscriptions show that the Venetic language asserted its existence even after Ateste came into the hands of the Romans. When this occurred is not known. Boundary stones of 135 BCE exist, which divide the territory of Ateste from that of Patavium and of Vicetia, showing that the former extended from the middle of the Euganean hills to the "Atesis" (modern Adige, from which Ateste no doubt took its name, and on which it once stood).
After the battle of Actium, Augustus settled veterans from several of his legions in this territory, Ateste being thenceforth spoken of as a colony "(colonia)". It appears to have furnished many recruits, especially for the "cohortes urbanae", an urban police force created by Augustus. Ateste appears but little in history, though its importance is vouched for by numerous inscriptions, the majority of which belong to the early Empire.

SPURS National Honor Society (Service, Patriotism, Unity, Responsibility, and Sacrifice) was a collegiate sophomore honor society founded at Montana State University - Bozeman as an honor society for Sophomore women in 1922. Originally a women-only organization, SPURS went co-educational in 1976. Chapters were spread across the United States, primarily at smaller colleges and universities and emphasis remained on community service and scholarship.

<doc id="2892412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892412" title="Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem">
Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem

In mathematics, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, named after Friedrich Hirzebruch, Bernhard Riemann, and Gustav Roch, is Hirzebruch's 1954 result contributing to the Riemann–Roch problem for complex algebraic varieties of all dimensions. It was the first successful generalisation of the classical Riemann–Roch theorem on Riemann surfaces to all higher dimensions, and paved the way to the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem proved about three years later.
Statement of Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem.
The Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem applies to any holomorphic vector bundle "E" on a compact complex manifold "X", to calculate the holomorphic Euler characteristic of "E" in sheaf cohomology, namely the alternating sum
of the dimensions as complex vector spaces.
Hirzebruch's theorem states that χ("X", "E") is computable in terms of the Chern classes "C""j"("E") of "E", and the Todd polynomials "T""j" in the Chern classes of the holomorphic tangent bundle of "X". These all lie in the cohomology ring of "X"; by use of the fundamental class (or, in other words, integration over "X") we can obtain numbers from classes in "H"2"n"("X"). The Hirzebruch formula asserts that
taken over all relevant "j" (so 0 ≤ "j" ≤ "n"), using the Chern character ch("E") in cohomology. In other words, the cross products are formed in cohomology ring of all the 'matching' degrees that add up to 2"n", where to 'massage' the "C""j"("E") a formal manipulation is done, setting
and the total Chern class
Formulated differently the theorem gives the equality
where "td(X)" is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of "X".
Significant special cases are when "E" is a complex line bundle, and when "X" is an algebraic surface (Noether's formula). Weil's Riemann–Roch theorem for vector bundles on curves, and the Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic surfaces (see below), are included in its scope. The formula also expresses in a precise way the vague notion that the Todd classes are in some sense reciprocals of characteristic classes.
Riemann Roch theorem for curves.
For curves, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the classical Riemann–Roch theorem. To see this, 
recall that for each divisor "D" on a curve there is an invertible sheaf O("D") (which corresponds to a line bundle) such that 
the linear system of "D" is more or less the space of sections of O("D"). 
For curves the Todd class is 1 + "c"1("T(X)")/2, and the Chern character of a sheaf O("D") is just
1+"c"1(O("D")), so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem 
states that
But "h"0(O("D")) is just "l"("D"), the dimension of the linear system of "D", and by Serre duality "h"1(O("D")) = "h"0(O("K" − "D")) = "l"("K" − "D") where "K" is the canonical divisor. Moreover "c"1(O("D")) integrated over "X" is the degree of "D", and "c"1("T"("X")) integrated over "X" is the Euler class 2 − 2"g"
of the curve "X", where "g" is the genus. So we get the classical Riemann Roch theorem
For vector bundles "V", the Chern character is rank("V") + "c"1("V"), so we get Weil's Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles over curves: 
Riemann Roch theorem for surfaces.
For surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces
combined with the Noether formula.
If we want, we can use Serre duality to express "h"2(O("D")) as "h"0(O("K" − "D")),
but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the "h"1(O("D")) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).

<doc id="2892414" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892414" title="Structural communication">
Structural communication

Structural communication was developed in the 1960s by John G. Bennett and his research team to simulate the structure and quality of a small group tutorial through automated means. It provides access to high level learning for many students without much supervision. A communication consists of both information and structure. An effective two-way communication involves mutual verification of understanding through comparisons of structure. In structural communication, information is provided that participants have to organize in explicit ways. 
Structural Communication is an instructional approach that provides a simulated dialogue between an author of instructional materials and the students. It has been called "an interactive technique for communicating understanding". Understanding is "inferred if a student shows the ability to use knowledge appropriately in different contexts, and to organize knowledge elements in accordance with specified organizing principles" (Egan, 1972, p. 66). The technique was designed to encourage creative thinking in learners, allowing them to develop an understanding of a topic, not simply to memorize facts. Furthermore, Structural Communication was designed to promote learning for social action. "Hodgson, in line with many current constructivists, viewed the social contexts of the learning activity to be critical for the transfer of learning to practical situations". The distinctions between the learning of knowledge and the learning for social action are evident in the components Bennett and Hodgson designed into the Structural Communication technique. The seven components of a Structural Communication unit are described below.
Components.
1. Intention.
The opening statement, which defines what is to be studied, provides an overview, possibly an "advance organizer", and sometimes a rationale. It is used to provide a context for the content of the study unit and a focus for the study.
2. Presentation.
The material, experience, exercise, case study, etc. which supplies the essential facts and concepts of the domain being studied. This may be an existing text, a video, a case study, a simulation, or real-life experience, depending on the overall strategy of the exercise. This could also be any sort of computer-based instruction, including simulations.
3. Response Array.
A randomized array of items which summarize key parts, concepts or principles from the knowledge base that is being used and studied in the exercise. Often it resembles a "key point summary" of the Presentation.
4. Questions.
A set of problems for solution, which are designed to present the "intellectual challenge" that is an essential part of the Structural Communication methodology. These problems are interrelated and are open-ended to allow multiple responses and viewpoints. The purpose of the investigation section is for the learner to interact with the subject matter. To respond to a question, a student selects a number of items from the Response Array that, taken together, summarise what must be brought to bear on it. 
Challenge: Problem 4
Here is a diagram of an apparatus for measuring the latent heat of vaporization of a liquid S at various temperatures. The tube T leads to a vessel that is kept slightly cooler than the main enclosure. Hl and HS are two heating coils. l is the same liquid which is used to control the temperature inside the main enclosure. Taken together, the valve V (which opens to a pump), the heating coil Hl, and the liquid "l", form a control system. Select those items on the Array which indicate what is prevented from happening by this control system. Then also indicate how this is done. 
5. Diagnostics.
These are sets of logical tests of inclusion and exclusion. Relative to any given question, the author ascribes values of "essential", "relevant", "irrelevant" and "misleading" to the items of the Response Array and builds his tests around them. The student is not shown what these tests are but is given a set of comments based on his response.
6. Comments.
The Comments are constructive statements that discuss in depth the rationale for including or excluding certain items. They can accommodate alternative interpretations and also serve to further the discourse represented in the Presentation.
7. Viewpoints.
An outline of the author's, and other alternative viewpoints; this may review some aspects stated in the Intention, make explicit some biases or standpoints held dear by the author, draw attention to other views in the literature, etc. Ideally, the viewpoint section plays a final, interactive role between author and learner.
An additional aspect of the Structural Communication study unit is the assessment of the learner's responses to the questions posed by the study unit.
Sample Exercises.

History and development.
The basic method was developed in the 1960s for educational use. Work was done with the electronics company GEC to develop a teaching machine – the ‘Systemaster’ – because at this time there was little widespread use of computers. 
By the 1970s, structural communication had also come to be applied to management training. Anthony Hodgson made significant changes to the method. Firstly, the items that had previously been provided by an ‘expert’ were replaced by ones generated by the group itself. Secondly, in place of a static array, each item was put onto a separate magnetic hexagon that could be attached to and moved on a suitable whiteboard. This meant that people could generate and physically handle the items. In place of making selections in an abstract way, they could physically ‘cluster’ them together to make various meanings. 
In the 1980s, software was developed. And the method was linked to decision theory. 
In the 1990s, the method was re-interpreted as LogoVisual thinking and cast in the form of a fivefold process, now seen as universally applicable to any thinking process. 
By the twenty-first century, it was again finding many applications in schools as well as management and communities. It proved especially versatile in dealing with a wide range of numbers of people from single individual to many hundreds.

Battle of Kashii

The Battle of Kashii (樫井の戦い) was the very first battle of the Summer Campaign of the 1615 Siege of Osaka, near the beginning of the Edo period in Japan. It took place on 26th day of 4th month of Keichō era.
As the Shogun's Eastern Army prepared to renew the siege begun the previous winter, the Ōsaka garrison sallied forth, ambushing Tokugawa forces in a number of skirmishes and sieges. In the battle of Kashii, a contingent of forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori, lord of Ōsaka, attempted to besiege Wakayama Castle, which was controlled by Asano Nagaakira, an ally of the shogun. The attackers were led by Ōno Harunaga, Hanawa Naoyuki, and Okabe Noritsuna.
Asano's garrison realized that their attackers were far from support or reinforcements, and met them in battle at Kashii, a short distance from Wakayama. Okabe and Hanawa were killed in the battle, and Ōno was therefore forced to retreat back to Ōsaka.

Charioteer Papyrus

The Charioteer Papyrus (London, Egypt Exploration Society, s.n.) is a 5th-century fragment of an illustration from an unknown work of literature. It is one of the finest surviving fragments of classical book illustration. Unlike other surviving illustrated fragments of papyrus, such as the "Romance Papyrus" and the "Heracles Papyrus," which have illustrations that are little more than mere sketches, the "Charioteer Papyrus" is sensitively drawn and finely colored. It shows portions of six charioteers in red or green tunics. Although there is no text on the fragment, it undoubtedly served an illustration for a literary work, perhaps serving as an illustration for the chariot race at the games at the funeral of Patroclus in the "Iliad."

Shenzhou 8

Shenzhou 8 () was an unmanned flight of China's Shenzhou program, launched on October 31, 2011 UTC, or November 1 in China, by a modified Long March 2F (CZ-2F) rocket which lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.
The Shenzhou 8 spacecraft was automatically docked with the Tiangong 1 space module (launched on 29 September 2011) on November 3 and again on November 14, 2011. This unmanned docking—China's first—was followed in 2012 with the manned Shenzhou 9 mission, which performed a manned docking (also China's first) with the Tiangong 1 module. Only the Soviet Union (Russia), Japan and the European Space Agency had achieved automatic rendezvous and docking prior to China's accomplishment.
History.
On September 29, 2008, Zhang Jianqi (), Vice Director of China manned space engineering, announced in an interview of China Central Television that Tiangong 1, an 8-ton "target vehicle", would be launched in 2010 (now 2011), and that Shenzhou 8, Shenzhou 9 and Shenzhou 10 were all intended to dock with it.
On October 1, 2008, Shanghai Space Administration, which participated in the development of Shenzhou 8, stated that they have succeeded in the simulated experiments for the docking of Tiangong 1 and Shenzhou 8.
, the launch of Shenzhou 8 was planned for early 2011. 
By March 2011, the launch had been postponed until October 2011.
Shenzhou 8 was launched at 21:58 UTC on October 31, 2011 (November 1 in China) by a modified Long March 2F (CZ-2F) rocket. The launch lifted off from 921/SLS-1 Launch Pad at the Southern Launch Site of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. 
The unmanned Shenzhou 8 mission successfully docked with Tiangong-1 on 2 November 2011 GMT, marking China's first orbital docking. Shenzhou 8 undocked from Tiangong-1 on 14 November, before successfully completing a second rendezvous and docking, so as to test the reusability of the docking system.
Shenzhou 8 deorbited on 17 November 2011, and landed safely in Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia.
Mission.
Shenzhou 8 features an active APAS like docking module in place of the usual orbital module, and performed its docking operation automatically under ground control. Docking took place on November 2 at 1728 GMT, during orbital darkness to avoid interference from the Sun's glare with sensitive navigation and rendezvous equipment. 
After 12 days being docked, Shenzhou 8 undocked and a second docking took place, this time in full sunlight. The separation, second rendezvous, and docking occurred on November 14 and was aimed to test accuracy and reliability of equipment and sensors in a bright environment. On November 17, the capsule was autonomously de-orbited.
The mission also featured a biological sample supplied by Germany and the European Space Agency, which was cited as an example of "international cooperation in the field of manned space" by Zhang Jianqi, deputy chief commander of China's manned space programme.
Final Shenzhou spacecraft design.
According to Zhang Bainan, the chief designer of China's spacecraft systems, Shenzhou 8 was the last to see significant modifications from previous models. Future flights will use the same spacecraft design, which is intended for production of multiple units of the same design.

Peatbog Faeries

The Peatbog Faeries are a largely instrumental Celtic fusion band. Formed in 1991, they are based in Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.
Their music embodies many styles and influences, including folk, electronica, rock and jazz, - but their main influence is traditional celtic music. The band's unique sound is created through a mix of programmed effects and traditional celtic arrangements, played on bagpipes, fiddles, and whistles.
The band have twice won "Live Band of the Year" at the Scottish Traditional Music Awards and were nominated for "Live Band of the Year" at the BBC Radio 2 folk awards.
History.
The Peatbog Faeries formed in 1991. They recorded and released their debut album "Mellowosity" in 1996 on Greentrax Recordings. Two years later they signed to a New York label and recorded their second album, "Faerie Stories". Due to problems at the record company the CD was not released for a further two years. The album featured a more experimental blend of club/dance music and funk combined with celtic music, receiving positive reviews from those who noticed it.
For their third album the band set up their own label, Peatbog Records. On the label, they released "Welcome to Dun Vegas" in 2003. The album introduced a small amount of vocals. In 2005, they released "Croftwork", which saw the first appearance of brass instruments on an album. These have been a regular feature of the band's albums and live performances ever since.
The band toured in 2008, recording a series of gigs and subsequently released their first live album, "Live", made up of two of these performances.
The band's seventh studio album, "Dust", was released in August 2011.
The Peatbog Faeries are currently working on an eighth album.
Music.
The band's genre is celtic fusion, and like the genre, the band are often seen as very experimental musicians. Their debut album, "Mellowosity", is often seen as a quieter, more alternative rock album with the usual celtic vibes. It is believed that Pink Floyd were a cited influence. By much surprise, the band's 2001 "Faerie Stories" offered a completely different style of celtic fusion. Trance music became the main theme of the album, as well as electronic dance music and even reggae at times.
The band's third album, "Welcome to Dun Vegas", was a lot less celtic at times, with bagpipes absent in a few of the songs, and the overall genre was alternative rock, returning to that of "Mellowosity". The opening track ("Wacko King Hako"), however, seems to be a mix of both alternative rock and dance music, both of whom the band previously used. The band used a brand new type of celtic fusion for "Croftwork". The new vibe matched reggae, electronic dance music, alternative rock, but most importantly brass roots, with saxophones appearing in many of its songs. "What Men Deserve to Lose" appeared to be quite similar to "Croftwork", with the brass roots returning, but with more alternative rock audible towards the end of the album.
Previews of "Dust" have hinted that it is more ambient than previous work, but with the original roots returning.

Atrek River

The Atrek (also Atrak and Etrek) (, ) is a fast-moving river which begins in the mountains of Northeastern Iran (), and flows westward draining into the southeastern corner of the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan. Because of the high use of its waters for irrigation, it only flows into the Caspian when it is in flood stage.
Geography.
The Atrek is 669 km long and drains a basin of 27 300 km².
Politics.
Beginning at , where its tributary the Sumbar join it, the river forms the border of Iran with Turkmenistan; this helped keep the area closed throughout the Cold War years. A 1926 treaty between Iran and Turkmenistan stipulates that Turkmenistan receives approximately 50% of the total Atrek average runoff.
Ecology.
Even though sturgeons concentrate in the area of the Caspian Sea next to the Turkmen coast, they do not currently migrate into the Atrek River owing to its low water level and pollution. Since the Atrek is the only Caspian watershed river of the Turkmen coast, sturgeons no longer reproduce in Turkmenistan.

Swannanoa (mansion)

Swannanoa is an Italianate villa built in 1912 by millionaire and philanthropist James H. Dooley (1841–1922) above Rockfish Gap on the border of northern Nelson County and Augusta County, Virginia, in the USA. It is partially based on buildings in the Villa Medici, Rome.
Rockfish Gap is the southern end of the Skyline Drive through the Shenandoah National Park and the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway.
It is located on the crest of the Blue Ridge mountains, overlooking both Shenandoah and Rockfish valleys. It is located on a jurisdictional border, so it is in both Augusta and Nelson counties.
History.
Intended to be a "summer place" for Richmond, Virginia, millionaire and philanthropist James H. Dooley and his wife Sally May, it reportedly took over 300 artisans eight years to build the structure, complete with Georgian marble, Tiffany windows, gold plumbing fixtures, and terraced gardens. Built as a token of love from husband to wife, the depth of James and Sally May’s relationship was represented in the 4,000 piece Tiffany stained-glass window and a domed ceiling bearing the likeness of Mrs. Dooley Despite the lavish expenditure, it was occupied only for a few years following completion in 1912.
Major Dooley died in 1924 at the age of 82. He left Swannanoa entirely to his wife, Sally Mae, along with several million dollars. Sally Mae Dooley died in 1926 at the age of 79. She left the estate to Major Dooley's two sisters.
When the property was built it had state-of-the-art fixtures for the time. Electricity and plumbing were installed in the house. It was the first house to have electricity in Nelson County and to accomplish this it had its own power plant on the property. There also was a built in elevator. Like Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's house 27 miles away, it had a dumbwaiter to bring food up from the basement kitchen to the dining room on the first floor.
The sisters sold Swannanoa in 1926 to the Valley Corporation of Richmond, which became the second owner of Swannanoa. They planned and opened a country club in 1929 and closed in 1932. During that time they built the stone building on the property rumored to house the region's best moonshine distillery and which was a favored supplier for government officials during Prohibition. The golf course was an 18-hole course. In was during Swannanoa's time as a country club that Calvin Coolidge had Thanksgiving dinner (1928) at the mansion. The sumptuous accommodations and isolation from the Capitol's hubbub seemed to affect Mrs. Coolidge deeply, giving her "the giddiness of a mare in the spring" according to the waitstaff. Calvin was typically silent on the subject, but seemed rather drawn and sleepy for the next day's hunting.
The mansion was empty from 1932 until 1942, when A.T. Dulaney formed Skyline Swannanoa, Inc. Dulaney and nine other stockholders purchased Swannanoa and became the third owners of the property.
The United States Navy considered purchasing and renovating the property in 1942, which they calculated would cost $200,000, for the purpose of establishing a secret facility to interrogate prisoners of war. The military rejected it in favor of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Fort Hunt, Virginia, code named P. O. Box 1142, because it seemed unlikely that Congress would approve the purchase of such a palatial structure for the purpose. The mansion stood empty through the Great Depression and World War II until it was leased in 1949 to Walter Russell for his University of Science and Philosophy. During this period, the retreat took in a series of female acolytes who, to help support the institute, gave tours of the mansion and grounds.
Walter Russell died in 1962, his wife Lao died in 1988. The University of Science and Philosophy decided to leave the property and gave up their lease in 1998. In 1999 Skyline Swannanoa, Inc. started major renovations on the property.
Today the property is owned by J. F. Dulaney, Jr., of Charlottesville, who has been attempting to sell tours of the first floor, all the while letting the property fall into disrepair.
Currently small group tours, open houses and weddings are being held on the property and there are plans for a bed-and-breakfast in the future.

Ghosthunter

Ghosthunter is a third-person shooter action video game built around ghost hunting. Developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published for the PlayStation 2 by SCEE in Europe, Namco in North America and Electronic Arts in Japan, the game was released on December 5, 2003 in Europe, on August 17, 2004 in North America and on September 2, 2004 in Japan.
The game tells the story of Lazarus Jones, a rookie detective with the Detroit Police Department, who accidentally releases a group of imprisoned ghosts from their confinement. When one of the ghosts kidnaps his partner, Jones must enter the ghost realm to successfully track her down. The game received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising its graphics but criticizing its brevity and linearity.
Gameplay.
"Ghosthunter" is a third-person shooter. Players control the protagonist, Lazarus Jones, with the left analog stick. The right analog stick is used to move the camera and adjust aim when in combat or first-person mode. When in default third-person mode, Jones has a full range of movement, but he cannot shoot. To do so, the player must enter combat mode, which places a crosshair on screen. In combat mode, Jones' lateral movement changes to strafing, and he also moves slower. Jones can also shoot whilst in first-person mode, although he is unable to move in this mode. The game features two types of ammo; normal ammo for the shotgun and pistol, and ghost energy for the other weapons. Ghost energy can be collected in the form of orbs found throughout the game and dropped by defeated enemies.
When the player encounters a ghost, they must weaken it to a point where it can be captured by hitting it with a "Capture Grenade." If the player uses the grenade before weakening the ghost sufficiently for capture, the grenade attaches itself to the enemy for a limited time, and a life meter appears. If Jones depletes the life meter whilst the grenade is still attached, the monster will be captured. The grenade can also be used to pick up ghost energy and health which the player cannot physically reach.
As well as controlling Jones, the player can also control Astral, a spirit which Jones can call in specific locations. Astral levitates rather than walks, and she has no offensive capabilities. Instead, the player has access to different "form", such as a Revenant form which allows her to walk and interact with switches, a charming form which allows her to trick ghosts into following her, a spectral form which allows her to warp at special warp points, a poltergeist form which allows her to throw objects and a possession form which allows her control certain ghosts.
"Ghosthunter" is one of the relatively rare examples of a game featuring a false ending; Jones is killed, apparently for good, and the game returns to the title screen, inviting the player to start over. However, within moments, the game begins again, with the player in control of another character.
Plot.
The game begins at Montsaye High, an abandoned school in Detroit, where Detective Lazarus Jones (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is on his first day on the job. He is on a routine call with his partner, Anna Steele (Nan McNamara), to investigate reports of unusual sounds in the building. Steele explains that several years previously, a professor murdered ten students, and then disappeared. He was never found, nor was any murder weapon, and the coroner was unable to determine the cause of death of any of the victims. After the two split up to investigate the building, Jones discovers a laboratory in the basement. He presses a switch on a machine, which seems to release a gas of some kind. He is knocked out and when he regains consciousness, he goes to meet Steele in the sewers. However, before he can prevent it, Steele is dragged into a pipe by a transparent man.
Jones returns to the lab, where a sentient computer program (Joe Morton) explains to him that when he pressed the button, he shut down an array containing numerous imprisoned ghosts, and he must now set about recapturing them. The program also tells him that he has "supernormal sight"; he can see ghosts with the naked eye. He has acquired this ability because he has fused with Astral; a spirit who wishes to add him in his quest. The program also explains that his only hope of getting Steele back is to find Professor Richmond, who created the lab. His location, however, is unknown, so Jones must use the "Spectral Gateway" to jump to ghost realms, fighting ghosts until he finds Richmond.
After heading to a ghost town, where he saves a young girl from the clutches of the spirit of Lady DeMontford (Jane Hamilton), Jones returns to the lab and learns that Astral's real name is Kate Heller, and she was Richmond's assistant. She is still alive, but her physical location is unknown. Jones then encounters the spirit of the Montsaye librarian (Jane Hamilton) who tells him the legend of the thirteenth century English knight, Sir William Hawksmoor (Michael Gambon); the man Jones saw abduct Steele. A trusted servant of the king, he eventually became too powerful, and a group of aristocrats killed him. Jones also learns that Richmond did not commit the murders in the school. He returned from a journey through the Gateway to find the bodies of the students. Pursuing the murderer, he eventually caught up with Hawksmoor, who explained that he murdered the students to make Richmond follow him. However, Richmond was able to capture Hawksmoor and place him in the array. Until he was inadvertently released by Jones.
Jones next encounters a ghost ship, where he aids a group of English World War II soldiers, led by Colonel Freddie Fortesque (Michael Cochrane), defeat a monster whom they have been fighting since the War. He then heads to a prison island, Devil's Scar Penitentiary, where he encounters Frank Agglin (André Sogliuzzo), a former police officer who killed several people, including his wife, before being executed by electric chair. Jones, however, discovers that Agglin was possessed by Hawksmoor. He eventually finds Richmond (Joe Morton), but they are attacked by Agglin. Jones defeats him, and Richmond explains that when he captured Agglin's spirit and placed it into the array, Hawksmoor was able to trace Richmond back to Montsaye, resulting in the murders. Richmond explains that Hawksmoor has Kate Heller's physical body, but he needs Astral, although Richmond is unsure exactly why. He and Jones then head to a secret underground military base, where Richmond worked during the 1970s, undertaking paranormal research for the government. He explains that Kate became trapped in the Astral form due to an experiment that went wrong. She then fused with Richmond as she has now fused with Jones, and they began hunting ghosts. However, Hawksmoor proposed a deal to the military executives of the base - if they granted him Kate Heller's body, as well the right to exploit the Professor, he would destroy their enemies. Learning of this, Richmond fled the base with Heller, going to work in Montsaye High, before Hawksmoor tracked him down.
Richmond then betrays Jones, handing him over to Hawksmoor in return for being allowed to leave. As Richmond departs, Hawksmoor uses a machine to extract Astral from Jones. Steele, who is possessed by Hawksmoor, then shoots and kills Jones. However, Richmond's computer program takes control of a heavily armed robotic unit. It encounters Jones' ghost, which it leads to the "Resurrection Machine" – a machine which can reunite a spirit with its physical form. Richmond had discovered that every person who dies before their "allotted time" becomes a ghost, but over a long period of time, each ghost fades away, eventually ceasing to exist. Hawksmoor is attempting to prevent this happening by using the machine, which needs Astral's ghost energy to work. Lazarus is resurrected as Hawksmoor arrives and flings the robot from the balcony. Hawksmoor himself then enters the machine, but before he can active it, Richmond arrives, giving weapons to Lazarus and Steele, who is now free of Hawksmoor's possession. They destroy the machine and Lazarus battles Hawksmoor as Richmond finds the robot damaged beyond repair. However, it is in possession of a zero bomb, a device capable of utterly destroying a ghost. Lazarus and Steele flee and Richmond sets off the bomb, killing himself and Hawksmoor. Steele and Jones make it back to the school and joke about how hard it is going to be to write their report. The fate of Kate Heller/Astral remains unknown.
Development.
According to SCE Cambridge Studio, the origin of the game was their desire to do "a very high concept dark adult, James Bond/"Ghostbusters"" type game. Each of the team looked to their favorite horror films for inspiration, as well as to other survival horror games. They also claim to have been particularly inspired by "".
The game was first announced on April 22, 2003, with SCEE revealing a plot outline, the main characters and the basic gameplay mechanics. It was also revealed that the game would run off a tweaked version of the "Primal" game engine, with new special effects technology used to produce the game's "cinema-grade effects." Playable demos of a 60% complete build were first shown at the 2003 Games Convention in Leipzig in August, with a European release date slated for November. The game was also on display at the 2003 PlayStation Experience in London in September.
The game was released in Europe in December, but wasn't picked up for North American release, with Sony choosing not to distribute the game themselves. In April 2004, however, Namco announced they had acquired North American distribution rights, with release slated for August. The North American localization was first previewed at the 2004 E3 event in May. For the North American version of the game, over 1,500 fixes and improvements were made, with the grenade targeting system and the camera and combat systems refined. Some of the puzzles were made easier, but combat was made harder.
Reception.
"Ghosthunter" received mixed reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 69 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on forty-four reviews and 72.40% on GameRankings, based on fifty-nine reviews.
Eurogamer's Ronan Jennings was somewhat disappointed, scoring the game 6 out of 10 and arguing the only thing it really has going for it is its graphics. He was critical of the level design, the Astral-related puzzles and the "clunky" combat system. However, of the graphics, he wrote, "it looks, sounds and feels awesome. Quite simply, there are times in it where I have never seen anything so impressive in a game. As you'd expect, things like texture detail and animation are superb, but it's not these aspects that steal the show. Rather it's the combination of breathtaking lighting and wonderful art that do the trick. We've known for a long time that perfect lighting is the key to realism, but so far much of its use has been in contrasting brightness and darkness, rather than enhancing color. In "Ghosthunter", there are certain scenes that made me stop playing and mutter "my god" to myself." He concluded that ""Ghosthunter" once again raises the 'aesthetics versus gameplay' debate. It sports a stunning-looking world that's comfortable and satisfying to explore but for some reason the developer has tarnished this with a god-awful set of enemies and infuriating level design."
Game Revolution's Brian Gee awarded the game a C. He also praised the graphics, but found the overall experience lacking; "While "Ghosthunter" sets up a freaky scene, it never does much to distinguish itself from your average action game. There are no big scares and only mildly interesting action. Ghostbusting wannabes might feel compelled to investigate this activity, but everyone else should let it float on by."
GameSpy's Justin Leeper was also disappointed, scoring the game 2.5 out of 5. He was critical of the combat mode and the puzzles, and although he praised the graphics he concluded that "good graphics do not a good game make, and I don't consider "Ghosthunter" a particularly good game. It's passable at best, and surpassed by "The Suffering" in nearly every aspect. Sadly, Sony had the right idea in not bringing this title to the U.S., as it simply brings nothing new to the table.
GameSpot's Alex Navarro was more impressed, scoring the game 8 out of 10. He felt it struck a good balance between survival horror and action game; "The primary reason "Ghosthunter" works is that it seems to have a very firm grip on what it wants to be. It knows it isn't scary enough to really fit into the survival horror genre, but it's too creepy to be considered just a standard action game. "Ghosthunter" falls squarely in between the two, and it manages to keep an almost uncanny balance all throughout the game." He was impressed by the graphics but was critical of the game's length; ""Ghosthunter" is a very easy game that shouldn't take more than eight or nine hours to complete, and there isn't really anything to bring you back to the game once you're done with it. However, "Ghosthunter" is still a very enjoyable experience for as long as it lasts. Most players should be able to forgive its relative simplicity thanks to its excellent ambiance and entertaining characters and storyline."
IGN's Ivan Sulic was also impressed, scoring the game 8.4 out of 10. He was extremely impressed with the graphics, arguing the game features "a level of environmental diversity and intrigue that most titles never come close to approaching [...] this plush design is only strengthened by one of the most impressive engines found on PlayStation 2. What "Ghosthunter" does for the eyes and ears, we simply do not see that often. Rare is the PS2 game that is this crisp, this well-defined, this polished, this flicker free, and this extravagantly detailed." However, he was less impressed with the gameplay; "The combat here simply does not match the applied presentation value. What we have in terms of action is an affable, but repetitive affair with marginal challenge attached." Overall, however, he felt the positives of the game outweighed the problems, referring to the "game's incredible presentation with slick support for progressive scan, widescreen display, and a penchant for utterly astonishing graphics and superlative audio effects." In 2010, IGN placed the game in their list of "The Top 10 Best Looking PS2 Games of All Time".

Jim Peck

James Edward "Jim" Peck (born on June 5, 1943 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is an American television and radio personality based in Milwaukee and is perhaps best known for his time as a game show host.
Early career.
He got his start in the form of a contract with ABC to host three game shows (he also occasionally substituted for David Hartman on "Good Morning America"). His first hosting job came on the Ron Greenberg-produced hard quiz "The Big Showdown", which ran on ABC from December 23, 1974 until July 4, 1975. Peck then hosted the unusual "Hot Seat", a Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley production which featured an oversized lie detector that was used to measure a spouse's responses to personal questions. "Hot Seat" began airing on July 12, 1976, but was gone after fifteen weeks and aired its final episode on October 22 of that year. In March 1977 Peck began to helm the Bill Carruthers-produced "Second Chance", a precursor to Carruthers' "Press Your Luck" which premiered in 1983 and ran for three seasons. Peck's series wasn't as popular as its follow-up and after nineteen weeks of episodes, "Second Chance" left the air on July 15, 1977. Peck has not hosted a network game show since.
Later career.
In the fall of 1978, Peck was called on to host a second revival of the 1960s classic word game "You Don't Say!" that Tom Kennedy had hosted. Suffering from low ratings and a lack of major market clearances, "You Don't Say!" did not last a full season and aired its final episode in March 1979.
Afterward, Peck became host of the controversial Chuck Barris game show "Three's a Crowd", which asked the question, "Who knows a man better, his wife or his secretary?" "Three's a Crowd" only lasted for 4 1/2 months (September 17, 1979 to February 1, 1980) due in part to both the low ratings the show pulled in and the backlash caused by the show's content.
Since then, Peck hasn't emceed game shows on a full-time basis. Beginning in 1981, however, he returned as a frequent substitute for Jack Barry on the syndicated quiz "The Joker's Wild". Over the next three years, Peck began appearing more often as Barry, who was in his mid-sixties at the time, was beginning to ease himself into retirement. Although Peck was not the popular choice among staffers at Barry & Enright Productions, Barry and producer Ron Greenberg continued to groom the frequent sub for the position. The plans were to have Peck take over the hosting position permanently at the beginning of the 1984-85 season, with Barry announcing his retirement on-air and handing the show over to his successor.
However, on May 2, 1984, Barry suddenly died of cardiac arrest in New York City shortly after filming for the seventh season of "The Joker's Wild" had concluded. Upon Barry's death, his partner Dan Enright took control of the production company and over Peck, hired Bill Cullen, who was finishing up his run as the host of another Barry & Enright-produced program, NBC's "Hot Potato".
Except for several weeks of subbing for Cullen on "The Joker's Wild" during its final season (1985–86), Peck moved away from game shows altogether; he went on to serve as the court reporter and announcer for a revival of "Divorce Court" during its run from 1985-92.
Other work.
From 1985–1992, he played the courtroom reporter and announcer on the William B. Keene version of "Divorce Court", often whispering through the proceedings of the case.
One of Peck's last jobs before leaving national television was as host of the annual Drum Corps International (DCI) competitions, seen on PBS.
Current.
He is now working in Public Relations for his alma mater, Marquette University, as a fund-raiser; hosts "I Remember" (formerly called "I Remember Milwaukee"), a series revolving around the history of Wisconsin's largest city on PBS station WMVS (Channel 10); and hosts the Saturday edition of "Wisconsin's Morning News" on WTMJ-AM (620) [http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=475807].
Jim recently resurfaced on national television doing commercials for the AARP/Walgreens discount card.

<doc id="2892491" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892491" title="Visual language">
Visual language

A visual language is a system of communication using visual elements. Speech as a means of communication cannot strictly be separated from the whole of human communicative activity that includes the visual and the term 'language' in relation to vision is an extension of its use to describe the perception, comprehension and production of visible signs.
Overview.
An image that dramatizes and communicates an idea presupposes the use of a visual language. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. A diagram, a map, and a painting are all examples of uses of visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, color, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion. 
The elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and often interdependent means by which humans exchange information.
Visual Language.
Visual units in the form of lines and marks are constructed into meaningful shapes and structures or signs. Different areas of the cortex respond to different elements such as colour and form. Semir Zeki had shown the responses in the brain to the paintings of Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Magritte, Malevich and Picasso.
Imaging in the mind.
What we have in our minds in a waking state and what we imagine in dreams is very much of the same nature. Dream images might be with or without spoken words, other sounds or colours. In the waking state there is usually, in the foreground, the buzz of immediate perception, feeling, mood and as well as fleeting memory images. In a mental state between dreaming and being fully awake is a state known as 'day dreaming' or a meditative state, during which "the things we see in the sky when the clouds are drifting, the centaurs and stags, antelopes and wolves" are projected from the imagination. Rudolf Arnheim has attempted to answer the question: what does a mental image look like? In Greek philosophy, the School of Leucippus and Democritus believed that a replica of an object enters the eye and remains in the soul as a memory as a complete image. Berkeley explained that parts, for example a leg rather than the complete body, appear in the mind. Arnheim considers the psychologist, Edward B. Titchener's account to be the breakthrough in understanding something of how the vague incomplete quality of the image is 'impressionistic' and carries meaning as well as form.
Meaning and expression.
Abstract art has shown that the qualities of line and shape, proportion and colour convey meaning directly without the use of words or pictorial representation. Wassily Kandinsky in "Point and Line to Plane" showed how drawn lines and marks can be expressive without any association with a representational image. Throughout history and especially in ancient cultures visual language has been used to encode meaning " The Bronze Age Badger Stone on Ilkly Moor is covered in circles, lines, hollow cups, winged figures, a spread hand, an ancient swastika, an embryo, a shooting star? … It's a story-telling rock, a message from a world before (written) words."
Richard Gregory suggests that, "Perhaps the ability to respond to absent imaginary situations," as our early ancestors did with paintings on rock, "represents an essential step towards the development of abstract thought."
Perception.
The sense of sight operates selectively. Perception is not a passive recording of all that is in front of the eyes, but is a continuous judgement of scale and colour relationships, and includes making categories of forms to classify images and shapes in the world.
Children of six to twelve months are to be able through experience and learning to discriminate between circles, squares and triangles.The child from this age onwards learns to classify objects, abstracting essential qualities and comparing them to other similar objects. Before objects can be perceived and identified the child must be able to classify the different shapes and sizes that a single object may appear to have when it is seen in varying surroundings and from different aspects.
Innate structures in the brain.
The perception of a shape requires the grasping of the essential structural features, to produce a "whole" or "gestalt". The theory of the "gestalt" was proposed by Christian von Ehrenfels in 1890. He pointed out that a melody is still recognisable when played in different keys and argued that the whole is not simply the sum of its parts but a total structure.
Max Wertheimer researched von Ehrenfels' idea, and in his "Theory of Form" (1923) – nicknamed "the dot essay" because it was illustrated with abstract patterns of dots and lines – he concluded that the perceiving eye tends to bring together elements that look alike (similarity groupings) and will complete an incomplete form (object hypothesis). An array of random dots tends to form configurations (constellations). All these innate abilities demonstrate how the eye and the mind are seeking pattern and simple whole shapes. When we look at more complex visual images such as paintings we can see that art has been a continuous attempt to "notate" visual information.
Visual thinking.
Thought processes are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, and the two hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought.
The brain is divided into two hemispheres and a thick bundle of nerve fibres enable these two halves to communicate with each other. In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution. 
In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, L. Bruce Archer proposed "that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their mind's eye, manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system. Indeed we believe that human beings have an innate capacity for cognitive modelling, and its expression through sketching, drawing, construction, acting out and so on, that is fundamental to human thought."
Graphicacy.
The development of the visual aspect of language communication has been referred to as graphicacy, as a parallel discipline to literacy and numeracy. Michael Twyman has pointed out that the ability to handle ideas visually, which includes both the understanding and conception of them, should not be confused with the specific talents of an artist. The artist is one very special kind of visual manipulator whose motives are varied and often complex. The ability to think and communicate in visual terms is part of, and of equal importance in the learning process, with that of literacy and numeracy.

<doc id="2892496" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892496" title="Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig">
Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig

Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig (6 December 1835 – 19 November 1910) was a German chemist. Fittig discovered the pinacol coupling reaction, mesitylene, diacetyl and biphenyl. He studied the action of sodium on ketones and hydrocarbons. He discovered the Fittig reaction or Wurtz-Fittig reaction for the synthesis of alkylbenzenes, he proposed a diketone structure for benzoquinone and isolated phenanthrene from coal tar. He discovered and synthesized the first lactones and investigated structures of piperine naphthalene and fluorene.
Career.
Fittig studied chemistry at the University of Göttingen, graduating as Ph.D. with a dissertation on acetone in 1858, under the supervision of Heinrich Limpricht and Friedrich Wöhler. He subsequently held several appointments at Göttingen, becoming Wöhler's assistant in 1858, privatdozent in 1860 and extraordinary professor in 1870. In 1870 he was appointed full professor at University of Tübingen and in 1876 at Strassburg, where the laboratories were erected from his designs.
Fittig's research covered wide areas of organic chemistry. The aldehydes and ketones provided material for his earlier work. He observed that aldehydes and ketones may suffer reduction in neutral, alkaline, and sometimes acid solution to secondary and tertiary glycols, substances which he named pinacones; and also that certain pinacones when distilled with dilute sulfuric acid gave compounds, which he named pinacolines. The unsaturated acids also received much attention, and he discovered the internal anhydrides of oxyacids, termed lactones. In 1863 he introduced the reaction known by his name. In 1855 Charles-Adolphe Wurtz had shown that when sodium acted upon alkyl iodides, the alkyl residues combined to form more complex hydrocarbons; Fittig developed this method by showing that a mixture of an aromatic and alkyl haloid, under similar treatment, yielded homologues of benzene. His investigations on Perkins reaction led him to an explanation of its mechanism which appeared to be more in accordance with the facts. The question, however, is one of much difficulty, and the exact course of the reaction appears to await solution. These researches incidentally solved the constitution of coumarin, the odoriferous principle of woodruff. Fittig and Erdmann's observation that phenyl isocrotonic acid readily yielded α-naphthol by loss of water was of much importance, since it afforded valuable evidence as to the constitution of naphthalene. They also investigated certain hydrocarbons occurring in the high boiling point fraction of the coal tar distillate and solved the constitution of phenanthrene. We also owe much of our knowledge of the alkaloid piperine to Fittig, who in collaboration with Ira Remsen established its constitution in 1871.
Fittig has published two widely used textbooks; be edited several editions of Wohler's "Grundriss der organischen Chemie" (11th ed., 1887) and wrote an "Unorganische Chemie" (1st ed., 1872; 3rd, 1882). His researches have been recognized by many scientific societies and institutions, the Royal Society awarding him the Davy medal in 1906.

Shields sailboat

In 1963 Cornelius Shields, one of the foremost proponents of one-design sailing in the U.S. conceived of a modern followup to the International One Design (IOD). The new boat would have the balance and beauty of the IOD while incorporating modern trends such as fiberglass construction. Shields commissioned Olin Stephens for the design. Over 250 have been built and many are actively raced in fleets around the U.S. Shields are sloop-rigged and usually sailed by a crew of three to five. No hiking straps are allowed, keeping athletic demands on the crew to a minimum. (Shields class web site.)
Principal dimensions: LOA 30'2" (9.19 m), DWL 20' (6.1 m), beam 6'5" (1.96 m), draft 4'9" (1.45 m), displacement 4,600 lb (2.1 t), ballast 3,080 lb (1.4 t), sail area (Main, Jib) 360 ft² (33 m²), (Spinnaker) 520 ft² (48 m²)
The Shields enjoys a strong National Association that organizes annual championship regattas. There are active fleets welcoming sailors across the country, including; Larchmont NY, Newport, RI, Chicago, IL and Monterey, CA.
In September 2012, Tim Dawson's Aeolus won the 2012 Shields National Championship at Beverly Yacht Club in Marion, Mass. Bill Berry's Syrinx and John Burnham's Grace finished second and third, respectively.

<doc id="2892508" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892508" title="Golden mean (philosophy)">
Golden mean (philosophy)

In philosophy, especially that of Aristotle, the 'golden mean' is the desirable middle between two extremes, one of excess and the other of deficiency. For example, in the Aristotelian view, courage is a virtue, but if taken to excess would manifest as recklessness, and if deficient as cowardice. 
To the Greek mentality, it was an attribute of beauty. Both ancients and moderns believed that there is a close association in mathematics between beauty and truth. The poet John Keats, in his "Ode on a Grecian Urn", put it this way:
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty," — that is all<br>
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
The Greeks believed there to be three "ingredients" to beauty: symmetry, proportion, and harmony. This triad of principles infused their life. They were very much attuned to beauty as an object of love and as something that was to be imitated and reproduced in their lives, architecture, education ("paideia"), and politics. They judged life by this mentality.
In Chinese philosophy, a similar concept, Doctrine of the Mean, was propounded by Confucius. Buddhist philosophy likewise includes the concept of the middle way.
History.
Western philosophy.
Crete.
The earliest representation of this idea in culture is probably in the mythological Cretan tale of Daedalus and Icarus. Daedalus, a famous artist of his time, built feathered wings for himself and his son so that they might escape the clutches of King Minos. Daedalus warns his beloved son who he loved so much to ""fly the middle course"", between the sea spray and the sun's heat. Icarus did not heed his father; he flew up and up until the sun melted the wax off his wings. For not heeding the middle course, he fell into the sea and drowned.
Delphi.
Another early elaboration is the Doric saying carved on the front of the temple at Delphi: "Nothing in Excess" ("Meden Agan").
Pythagoreans.
The first work on the golden mean is sometimes attributed to Theano, wife of Pythagoras.
Socrates.
Socrates teaches that a man "must know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible."
In education, Socrates asks us to consider the effect of either an exclusive devotion to gymnastics or an exclusive devotion to music. It either "produced a temper of hardness and ferocity, (or) the other of softness and effeminacy." Having both qualities, he believed, produces harmony; i.e., beauty and goodness. He additionally stresses the importance of mathematics in education for the understanding of beauty and truth.
Plato.
Proportion's relation to beauty and goodness is stressed throughout Plato's dialogues, particularly in the "Republic" and "Philebus". He writes:
SOCRATES: That any kind of mixture that does not in some way or other possess measure of the nature of proportion will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and most of all itself. For there would be no blending in such a case at all but really an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be contained in it.
PROTARCHUS: Very true.
SOCRATES: But now we notice that the force of the good has taken up refuge in an alliance with the nature of the beautiful. For measure and proportion manifest themselves in all areas of beauty and virtue.
PROTARCHUS: Undeniably.
SOCRATES: But we said that truth is also inclined along with them in our mixture?
PROTARCHUS: Indeed.
SOCRATES: Well, then, if we cannot capture the good in "one" form, we will have to take hold of it in a conjunction of three: beauty, proportion and truth. Let us affirm that these should by right be treated as a unity and be held responsible for what is in the mixture, for goodness is what makes the mixture good in itself.
("Phlb." 64d–65a) 
In the "Laws", Plato applies this principle to electing a government in the ideal state: "Conducted in this way, the election will strike a mean between monarchy and democracy …"
Aristotle.
In the "Eudemian Ethics", Aristotle writes on the virtues. Aristotle’s theory on virtue ethics is one that does not see a person’s actions as a reflection of their ethics but rather looks into the character of a person as the reason behind their ethics. His constant phrase is, "… is the Middle state between …". His psychology of the soul and its virtues is based on the golden mean between the extremes. In the "Politics", Aristotle criticizes the Spartan Polity by critiquing the disproportionate elements of the constitution; e.g., they trained the men and not the women, and they trained for war but not peace. This disharmony produced difficulties which he elaborates on in his work. See also the of the golden mean, and Aristotelian ethics in general.
Eastern philsophy.
Gautama Buddha (fl. 6th century BC) taught of the Middle Way, a path between the extremes of religious asceticism and worldly self-indulgence.
Confucius in "The Analects", written through the Warring States period of Ancient China (c. 479 BCE – 221 BCE), taught excess is similar to deficiency. A way of living in the mean is the way of Zhongyong.
Zhuangzi was the Tao's most famous commentator (369–286 BC).
Tiruvalluvar (2nd century BC and the 8th century AD; date disputed) in his Tirukkural of the Sangam period of Tamizhagam writes of the middle state which is to preserve equity. He emphasises this principle and suggests that the two ways of preserving equity is to be impartial and avoid excess. Parimelazhagar was the historical commentator of the Tirukkural.
Christianity.
Thomas Aquinas, the Catholic philosopher, in his Summa Theologica, Question 64 of the Prima Secundæ Partis, argues that Christian morality is consistent with the mean. He observes: "evil consists in discordance from their rule or measure. Now this may happen either by their exceeding the measure or by their falling short of it;...Therefore it is evident that moral virtue observes the mean."
Modernity.
Jacques Maritain, throughout his "Introduction to Philosophy" (1930), uses the idea of the golden mean to place Aristotelian-Thomist philosophy between the deficiencies and extremes of other philosophers and systems.

<doc id="2892513" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892513" title="Nonimaging optics">
Nonimaging optics

Nonimaging optics (also called anidolic optics) is the branch of optics concerned with the optimal transfer of light radiation between a source and a target. Unlike traditional imaging optics, the techniques involved do not attempt to form an image of the source; instead an optimized optical system for optical radiative transfer from a source to a target is desired.
Applications.
The two design problems that nonimaging optics solves better than imaging optics are:
Typical variables to be optimized at the target include the total radiant flux, the angular distribution of optical radiation, and the spatial distribution of optical radiation. These variables on the target side of the optical system often must be optimized while simultaneously considering the collection efficiency of the optical system at the source.
Solar energy concentration.
For a given concentration, nonimaging optics provide the widest possible acceptance angles and, therefore, are the most appropriate for use in solar concentration as, for example, in concentrated photovoltaics. When compared to “traditional” imaging optics (such as parabolic reflectors or fresnel lenses), the main advantages of nonimaging optics for concentrating solar energy are:
Also, for low concentrations, the very wide acceptance angles of nonimaging optics can avoid solar tracking altogether or limit it to a few positions a year.
The main disadvantage of nonimaging optics when compared to parabolic reflectors or fresnel lenses is that, for high concentrations, they typically have one more optical surface, slightly decreasing efficiency. That, however, is only noticeable when the optics are aiming perfectly towards the sun, which is typically not the case because of imperfections in practical systems.
Illumination optics.
Examples of nonimaging optical devices include optical light guides, nonimaging reflectors, nonimaging lenses or a combination of these devices. Common applications of nonimaging optics include many areas of illumination engineering (lighting). Examples of modern implementations of nonimaging optical designs include automotive headlamps, LCD backlights, illuminated instrument panel displays, fiber optic illumination devices, LED lights, projection display systems and luminaires.
When compared to “traditional” design techniques, nonimaging optics has the following advantages for illumination:
Examples of nonimaging illumination optics using solar energy are anidolic lighting or solar pipes.
Other applications.
Collecting radiation emitted by high-energy particle collisions using the fewest number of photomultiplier tubes.
Some of the design methods for nonimaging optics are also finding application in imaging devices, for example some with ultra-high numerical aperture.
Theory.
Early academic research in nonimaging optical mathematics seeking closed form solutions was first published in textbook form in a 1978 book. A modern textbook illustrating the depth and breadth of research and engineering in this area was published in 2004. A thorough introduction to this field was published in 2008.
Special applications of nonimaging optics such as Fresnel lenses for solar concentration or solar concentration in general have also been published, although this last reference by O'Gallagher describes mostly the work developed some decades ago. Other publications include book chapters.
Imaging optics can concentrate sunlight to, at most, the same flux found at the surface of the sun.
Nonimaging optics have been demonstrated to concentrate sunlight to 84,000 times the ambient intensity of sunlight, exceeding the flux found at the surface of the sun, and approaching the theoretical (2nd law of thermodynamics) limit of heating objects up to the temperature of the sun's surface.
The simplest way to design nonimaging optics is called "the method of strings", based on the edge ray principle. Other more advanced methods were developed starting in the early 1990s that can better handle extended light sources than the edge-ray method. These were developed primarily to solve the design problems related to solid state automobile headlamps and complex illumination systems. One of these advanced design methods is the Simultaneous Multiple Surface design method (SMS). The 2D SMS design method () is described in detail in the aforementioned textbooks. The 3D SMS design method () was developed in 2003 by a team of optical scientists at Light Prescriptions Innovators.
Edge ray principle.
In simple terms, the edge ray principle states that if the light rays coming from the edges of the source are redirected towards the edges of the receiver, this will ensure that all light rays coming from the inner points in the source will end up on the receiver. There is no condition on image formation, the only goal is to transfer the light from the source to the target.
Figure "edge ray principle" on the right illustrates this principle. A lens collects light from a source S1S2 and redirects it towards a receiver R1R2.
The lens has two optical surfaces and, therefore, it is possible to design it (using the SMS design method) so that the light rays coming from the edge S1 of the source are redirected towards edge R1 of the receiver, as indicated by the blue rays. By symmetry, the rays coming from edge S2 of the source are redirected towards edge R2 of the receiver, as indicated by the red rays. The rays coming from an inner point S in the source are redirected towards the target, but they are not concentrated onto a point and, therefore, no image is formed.
Actually, if we consider a point P on the top surface of the lens, a ray coming from S1 through P will be redirected towards R1. Also a ray coming from S2 through P will be redirected towards R2. A ray coming through P from an inner point S in the source will be redirected towards an inner point of the receiver. This lens then guarantees that all light from the source crossing it will be redirected towards the receiver. However, no image of the source is formed on the target. Imposing the condition of image formation on the receiver would imply using more optical surfaces, making the optic more complicated, but would not improve light transfer between source and target (since all light is already transferred). For that reason nonimaging optics are simpler and more efficient than imaging optics in transferring radiation from a source to a target.
Design Methods.
Nonimaging optics devices are obtained using different methods. The most important are: the flow-line or Winston-Welford design method, the SMS or Miñano-Benitez design method and the Miñano design method using Poisson brackets. The first (flow-line) is probably the most used, although the second (SMS) has proven very versatile, resulting in a wide variety of optics. The third has remained in the realm of theoretical optics and has not found real world application to date. Often optimization is also used.
Typically optics have refractive and reflective surfaces and light travels though media of different refractive indices as it crosses the optic. In those cases a quantity called optical path length (OPL) may be defined as formula_1 where index "i" indicates different ray sections between successive deflections (refractions or reflections), "n"i is the refractive index and "d"i the distance in each section "i" of the ray path.
The optical path length (OPL) is constant between wavefronts. This can be seen for refraction in the figure "constant OPL" to the right. It shows a separation "c"("τ") between two media of refractive indices "n"1 and "n"2, where "c"("τ") is described by a parametric equation with parameter "τ". Also shown are a set of rays perpendicular to wavefront "w"1 and traveling in the medium of refractive index "n"1. These rays refract at "c"("τ") into the medium of refractive index "n"2 in directions perpendicular to wavefront "w"2. Ray "r""A" crosses "c" at point "c"("τA") and, therefore, ray "r""A" is identified by parameter "τA" on "c". Likewise, ray "r""B" is identified by parameter "τB" on "c". Ray "r""A" has optical path length "S"("τA") = "n"1"d"5 + "n"2"d"6. Also, ray "r""B" has optical path length "S"("τB") ="n"1"d"7 + "n"2"d"8. The difference in optical path length for rays "r""A" and "r""B" is given by:
In order to calculate the value of this integral, we evaluate "S"("τ"+"dτ")-"S"("τ"), again with the help of the same figure. We have "S"("τ") = "n"1"d"1+"n"2("d"3+"d"4) and "S"("τ"+"dτ") = "n"1("d"1+"d"2)+"n"2"d"4. These expressions can be rewritten as "S"("τ") = "n"1"d"1+"n"2"dc" sin"θ"2+"n"2"d"4 and "S"("τ"+"dτ") = "n"1"d"1+"n"1"dc" sin"θ"1+"n"2"d"4. From the law of refraction "n"1sin"θ"1="n"2sin"θ"2 and therefore "S"("τ"+"dτ") = "S"("τ"), leading to "S"("τA")="S"("τB"). Since these may be arbitrary rays crossing "c", it may be concluded that the optical path length between "w"1 and "w"2 is the same for all rays perpendicular to incoming wavefront "w"1 and outgoing wavefront "w"2.
Similar conclusions may be drawn for the case of reflection, only in this case "n"1="n"2. This relationship between rays and wavefronts is valid in general.
Flow-line design method.
The flow-line (or Winston-Welford) design method typically leads to optics which guide the light confining it between two reflective surfaces. The best known of these devices is the CPC (Compound Parabolic Concentrator).
These types of optics may be obtained, for example, by applying the edge ray of nonimaging optics to the design of mirrored optics, as show in figure "CEC" on the right. It is composed of two elliptical mirrors "e"1 with foci S1 and R1 and its symmetrical "e"2 with foci S2 and R2.
Mirror "e"1 redirects the rays coming from the edge S1 of the source towards the edge R1 of the receiver and, by symmetry, mirror "e"2 redirects the rays coming from the edge S2 of the source towards the edge R2 of the receiver. This device does not form an image of the source S1S2 on the receiver R1R2 as indicated by the green rays coming from a point S in the source that end up on the receiver but are not focused onto an image point. Mirror "e"2 starts at the edge R1 of the receiver since leaving a gap between mirror and receiver would allow light to escape between the two. Also, mirror "e"2 ends at ray r connecting S1 and R2 since cutting it short would prevent it from capturing as much light as possible, but extending it above r would shade light coming from S1 and its neighboring points of the source. The resulting device is called a CEC (Compound Elliptical Concentrator).
A particular case of this design happens when the source S1S2 becomes infinitely large and moves to an infinite distance. Then the rays coming from S1 become parallel rays and the same for those coming from S2 and the elliptical mirrors "e"1 and "e"2 converge to parabolic mirrors "p"1 and "p"2. The resulting device is called a CPC (Compound Parabolic Concentrator), and shown in the "CPC" figure on the left. CPCs are the most common seen nonimaging optics. They are often used to demonstrate the difference between Imaging optics and nonimaging optics.
When seen from the CPC, the incoming radiation (emitted from the infinite source at an infinite distance) subtends an angle ±"θ" (total angle 2"θ"). This is called the acceptance angle of the CPC. The reason for this name can be appreciated in the figure "rays showing the acceptance angle" on the right. An incoming ray "r"1 at an angle "θ" to the vertical (coming from the edge of the infinite source) is redirected by the CPC towards the edge R1 of the receiver.
Another ray "r"2 at an angle "α"<"θ" to the vertical (coming from an inner point of the infinite source) is redirected towards an inner point of the receiver. However, a ray "r"3 at an angle "β">"θ" to the vertical (coming from a point outside the infinite source) bounces around inside the CPC until it is rejected by it. Therefore, only the light inside the acceptance angle ±"θ" is captured by the optic; light outside it is rejected.
The ellipses of a CEC can be obtained by the (pins and) string method, as shown in the figure "string method" on the left. A string of constant length is attached to edge point S1 of the source and edge point R1 of the receiver.
The string is kept stretched while moving a pencil up and down, drawing the elliptical mirror "e"1. We can now consider a wavefront "w"1 as a circle centered at S1. This wavefront is perpendicular to all rays coming out of S1 and the distance from S1 to "w"1 is constant for all its points. The same is valid for wavefront "w"2 centered at R1. The distance from "w"1 to "w"2 is then constant for all light rays reflected at "e"1 and these light rays are perpendicular to both, incoming wavefront "w"1 and outgoing wavefront "w"2.
Optical path length (OPL) is constant between wavefronts. When applied to nonimaging optics, this result extends the string method to optics with both refractive and reflective surfaces. Figure "DTIRC" (Dielectric Total Internal Reflection Concentrator) on the left shows one such example.
The shape of the top surface "s" is prescribed, for example, as a circle. Then the lateral wall "m"1 is calculated by the condition of constant optical path length "S"="d"1+"n d"2+"n d"3 where "d"1 is the distance between incoming wavefront "w"1 and point P on the top surface "s", "d"2 is the distance between P and Q and "d"3 the distance between Q and outgoing wavefront "w"2, which is circular and centered at R1. Lateral wall "m"2 is symmetrical to "m"1. The acceptance angle of the device is 2"θ".
These optics are called flow-line optics and the reason for that is illustrated in figure "CPC flow-lines" on the right. It shows a CPC with an acceptance angle 2"θ", highlighting one of its inner points P.
The light crossing this point is confined to a cone of angular aperture 2"α". A line "f" is also shown whose tangent at point P bisects this cone of light and, therefore, points in the direction of the "light flow" at P. Several other such lines are also shown in the figure. They all bisect the edge rays at each point inside the CPC and, for that reason, their tangent at each point points in the direction of the flow of light. These are called flow-lines and the CPC itself is just a combination of flow line "p"1 starting at R2 and "p"2 starting at R1.
Variations to the flow-line design method.
There are some variations to the flow-line design method.
A variation are the multichannel or stepped flow-line optics in which light is split into several "channels" and then recombined again into a single output. Aplanatic (a particular case of SMS) versions of these designs have also been developed. The main application of this method is in the design of ultra-compact optics.
Another variation is the confinement of light by caustics. Instead of light being confined by two reflective surfaces, it is confined by a reflective surface and a caustic of the edge rays. This provides the possibility to add lossless non-optical surfaces to the optics.
Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) design method.
This section describes
The design procedure
The SMS (or Miñano-Benitez) design method is very versatile and many different types of optics have been designed using it. The 2D version allows the design of two (although more are also possible) aspheric surfaces simultaneously. The 3D version allows the design of optics with freeform surfaces (also called anamorphic) surfaces which may not have any kind of symmetry.
SMS optics are also calculated by applying a constant optical path length between wavefronts. Figure "SMS chain" on the right illustrates how these optics are calculated. In general, the rays perpendicular to incoming wavefront "w"1 will be coupled to outgoing wavefront "w"4 and the rays perpendicular to incoming wavefront "w"2 will be coupled to outgoing wavefront "w"3 and these wavefronts may be any shape. However, for the sake of simplicity, this figure shows a particular case or circular wavefronts. This example shows a lens of a given refractive index "n" designed for a source S1S2 and a receiver R1R2.
The rays emitted from edge S1 of the source are focused onto edge R1 of the receiver and those emitted from edge S2 of the source are focused onto edge R2 of the receiver. We first choose a point T0 and its normal on the top surface of the lens. We can now take a ray "r"1 coming from S2 and refract it at T0. Choosing now the optical path length "S"22 between S2 and R2 we have one condition that allows us to calculate point B1 on the bottom surface of the lens. The normal at B1 can also be calculated from the directions of the incoming and outgoing rays at this point and the refractive index of the lens. Now we can repeat the process taking a ray "r"2 coming from R1 and refracting it at B1. Choosing now the optical path length "S"11 between R1 and S1 we have one condition that allows us to calculate point T1 on the top surface of the lens. The normal at T1 can also be calculated from the directions of the incoming and outgoing rays at this point and the refractive index of the lens. Now, refracting at T1 a ray "r"3 coming from S2 we can calculate a new point B3 and corresponding normal on the bottom surface using the same optical path length "S"22 between S2 and R2. Refracting at B3 a ray "r"4 coming from R1 we can calculate a new point T3 and corresponding normal on the top surface using the same optical path length "S"11 between R1 and S1. The process continues by calculating another point B5 on the bottom surface using another edge ray "r"5, and so on. The sequence of points T0 B1 T1 B3 T3 B5 is called an SMS chain.
Another SMS chain can be constructed towards the right starting at point T0. A ray from S1 refracted at T0 defines a point and normal B2 on the bottom surface, by using constant optical path length "S"11 between S1 and R1. Now a ray from R2 refracted at B2 defines a new point and normal T2 on the top surface, by using constant optical path length "S"22 between S2 and R2. The process continues as more points are added to the SMS chain.
In this example shown in the figure, the optic has a left-right symmetry and, therefore, points B2 T2 B4 T4 B6 can also be obtained by symmetry about the vertical axis of the lens.
Now we have a sequence of spaced points on the plane. Figure "SMS skinning" on the left illustrates the process used to fill the gaps between points, completely defining both optical surfaces.
We pick two points, say B1 and B2, with their corresponding normals and interpolate a curve "c" between them. Now we pick a point B12 and its normal on "c". A ray "r"1 coming from R1 and refracted at B12 defines a new point T01 and its normal between T0 and T1 on the top surface, by applying the same constant optical path length "S"11 between S1 and R1. Now a ray "r"2 coming from S2 and refracted at T01 defines a new point and normal on the bottom surface, by applying the same constant optical path length "S"22 between S2 and R2. The process continues with rays "r"3 and "r"4 building a new SMS chain filling the gaps between points. Picking other points and corresponding normals on curve "c" gives us more points in between the other SMS points calculated originally.
In general, the two SMS optical surfaces do not need to be refractive. Refractive surfaces are noted R (from Refraction) while reflective surfaces are noted X (from the Spanish word refleXión). Total Internal Reflection (TIR) is noted I. Therefore, a lens with two refractive surfaces is an RR optic, while another configuration with a reflective and a refractive surface is an XR optic. Configurations with more optical surfaces are also possible and, for example, if light is first refracted (R), then reflected (X) then reflected again by TIR (I), the optic is called an RXI.
The SMS 3D is similar to the SMS 2D, only now all calculations are done in 3D space. Figure "SMS 3D chain" on the right illustrates the algorithm of an SMS 3D calculation.
The first step is to choose the incoming wavefronts "w"1 and "w"2 and outgoing wavefronts "w"3 and "w"4 and the optical path length "S"14 between "w"1 and "w"4 and the optical path length "S"23 between "w"2 and "w"3. In this example the optic is a lens (an RR optic) with two refractive surfaces, so its refractive index must also be specified. One difference between the SMS 2D and the SMS 3D is on how to choose initial point T0, which is now on a chosen 3D curve "a". The normal chosen for point T0 must be perpendicular to curve "a". The process now evolves similarly to the SMS 2D. A ray "r"1 coming from "w"1 is refracted at T0 and, with the optical path length "S"14, a new point B2 and its normal is obtained on the bottom surface. Now ray "r"2 coming from "w"3 is refracted at B2 and, with the optical path length "S "23, a new point T2 and its normal is obtained on the top surface. With ray "r"3 a new point B2 and its normal are obtained, with ray "r"4 a new point T4 and its normal are obtained, and so on. This process is performed in 3D space and the result is a 3D SMS chain. As with the SMS 2D, a set of points and normals to the left of T0 can also be obtained using the same method. Now, choosing another point T0 on curve "a" the process can be repeated and more points obtained on the top and bottom surfaces of the lens.
The power of the SMS method lies in the fact that the incoming and outgoing wavefronts can themselves be free-form, giving the method great flexibility. Also, by designing optics with reflective surfaces or combinations of reflective and refractive surfaces, different configurations are possible.
Miñano design method using Poisson brackets.
This design method was developed by Miñano and is based on Hamiltonian optics, the Hamiltonean formulation of geometrical optics which shares much of the mathematical formulation with Hamiltonian mechanics. It allows the design of optics with variable refractive index, and therefore solves some nonimaging problems that are not solvable using other methods. However, manufacturing of variable refractive index optics is still not possible and this method, although potentially powerful, did not yet find a practical application.
Conservation of etendue.
Conservation of etendue is a central concept in nonimaging optics. In concentration optics, it relates the acceptance angle with the maximum concentration possible. Conservation of etendue may be seen as constant a volume moving in phase space.
Kohler integration.
In some applications it is important to achieve a given irradiance (or illuminance) pattern on a target, while allowing for movements or inhomogeneities of the source. Figure "Kohler integrator" on the right illustrates this for the particular case of solar concentration. Here the light source is the sun moving in the sky. On the left this figure shows a lens L1 L2 capturing sunlight incident at an angle "α" to the optical axis and concentrating it onto a receiver L3 L4. As seen, this light is concentrated onto a hotspot on the receiver. This may be a problem in some applications. One way around this is to add a new lens extending from L3 to L4 that captures the light from L1 L2 and redirects it onto a receiver R1 R2, as shown in the middle of the figure.
The situation in the middle of the figure shows a nonimaging lens L1 L2 is designed in such a way that sunlight (here considered as a set of parallel rays) incident at an angle "θ" to the optical axis will be concentrated to point L3. On the other hand, nonimaging lens L3 L4 is designed in such a way that light rays coming from L1 are focused on R2 and light rays coming from L2 are focused on R1. Therefore, ray "r"1 incident on the first lens at an angle "θ" will be redirected towards L3. When it hits the second lens, it is coming from point L1 and it is redirected by the second lens to R2. On the other hand, ray "r"2 also incident on the first lens at an angle "θ" will also be redirected towards L3. However, when it hits the second lens, it is coming from point L2 and it is redirected by the second lens to R1. Intermediate rays incident on the first lens at an angle "θ" will be redirected to points between R1 and R2, fully illuminating the receiver.
Something similar happens in the situation shown in the same figure, on the right. Ray "r"3 incident on the first lens at an angle "α"<"θ" will be redirected towards a point between L3 and L4. When it hits the second lens, it is coming from point L1 and it is redirected by the second lens to R2. Also, Ray "r"4 incident on the first lens at an angle "α"<"θ" will be redirected towards a point between L3 and L4. When it hits the second lens, it is coming from point L2 and it is redirected by the second lens to R1. Intermediate rays incident on the first lens at an angle "α"<"θ" will be redirected to points between R1 and R2, also fully illuminating the receiver.
This combination of optical elements is called Köhler illumination. Although the example given here was for solar energy concentration, the same principles apply for illumination in general. In practice, Köhler optics are typically not designed as a combination of nonimaging optics, but they are simplified versions with a lower number of active optical surfaces. This decreases the effectiveness of the method, but allows for simpler optics. Also, Köhler optics are often divided into several sectors, each one of them channeling light separately and then combining all the light on the target.
An example of one of these optics used for solar concentration is the Fresnel-R Köhler.
Compound parabolic concentrator.
In the drawing opposite there are two parabolic mirrors CC' (red) and DD' (blue). Both parabolas are cut at B and A respectively. A is the focal point of parabola CC' and B is the focal point of the parabola DD' The area DC is the entrance aperture and the flat absorber is AB. This CPC has an acceptance angle of "θ".
The Parabolic Concentrator has an entrance aperture of DC and a focal point F.
The Parabolic concentrator only accepts rays of light that are perpendicular to the entrance aperture DC. The tracking of this type of concentrator must be more exact and requires expensive equipment .
The Compound Parabolic Concentrator accepts a greater amount of light and needs less accurate tracking
For a 3-dimensional "nonimaging compound parabolic concentrator", the maximum concentration possible in air or in vacuum (equal to the ratio of input and output aperture areas), is:
formula_3
where, formula_4 is the half-angle of the acceptance angle (of the larger aperture).
History.
The development started in the mid-1960s at three different locations by V. K. Baranov (USSR) with the study of the focons (focusing cones) Martin Ploke (Germany), and Roland Winston (USA), and led to the independent origin of the first nonimaging concentrators, later applied to solar energy concentration. Among these three earliest works, the one most developed was the American one, resulting in what nonimaging optics is today.
There are different commercial companies and universities working on nonimaging optics. Currently the largest research group in this subject is the Advanced Optics group at the CeDInt, part of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM).

List of unproduced Hitchcock projects

The following is a partial list of unproduced Hitchcock projects, in roughly chronological order. During a career that spanned more than half a century, Alfred Hitchcock directed over fifty films, and worked on a number of others which never made it beyond the pre-production stage.
"Number 13" (1922).
This was to be Hitchcock's directorial debut, after working in the art department on twelve films prior, but budgetary problems canceled the production after only a few scenes were shot. Studio records indicate that its title was to be "Mrs. Peabody".
"Greenmantle" (1939–1942).
Hitchcock very much wanted to direct a follow-up to "The 39 Steps", and he felt that "Greenmantle" by John Buchan was a superior book. He proposed that the film would star Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, but the rights from the Buchan estate proved too expensive.
"Escape" (1940).
Hitchcock desperately wanted to direct Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, and Conrad Veidt in one of the first World War II dramas, "Escape". Hitchcock, a long-time admirer of Shearer's acting, had sought for years to find a suitable project for her. However, Hitchcock was shut out of the project when the novel "Escape" by Ethel Vance (pen name of Grace Zaring Stone) was purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Hitchcock knew he could never work for the notorious MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer, who selected Mervyn LeRoy to produce the film. Years later, Hitchcock made the statement about the lack of true Hollywood leading ladies with the quote, "Where are the Norma Shearers?"
"The Bramble Bush" (1951–1953).
"The Bramble Bush" would have been an adaptation of a 1948 novel by David Duncan about a disaffected Communist agitator, who on the run from the police, is forced to adopt the identity of a murder suspect. The story would be adapted to take place in Mexico and San Francisco. 
The project, originally to come after "I Confess" (1953) as a Transatlantic Pictures production to be released by Warner Brothers, had a high budget which made it a difficult project. Hitchcock did not feel that any of the scripts lifted the movie beyond an ordinary chase story, and Warner Brothers allowed him to kill the project and move on to "Dial M for Murder" (1954). 
The theme of the hero assuming a dangerous new identity would become the kernel of the script for "North by Northwest" (1959). Michelangelo Antonioni's film "The Passenger" (1975) tells a similar story, but is not based on Duncan's book. The 1960 film "The Bramble Bush", starring Richard Burton and Barbara Rush, and released by Warner Brothers, was based on a Charles Mergendahl novel, and had no relation to Duncan's book.
"Flamingo Feather" (1956).
This was to be a big-budget adaptation of Laurens van der Post's novel of political intrigue in Southern Africa. James Stewart was expected to take the lead role of an adventurer who discovers a concentration camp for Communist agents; Hitchcock wanted Grace Kelly to play the love interest. 
After a disappointing research trip to South Africa where he concluded that he would have difficulty filming, especially on a budget – and with confusion of the story's politics and the seeming impossibility of casting Kelly, Hitchcock deferred the project and instead cast Stewart in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956). Hitchcock travelled to Livingstone at The Victoria Falls and was a guest of Harry Sossen one of the prominent inhabitants of this pioneer town. Hitchcock and Sossen were photographed together at the newly opened Livingstone Airport and the event was recorded in the local papers. Sossen was also in communication with Laurens van der Post who gave him a signed copy of the book "Flamingo Feather" during a visit to the Falls (staying at the Victoria Falls Hotel). Sossen's daughter Marion is in possession of the book today and a number of letters between her father and van der Post.
"No Bail for the Judge" (1958–1961).
"No Bail for the Judge" was to be an adaptation of a thriller novel by Henry Cecil about a London barrister who, with the assistance of a gentleman thief, has to defend her father, a High Court judge, when he is accused of murdering a prostitute. In a change of pace from his usual blonde actresses, Audrey Hepburn would have played the barrister, with Laurence Harvey as the thief, and John Williams as the Hepburn character's father. Some sources, including "Writing with Hitchcock" author Steven DeRosa say that Hitchcock's interest in the novel started in the summer of 1954 while filming "To Catch a Thief", and that Hitchcock hoped to have John Michael Hayes write the screenplay. Hepburn was an admirer of Hitchcock's work and had long wanted to appear in one of his films.
Samuel A. Taylor, scenarist for "Vertigo" and "Topaz", wrote the screenplay after Ernest Lehman rejected it. The Taylor screenplay included a scene, not in the original novel, where the heroine disguises herself as a prostitute and has to fend off a rapist. Hepburn left the film, partly because of the near-rape scene, but primarily due to a pregnancy. (Hepburn suffered a miscarriage during the filming of the 1960 film "The Unforgiven" then gave birth to son Sean Ferrer in July 1960.) Laurence Harvey still ended up working with Hitchcock in 1959, however, on an episode that Hitchcock directed of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents".
Without Hepburn, the project didn't have the same appeal for Hitchcock. Changes in British law concerning prostitution and entrapment – changes which took place after the novel was published – made some aspects of the screenplay implausible. Hitchcock told Paramount Pictures it was better to write off $200,000 already spent on the film's development than to spend another $3 million for a film he no longer cared for. In the fall of 1959, a Paramount publicity brochure titled "Success in the Sixties!" had touted "No Bail for the Judge" as an upcoming feature film starring Hepburn, to be filmed in Technicolor and VistaVision.
"The Wreck of the Mary Deare" (1959).
The Hammond Innes novel was optioned by MGM with the intention of having Hitchcock direct and Gary Cooper star. Hitchcock had long wanted to work with Cooper, but after developing the script with Ernest Lehman for several weeks, they concluded that it couldn't be done without turning the movie into "a boring courtroom drama". 
Hitchcock and Lehman made an appearance before MGM executives telling the story of "North by Northwest", and said that MGM would get two films out of Hitchcock under his contract with MGM. However, eventually Hitchcock abandoned the idea of "Mary Deare" and went ahead with "North by Northwest" instead.
"The Blind Man" (1960).
Following "Psycho", Hitchcock re-united with Ernest Lehman for an original screenplay idea: A blind pianist, Jimmy Shearing (a role for James Stewart), regains his sight after receiving the eyes of a dead man. Watching a Wild West show at Disneyland with his family, Shearing would have visions of being shot and would come to realize that the dead man was in fact murdered and the image of the murderer is still imprinted on the retina of his eyes. The story would end with a chase around the ocean liner RMS "Queen Mary". Walt Disney reputedly barred Hitchcock from shooting at Disneyland after seeing "Psycho". Stewart left the project, Lehman argued with Hitchcock, and the script was never shot.
"Village of Stars" (1962).
Hitchcock bought the rights to the 1960 novel "Village of Stars" by David Beaty (written under the pen name Paul Stanton) after "The Blind Man" project was canceled. The book follows a RAF V bomber crew given an order to drop a nuclear bomb, only to have the order aborted. Unfortunately, the bomb is resisting attempts to defuse it and the plane can only stay in flight for a limited time.
"Trap for a Solitary Man" (1963).
"Trap for a Solitary Man" was scheduled to be directed by Hitchcock in widescreen by Twentieth Century-Fox. The story, based on the French play "Piege Pour un Homme Seul" by M. Robert Thomas, follows a young married couple on holiday in the Alps. The wife disappears, and after a prolonged search the police bring back someone they claim to be her; she even says she is the man's wife, but the man has never seen her before. The play was later adapted three times as TV movies: "Honeymoon With a Stranger" (ABC, 1969), "One Of My Wives Is Missing" (ABC, 1976) and "Vanishing Act" (CBS, 1986). It had previously been broadly adapted (without attribution) as the 1958 Associated British-Pathé feature "Chase a Crooked Shadow".
"Mary Rose" (1964).
Hitchcock had long desired to turn J. M. Barrie's 1920 play "Mary Rose" into a film. In 1964, after working together on "Marnie", Hitchcock asked Jay Presson Allen to adapt the play into a screenplay. Hitchcock would later tell interviewers that his contract with Universal allowed him to make any film, so long as the budget was under $3 million, and so long as it was not "Mary Rose". Whether or not this was actually true, Lew Wasserman was not keen on the project, though Hitchcock never gave up hope of one day filming it.
"The Three Hostages" (1964).
In 1964, Hitchcock re-read another Richard Hannay novel by John Buchan, "The Three Hostages", with a mind to adapting it. As with "Greenmantle" a quarter of a century earlier, the rights were elusive. But also the story was dated, very much rooted in the 1930s, and the plot involved a villain whose blind mother hypnotizes the hero. Hitchcock, in interviews, said that he felt that the portrayal of hypnosis did not work on film, and that films that attempted this portrayal, in Hitchcock's opinion, turned out poorly.
"Frenzy" (a.k.a. "Kaleidoscope") (1964–1967).
Although Hitchcock made a film called "Frenzy" in 1972, that film's title and some plot points came from an idea Hitchcock had a few years earlier for a prequel to "Shadow of a Doubt". Hitchcock approached many writers including Samuel Taylor and Alec Coppel, but in the end engaged an old friend, Benn Levy to flesh out his sketchy idea.
The story would have revolved around a young, handsome bodybuilder (inspired by Neville Heath) who lures young women to their deaths, a version of the character known as 'Merry Widow Murderer' in "Shadow of a Doubt". The New York police set a trap for him, with a policewoman posing as a potential victim. The script was based around three crescendos dictated by Hitchcock: the first was a murder by a waterfall; the second murder would take place on a mothballed warship; and the finale, which would take place at an oil refinery with brightly colored drums.
Hitchcock showed his script to his friend François Truffaut. Though Truffaut admired the script, he felt uneasy about its relentless sex and violence. Unlike "Psycho", these elements would not be hidden behind the respectable veneer of murder mystery and psychological suspense, and the killer would be the main character, the hero, the eyes of the audience.
Universal vetoed the film, despite Hitchcock's assurances that he would make the film for under $1 million with a cast of unknowns, although David Hemmings, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine had all been suggested as leads. The film – alternatively known as "Frenzy" or the more "sixties"-esque "Kaleidoscope" – was not made.
Test footage from this project is included in the 1999 Encore cable TV documentary "Dial H For Hitchcock: The Genius Behind the Showman."
"R.R.R.R." (1965).
Hitchcock approached Italian comedy-thriller writers Agenore Incrocci and Furio Scarpelli (Age & Scarpelli), writers of "Big Deal on Madonna Street", to write a screenplay around an original idea Hitchcock had carried in his head since the late 1930s. A New York City hotel run by an Italian immigrant and his family who, unknown to him, are using the hotel as cover for crimes, including the theft of a valuable coin from a guest of the hotel. (R.R.R.R. is the highest value of coin.)
The Italian screenwriters struggled with the story, and were not helped by the language barrier. Universal Studios were not keen on the idea and persuaded Hitchcock to move on to something else.
"The Short Night" (1976–1979).
Hitchcock's last, unfinished project was "The Short Night", an adaptation of the spy thriller of the same name by Ronald Kirkbride. A British double agent (loosely based on George Blake) escapes from prison and flees to Moscow via Finland, where his wife and children are waiting. An American agent – whose brother was one of the traitor's victims – heads to Finland to intercept him but ends up falling for the wife. It was Hitchcock's third attempt – after "Torn Curtain" and "Topaz" – to produce a "realistic Bond film". Clint Eastwood, and Sean Connery were possible male leads. Liv Ullman was asked to play the double agent's wife. Catherine Deneuve was also asked to star. Walter Matthau was considered for the villain role. Ed Lauter was also discussed for a role as one of Matthau's prison mates. 
The first writer assigned to the picture, James Costigan, quarreled with the director, who asked for him to be paid off. Then Ernest Lehman agreed to work on the script. Lehman felt the story should focus on the American spy, and left out the double agent's jailbreak. Lehman left the film too, and Hitchcock asked old friend Norman Lloyd to help him write a long treatment. Lloyd, like Universal, was concerned that Hitchcock's failing health meant that the movie might not get made. When Hitchcock suggested moving straight on to the screenplay, Lloyd objected saying they were unprepared. Hitchcock reacted angrily, fired Lloyd, and worked on the treatment himself.
After a while, Hitchcock accepted that he needed another writer to work with him, and Universal suggested David Freeman. Freeman helped Hitchcock complete the treatment and wrote the screenplay. He wrote about his experiences in the 1999 book "The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock", which includes his completed screenplay. The circumstances surrounding Hitchcock's retirement were given by producer Hilton A. Green during the documentary "Plotting "Family Plot"". According to Green, during pre-production for "The Short Night" Hitchcock met Green to tell him that his poor health would prevent him from making the film that was to be the follow-up to "Family Plot". After trying to talk Hitchcock out of his decision, Green agreed to Hitchcock's request to bring the news of his decision to retire to studio head Lew Wasserman, a long-time friend of Hitchcock.

Operating surplus

Operating surplus is an accounting concept used in national accounts statistics (such as United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) and in corporate and government accounts. It is the balancing item of the Generation of Income Account in the UNSNA. It may be used in macro-economics as a proxy for total pre-tax profit income, although entrepreneurial income may provide a better measure of business profits. According to the 2008 SNA, it is the measure of the surplus accruing from production before deducting property income, e.g., land rent and interest.
Operating surplus is a component of value added and GDP. The term "mixed income" is used when operating surplus cannot be distinguished from wage income, for example, in the case of sole proprietorships. Most of operating surplus will normally consist of gross profit income. In principle, it includes the (separately itemised) increase in the value of output inventories held, with or without a valuation adjustment reflecting average prices during the accounting period.
Operating surplus therefore does not necessarily refer to "all" gross profit income realized in an economy. Profits are also realized from all kinds of property transactions which do not involve new production, such as capital gains, and net profits are often also received from foreign countries or paid to foreign countries. In addition, many profits arising from the use of natural resources, land, and financial assets (in the form of interest income) will not be included.
Derivation of operating surplus in UNSNA.
A simple definition of business profit would be "sales less costs", and the accounting derivation of operating surplus is similar (although the SNA concept of entrepreneurial income better matches what is thought of as business profits). Starting off with Gross Output, expenditure on intermediate goods and services are deducted, to arrive at gross value added. 
Value added may be stated "gross" (equal to the net output value, including consumption of fixed capital, i.e. depreciation charges) or "net" (excluding consumption of fixed capital). The net operating surplus (NOS) is thus the residual balancing item in the product account, obtained as follows:
In simple equations,
NOS=GV - (CE + (IT-SU) + CFC)
or
NOS=NV - (CE + (IT-SU)
Operating surplus can of course also be stated gross (GOS):
GOS=NOS + CFC
In this case, depreciation charges are included.
Exclusions.
In UNSNA, "implicit (imputed) rents" on land owned by the enterprise and the "implicit (imputed) interest" chargeable on the use of the enterprise's own funds are excluded from operating surplus.
Operating surplus also excludes property incomes considered to be unrelated to value-adding production.
Mixed income.
The category of operating surplus is applied to the whole economy, and therefore may include more than gross corporate profit income. For example, profit income by self-employed operators.
In UNSNA, "mixed income" refers to the balancing item of accounts for "unincorporated enterprises" owned by members of households, either individually or in partnership with others, in which the self-employed owners, or other members of their households, work and obtain income other than wages or salaries, which is included in operating surplus.
In practice, all unincorporated enterprises owned by households that are not quasi-corporations fall in this category, except for the "imputed rental value of owner-occupied housing" and paid domestic staff employed by households, an activity that is considered to generate no surplus.
Some countries separately itemise this mixed income in their accounts, other do not.
The effect of ownership relations on operating surplus in UNSNA.
The size of total operating surplus is in theory not affected by whether the assets used in production are owned or rented by the enterprise, or whether assets owned by the enterprise and used in production are financed out of its own funds (or equity capital) or out of borrowed funds (or loan capital). 
But if buildings, other structures, machinery or equipment are "rented" by an enterprise, the payments of rentals under an operating lease or similar lease are recorded as purchases of services (Intermediate consumption). Thus, the payment of a rental on a fixed asset "reduces its gross value added", below what it would be, if the producer owned the asset. 
The impact of this on net value added is offset to some extent by the fact that a tenant, or lessee, incurs no asset depreciation, whereas an owner would. But net value added will be lower when a fixed asset is rented, because the rental has to cover the lessor's operating and interest costs as well as asset depreciation. Thus, the size of net operating surplus will vary according to whether fixed assets are rented, or purchased. 
Enterprises may furthermore invest surplus capital in financial assets or real estate assets, especially in times of uncertainty or high interest rates. Considerable "property income" may be received from such investments. In UNSNA, this property income does not constitute part of value added in production, and is therefore "excluded" from operating surplus (except for what is called the "services" of the financial, insurance and real estate industry). 
If therefore an increasing amount of business income consists of property income rather than income from production, this will lower value added, and lower operating surplus.
Criticism of UNSNA concept.
As stated, operating surplus is a residual item in national accounts of gross product. It is "analogous" to what is "left over" when a business deducts its costs from sales revenue in order to arrive at its profit total. However, the analogy is somewhat deceptive, insofar as the operating surplus in national accounts, as a component of value added, is not truly equal to real generic pre-tax profit receipts. 
The main reason for that is simply that, in calculating this aggregate, various items are added and deducted from an initial surveyed (or tax-declared) gross profit figure in a way that is consistent with the concept of value added.
Or, to put it a different way, the definition of operating surplus is dependent on the general definition of Gross Output from production. To obtain a measure of value added in production, all those income flows considered to be unrelated to production (mainly, property income and transfer income) are excluded from the valuation of Gross Output. Therefore, this is one reason why the operating surplus cited in national accounts is likely to be "lower" than "real" generic pre-tax profit income. An additional problem is the practice of shifting the declaration of profit income to another country where taxes are lower, by means of various financial manipulations. Again that leads to an understatement of domestic profits.
The trend in operating surplus over time will normally be similar to the general trend in gross business profits, but in Marxian economics operating surplus is rejected as an adequate proxy for total gross profit or surplus value. 
The main reason is that in Marxian economics the official concepts of Gross Output and value added are not accepted as an adequate definition of the value of production. Among other things, a fraction of profit, interest and rent income which is payable from the gross income of producing enterprises is excluded from value added in the official accounts, on the ground that it is unrelated to production. Marxian economists however argue that fraction is part of the value of production and the value product, insofar it has to be paid out of current revenues of producing enterprises.
This Marxian interpretation implies a somewhat different view of the real cost structure of production, and the real composition of product values, and to obtain alternative measures, the official accounts must be substantially reaggregated to make explicit the sources and receipts of income from salaries, profits, interest, rent, taxes and social insurance levies, subsidies, royalties and fees, and their contribution to the valuation of gross product (see also value product). 
In the Marxian view, obtaining generic profit income from sales is precisely the prime motivator of capitalist business activity, and therefore to present this income as a "generic residual balancing item" in national accounts without making its components explicit does no justice to the real economic relations involved.

UKErevyen

UKErevyen (literally meaning "The revue of UKA") is the traditional revue shown during the biannual cultural festival UKA in Trondheim, Norway.
History.
Overview.
The revue UKErevyen has been made by students every second year since the beginning in 1917, except during World War II, in order to supply the students' society with enough money to run for another two years. During the years, both the revue and its subsequent festival has grown continuously.
In detail.
Back in 1917, the newly founded students' community in Trondheim ("Samfundet") was in a financial crisis. As a last resort, the students made a revue on their own; the revenue were to assure the future of Samfundet. The boss of Samfundet's own theatre got a script from the student theatre in Oslo, and managed to talk the others into trying to make money on it, despite the fact that the earlier shows they had put on had just worsened the financial situation. Less than a month later, the first UKErevy (revue of UKA) premiered. The show lasted for a week (a "week" in Norwegian is "uke", hence the name UKA, "the week") and was a huge success. After a couple of years the money was spent, the urge and need was back, and thus a tradition began: Every second year a show would be put on to assure Samfundet's future. However, from now on, they would write the material themselves.
The first UKA revues were never really finished before opening, and it wasn't before the 1933 "NÆMESiS" that the audience could experience a large-scale, thoroughly worked-with revue. From now on the UKErevy became a more professional revue.
During the 1930s the revues were coloured by the social and political disturbances in Europe. The 1939 revue "Tempora" criticized largely the rearmament and racial discrimination seen on the continent. The revue's poster, where a threatening giant lizard arises behind partying students, proved an omen of what to come.
The line of festivals was itself affected by World War II, as the nazis took over the community's house and thus in 1941 and 1943 there was no revue shown. However, the 2005 revue "Origo" tells the story of a show indeed being written and rehearsed in 1943, on the authority of Norwegian Nazi sympathizer Vidkun Quisling, in order to turn the citizens of Trondheim to the nazi's side. However, the show was sabotaged by a Norwegian rebel, not unlike the sabotage at Rjukan during the war. Quisling discovered the day before the premiere that his revue made fun of the nazis instead of portray them well, and in rage he demanded the revue cancelled. "Origo" further on tells that the script, film reels and costumes was found below "Samfundet" during a renovation in 2005, and so a reconstruction of the sabotaged never-existing play "Quiss-e-ling" could be shown in the 2005 revue, to acclaim the until-now unknown war hero.
Already in 1945, UKErevyen was back with "Go-a-head", an optimistic show that looked forward, telling the viewers not to let blame and hatred reign. 1947's "Fandango", however, had already discovered the Cold war, and in a time where most Norwegians focused on rebuilding the country, the revue warned about the technological society and uncritical use of science.
Themes brought up over the years include communism, worshipping one's own reflection, technology hype, and more recently, the new generation of people who has everything they want and still want more, and coping with the world's numerous demands to you as an individual, when you perhaps should listen more to yourself.
Since the beginning, the revue has grown largely in both terms of the number of people involved and revenue. As mentioned; over the years a full-blown festival blossomed up around the revue. Its primary goal is still to keep the students' community running, and 2003 was in fact the first year in the history of UKA and UKErevyen that Samfundet made enough money on its own to be able to survive without UKA. The festival and its heart, the revue, is regardlessly continuing to prosper, and "the week" now ironically lasts over three weeks. During the 24 days the festival lasts, the revue is shown 30 times, selling somewhere around 25.000 tickets.
Traditions.
Both UKA and the revue has many traditions. Some evolve over time, likewise some fade out and are forgotten as new students arrive to arrange new festivals. Thus, it's just as hard to determine how old the current traditions are, as it is to try to find out what traditions are lost. One set of traditions concern the name of UKErevyen, which also becomes the name of the entire festival.
The content.
A few traditions follow the revue itself as well. 
Songwise, there must be a song about or related to drinking and one that revolves around the city in which the revue is played, Trondheim. A tradition that used to be, is that there should be a song about being a student. This tradition is, to some extent, awoken again in 2005.
When it comes to the sketches, few traditions remain. There is said to be a "rule" that at least one of the skits have to include some kind of animal.

Long March 2 (rocket family)

Long March 2 rocket family or Chang Zheng 2 rocket family as in Chinese pinyin is an expendable launch system operated by the People's Republic of China.
History.
Development and design falls mostly under the auspices of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. The rockets use the abbreviations LM-2 family for export, and CZ-2 family within China, as "Chang Zheng" means "Long March" in Chinese pinyin.
Long March 2 is the base model of the Long March 2 rocket family, derived from Chinese first ICBM DF-5. The development work began in 1970, the first rocket was launched on November 5, 1974, but the launch failed. The production of the rocket ended in 1979.
Although not officially reported, it is believed that Long March 2A and Long March 2B were assigned to derivations which targeted to launch the first Chinese static orbit communication satellite Dong Fang Hong 2 into GTO, with different 3rd stage solutions. The original Long March 2A, which planned to use hypergolic rocket fuels as the third stage, was later renamed to Long March 4. In addition, the original Long March 2B, which used cryogenic fuel as third stage, was later renamed to Long March 3. Each of them derived into a full rocket family with various configurations, but the core 1st stage and 2nd stage are mostly kept unchanged.
Long March 2C and Long March 2D's first launches occurred in 1982 and 1990 respectively.
The Long March 2E was the first one in the Long March rocket family that introduced liquid rocket boosters, to improve its GTO payload capacity to satisfy the domestic and international launch market in the 1990s. It was first launched in 1992.
The development of Long March 2F began in 1992, which is a man-rated version of Long March 2E. Its first launch was in November 1999 "(See also Shenzhou 1)". This version is the safest model in the Long March 2 family, with 7 launches and no failure record.
Long March 2D and Long March 4 were developed by the Shanghai Space Agency, while all others are developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.

Austrian Littoral

The Austrian Littoral (, , , , ) was established as a crown land ("Kronland") of the Austrian Empire in 1849.
Kingdom of Italy annexed it after World War I according to the Treaty of London and later Treaty of Rapallo. After World War II, it was split between Italy (West), Slovenia (North), and Croatia (South).
Trieste had strategic importance as Austria-Hungary's primary seaport and the coast of the Littoral was a resort destination, the Austrian Riviera. The region was a multi-national one, with Italians, Slovenes, Croats, Germans and Friulians being the main ethnic groups. In 1910, it had an area of and a population of 894,287.
History.
The territory of the medieval Patriarchate of Aquileia had gradually been conquered by the Republic of Venice ("Domini di Terraferma") until the early 15th century. In the east, the Habsburg archdukes of Austria, based on the March of Carniola they held from 1335, had gained suzerainty over Istrian Pazin in 1374 and the port of Trieste in 1382. They also purchased Duino and Rijeka (Fiume) on the northern Adriatic coast in 1474, and inherited the Friulian lands of the extinct Counts of Görz in 1500. In 1511 Emperor Maximilian I annexed the city of Gradisca from Venice.
The Habsburgs however did little initially to consolidate or develop their holdings in the Littoral. The supremacy of "La Serenissima" in the Adriatic and the attention to the threat posed by an expanding Ottoman Empire gave the Austrian archdukes little opportunity to enlarge their coastal possessions. Incorporated into the Austrian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, Görz, Trieste and Istria remained separately administered and retained their autonomy until into the 18th century.
Emperor Charles VI increased sea power of the Habsburg Monarchy by making peace with the Ottomans and declaring free shipping in the Adriatic. In 1719, Trieste and Fiume were made free ports. In 1730, administration of the Littoral was unified under the Intendancy in Trieste. However, in 1775, Emperor Joseph II divided the administration of the two main ports, assigning Trieste as the port for the Austrian "hereditary lands" and Fiume for the Kingdom of Hungary. Shortly after, Trieste was merged with the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca in the north.
During the Napoleonic Wars, the Habsburg Monarchy gained Venetian lands in the Istrian Peninsula and the Quarnero (Kvarner) Islands as part of the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797. However, these territories and all of the new Austrian Empire's Adriatic lands were soon lost to the French Empire's puppet state, the Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg of 1805. The 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn then transferred the area to the Illyrian Provinces which were directly ruled by France.
With Napoleon's defeats, the Austrian Empire regained the region and, in 1813, all of the Littoral including Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, all of Istria, the Quarnero Islands, Fiume, and the hinterland of Fiume, Civil Croatia, including Karlstadt (Karlovac) became one administrative unit. From 1816, the Littoral was a part of the Austrian Empire's Kingdom of Illyria. In 1822, Fiume and Civil Croatia were separated from the territory and ceded to the Kingdom of Hungary (and in 1849 to Croatia).
The Littoral was officially the Trieste ("Triest") Province, one of two provinces (or "gouvernements") of the Kingdom, the other being Laibach (Ljubljana). It was subdivided into four districts ("kreis"): Gorizia ("Görz"; including Gorizia and the Julian March), Istria ("Istrien"; Eastern Istria and the Quarnero Islands), Trieste ("Triest"; the Trieste hinterland and Western Istria), and Trieste city ("Triester Stadtgebiet").
Around 1825, the Littoral was reorganized into only two subdivisions: Istria with its capital at Mitterburg (Pisino/Pazin) and Gorizia with Trieste and its immediate surroundings under the direct control of the crown and separate from the local administrative structure.
In 1849, the Kingdom of Illyria was dissolved and the Littoral became a separate crown land with a governor in Trieste. It was formally divided into the Margravate of Istria and the Princely County ("Gefürstete Grafschaft") of Gorizia and Gradisca with Trieste remaining separate from both.
By the 1861 February Patent, Gorizia and Gradisca and Istria became administratively separate entities and, in 1867, Trieste received separate status as well, and the Littoral was divided into the three crown lands of the Imperial Free City of Trieste and its suburbs, the Margraviate of Istria, and the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, which each had separate administrations and Landtag assemblies, but were all subject to a "k.k." statholder at Trieste. 
Following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Littoral fell within Italy's newly expanded borders as part of the Julian March. An area of similar extent under the name of Adriatic Littoral ("Adriatisches Küstenland") was one of the operational zones of German forces during World War II after the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 until the end of the war. After World War II, most of it was included in the Second Yugoslavia.
Today Croatia and Slovenia each hold portions of the territory and the city of Trieste remains under Italian rule. The name of the region lives on in its Slovene version, "Primorska" (Slovenian Littoral), a region of Slovenia.
Area and population.
Area:
Population (1910 Census):
Linguistic composition.
According to the last Austrian census of 1910 (1911 in Trieste), the Austrian Littoral was composed of the following linguistic communities:
Total:
Gorizia and Gradisca:
Trieste:
Istria:
The Austrian censuses did not count ethnic groups, nor the mother tongue, but the "language of daily interaction" ("Umgangssprache"). Except for a small Serbian community in Trieste, and the village of Peroj in Istria, inhabited by ethnic Montenegrins, the vast majority of Croatian speakers in the Austrian Littoral can be identified as Croats.
After 1880, Italian and Friulian languages were counted under one category, as Italian. The estimated number of Friulian speakers can be extrapolated from the Italian census of 1921, the only one in the 20th century when Friulian was counted as a distinct linguistic category. The Austrian Littoral had a large number of foreign nationals (around 71,000 or 7,9% of the overall population), which were not asked about their language of interaction. More than half of them resided in the city of Trieste. The majority were citizens of the Kingdom of Italy, followed by citizens of the Kingdom of Hungary (part of the Dual Monarchy)] and the German Reich. It can be supposed that the majority of these foreign citizens were Italian speakers, followed by German, Croatian (from Rijeka and Croatia-Slavonia) and Slovene (from Venetian Slovenia), and Hungarian speakers.

Picture Exchange Communication System

The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is a form of augmentative and alternative communication produced by Pyramid Educational Consultants, Inc. While the system is commonly used as a communication aid for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it has been used with a wide variety of learners, from preschoolers to adults, who have various communicative, cognitive, and physical impairments, including cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness. PECS has been the subject of much academic research, with currently over 85 PECS-related publications.
PECS was developed in 1985 at the Delaware Autism Program by Lori Frost and Andy Bondy. They noted that traditional communication techniques, including speech imitation, sign language, and picture point systems, relied on the teacher to initiate social interactions and none focused on teaching students to initiate interactions. Based on these observations, Frost and Bondy created a functional means of communication for individuals with a variety of communication challenges.
Overview.
PECS is designed to teach functional communication skills with an initial focus on spontaneous communication. It has been and continues to be implemented in a variety of settings and contexts (home, school, community) so users have the skills to communicate their wants and needs. PECS does not require complex or expensive materials since it uses picture symbols as the modality. PECS is a method to teach young children or any individual with a communication impairment a way to communicate within a social context. Research has shown that many preschoolers using PECS also begin developing speech. Based on the current evidence base, PECS has been described as an emerging treatment shown to increase communication skills for individuals with ASD.
Philosophy.
The training protocol is based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. The goal of PECS is spontaneous and functional communication. Verbal prompts are not used during the early phases, thus building immediate initiation and avoiding prompt dependency. PECS begins with teaching a student to exchange a picture of a desired item with a teacher/communicative partner, who immediately honors the request. After the student learns to spontaneously request for a desired item, the system goes on to teach discrimination among symbols and then how to construct a simple sentence. In the most advanced phases, individuals are taught to respond to questions and to comment. Additionally, descriptive language concepts such as size, shape, color, number, etc. are also taught so the student can make their message more specific. For example, "I want big yellow ball."
PECS Protocol.
After a preparation, the PECS Protocol occurs in six phases:
Depending on the age and cognitive level of the user, the time to master PECS will vary. One study found that it takes an average of 246 trials for users to master all six phases of PECS.
Effectiveness.
There is evidence that PECS is easily learned by most students, with its primary benefit being a means of communication for children and adults who have limited or no speech due to autism or other communication disorders. With regard to the intervention setting for AAC training, there is evidence that PECS is most readily learned when instruction takes place in a general education setting. Evidence also indicated that learners initiate a higher number of picture exchanges when PECS is taught in a single setting versus multiple settings.
The consensus among most researchers is that "PECS is recommended as an evidence-based intervention for enhancing functional communication skills of individuals with ASD." On the other hand, the 2009 National Standards Report from the National Autism Center lists PECs among emerging treatments that not (yet) have sufficient evidence of effectiveness.
An initial concern was that PECS might delay or inhibit speech development. However, a recent review of several peer-reviewed studies found that "there is no evidence within the reviewed studies to suggest that PECS inhibited speech; to the contrary, if any effect was observed, it was facilitative rather than inhibitory." When difficulties do arise, it is often due to a lack of powerful reinforcers and/or trainer error. A systematic review of interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder reported that use of PECS resulted in short-term improvement in word acquisition, but the effects were not maintained over time.
However, evidence from meta-analyses indicate that PECS does not result in equal communicative outcomes for all children with ASD. PECS training appears to have the most beneficial effects for younger learners. In addition, evidence of maintenance and generalization effects of functional communication gains achieved through PECs training has been mixed. Research indicates that "PECS is probably best used as an initial intervention to teach manding and the basic elements of what is a communicative exchange," and is not the best selection "for a long-term intervention as it does not address question asking and may be better implemented as part of a multimodal system for when picture communications are more socially appropriate." 
Additional applications.
There is emerging research that suggests adults with developmental disabilities and severe communication deficits may benefit from the implementation of PECS as well. Others tried to combine PECS training with video modeling.

VARTA

VARTA AG (Vertrieb, Aufladung, Reparatur Transportabler Akkumulatoren; "Distribution, charging, repair of transportable accumulators"; ) is a company based in Germany manufacturing batteries for global automotive, industrial and consumer markets. A sales slogan was "you're smarter to fit Varta!" in the mid-1990s. However, the brand is now owned by other companies.
History.
VARTA was created in 1904 as a subsidiary of Accumulatorenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft (AFA) and was based in Berlin and Hagen in Westphalia. AFA was acquired by Günther Quandt after the First World War and the VARTA business was expanded greatly. The company was "the" manufacturer of batteries and accumulators for the Wehrmacht, submarines and the Luftwaffe during World War II.
During this period 3,500 slave labourers worked in AFA's factories under appalling conditions.
After the war, most of the shares of Varta passed from Günther Quandt to Herbert Quandt. The subsidiary in East-Berlin was occupied by the Soviets and was named Berliner Akkumulatoren- und Elementefabrik. In 1977, VARTA AG's businesses were split up by Herbert Quandt. Battery and plastics operations were retained in VARTA AG, but the pharmaceuticals and specialty chemical businesses was transferred to a new public company called Altana, and the electrical business was spun off into a company called CEAG. Herbert Quandt's shares in VARTA AG were left to his three children by his second marriage; while the two children of his third marriage received shares in Altana and CEAG (and a substantial stake in BMW).
However, by 2006 Varta AG had sold all its operating divisions and the Quandts had sold their shares. VARTA AG is currently liquidating its remaining assets, contracts, liabilities and shareholdings (in particular the manufacture and sale of VARTA batteries). The VARTA businesses continues elsewhere in other hands.

Jared Lorenzen

Jared Raymond Lorenzen (born February 14, 1981) is a professional football quarterback for the Northern Kentucky River Monsters of the Continental Indoor Football League. Lorezen has also been the Commissioner of the Ultimate Indoor Football League. He was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2004. He played college football at Kentucky. 
Lorenzen earned a Super Bowl ring with the Giants in Super Bowl XLII as the backup quarterback behind Eli Manning.
Early years.
Lorenzen attended Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In basketball, he was a three-year letterman and helped lead his team to Kentucky Sweet 16 appearances. As a junior, he passed for a Northern Kentucky-record 2,759 yards and 37 touchdowns in 13 games. As a senior in 1998, he completed 62 percent of his passes for 3,393 yards, 45 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also rushed for 904 yards (8.4 average per carry) and 15 TDs in leading Highlands to a 15–0 season and No.19 national ranking as a senior, earning him the Mr. Football Award. Five games into his senior season, Lorenzen committed to the University of Kentucky.
College career.
When Lorenzen arrived at Kentucky, he redshirted as a true freshman. As a redshirt freshman, he was named the team's starting quarterback by head coach Hal Mumme ahead of returning starter Dusty Bonner. The move caused Bonner to transfer. Lorenzen's career at Kentucky was marked by two head coaching changes; Mumme departed as an investigation into NCAA rules violations brought down his staff and resulted in the program being placed on probation with scholarship limitations. After Lorenzen helped lead the team to a 7–5 record in 2002, head coach Guy Morriss left to become the head coach at Baylor University and was replaced by Rich Brooks, who designed plays where Lorenzen lined up as a receiver while Shane Boyd played quarterback. Despite all the turmoil, Lorenzen set school records in total offense, passing yards, and passing touchdowns, eclipsing many marks set by 1999 NFL No. 1 overall draft pick Tim Couch.
Statistics.
Source:
Numbers in bold are Kentucky records.
Professional career.
New York Giants.
After failing to be drafted in the 2004 NFL Draft, Lorenzen signed as undrafted free agent with the New York Giants.
In the 2006 preseason, Lorenzen led his team to victory by engineering a game-winning drive against the Baltimore Ravens. Following that performance and an impressive training camp he was officially named the Giants backup quarterback three weeks later.
Lorenzen made his first appearance on the field in a Giants uniform on December 30, 2006. During this game, he was used for one play, a quarterback sneak to make a first down on a third-and-one. 
Lorenzen made his second appearance on Sunday, January 7, 2007, in the Giants wild card loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. On the Giants opening drive, he lined up at quarterback on a third-and-one and got the first down, "shifting the pile" in the process, on the way to a Giants touchdown. He also entered the game in the third quarter but the Giants called timeout and Manning took over at quarterback. 
Lorenzen's first significant regular season appearance occurred on September 9, 2007, when he took over for the injured Manning in the fourth quarter of the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. Lorenzen made both his first regular season pass and rush, but failed to earn a first down. He did not see further action in the 2007 season, because Manning's injury did not cost him any further playing time. 
Lorenzen was released by the Giants on June 23, 2008.
Indianapolis Colts.
On July 24, 2008, Lorenzen was signed by the Indianapolis Colts. He was waived during the final cuts for the 53-man roster.
Kentucky Horsemen.
On February 10, 2009, Lorenzen was assigned to the Kentucky Horsemen of af2. The team went bankrupt and was dissolved in October 2009.
Northern Kentucky River Monsters.
Lorenzen was working as the general manager of the Northern Kentucky River Monsters of the Ultimate Indoor Football League when he decided to return to football. Despite being well over 300 lbs at the time, Lorenzen resigned as GM to become the team's starting quarterback. Lorenzen had a highly successful return to football, turning in an MVP Season.
Owensboro Rage.
Lorenzen signed with the Owensboro Rage of the Continental Indoor Football League partway through the 2013 season. The Rage folded two weeks prior to the end of the season due to financial distress.
Return to the River Monsters.
Lorenzen returned to the River Monsters, by this point a member of the Continental Indoor Football League, on December 17, 2013. In Lorenzen's first game of the season, listed as 320 pounds, Lorenzen showed that he still had plenty of skill, side-stepping defenders. Lorenzen's play was filmed and the videos ended up all over the internet, overshadowing the River Monster's 36-20 victory of the Bluegrass Warhorses. Lorenzen broke his tibia in the Week 2 42-30 loss to the Erie Explosion.
Post-football career.
Lorenzen was hired on March, 23, 2010 to become the quarterbacks coach at his alma mater, Highlands High School, in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. After the 2011 UIFL season, Lorenzen was named Commissioner of the UIFL.

Glass bottle

A glass bottle is a bottle created from glass. Glass bottles can vary in size considerably, but are most commonly found in sizes ranging between about 10ml and 5 litres.
History.
The history of glass can be traced back to at least 1,200 BC where glass coated objects have been found.
Manufacture and reuse.
Millions of glass bottles are created worldwide every day. It is a highly mechanized process, and bottles in use today are no longer hand blown as they were in the past.
A glass bottle is 100% recyclable with many new bottles containing glass which was created over 20 years ago. Less energy is used in recycling a glass bottle than creating the glass from raw materials, helping the environment. In 2012, 96% of the glass bottles sold in Switzerland were recycled. 
Glass bottle manufacturing takes place over several stages. To briefly outline the processes from beginning to end: raw material, melting, forming, annealing, physical inspection, machine & laser inspection, secondary physical inspection, quality control, and finally packing.
Glass bottles are sometimes reinforced through lamination. Laminated safety glass is made by coating a glass surface with a layer of plastic. When a standard glass bottle is dropped, the glass breaks and scatters. When a laminated bottle is dropped, the glass still breaks but the layer of plastic remains intact, keeping the glass pieces together.
Once made, bottles may suffer from internal stresses as a result of unequal, or too rapid cooling. An annealing oven, or 'lehr' is used to cool glass containers slowly to prevent stress and make the bottle stronger. When a glass bottle filled with liquid is dropped or subjected to shock, the water hammer effect may cause hydrodynamic stress, breaking the bottle.

Darren Sammy

Darren Julius Garvey Sammy (born 20 December 1983) is a Saint Lucian cricketer who plays international cricket for the West Indies. He is a right-handed batsman and a fast-medium bowler. On making his One Day International (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2004, Sammy became the first person from the island of St. Lucia to play international cricket. Three years later he made his Test debut against England, taking 7/66 which were the best bowling figures for a West Indian in his first Test since Alf Valentine in 1950. Sammy was appointed West Indies captain in October 2010. He scored his maiden Test century in May 2012 during a match against England.
Sammy also captained West Indies to the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 victory against Sri Lanka, their first major trophy for 8 years. They won the ICC Champions trophy against England in 2004.
Sammy also plays IPL by sunrisers Hyderabad. He mention captain of sun risers Hyderabad on 24 th May 2014 after Shikhar Dhawan.
At the launch of the Caribbean Premier League Sammy was announced as a franchise player for the 2013 tournament.
Early career.
On 2 October 2001 Darren Sammy made his List A debut at the age of 17. Playing in the Red Stripe Bowl for the Northern Windward Islands against Jamaica he bowled nine overs without taking a wicket and scored 25 runs before he was run out as his team slid to defeat. Playing three matches Sammy was his team's second-highest run-scorer with 90 runs, and took one wicket. Sammy was a member of the West Indies team to the 2002 Under-19 World Cup, which was held that year in New Zealand; he made 22 runs and took three wickets. Other members of that team, which lost to Australia in the semi-final, included Dwayne Bravo, Narsingh Deonarine, Ravi Rampaul, Shane Shillingford, Lendl Simmons, and Gavin Tonge all of whom went on to play for the West Indies senior team.
Upon his return from New Zealand, Sammy was picked to attend the Shell Cricket Academy at St. George's University in Grenada in 2002. The scheme aimed to help what were considered the Caribbean's "brightest cricketing prospects" develop skills to help them professionally, including areas such as money management to complement their cricketing ability. Other notable players in that classjust a handful would go on to play senior cricket for West Indiesincluded Dwayne Smith, Narsingh Deonarine, Carlton Baugh, Daren Powell, and Omari Banks.
On 31 January 2003, Sammy made his first-class debut for the Windward Islands against Barbados in the 2002/03 Carib Beer Cup. Batting at number seven, he scored no runs before being dismissed by spin bowler Sulieman Benn in the first innings, but fared better in the second, scoring 25 and falling to Benn again. Sammy bowled six overs in the match without taking a wicket. He played one further match in that season's cup, again succumbing for a duck in the first innings and failing to take a wicket. In the second innings he recorded his maiden first-class half-century, scoring 53 runs from 70 balls before he was dismissed by spin bowler Mahendra Nagamootoo. At the start of the 2003 season in England, Sammy joined the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Young Cricketers. Whilst still a member of the Young Cricketers, Sammy was called to the West Indies to join the University of the West Indies Vice Chancellor's XI against England in a warm-up match.
First international experience.
Following a successful domestic season in which Sammy finished as the Winward Islands' second highest wicket-taker in the Regional Four Day Competition with 22 scalps and 261 runs, he was the only uncapped player selected in the 15-man West Indies squad for the NatWest Triangular One Day International Series with England and New Zealand in June 2004. Counting in favour of his selection was Sammy's experience of English conditions: in 2003 he played for Barnes Cricket Club in the Middlesex Premier Cricket League. He subsequently earned his first West Indies cap in odd circumstances. Due to heavy rain the West Indies' match against New Zealand at the Rose Bowl was abandoned without a ball being bowled. But the captains had already completed the toss, and he fixture counts in ICC records as Sammy's first match.
In September, Sammy was recalled to the senior team in place of 22-year-old Jamaican fast bowler Jermaine Lawson who withdrew from the Champions Trophy squad with a stress fracture of the lower back. Sammy, at the age of 20, became the first international cricketer to emerge from St Lucia. For his actual playing debut, back at the Rose Bowl, Sammy took 1 wicket for 19 runs (1/19) off six overs and held on to three catches as West Indies beat Bangladesh by 138 runs. It was the only match Sammy played in the tournament. The West Indies went on to win the trophy, beating England in the final.
Early international career.
When the West Indies toured India in January 2007 Sammy was included in the squad, with a chance to make his Test debut. However, shortly before the team departed, he suffered an injury that ruled him out of the tour. After that set-back, Sammy travelled to England in April and May where he played in the Central Lancashire League ahead of the West Indies' tour of the country in May. He was selected in the touring squad. This time, the team won the NatWest limited overs series. And the 23-year-old St Lucian won his first Test cap in the third Test match at Old Trafford on 7 June. He claimed his first Test wicket when he dismissed Alastair Cook caught by Dwayne Bravo, but his first innings was unremarkable save for his economy, giving up just 1.88 runs per over off 17 completed overs. In the second innings, though, Sammy caught England captain Michael Vaughan off his own bowling, with the England score 99/2. In his 17th over, he had Ian Bell caught behind by Ramdin. Next ball he had Matt Prior by the same route. A couple of balls later, on the same score he dismissed Liam Plunkett, caught by Bravo. Five wickets gone, four to Sammy, three in five balls. He continued his excellent debut, capturing the wickets of Steve Harmison and Monty Panesar, before snagging Paul Collingwood to end with seven wickets for 66 runs. His bowling figures were the best at Old Trafford since Malcolm Marshall's 7/22 in 1988, and the best by any West Indian on debut since Alf Valentine took 8/102 in 1950.
As an all-rounder Sammy did not cover himself in glory on that tour, averaging just 14.20 runs from 10 innings, twice unbeaten. He had just the tenth highest aggregate on a tour that included matches against Scotland and the Netherlands. As a bowler, he excelled with a team-best average of 17.72, 18 wickets (third on the team) from 93.5 overs (five other players bowled more overs than Sammy).
Sammy was called up to the Stanford Superstars, a team compiled by American billionaire Allen Stanford, when Dwayne Bravo pulled out with an injury. He was not slated to play the first game, but Shivnarine Chanderpaul had a neck strain that precluded his participation. So all Sammy did was to provide electric fielding and consistent bowling to force his way into the side. As expected, the Superstars made it to the series finale to face England. The prize money at stake was US$20 million, $1 million each to the players on the winning team. Bowling first, the Superstars dismissed England for 99 runs. Sammy took 2/13 and made one catch. He did not bat in the series.
During the 2008/09 Regional Four Day Competition, Sammy played seven matches for the Winward Islands, scoring 476 runs at an average of 43.27 (the second highest for the club that season) and recording his maiden first-class century. His innings of 121 came from 140 balls and was scored against Barbados who were fielding a bowling line up including Tino Best, Kemar Roach, and Corey Collymore who all had international experience. During the innings he also passed 2,000 runs in first-class cricket. Sammy took 23 wickets in the competition at an average of 21.65.
In July 2009, there was a pay dispute between the West Indies players and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). An understrength squad was picked for the series against Bangladesh. Of the 15 players named, nine were uncapped; Sammy was appointed vice-captain and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The West Indies lost the series 2–0 as Bangladesh secured their first overseas series win. Sammy was the West Indies second-highest wicket-taker in the series with 12 wickets at an average of 17.33. he also scored 90 runs at an average of 22.50.
The WICB announced its central contracts in November 2009, and Sammy was included in the 33-man list. He was given a Grade B contract (the second-highest level) worth $80,000. His career-best Man of the Match figures of 4–26 in the third ODI in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines would have been more flattering still had captain Chris Gayle been able to hold on to a catch that would have given the tall St Lucian the distinction of becoming the first West Indian to take a five-fer in every form of the game; he had 5–26 off the same opponents in a Twenty20 International earlier in the series. West Indies bowled Zimbabwe for 104, having made 245.
In the fourth ODI, Sammy took 1–24 as West Indies won by four wickets; in the final match, he had 3–33 as West Indies again won by four wickets. Sammy finished the series as West Indies' joint top wicket-taker, himself and Kemar Roach sharing 16 scalps equally.
Playing at home, the West Indies had high hopes for the 2010 version of the Twenty20 competition. The tournament did not start off too badly, Sammy scoring 30 as the West Indies made 138–9 against Ireland, then capturing 3–8 and holding on to a record four catches as Ireland were routed for just 68, the second-lowest total in Twenty20s, and losing by 70 runs. But eventually West Indies were knocked out of contention when they were drubbed by Australia at Beausejour Cricket Grounds in St Lucia. He had a forgettable match in front of his home crowd, but overall, Sammy had had a good series. He ended with 51 runs in four innings, the fourth highest aggregate for West Indies, and his 12.75 was the seventh best average. But as a bowler, his six wickets and average of 12.0 topped the West Indies, and his economy rate of 5.26 runs per over was second.
In the second ODI against South Africa at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua-Barbuda, West Indies appeared well on their way to a second consecutive loss. 200–6 in the 41st over, well short of their winning target of 301, Sammy joined Dwayne Bravo at the crease. But six sixes and two fours later, it looked as though West Indies might just win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.
But successive run-outs – Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul and Nikita Miller all went by that route – left Sammy stranded and the West Indies 17 runs shy.
West Indies captain.
On 17 October 2010 Sammy was named captain of the West Indies Test team for its tour to Sri Lanka and until the end of the 2011 season, replacing Chris Gayle. At the time Sammy had played 8 Tests and 41 ODIs. The previous captain and vice, Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo respectively, had chosen not to sign central contracts with the West Indies Cricket Board and were replaced. Between January 2004 and the start of the tour to Sri Lanka in November, the West Indies had won just five of their previous 62 Tests and were expected to lose the three match series against a team with a good home record. In a series shortened by poor weather Sammy scored 10 runs and took two wickets at an average of 75.50, and while he said he wanted to improve his own performance Sammy stated that he was pleased with the 0–0 result of the series. In the 2–0 defeat to Sri Lanka in the subsequent ODI series, Sammy scored 28 runs and sent down 19 wicketless overs.
Pakistan toured the West Indies in April and May 2011 for a T20I, five ODIs, and two Tests. In the first match of the Test series West Indies secured their first victory since 2009, ending a 17-match run without a win. Sammy took seven wickets in the match, including five in Pakistan's second innings, and was named Man of the Match for his performance. West Indies lost the second match, drawing the series 1–1; Sammy was his team's second-highest wicket-taker, claiming ten at an average of 17.90. The following month Sammy was named T20I player of the year at the West Indies Players Association awards. When India toured in June and July the West Indies lost the Test series 1–0. Cricinfo recorded that Sammy led with passion and "bowled his heart out"; he finished with seven wickets from three matches at an average of 38.28. While playing, Sammy had to deal with distractions from hostile crowds and pundits who criticised his appointment as captain as some believed he could not hold down a place as a player alone.
Initially named as captain until the end of the 2011 season, Sammy was retained as captain across all formats for the tours of Bangladesh and India. In October Sammy's Grade B central contract was renewed; he was one of four players with a Grade B contract, the second highest category (Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the only player with a Grade A). Later that month, the West Indies toured Bangladesh. Sammy missed the first ODI through illness, but returned to captain the side in the remaining two. West Indies won the series 2–1 and Sammy took two wickets. The first Test was curtailed by rain and ended in a draw, and Sammy top-scored for his team. Having played 17 Tests, the innings of 58 runs from 43 balls was Sammy's first half-century in the format. West Indies won the second Test to take the series, and in the process Sammy dismissed Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to claim his 50th Test wicket.
Following on from the Bangladesh series, the West Indies moved on to India in November for three Tests and five ODIs. West Indies lost the Test series 2–0 and Sammy finished as his team's highest wicket-taker with nine at an average of 34.77. In the ODI series, Sammy took a single wicket from 21.5 overs as West Indies succumbed to a 4–1 defeat. The West Indies faced Australia in a five-match ODI series in March 2012. Sammy's team won the second match by five wickets, ending a series of 13 defeats against Australia that extended back to 2006. The West Indies entered the final match with a 2–1 lead and a chance to register their first series win against Australia since 1995. In the event Australia won by 30 runs, but the margin of victory was smaller than it would have been had Sammy not scored 84 runs from 50 deliveries, his highest score in the format and an effort for which he was named Man of the Match. In the Test series that followed, Sammy managed just five wickets from three matches at an average just above forty. As a batsman he was more successful, and was one of three West Indies batsmen to score more than 150 runs in the series. With the West Indies on 13/2 chasing 215 to win from 61 overs on the final day of the second Test, Sammy promoted himself up the batting order to number three to accelerate the scoring rate. He managed 30 not out from 26 deliveries before rain intervened and the match ended in a draw. West Indies lost the third Test by 75 runs to lose the series 2–0, but during his team's chase of 370 to win on the final day Sammy scored his second Test half-century, 61 from 51 deliveries, bettering his previous highest Test score of 58.
The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in the series against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100 runs, which he had not done previously in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000 runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201 runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer in the series while his six wickets cost 48.50 runs each.•</ref> Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said "All of a sudden there was this new-found confidence. You need to have a leader who can come out to the middle and make some sort of contribution. He has done enough and should not feel he has one foot in and one foot out as far as the leadership in concerned. He has done his bit to provide a winning environment."
New Zealand toured the West Indies between June and August 2012. The fixtures included two Tests, five ODIs, and two T20Is, and the West Indies won every match apart from the third ODI. Sammy guided the team to their first Test series victory since 2009 against a Test side other than minnows Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. He carried on his good form with the bat, scoring a half-century in the first Test.
Sammy led the West Indies in the 2012 World Twenty20 hosted by Sri Lanka. For the first time in a long time, the West Indies were considered realistic contenders for the title, a measure of how the team has matured under the auspices of Sammy. However, it was as an individual player that he came under scrutiny in the tournament. In the journey from group stages to the final, Sammy contributed 27 runs with the bat from four visits to the crease and overall bowling figures of 2/125, and drew a lot of criticism as many people felt he was keeping better players out of the side. But in the final, when it mattered most, Sammy scored 26 not out from 15 balls and took two key wickets (almost matching his batting and bowling tally for the rest of the tournament) to help his team overcome a slow start and defeat Sri Lanka.
Playing style.
Sammy has a reputation for bowling long spells and his medium-fast pace bowling is used to support strike bowlers. He has commented that "We all have roles in the team and I've clearly understood what my role is in the team, which is to build pressure and be the workhorse of the team. I've accepted that and that's how I've played throughout my career." He aims to do this by bowling dot balls to create pressure. Sammy feels that because he is a support bowler batsmen relax against him and are more prone to make mistakes. A consistent bowler, though he does not move the ball much Sammy delivers the ball with an upright seam and uses the crease to vary his angle of delivery. As a batsman, his strike-rate in ODIs of 98.11 is the second highest amongst West Indian players who have faced at least 500 deliveries (behind all-rounder Andre Russell on 119.34), and in ODI innings of at least 25 runs holds the second, third, and fourth highest strike rates of West Indian players.

Opistophthalmus boehmi

Opistophthalmus boehmi is a small (around 5 centimeters / 1.97 inches) scorpion native to southern Africa. It is a burrowing scorpion which can create intricated tunnels and spend days buried at the bottom on its lair.
Captive care.
"Opistophthalmus boehmi" can be housed in a small vivarium. A mixture of peat and sand should be used for substrate. The substrat should be humidified in order to stabilize it and permit burrowing, then dried before introducing the scorpion in the vivarium. No hide is necessary as this scorpion will dig its own burrow. A small cup of water should be provided to ensure an adequate level of humidity (60%-70%). "Opistophthalmus boehmi" does not require high temperatures and does best at 25°C-30°C (77°F-86°F). As with all scorpions, this specie can be fed most types of small insects, though crickets remain the most common choice.
Behavior.
This scorpion is quite nervous and can display aggressivity towards its keeper. It should not be kept communally, as fights and cannibalism are frequent. The toxicity of its venom is usually deemed to be low, though its sting can be quite painful. This scorpion makes a good pet for a beginner, though it spends most of its time in its burrow and is rarely seen.

Transverse rib

A Transverse rib () is the term in architecture given to the rib of a rib vault which is carried across the nave, dividing the same into bays. Although as a rule it was sunk in the barrel vault of the "Thermae", it is found occasionally below it, as in the Piscina at Baiae and the so-called Baths of Diana (Nymphaeum) at Nîmes. In the Romanesque and Gothic styles it becomes the principal feature of the vault, so much so that Scott termed it the "master rib".

Idlewild (Outkast album)

Idlewild is the sixth studio album by American hip hop duo OutKast, released August 22, 2006 on LaFace Records. It also serves as the soundtrack album to the duo's musical film of the same name, released by Universal Pictures in August 2006. Containing themes relating to the music industry, the album also features songs not included in the film and incorporates blues, R&B, jazz, and soul musical elements.
The album debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 196,000 copies in its first week. It achieved minimal international charting and produced five singles that attained moderate "Billboard" chart success. Despite mixed criticism towards its unconventional musical style and loose thematic structure, "Idlewild" received positive reviews from most music critics upon its release. The album has been certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of one million copies in the United States.
Music.
Though less a soundtrack and more of a companion album, the "Idlewild" album features seven songs from the "Idlewild" film: "Chronomentrophobia", "Makes No Sense at All", "PJ and Rooster", "Greatest Show on Earth", "When I Look in Your Eyes", and, from the end credits, "Morris Brown". Two snippets of film dialogue are also included on the album as interludes. The rest of the songs performed in the film were included on the earlier OutKast LPs "Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast" and "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below". In an interview for "Billboard", Big Boi stated "This is an OutKast album. It isn't like a soundtrack where we go get this person or that person".
The first single of the album, "Mighty 'O'", features both André 3000 and Big Boi; the song takes its lyrical hook from the Cab Calloway song "Minnie the Moocher" ("Mighty-ighty-ighty O") and seems to be an example of the album's mix of hip hop and more traditional American jazz and blues. Next, similar to previous OutKast albums such as "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below", two singles—one solely by Big Boi, the other solely by André 3000—were released simultaneously. The second single, almost exclusively featuring Big Boi, is the marching band–influenced "Morris Brown", featuring guest artists Sleepy Brown and Scar, both artists on Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. The song's title is a reference to Atlanta's Morris Brown College, with the school's marching band providing the instrumentation.
The third single, André 3000's "Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)" delves into the blues genre, complete with a blues-style acoustic guitar riff and a harmonica element reminiscent of "Aquemini" single "Rosa Parks". In tune with the film, "Idlewild" reflects OutKast's original style tempered by 1930s influences. The fourth single, "Hollywood Divorce" was released in November 2006, and features verses from Lil' Wayne and Snoop Dogg and is produced by André 3000.
Commercial performance.
Originally planned for early 2005, "Idlewild"s release date was pushed to December 2005, before being delayed into 2006. The album debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" 200 chart with first-week sales of 196,000 copies. It also entered at number one on "Billboard"s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, at number one on the Top Rap Albums, and at number two on the Top Digital Albums chart. The album dropped to number seven on the "Billboard" 200, selling 78,000 copies in its second week. It spent nine weeks on the "Billboard" 200. In the United Kingdom, "Idlewild" debuted at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. It fell to number 28 in its second week on the chart. While it charted wihin the top-twenty in several other countries, the album spent a minimal amount of weeks on most charts. 
On August 26, 2006, the album was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America, following shipments in excess of one million copies in the United States. It was certified gold in sales by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in November 2006.
Critical reception.
"Idlewild" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 30 reviews. "Q" called it "a dazzling album", while Ben Williams of "New York" found it "entertaining and surprisingly consistent". "The Guardian"s Alexis Petridis wrote that it "bulges with brilliant ideas... Ambitious but flawed, at turns stunning, maddening and confusing". "NME" magazine's Dan Martin praised its "uneven and self-indulgent" style. Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" compared "Idlewild" to Prince's "Parade" (1986), while praising its "deeply eccentric richness" and calling it "so suave on the surface, it takes a few spins to absorb how radical it is". Although she felt it lacked cohesion and a "clear message", Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" found the album "sonically challenging and lyrically wide-ranging", including songs for "contemplation and booty-shaking". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau called "Idlewild" "a joyous mishmash" and praised each OutKast-member's distinct performance: "from the mainstream hip-hop Big Boi articulates with so much muscle to the retro swing Andre sings just fine, they sound happy to parade their mastery". "Uncut" described it as "Stylish and substantial, it's a deft masterpastiche that dissolves history for its own entertainment". "Mojo" stated, "Every time you think you've got Idlewild figured out, it zips off in a totally unexpected new direction".
In a negative review for the "Chicago Sun-Times", Jim DeRogatis viewed the album as unfocused and stated, "it's all about heavy-handed, faux Scott Joplin ragtime piano; showy but lame Cab Calloway horn arrangements; fake Rudy Vallee crooning (courtesy of Benjamin's nasal, off-key whine) and ultra-hammy vaudeville shucking and jiving". "The Washington Post"s J. Freedom du Lac noted a "creative schism" in the duo and wrote, "For all of its flashes of greatness -- the brassy marching-band rap of 'Morris Brown', the psychedelic hip-hop flashback 'Train', the Stevie Wonder-inspired acoustic blues number 'Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)' -- the staggeringly eclectic 'Idlewild' includes too much filler and too many outright stink bombs to deserve a place alongside the best pop offerings of 2006, let alone "Aquemini", et al". Preston Jones of Slant Magazine called it "frustrating, uneven, and strained ... an interesting failure". "Spin" magazine's Charles Aaron called it "a perplexing album", despite how it "grasps for a distinctive sound, departing almost entirely from rap per se" in favor of music from "the jazz/jump blues from the film's '30s/40's demimonde, as well as shades of Prince's most fitfully eclectic periods".

<doc id="2892605" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892605" title="Battle of Palkhed">
Battle of Palkhed

The Battle of Palkhed was fought on February 28, 1728 at the village of Palkhed, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra, India between the Maratha "Peshwa", Baji Rao I and the "Nizam-ul-Mulk" of Hyderabad. The Marathas defeated the Nizam.
The battle is considered an example of brilliant execution of military strategy.
Background.
The seeds of this battle go to the year 1713, when Maratha King Shahu, appointed Balaji Vishwanath as his "Peshwa" or Prime Minister. Within a decade, Balaji had managed to extract a significant amount of territory and wealth from the fragmenting Mughal Empire. In October 1724, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Nizam-ul-Mulk as the Governor of Deccan.
The Nizam set about strengthening the province by attempting to control the growing influence of the Marathas. He utilized a growing polarization in the Maratha Empire due to the claim of the title of King by both Shahu and Sambhaji II of Kolhapur. The Nizam began supporting the Sambhaji faction, which enraged Shahu who had been proclaimed as King. The Nizam further decided to halt the payment of a 25% of the revenue being given by many landowners of the Deccan province to the Marathas, as had been agreed by the Syed Brothers in 1719.
Battle.
The battle plan was set by the withdrawal of Baji Rao's army from the southern reaches of the Maratha empire during May 1727. This was followed by Shahu breaking off negotiations with the Nizam-ul-Mulk about restoration of the chauth.
The Nizam pursued Baji Rao's army around the vicinity of Pune for about six months, where Baji Rao executed a series of thrust and parry moves to finally corner the Nizam at Palkhed.
The Campaign.
The Palkhed campaign of 1728, is notable for two reasons. First, this campaign has been chosen as brilliant in strategy ("A masterpiece of strategic mobility...") by Field Marshal Montgomery in his book, "A History of Warfare". Whether this was a completely pre-planned strategy, or clever improvization in response to circumstances, is not known. Secondly, the success of this campaign established the Maratha supremacy in the Deccan – and gave way for further adventures.
It also ensured the handover of the claim of the chauth and sardeshmukhi from Nizam-ul-Mulk to the Shahu.
Various factors contributed to the campaign of Palkhed:
Event.
Baji Rao and the Maratha armies were called back from the south, from the Karnataka campaign. In May 1727, Baji Rao then asked Shahu to break of negotiations with the Nizam-ul-Mulk (Nizam-ul-Mulk had called for an arbitration over the payment of the chauth and sardeshmukhi) and started mobilizing an army. With the monsoons over and the land ready for this exciting campaign, Baji Rao moved towards Aurangabad.
After a skirmish near Jalna (the Marathas by now had become famous for their strategy of not engaging with the enemy) with Iwaz Khan (the General of Nizam-ul-Mulk), as could have been predicted, Baji Rao moved away from the battlefield, towards Burhanpur.
Nizam-ul-Mulk’s army pursued Baji Rao. Baji Rao then moved westwards to Gujarat from North Khandesh. However, the Nizam-ul-Mulk gave up the pursuit and moved southward towards Pune. This is an interesting reason and comparison between how the two armies functioned. The Nizam is known to have carried huge armies with him, including supplies to last for the duration of the campaign. In fact, the Nizam used to carry his jenana or womenfolk with him during his campaigns. The Maratha armies however were very light and found supplies on the way by plundering and looting out-posts on the way.
As Nizam-ul-Mulk left the pursuit of Baji Rao and moved towards the headquarters of the Shahu stronghold, posts like Udapur, Avasari, Pabal, Khed, and Narayangarh surrendered to Nizam-ul-Mulk, who then occupied Pune and advanced towards Supa, Patas, and Baramati.
In Baramati, Nizam-ul-Mulk got news of Baji Rao moving towards Aurangabad. Nizam-ul-Mulk began moving northwards to intercept the Maratha Army. By this time he was confident of crushing Baji Rao and his army. It was not to happen so. The Raja of Kolhapur, Shambhaji (not to be confused with Sambhaji, son of Shivaji) refused to join him in this campaign against Baji Rao. Nizam-ul-Mulk was cornered in a waterless tract near Palkhed of 25 February 1728. Nizam-ul-Mulk’s army refused to fight. Through Iwaz Khan, the Nizam-ul-Mulk sent out word of his plight, and his army was allowed to move to the vicinity of the river.
Outcome.
The Nizam was defeated by the Marathas, and signed a peace treaty on March 6, 1728 at the village of Mungi-Paithan.()
By the treaty of Munji Shivagaon, the Nizam was forced to make certain concessions.

<doc id="2892625" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892625" title="Alex Odeh">
Alex Odeh

Alex Odeh (April 4, 1944 – October 11, 1985) was an Arab-American (specifically, Palestinian American) anti-discrimination activist who was killed in a bombing as he opened the door of his office at 1905 East 17th Street, Santa Ana, California. Odeh was west-coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).
Life and murder.
Born into a Palestinian Christian (Latin rite Catholic) family in Jifna, the West Bank, Odeh immigrated to the United States in 1972. He was a lecturer and poet who had published a volume of his poetry, "Whispers in Exile."
The Boston office of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee suffered a bombing on August 16, 1985, injuring two officers. The Santa Ana bombing came the day after the ending of the Palestine Liberation Front–sponsored Achille Lauro attack in which Jewish American Leon Klinghoffer was killed. The night before his death Odeh denied to the media that the PLO was involved in the hijacking and portrayed Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat as being ready to make peace. The day of his murder he had been scheduled to speak at Friday prayer services at a synagogue in Fountain Valley, California.
Shortly before his killing, Odeh appeared on the television show "Nightline". The program featured a back-and-forth between Odeh and a representative from the Jewish Defense League, a Jewish armed militant organization which has been characterized by the FBI as a terrorist group involved in numerous attacks within the United States.
Reaction to murder.
The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both condemned the murder. United States President Ronald Reagan sent a message of regret.
Irv Rubin, who had become chairman of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) the same year, immediately made several public statements in reaction to the incident. "I have no tears for Mr. Odeh," Rubin said. "He got exactly what he deserved." He also said: "My tears were used up crying for Leon Klinghoffer."
Criminal investigation.
Four weeks after Odeh's death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. Rubin criticized the FBI for implying his organization's guilt without evidence, saying the FBI "could take their possible link and shove it." In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. In July they eased away from their original position, saying the JDL was "probably" responsible for this attack and four others, but that final attribution to the JDL or any other group "must await further investigation." Rubin again denied the JDL's involvement. "What the FBI is doing is simple," he stated, "Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase "Never Again", ... and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That's tragic." The JDL denied any involvement in Odeh's killing.
Immediately after the 1985 assassination the FBI identified three suspects, all of them believed to be affiliated with the JDL, who fled to Israel. Floyd Clarke, then assistant director of the FBI, claimed in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in Kiryat Arba, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. In 1988, the FBI arrested Rochelle Manning as a suspect in a mail bombing which killed a secretary, Patricia Wilkerson, in Manhattan Beach, California. It also charged her husband, Robert Manning, who they considered a prime suspect in the Odeh bombing. Manning had previously been convicted of a 1972 bombing of the home of an Arab activist in Hollywood, and was a suspect in three other bombings in 1985, one of which killed a Neo-Nazi. Both Rochelle and Robert Manning were members of the JDL. Rochelle's jury deadlocked, and after the mistrial she left for Israel to join her husband. The U.S. government requested Manning's extradition in 1991. After an unsuccessful two-year legal battle in the Israeli courts to prevent his extradition, Manning was extradited in 1993.
In April 1994, the Alex Odeh Memorial Statue, created by Algerian-American sculptor Khalil Bendib, was erected in front of the Santa Ana Central Library over protests by the Jewish Defense League. On October 11, 1996, the eleventh anniversary of his murder, vandals defaced the statue. On February 6, 1997 vandals poured two gallons of red paint on the statue. JDL chairman Irv Rubin commented: “I think the guy is a war criminal.” The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called for greater government efforts to catch Odeh's killers.
On August 27, 1996, the FBI announced a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Odeh’s killers. JDL members heckled the FBI spokespersons announcing the reward. The reward is still in force.
In 2006 following the disclosure of the Death of Earl Krugel by White Supremacist David Jennings at FCI Phoenix, former Federal Prisoner, John Mauritz Hummasti, a former US Customs informant and US Dept. of Homeland Security informant who is an Orthodox Jew that studied Judaism with Robert Steven Manning at USP Florence and USP Lompoc filed a RICO Civil Action in Oregon US District Court, Hummasti v. Ali, 06-1710-BR (March 2009) and on 12/06/2007 Hummasti requested Witness Security by formal Motion (Docket No's 77 and 79) to the US District Court, which was denied as such requests are in the sole discretion of the US Attorney's Office whether to grant or deny such requests. <http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16816878421676194870&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr>
Following the Oregon State Bar's 2012 suspension of appointed Counsel, Milo Petranovich and Petranovich's July 2012 resignation and surrender of his license to practice law in California, Hummasti moved the US District Court for an Order appointing new counsel and an Order for Safe Passage to and from Israel along with a renewed Motion for Witness Security which the US District Court denied (Docket 168). <https://www.osbar.org/publications/bulletin/12febmar/baractions.html>
In September 2012 Hummasti contacted Congressman Issa by formal letter concerning the Odeh case and the request for witness security and Hummasti's attempts to collect the reward offered by the FBI in the Odeh case. That letter has been unanswered by Congressman Issa.
In December 2012 after making multiple requests to speak with the ATF and FBI in Los Angeles, Hummasti was finally interviewed by FBI Field Agent Tony Bass about the Alex Odeh murder and Manning's admitted involvement in "going around bombing Mosques and Islamic Centers and killing Arabs" as the reason Manning was extradited from Israel. During the December 2012 interview by Agent Bass, Hummasti and Bass discussed the reward offered in the Odeh investigation. Hummasti has heard nothing from the US Dept. of Justice concerning the reward or any follow-up inquiries about Manning's involvement in the Odeh murder. The US and State Courts and the US Justice Dept. seem uninterested in resolving the Odeh investigation. see Hummasti's YouTube video here: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDenSkC0p24>
In 2007, the FBI revealed they had received information from a deceased informant, believed to be former Jewish Defense League member Earl Krugel who had been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for 2001 plots to bomb a Southern California mosque and office of an Arab American congressman. It is believed that Irv Rubin, who died in prison while awaiting trial on the same charges, revealed to Krugel the names of those responsible for Odeh’s death and Krugel shared those with the FBI before he, too, died in prison. The bombers are believed to be Manning and two other JDL activists; Keith Fuchs and Andy Green, who also fled to Israel and are believed to be living in Kiryat Arba.
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee continues to honor Odeh’s memory and call for prosecution of his killers.

The Rangers began play in the season and won a division title in their first season of existence and a Stanley Cup against the Montreal Maroons in their second. They would win two more Cups in and , defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs both times.
During the season, the mortgage on the Rangers' home arena, the third Madison Square Garden (built in 1925), was paid off. Hence, the management of the Madison Square Garden Corporation symbolically burned the mortgage in the bowl of the Cup. This led some hockey fans to believe that the Cup, which is regarded almost as a sacred object, had been "desecrated", leading the "hockey gods" to place a curse on the Rangers.
Another theory is that the supposed curse came from Red Dutton, the coach and general manager of the New York Americans, for whom he had once played. The Amerks were actually the first NHL team to play in New York City, beginning play as soon as the Garden opened for the season. However, their original owner, bootlegger Bill Dwyer, found the going difficult with the end of Prohibition, and the NHL took over ownership of the team in 1937. They made five playoff appearances, including a quarterfinal loss to the Rangers in and a quarterfinal win over the Rangers in . However, after beating the Rangers, the Amerks fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Black Hawks in the 1938 semifinals, the closest they ever came to winning the Cup.
Following the season, many NHL players entered the armed forces to fight in World War II. This hurt the Americans more than the other teams, and so Dutton announced his team would suspend operations for the duration of the war. He was named NHL President upon the death of Frank Calder in 1943, a post he held until 1946, when he resigned and was replaced by Clarence Campbell.
Dutton had resigned the league presidency with the intention of reviving the Amerks. However, the league, with the encouragement of Garden management, reneged on a longstanding promise to allow the Amerks to return. A bitter Dutton declared that the Rangers would never win the Cup for as long as he lived. He died in 1987 at 88. At that time, the Rangers were in their 47th season without having won the Cup.
The Curse of 1940 "worked" in several ways, some of them odd. The Madison Square Garden Corporation found it could make more money when Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus came to town in the spring. This forced the Rangers, and later the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks, to use different arenas at the worst possible time – during their respective leagues' playoffs. At the time, it was not possible to configure arenas in a way that would allow a circus and a hockey or basketball game to take place on the same day. Hence, the Rangers used Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto as their "home ice" in the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals, a move that potentially cost the Rangers that year's Stanley Cup. After the Blueshirts took a 3-2 series lead on the Wings, the NHL cited an obscure rule stating that the deciding game in a Stanley Cup Final could not be played on neutral ice. Maple Leaf Gardens was labelled "neutral" because its tenants proper were the Leafs, and Madison Square Garden was still occupied by the circus at the time. The Detroit Olympia was thus the venue for the sixth (although the Rangers were to be designated the "home" team for that match) and seventh games, both of which were won by Detroit.
Also, while Dutton was the league president, he oversaw a 1943–44 Rangers team that inherited the title the Americans left behind upon their folding of hardest-hit NHL team by World War II. The Rangers asked the NHL for permission to fold until the end of the war because of their best players' service in the armed forces overseas — a request Dutton himself had neglected to make before his own team ceased operations, as he had simply folded the Americans franchise. The Dutton-controlled NHL did not honor the Rangers' request, and so they finished well back of the other five teams that year, with career minor-league goaltender Ken McAuley giving up 310 goals in the team's 50 games, a league record for worst goals-against-average that has stood ever since. The closest any goalie since has come to equalling this record is Greg Millen, whose 4.70 GAA came from allowing 282 goals in 60 games for the Hartford Whalers forty seasons later.
League corruption and favoritism through the entire Original Six era was also a factor in the Rangers' futility. James E. Norris, the owner of the Detroit Red Wings, at one point also owned controlling stakes in both the Rangers and the Chicago Blackhawks, allowing him to stack the best players onto the Red Wings. This continued after the elder Norris's death, as his two sons, James D. Norris and Bruce Norris, continued to control the three teams. During this time, the NHL still held territorial drafts, in which teams would get first rights to players who played junior hockey within a 50-mile radius of the home stadium; this gave Toronto, Detroit and Montreal significant recruiting advantages, since the areas around those cities were far more developed in their junior hockey programs than those further from the Canadian border, including the Rangers.
The Islanders.
The Rangers struggled for several years after World War II; after their 1950 Finals appearance they only made the playoffs six times in 17 seasons. In 1972, they reached the Stanley Cup Finals again, only to lose to the Boston Bruins of Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito. The next season began with the founding of an expansion team playing on Long Island, the New York Islanders. In , the Islanders qualified for the playoffs for the first time and defeated the Rangers. The two teams squared off again in , this time with the Rangers emerging victorious. They went on to lose the 1979 Cup Finals to the Montreal Canadiens, who claimed their fourth Stanley Cup in a row.
The Islanders won the Stanley Cup for the first time in , beginning their own streak of four consecutive championships, one more than the Rangers had won in their entire 57-year history to that point (after 1983 the Isles had only existed for 11 years). During the Islanders' second Cup run, in , the Islanders swept the Rangers in the second round. During that series, fans of the younger franchise taunted the Rangers by chanting "1940!" This chant caught on around the league. It was also in the 1980s that the idea of a "Curse of 1940" began to take hold, with Red Dutton's death in 1987 and the occasional publication of the photograph of the Garden mortgage being burned in the Cup's bowl (the third Garden was demolished after the Rangers and Knicks moved into the current Garden in 1968). Also, in 1982, the Colorado Rockies moved to suburban East Rutherford, New Jersey and became the New Jersey Devils, giving the Rangers a second rival in the New York metropolitan area.
In , the Rangers finished with the best overall record in the NHL, earning them their first of two Presidents' Trophies, but they lost to the defending Cup champion (and eventual champions) Pittsburgh Penguins in the Patrick Division Finals. Although the Penguins were defending champions, and their victory was hardly a shocking one, an odd moment came when Rangers goaltender Mike Richter allowed a shot from the blue line by Pittsburgh's Ron Francis by him. The next season, with hopes high, the Rangers finished last in the Patrick Division, largely because of an injury to defenseman Brian Leetch. In the kind of incident many fans ascribe to curses, Leetch arrived at the Garden in a taxi, stepped out, and broke his ankle when he slipped on a patch of ice, a most ironic injury for a hockey player.
End of the Curse.
By , the Rangers had not won the Stanley Cup in 54 years. In that time, championships had been won in the New York area by the Islanders (four), the New York Yankees (fourteen), the New York Mets (two), the New York Giants baseball team (one, and they had been in San Francisco since 1958), the Brooklyn Dodgers (one, and they had been in Los Angeles since 1958), the New York Giants football team (three), the New York Jets (one), the New York Knicks (two NBA titles) and the New Jersey Nets (two ABA titles, playing as the New York Nets). All five of the other Original Six teams collected Stanley Cups since 1940: the Canadiens 20 times, including the previous year; the Maple Leafs 10 times, but none since ; Detroit five times, but none since ; Boston three times, but none since , and the Black Hawks once, in .
The Rangers stormed through the 1993–94 regular season, scoring 112 points en route to clinching their second Presidents' Trophy in three years. They swept aside the Islanders in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the Washington Capitals in five games in the second round before meeting the Devils (whom they had beaten in the 1992 Patrick Division Semifinals) in the Eastern Conference Finals. Devils fans had picked up the "1940!" chant and the curse myth from Islander fans, and curiously, the hockey seating capacity of the Devils' home arena, the Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed the Continental Airlines Arena and then Izod Center), was 19,040. With the Rangers trailing the series three games to two and facing elimination, it looked as though the curse was at work again. However, Rangers captain Mark Messier challenged the New York media by offering a "guaranteed" win in Game 6: "We know we're going in there to win Game 6 and bringing it back for Game 7. We feel we can win it and we feel we are going to win it." "The New York Post" and "The New York Daily News" both carried back pages offering Messier's guarantee: "We'll Win Tonight." Rangers' coach Mike Keenan said of the guarantee: "Mark was sending a message to his teammates that he believed together we could win. He put on an amazing performance to make sure it happened."
The Rangers quickly fell behind 2-0, but trailing 2-1 in the third period, Messier scored a natural hat trick (three straight goals) to make good on his guarantee and force a deciding seventh game. The curse threatened again in Game 7 as the Rangers led 1-0 and looked as though they were about to advance to the Cup Finals when New Jersey's Valeri Zelepukin scored with 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game. But in the second overtime, Stephane Matteau scored to give the Rangers the game and the series.
The Rangers moved on to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Vancouver Canucks and took a 3-2 lead late in the third period of the deciding seventh game. They shot the puck down the length of the ice with seven seconds left. Thinking the game was over, the Rangers poured onto the ice celebration. However, the Canucks touched the puck to stop play with 1.1 seconds left in regulation. The officials reset the clock to 1.6 seconds and ordered a faceoff in the Rangers' zone. Messier and Craig MacTavish conferred and came up with a gambit to ensure the Rangers' win. Both of them, deciding that the officials wouldn't call a penalty at such a dramatic moment, committed fouls on the final drop of the puck as first Messier, then MacTavish whacked and cross-checked Vancouver's star forward Pavel Bure.
The CBC broadcast of Game 7 attracted an average Canadian audience of 4.957 million viewers, making it the most-watched CBC Sports program in history at the time, a record since eclipsed by the men's ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2002 Winter Olympics, when Canada won its first Olympic ice hockey gold medal since the 1952 Winter Olympics, which drew 10.6 million. CBC commentator Bob Cole, who called both games, said that Game 7 was one of his most memorable TV games.

Music of Your Life

Music of Your Life is a syndicated music radio network delivered over the Internet to AM/FM and HD radio stations across the United States using the Barix distribution system. Created by record executive and jingle writer Al Ham, and now under the direction of Marc Angell, Music of Your Life has been in continuous operation since 1978. On January 26, 2012 it was announced that starting on Feb. 1, stations owned by Multicultural Broadcasting in the Top 20 markets would be running Music of Your Life from 6 PM to 6 AM.
The format is hosted by well-known celebrity DJs including TV game show host and singer/entertainer Peter Marshall. Other on-air personalities include Lorri Hafer (a recording artist and member of the Hillside Singers who is also the daughter of the format's founder, Al Ham), Al Hardee, Johnny Magnus, singer Steve March Torme, son of legendary entertainer Mel Torme, and Telarc Records artist Tony DeSare.
Over the years, the Radio Network has featured a "Stars Play the Stars" on-air lineup that has included such well recognized talent as TV game show host Wink Martindale, Gary Owens from "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In" and 1950s pop superstar Patti Page, as well as Southern California broadcasting's Chuck Southcott. A typical hour of music may include a wide variety of artists, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Dean Martin, Nat King Cole to Tony Bennett and Ella Fitzgerald to Michael Bublé, Norah Jones, Harry Connick Jr. and Jamie Cullum, to pop songs by artists like The Beatles, The Association, Petula Clark, Elvis Presley, The Carpenters and Neil Diamond.
History.
Al Ham, a veteran recording executive, decided to change careers in 1978. First he took time off from actual work, moving from New York City to Huntington, Connecticut. Realizing that many of the songs he liked could not be heard on the radio, he decided to give the many fans of nostalgia/big band music what they wanted to hear. Ham approached Dick Ferguson, general manager of Bridgeport, Connecticut radio station WDJZ, about changing the format. Ferguson agreed, and positive results followed. Ham continued to work toward improving the format, including asking listeners to submit a list of three favorite songs. With thousands of responses, Ham put together a list of 20,000 songs and "Music of Your Life" was born.
That same year, 1978, the name "Music of Your Life" was trademarked, the only radio format to do this. In fact, the original Music of Your Life jingle is one of the first sound recordings to be trademarked along with the 3-note NBC jingle.
Because the target audience of this music was listeners over 50, Ham had difficulty selling the idea of syndication. Finally Jim West listened. West and Ham had both played bass, West in Las Vegas, and Ham in the orchestras of Tex Beneke and Artie Shaw. Both men wanted to see their favorite music on the radio again.
Together, they convinced Bob Lappin of WMAS in Springfield, Massachusetts (now WHLL) to play the music. After a year, the format had three stations. But the success of the format attracted many more affiliates. The original format consisted primarily of big hits by standards artists like Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, Andy Williams, McGuire Sisters, Four Aces, Perry Como, Mel Torme, Lena Horne, Tony Bennett, Nat "King" Cole, Patti Page, Johnny Mathis, Barbra Streisand, Mills Brothers, among others. Also, groups from the Big Band era of the 1930s and 1940s were played several times an hour, which included such artists Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, among many others. The format also played a very limited selection of baby boomer pop. Most of these artists were quazi rock and rollers such as Connie Francis, Ray Charles, Pat Boone, Bobby Vinton, Platters, Bobby Darin, Tom Jones, and others. They played only a few songs by artists like Neil Diamond, Barry Manilow, and Elvis Presley. More of this music would be added in the late 1990s.
Ham put the best of his music on reel-to-reel tapes and used a scheduling method called matched-flow sequencing, which arranged songs according to regular chord progressions. The scheduling worked by giving local DJs a regular formula to employ. For example, one could play a song from Tape A then follow with a song from Tape C, but not from Tapes B or D. Ham's strategy worked very well. Most radio stations reported that people listened for 3 hours. Ham's stations achieved numbers four to five times that amount. More and more stations joined the network during the 1980s. Another strategy developed by Ham was having recorded messages by the very stars being played, such as, "Hi, this is Tony Bennett, and I'd like to thank you for making the music of my life, The Music of Your Life." Then Ham, known for the State Farm commercials, added a theme song which the great stars also recorded.
An early success came when the format began simulcasting in Atlanta in early 1983 on Joy AM/FM (WJYA). It was the first 100,000 watt FM to carry the Music of Your Life in a major U.S. market. Under the direction of veteran broadcaster Rick Ellis, the FM predominantly covered the metropolitan Atlanta and middle-Georgia market while the AM reached the northern suburbs. Featuring the legendary John Moore of WSB-AM fame in the mornings, the ratings initially reached a modest 2.1 overall share but in the key demographics of 35+ it was rated firmly in the top five. Beyond on-air success, the music was extensively promoted through weekly tea dances in large venues and live performances of the traveling big bands and artists such as The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Rosemary Clooney, Benny Goodman, Harry James, and many others. The highlight was the final performance of "Woody Herman and the Traveling Heard" at the Atlanta Galleria with a crowd of more than 2,500. Eventually the format was changed when the stations were sold by the New York investment group in 2006.
By this time competing satellite networks of radio stations began. Stardust (later Timeless by ABC Radio) and AM Only (now Dial Global's "Adult Standards," a/k/a "America's Best Music"). Ham and West had to take advantage of the new technology in order to remain successful. Unistar Radio Networks, which distributed AM Only, bought a majority interest in Music of Your Life and made it a satellite format in 1990.
Unfortunately, the new distributors of Music of Your Life wanted listeners in the 25 to 54 age group (the most desired audience for advertisers), while the music had been designed for listeners over 50. Ham, who had wanted to retire, had to take over once again. He realized that as Americans aged, perhaps advertisers would take an interest in the older audience once again. Ham redesigned the music, since someone 50 years old in the 1990s would be of a different generation than the 50-year-old he targeted in 1978.
One major development that showed promise for the format was performers such as Tony Bennett showing up on MTV. Also, younger artists such as Harry Connick, Jr. were making the music popular with young people. Films such as "Sleepless in Seattle", and a number of commercials, had used the music found in the adult standards format.
When Frank Sinatra died in 1998, Music of Your Life played 36 straight hours of his music. Since more people listened to this special programming than to what the format usually aired, the popularity of the music with a new audience was reinforced.
Within a few years, there were nearly 200 stations, including WGUL in the Tampa market, whose chairman Carl Marcocci held the same position with Music of Your Life. Affiliates were learning that going after over-50 listeners was nothing to be ashamed of; these people were active and had lots of money to spend, and advertisers could reach them if they just made the effort. One of the most successful was KGIL in Los Angeles. Other success stories included WLUX in Long Island. 
Part of the format's success was adding more contemporary artists such as Beatles, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Rod Stewart and Beach Boys, as well as swing bands such as the Brian Setzer Orchestra and the Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra. 
One of MYL's on-air slogans is "Where the Stars Play the Stars", featuring well-recognized personalities such as Wink Martindale, Gary Owens, Peter Marshall, Pat Boone and Patti Page serving as DJ's, and other performers featured on "Celebrity Weekend" including Steve Allen, Lou Rawls, Glen Campbell, Shirley Jones and Marty Ingels.
In 2005, Music of Your Life, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent with entrepreneur Marc Angell to acquire the assets of Music of Your Life - including its Music of Your Life brand and affiliates. Angell brought-in his own production and technical team, made programming and talent changes and set-out to rebuild the Music of Your Life brand. Despite a recessive economy and a faltering industry in general, Music of Your Life quadrupled its affiliate base in just two years to more than 50 AM and FM and HD radio station affiliates across the US.
Combined with a steady stream of new recordings from singers of the Great American Songbook such as Jamie Cullum, Monica Mancini, Renee Olstead, Nikki Yanovski, Tony DeSare, Jane Monheit and a fifth installment from Rod Stewart, Music of Your Life is succeeding once again. The current on-air team is made up of entertainer Peter Marshall, best known as the former host of "Hollywood Squares"; Steve March-Torme, son of Mel Torme; record producer and big-band leader, Les Brown Jr.; Telarc recording sensation, Tony DeSare; Lorri Hafer, singer and daughter of MOYL founder Al Ham; radio vet Al Hardee, and Marc Angell.
In 2013, Marc Angell formed Music of Your Life, Inc. and took the company public under the ticker symbol "MYLI". In a 10-Q declaration in early 2014, Angell stated the publicly traded company was looking for financing, as the company had few monetary assets, and continued to lose money, due to a soft economy and slow recovery. In its SEC forms, they indicate that there is no guarantee that this company can continue to operate in the future. The Company is currently broadcasting 24 hours a day via the iRadio platform. Music of Your Life acquired the iRadio trademark in January 2014 and announced plans to expand their programming to include country, rock, pop, and other contermporary music formats, all featuring celebrity DJ's.

Acquackanonk Township, New Jersey

Acquackanonk Township was a township that existed in New Jersey, United States, from 1693 until 1917, first in Essex County and then in Passaic County.
History.
The land on which the town was situated was at one time owned by the Surveyor General of New Netherland Jacques Cortelyou, some "12,000 morgens at Aquackanonk on the Passaic, purchased by himself and associates of the Indians." It was first settled in 1678 by Dutch traders, who in 1693 formed a Dutch Reformed congregation.
The township was first formed on October 31, 1693, by the British in the newly established Province of New Jersey together with New Barbadoes Township, and was located in what was then the northern part of Essex County on the Passaic River. New Barbadoes Township became part of Bergen County in 1710, with Acquackanonk still part of Essex County. On February 21, 1798, Acquackanonk was incorporated as one of the initial group of 104 townships in the state of New Jersey. On February 7, 1837, Passaic County was created, incorporating the township and other portions of both Bergen County and Essex County. Over the years portions of the township were taken to create (or add to the territory of) Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now Fairfield Township), Paterson Township (April 11, 1831), Little Falls (April 2, 1868), Passaic village (created within the township on March 10, 1869, and independent from the township as of March 21, 1871), Paterson (1869) and Montclair (1907). The township became defunct on April 26, 1917, with the creation of Clifton.
Acquackanonk tribe.
The Acquackanonk were a Lenape group who spoke the same Algonquian language dialect and shared the same totem (turtle) as the neighboring Hackensack and Tappan. They were so called by the exonym by the New Netherlanders, who commonly referred to the people by the indigenous word for their territory. The name may mean "a place in a rapid stream where fishing is done with a net". 
Alternatively, "at the lamprey stream" from contemporary "axkwaakahnung" (spellings include Achquakanonk, Acquackanonk) Lastly it may mean "where gum blocks were made for pounding corn".
"Ackquekenon" was the spelling used by European explorer Jasper Danckaerts in 1679 describe his visit there.
Passaic River crossing.
A crossing of the Passaic River at Acquackanonk was first created in the colonial era, and was burned during Washington's 1776 great retreat from Fort Lee. Today's Gregory Avenue Bridge was built on a slightly different alignment.

Sula Islands

The Sula Islands (Indonesian: "Kepulauan Sula") are a group of islands in North Maluku in Indonesia. Its three main islands are Mangole, Sanana (officially Sula Besi or Xulla Besi) and Taliabu, with smaller islands Lifamatola and Seho. Until 2013 the whole group was administered as Sula Archipelago Regency ("Kabupaten Kepulauan Sula"), with its administrative capital at Sanana on the island of the same name; its area is 9,632.92 km2 and population 132,070 (at the 2010 census). However in 2013 Taliabu Island was separated from Kepulauan Sula Regency and formed into a new Regency.
Pre-Indonesian Independence saw the Sula Islands also known as the Xulla Islands, with Taliabo as Xulla Taliabo, Sanana as Xulla Bessi, and Mangola as Xulla Mangola.
Administration.
Following the removal of 7 districts to create a separate Taliabu Island Regency ("Pulau Taliabu") in 2013, the residual Sula Archipelago Regency was divided into 12 districts ("kecamatan"), tabulated below with their 2010 Census population.
History.
The Dutch built a fort on Sanana in 1652. Wallace visited the islands during an ornithological expedition in 1862.
Economy.
According to government data Sula Islands District's food crops include vegetables, groundnuts, cassava, sweet potatoes, durian, mangosteen and mango. As of 2005 the area of agriculturally active land was 24743.56 hectares with production amounting to 33,608.62 tons per year. Taliabu-Sanana District is the main producer of cloves, nutmeg, cocoa, copra and other coconut products. Fishery production is very diverse with and estimated sustainable potential of 40,273.91 tonnes per year of which only 22.8 percent is currently exploited. Forestry is considered a potential industry with the natural forest-based Classification Map TGHK RTRWP suggesting a forest area of 471,951.53 hectares, but much of this is protected or hard to access, due to steep slopes and transportation logistics, and the islands' main plywood company, PT Barito Pacific Timber Group (in Falabisahaya, West Mangole) has closed. Industrial activity is very limited. There is a gold mine in East Mangoli District (at Waitina and Kawata) and coal mines are located in the peninsula of West Sula Besi District, East Taliabu and Sub Sanana (Wai Village Ipa). Reserves of coal are estimated around 10.4 million tonnes.
Fauna.
The following species are native to the Sula Islands:

<doc id="2892645" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2892645" title="Instantiation principle">
Instantiation principle

The principle of instantiation or principle of exemplification is the concept in metaphysics and logic that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified properties (or universals). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object. Aristotle is well known for endorsing the principle and Plato for denying it.
Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the Principle of Instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly (and assuming objects are colored), if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.
Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as "in re" realists or "immanent realists".

Mattafix

Mattafix was a UK duo, made up of Marlon Roudette and Preetesh Hirji. Their sound is a fusion of hip hop/rap, R&B, reggae, dancehall, blues, jazz, soul and world. Best known for their 2005 hit single "Big City Life", they won the Sopot International Song Festival in 2006.
Biography.
Marlon McVey-Roudette was born in London and is the son of Cameron McVey, a British music producer, and Vonnie Roudette, a designer and artist from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. As a young child he moved with his mother and sister to St. Vincent, where he began his music career, and returned to London when he was 18. Preetesh Hirji was born in London of dual-Indian parentage and grew up in the heart of West London, where he started at Eastcote Studios on Kensal Road.
"Signs of a Struggle" (2005-06).
Mattafix released their first single, "11.30 (Dirtiest Trick in Town)", as a limited edition on Buddhist Punk Records on 13 January 2005. However, the song never charted.
Their second single, "Big City Life", was released by EMI on 8 August 2005. 
It was a considerable hit, managing a number 15 in the United Kingdom and a number 1 in Germany, Poland, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and New Zealand.
It also had considerable success in other European countries where it reached the top 20. It can also be heard on the soundtrack to the hit video game FIFA World Cup Germany 2006, designed by EA Sports, and was included in the "NOW! 62" UK compilation, the duo's first and only song to date, to be included in the series.
"Signs of a Struggle" received positive reviews and had success in Europe where the band toured extensively throughout 2006-08.
"Signs of a Struggle" was a Triple J feature album in April 2006.
The duo toured with the likes of Jem and Joss Stone on their UK tours to promote the album, and have also opened for Sting, in Milan, before a crowd of more than 100,000 people. 
Their fourth single, "To & Fro", was released on 13 March 2006. The single was released as a download only in the United Kingdom.
"Rhythm & Hymns" (2007-09).
On 7 September 2007, Mattafix released the first single, "Living Darfur", taken from their second album "Rhythm & Hymns". It was available as a download only.
The single was released physically on 22 October 2007. The video features Matt Damon in the intro.
The track was featured as part of the Save Darfur Campaign. Working alongside humanitarian agencies operating in the region, the band filmed a video for the song in the refugee camps in the region. The video became extremely popular on YouTube and to date is the only music video by an international group to be filmed in a war zone.
Speaking in June 2008 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Roudette explained the musical background to "Rhythms & Hymns": "With this album I wanted to bring through more aspects of the live show, which is something maybe the first album lacked. You know, we do go out with a seven or eight-piece band, and that has become a big part of the Mattafix sound. So, in addition to keeping the hardcore element and programmed beats from last time round, with "Rhythms & Hymns" we've also used a lot of live drums. Also, we've added quite a lot of influences that we got from the road. Particularly in places like Johannesburg, where we played a couple of great shows." 
The album was released on 23 November 2007 in most European countries. In Australia, it was released on 17 November 2007. 
Mattafix remixed Lady Gaga's song "Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)". Their remix appears on her iTunes Remix EP, however, not in the UK version.
Marlon Roudette solo album, "Matter Fixed" (2010-present).
In April 2010, Marlon Roudette made a video appearance where he spoke about recording and making the record in his home-based studio. However, via Facebook, it was announced that Roudette and Hirji had gone separate ways, due to their different new ideas for future projects. Marlon Roudette is now working on a solo project with the Universal label, apparently to be released in May 2011, which has brought abundant attention to fans. He is yet to come up with his new artist name; whether to stay with the name Mattafix, or choose a new stage name; perhaps his own. "Mattafix presents...Marlon..." was a quote from a late 2010 YouTube video, as an updated possibility for his album title and/or stage name. Marlon Roudette has confirmed that the new album is "not a radical shift but definitely different. More instrumentation and more in depth musical compositions." Marlon Roudette has stated that the album is pretty much completed, but the album is still being "fine tuned". On 9 July 2011, Marlon Roudette confirmed that the name of the first single from the new album is "New Age", and the name of the album will be called "Matter Fixed". In September 2011, "New Age" reached number one in Germany.
On 13 September 2011, Marlon announced that he signed to Warner Music Group for the UK.

Spoil Five

Spoil-Five, "Spoilt Five", "Five and Ten," is the traditional book version of the Irish national card game called Twenty-Five, which underlies the Canadian game of Forty-Five. Charles Cotton describes it in 1674 as "Five Fingers", a nickname applied to the Five of Trumps extracted from the fact that the Irish word "cuig" means both 'five' and 'trick'. It is supposed to be of great antiquity, and widely believed to have originated in Ireland. It may be identified with the game of Maw, of which James I of England was very fond.
Object.
Edmund Hoyle in his "The Complete Gamester" describes it as Five-cards. In the game of Five Cards, for example, when played by only two persons, Five and Ten, the card second in value is stated to be the ace of hearts, instead of the knave of trumps.
Spoil Five is a respected member of one of the most prolific families of card games based on this pattern: each player receives five cards, or six or nine, and another is turned up to fix the trump suit. The object of the play is to win one trick, or at least three or five.
The game is played by 2–8 persons, five being the best number. When three play at this game, it is still necessary that one of them should win the three tricks in order to make a Five, as the stakes must remain for the next game if two of the players get two tricks each, and the other one. If the party consists of four, they play in two partnerships, which are determined by cutting the cards, the two lowest playing against the two highest, or by agreement among the parties. When six play, it is usual to play in three partnerships, and when eight play, in four. When five or six play it makes a very interesting game.
Preliminaries.
A full pack of 52 cards is used and each player receives five cards, dealt in pairs and triplets, being the next card on the top of the pack turned up for trumps. Each player starts with a pre-arranged amount, which may be of 20 chips or counters, and puts up one chip upon the table to form a pool. The pool is usually limited to a certain maximum, which once reached there is no further subscription, though each dealer is required to "tit-up" the pool.
The turn to deal and play always passes to the left, and after the first hand, each player deals in rotation. Where the game is strictly played, the person who misdeals, or who departs from the order with which the game began, of dealing either the three or the two cards first, forfeits his stake. Stack the rest face down, turning the topmost card for trumps.
Robbing.
If the turn-up is an Ace, the dealer may "rob" the trump, i.e. put out, face downwards, any card from his hand and take in the Ace, but the trump suit remains unaltered. Similarly, a player who holds the Ace of trumps may himself rob the trump at any time before playing to the first trick, putting out any card and taking in the turn-up, but need not disclose the fact until it is his turn to play. If the holder of the trump Ace does not wish to rob, and does not announce the fact that he holds it before playing to the first trick, then, whenever he does play it, it counts as the lowest trump. A player who fails to rob cannot go out that hand. The card put out may not be seen. Robbing must take place before the first player on the dealer's left leads. Some players make "robbing" optional.
The cards.
So it will be seen that when the suit is not trump, the Ace of Diamonds is the worst card in the pack; when the suit is trump it is the fourth best card in the game. When Hearts are trumps, there is no Ace of trumps and whether trumps or not, the Deuce of Clubs or Spades is better than all plain cards in their respective suit.
The play.
The player on the dealer's left leads first. Players must follow suit whenever possible, and the highest card of the suit led or, if a trump is played, the highest trump wins the trick. Each player must follow suit when trump is led, under the penalty of forfeiting his stake, except in the case of the three best trump cards, the Five, Knave and the Ace of Hearts, each of which is privileged to renege. If a player takes three tricks he wins the game. If no one succeeds there is a spoil, and a fresh stake, smaller than the original one as a rule, is put into the pool for the next round.
Reneging.
When trumps are led, the Five and the Knave of trumps, and the Ace ♥, need not be played. This is called reneging (colloquially, "renigging"). The Five may always renege: if it is led, no card can renege. The Knave may renege if the Five is played, not led. Only the Five can renege to the Knave led. The Ace ♥ can renege to any inferior card. If Hearts are not trumps and the Ace ♥ is led, a trump must be played if possible; if not, it is not necessary to play a Heart.
Jinking.
At Spoil-five a player winning the first three tricks straight off may claim the pool without further play. If however, he leads to the fourth trick (described as "jinking"), he thereby is obliged to win all five. If he elects to jink and fails, he cannot score during that hand. A player who jinks, if jinking is agreed upon, receives an extra stake all around.
Pay-off.
If no one wins the three tricks, or if a player jinked and failed to win all five, the game is said to have been "spoiled". Everyone then adds another chip to the pool, which is carried forward to the next deal. Otherwise, whoever took three tricks wins the pool, with an additional chip from each opponent if he took all five.
Notes.
If the elder hand has a certain Five, that is to say, if he holds three cards which will each take a trick, he ought to play them, as there is a great probability, if his two remaining cards are tolerable, that he may get the whole five, and thus win a double stake. But if he holds only indifferent cards, the best method is to throw the lead into his opponent's hand by playing an inferior card, in the hope of regaining it at the third trick, which is the critical stage of the game; and as three tricks constitute a Five equally as four, it is reckoned better play to reserve the best cards till the third trick, than to risk the game by eagerness to secure the first two.
"Note": Twenty-five and Forty-five are varieties of Spoil-five and they are played for either of these numbers. The main feature between these two varieties and the game of Spoil Five is that there is no Spoil. Each trick counts five to the maker and the trick made by the highest trump out scores ten. If a player gets out before that trump is played, he wins the game all the same. The winning of all five tricks is called a jink and the player who jinks wins the game whether played for twenty-five or forty-five points.
