Ellbogensee

Ellbogensee (literally Elbow Lake) is a lake in the Mecklenburg Lake District, in Germany. Although most of the lake is in the district of Mecklenburgische Seenplatte in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a portion of its southern shore is in the state of Brandenburg. It has a distinctive shape, reflecting its name.
The lake has an elevation of and a surface area of . 
The navigable River Havel flows through the Ellbogensee, entering it at Priepert via a long channel from the Großer Priepertsee to the north, and exiting via a long channel to the Ziernsee to the east. At Strasen, at the western end of the lake, a canal and lock gives access to the Großer Pälitzsee, forming the first link of the Müritz–Havel–Wasserstraße. Navigation is administered as part of the Obere–Havel–Wasserstraße.

Peter Nares

Peter Nares is a Canadian social entrepreneur. Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1950, Nares founded the not-for-profit organization Social and Enterprise Development Innovations (SEDI)] in 1986. The organization is dedicated to helping low-income people gain financial independence through financial literacy, asset building and entrepreneurship. Nares is the current executive director of SEDI.
Biography.
A graduate in English and social work from Carleton University and York University respectively, Nares' contribution to social services started in 1974 as a child care worker. In 1979, he began his career in social policy with the Ontario Social Development Council (OSDC), where he worked for 16 years. Nares first started SEDI as a division of the OSDC with the organization later evolving into an independent national nonprofit in 1995. Under his leadership, SEDI has helped shape important social policies in Canada.
In 2009, the Canadian government announced its plan to establish a financial literacy task force, a measure recommended by Nares and SEDI. The independent, multi-sectoral task force will make recommendations to the minister of finance on a national strategy for financial literacy. With this initiative, Canada will join a growing list of countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and New Zealand that have developed national strategies to improve the financial literacy of their citizens.
In 1992, Nares' program to provide entrepreneurship training to the unemployed was incorporated into Canada's Employment Insurance legislation. In 2000, SEDI received support from the federal government to develop and test learn$ave. A nationwide pilot program and the largest demonstration of Individuals Development Accounts in the world, learn$ave uses a matching savings system to help low-income earners save for long-term assets such as post-secondary education, job skills training and self-employment. In seven years, the 3,609 participants of the program saved over $3.7 million.
Since the late 1990s, when Peter introduced financial literacy and asset building to Canada, these concepts have been incorporated into local, provincial and federal policies.
Accolades.
In 2008, Nares was awarded an Ashoka Senior Fellowship for his innovative work in socio-economic development in Canada.

Celestino Alfonso

Célestino Alfonso (born 1 May 1916, at Ituero de Azaba, Salamanca province, Spain, died 21 February 1944, at Fort Mont-Valérien, France) was a Spanish republican, a volunteer in the French liberation army FTP-MOI, and a part of the resistance operation led by Missak Manouchian. He was, by profession, a carpenter.
Youth.
Alfonso arrived in France at the beginning of the 1930s. In 1934, he joined the "Jeunesse communiste" (Communist Youth) and became responsible for the Ivry-sur-Seine group. In 1936, he set out as a volunteer for republican Spain, arriving on 27 August 1936. He served as a machine-gunner with the rank of sergeant, and from 1937, the rank of lieutenant. In 1938, his right hand was wounded. He was, shortly afterward, named political commissar of the 2nd International Brigade with the rank of captain. In February 1939, he was repatriated to the camp at Saint-Cyprien, from which he escaped.
Second World War.
In May 1942, Alfonso joined the French resistance. Arrested, he was deported to Germany, where, after six months in a camp, he succeeded in escaping and returned to Paris where he became head of a FTP-MOI resistance group. He participated in many operations in Paris and in the Orléans region, notably the execution of General Ernst Von Schaumburg, commandant of Greater Paris, and on 29 September 1943 of SS officer :fr:Julius Ritter, responsible for the STO in France.
Assassination of Ritter.
The FTP-MOI intelligence service had noticed the strengthening of security measures on rue Saint-Dominique in Paris. A large Mercedes with swastikas on the sides regularly entered the courtyard of the "Maison de la Chimie", and a Nazi official was let out. After four months of planning, the military leadership of the FTP requested Marcel Rayman, :fr:Léo Kneller and Alfonso to plan an attack against this official. The operation was put under the authority of Missak Manouchian, the military overseer of the FTP-MOI, from late August 1943.
On the morning of 28 September 1943, the Mercedes was parked for a few minutes before picking up its passenger. Alfonso fired at the SS officer as he got into the car. The windshield blocked the bullets, but the man was injured, probably by flying glass. He attempted to get out of the car through the opposite door, but Rayman hit him, fatally, with three bullets. The fighters only learned the man's identity through the German press: it was General :fr:Julius Ritter, the assistant in France to Fritz Sauckel, who was responsible for the mobilization and deportation of labor under the German STO (Obligatory Work Service) in Nazi-occupied Europe. Ritter was the chief recruiter of slave labor in occupied France. 
The front-page denunciation of this "abominable act" and the official funeral at the "église de la Madeleine" gave the operation even more impact.
Arrest and execution.
Alfonso was arrested in October 1943, and he was shot at the fort Mont-Valérien on 21 February 1944, along with 21 other members of the FTP-MOI. He had a wife and a small child.
Affiche rouge.
Alfonso's name was featured on the Affiche rouge poster, as: "Alfonso, Espagnol rouge, 7 attentats" (Alfonso, Spanish Communist, 7 attacks)

John Windet

John Windet ("fl" 1584–1611) was an English printer, notable for his music publications. He was a close business associate of fellow printer John Wolfe. After 1591, Wolfe ceased printing the lucrative metrical psalter of Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins, and Windet succeeded him in becoming the sole printer of the work for patent-holder Richard Day. At some point, Windet succeeded Wolfe as London's City Printer. Wolfe passed on some of his printing ornaments to Windet after he decided to stop printing and focus solely on publishing in 1594. On Wolfe's death in 1601, Windet was appointed administrator of his estate.
In 1604, Windet printed John Dowland's influential "Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares", a collection of the composer's pavans and one of the most important musical works of the era. He also printed all of composer Tobias Hume's known compositions in two compilations—"First Part of Ayres" (1605) and "Captaine Humes Poeticall Musicke" (1607). Windet probably needed to use all his skills as a printer to accommodate the unconventional Hume. The "First Part of Ayres" contains instructions for what may be the earliest examples of "pizzicato" ("to be plaide with your fingers...your Bow ever in your hand") and "col legno" ("Drum this with the back of your Bow"), which were probably eccentricities at the time. In "Lesson for two to play upon one Viole" of "First Part of Ayres", one of the players must sit in the lap of the other. Windet's other music publications included printings for Robert Jones, John Coprario and Thomas Ford.
On 25 December 1590, Windet took on William Stansby as his apprentice. Six years later, Windet gave Stansby his freedom, and on 7 January 1597, Stansby was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company. Probably lacking in capital, Stansby decided to stay with Windet at his shop at "the Crosse Keys at Powles Wharfe (St Benet Paul's Wharf)". Windet helped Stansby print his first book, "The Policy of the Turkish Empire" in April 1597. Windet continued printing until his death in either 1610 or 1611, at which point Stansby took over his Cross Keys shop; on 11 September 1611, Stansby inherited 47 of Windet's copyrights.

<doc id="21578129" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21578129" title="Dream of Mirror Online">
Dream of Mirror Online

Dream of Mirror Online (DOMO) was a free-to-play MMORPG game with storylines based on ancient Chinese mythology. It was the second online game of the "Xuan-Yuan Sword" series. The graphics were anime-style with various Chinese themes. This game placed great emphasis on teamwork and building relationships between players. The game is now no longer in service as of late-2012. 
Plot.
The central story involves an artifact called the Kunlun Mirror, a mirror device capable of copying everything from the real world to keep a record of things that exist. An unknown event caused the mirror to have a flawed reflection. As a result, "delusions" from peoples minds become monsters and ordinary creatures also transform when reflected in the mirror world. There are of the twelve Mirror Kings in DOMO, rulers of the Mirror World, and some have disappeared causing the remaining kings to summon human beings from the real world (the players) to the Mirror World to help defeat these delusions.
Gameplay.
Aeria has billed "DOMO" as a "social MMORPG". The gameplay encourages players to build relationships and form teams. Players can form special friendships, student-teacher, or even love relationships within the game that grant extra benefits such as abilities, fame, titles, or items; the Asian versions even currently offer in-game character marriages that grant special abilities to the lucky couple. Some characters also have special fated ties to other players that are based on the birthday selected for the character at creation. These relationships are marked by an arched red line, or "love line" that will form between the two. The love line represents not only potential romantic matches, but also possible family relationships and rivalries. It should be noted that players do not have to acknowledge these love lines in any way; most players completely ignore them. However, there is no way to turn off love lines at this time. Same-sex marriage is now supported, meaning a female player can marry another female player, and likewise for the male players.
Races.
There are 4 DOMO races: Humans, who are described as friendly and of ordinary capability; Shura, a beast-like race that can resemble both a fox (females) and dragon (males), are described as aggressive and with great physical prowess; Sylph, spirit-like creatures with great knowledge and wisdom but out of touch with their emotions; and Sprites, who are small and childlike in appearance.
The official DOMO website describes each race to be uniquely proficient in skill, but this does not significantly, if at all, affect the game of the player. A Sprite, despite their small size, can be just as competent as a Mercenary Shura of the same skill level. In the original release of the game these special race-skills made a big difference (such as Shura being better at physical attributes and Sylph at mental attributes), but this was phased out before the North American version of the game was released, making the differences today mostly cosmetic. It also affects certain dialog with NPCs and determines the village new characters start in.
Professions.
The job system is similar to that of Final Fantasy XI. Every character starts with the occupation Commoner, which grants no special skills. After reaching level 10 as a commoner, by completing specified tasks, the player can qualify for new tasks. Levels, attributes, and skill points are recorded separately for each job. Players may go to an NPC in any town to select a job which their level qualifies them to take. Levels, attributes, and skill points are recorded separately for each job type.
There are currently 13 professions in the North American version. They are Blademaster, Dancer, Doctor, Fencer, Hunter, Martial Artist, Mercenary, Merchant, Musician, Shaman, Thief, Wizard, and Witch Doctor, the new profession as of early June, 2009.
Pets.
Pet tokens (which can be used in-game to get a random pet egg (level 0), including the Special Edition pets) and pet chests are available for purchase in the game's cash shop. However, existing pets can also be traded in game, making it easier for those who would rather use in-game funds to purchase one. Also a quest in game can award the participants a hibernating Metal egg.
A pet have 4 stages of growth: egg, child, youth, and adult. To enable the pet to continue leveling an "evolution stone" is needed to evolve the pet to the next stage. At level 61 (adulthood) players can purchase "pet saddles" to ride the pet. Currently a pet saddle can only be bought through in-game cash shop or trading between players. Note that players can only ride Metal, Sapphire, Ruby and Rock pets.
There are currently six types of pets, each with an associated element and their own strengths and weaknesses:
Metal - metal element, looks like a golden bear.
Jade - wood element, looks like a cactus.
Sapphire - water element, looks like a long-necked turtle. 
Ruby - fire element, looks like a flying cat.
Rock - earth element, looks like a wild boar.
Love - no element, looks like a girl.
There is also a special Bird pet, which can be obtained like any other pet (at a lower chance), it also follows the same evolution pattern as the other pets, but at its first stage of evolution, it either obtains a wood, water or fire element attribute at random, and as it levels up it develops skills based on that element.
Each pet comes in a regular form and also three "special edition" versions that offer an alternate appearance.
Traveling.
Once a character reaches level 15 in any job, they become eligible to complete a quest that grants them the ability to fly on almost any weapon (that the player can equip). The flying system is based on the sword-flying myths in Chinese legends. In addition, there have been special items only available through purchase at the cash shop that are made for flight e.g. the special flying broom released in Halloween. Each different piece of flying equipment has its own features and specific speed; however, some weapons simply cannot fly, and others will only fly after achieving a specific level. Along with moving faster than running on the ground, flying allows characters to cross geographic barriers such as mountains or oceans and perform sky stunts. Flying level is further improved by completing specific quests that improve a character's flight speed and maximum altitude. The current max flying level in the North American version is 22.

Social sustainability

Social sustainability is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching sustainability and sustainable development. Social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability.
There are two main approaches to social sustainability. The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social sustainability. It is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability. The concept of "social sustainability" in this approach encompasses such topics as: social equity, livability, health equity, community development, social capital, social support, human rights, labor rights, placemaking, social responsibility, social justice, cultural competence, community resilience, and human adaptation.
A second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the "ecological domain" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities. It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social. (See the Venn diagram and the Circles of Sustainability diagram).
Definitions.
According to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS)[http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/publications/Partridgepaper.pdf]: ""Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities. Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life.""
Another definition has been developed by Social Life, a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place based innovation (originally set up by the Young Foundation). For Social Life, social sustainability is ""a process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve"."
Dimensions.
Social LIfe have developed a framework for social sustainability which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow.
Nobel Laureat Amartya Sen gives the following dimensions for social sustainability [http://integral-sustainability.net/wp-content/uploads/sas4-2-hodgson.pdf]:
Also we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations. In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.
The different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in socially responsible investing (SRI). Social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by SRI funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include: community, diversity, employee relations, human rights, product safety, reporting, and governance structure.

Richard Norton, 8th Baron Grantley

Richard William Brinsley Norton, 8th Baron Grantley (born 30 January 1956) is a retired banker and politician. In early life he worked for the Conservative Party, but joined the United Kingdom Independence Party when it was founded in 1993. As Baron Grantley, he was a member of the House of Lords from 1995 to 2000.
Early life.
The son of John Norton, 7th Baron Grantley, Norton was born in 1956. Through his maternal grandfather William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel, he is descended from Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and so from many kings of England, including William the Conqueror.
He was educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire and at New College, Oxford, which he entered with an Open Scholarship in Mathematics, but graduated in Law. He was President of the Oxford Union in 1976.
Career.
Norton worked in the Conservative Research Department from 1977 to 1981. In 1978 he was seconded to work for the Opposition front bench in the House of Lords. During the 1979 general election campaign he worked in Margaret Thatcher's Private Office. After the election, he became a special adviser for trade and energy and wrote "The Benefits of Trade". 
A councillor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea from 1982 to 1986, he was the Conservative parliamentary candidate for the unwinnable Wentworth constituency at the 1983 general election. 
He joined the United Kingdom Independence Party on its foundation and became one of its early patrons. On 24 June 1995 he succeeded his father, John Norton, 7th Baron Grantley, and thus became UKIP's sole representative in Parliament. In 1996 he made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in the presence of his maternal grandfather, the Earl of Listowel, a member of the House of Lords since 1931, a feat unlikely ever to be repeated. In 1997 he became leader of UKIP in the House of Lords. He spoke in the House on five occasions. At the time of the reforms brought about by the House of Lords Act 1999, he did not stand for election as a continuing member, and so left the House in March 2000. He remains a member of UKIP.
In 1981 Grantley became a banker and worked as an international project financier at Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC. He was a director of Morgan Grenfell International Limited and of HSBC Project and Export Finance. He was head of oil and gas project finance at both institutions, and retired in 2005.
Grantley is chairman of his local Residents' Association, one of the largest in Chelsea, and was a patron of Save Sloane Square, which successfully campaigned to prevent the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea from turning the centre of Sloane Square into a crossroads. He also participated in the successful campaign to prevent the developers of the Chelsea Barracks site from demolishing the Garrison Church. He is a patron of the Vaughan Parents Action Group which is campaigning to prevent the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School in Holland Park, the outstanding Catholic comprehensive, from being turned into an ordinary local school. 
Grantley is a Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and has served on the council of its British Association, and as a director of The Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth. For ten years he was a director of The Order of St John Care Homes Trust. He is a regular worshipper at the London Oratory and a long standing devotee of the traditional Latin Mass. 
Grantley is a keen bridge player. In 1972 he reached the final of the Daily Mail National Schools Bridge Competition; he was a regular member of the House of Lords bridge team in its annual matches against the House of Commons; and in 2011 he was a member of the Polish Club team which won the Devonshire Cup.

Rekuhkara (from Sakhalin Ainu "rekuh"　レクㇷ 'throat'; "rekut"　レクㇳ or レクッ in Hokkaidō Ainu) is a style of singing, similar to Inuit throat singing, that was practised by the Ainu until 1976 when the last practitioner died. The Sakhalin spelling "rekuxkara" or the Japanese spelling "rekukkara" (レクッカラ in Katakana) can also be encountered.
The Ainu method involved two women facing each other, with one forming a tube with her hands and chanting into the oral cavity of her partner. The technique is essentially one where the "giver" provides the voice and the "receiver", holding her glottis closed, uses her vocal tract to modulate the sound stream.

Felicia of Roucy ( – 3 May 1123) was a daughter of Hilduin IV of Montdidier and his wife Alice of Roucy.
She married in 1076 to Sancho Ramírez, then king of Aragon after he had divorced his first wife, Isabella of Urgell. His accession to the crown of Navarre later that year made her the first Aragonese consort to also be Queen consort of Navarre. She is attested shortly before her husband's death and is now thought to have outlived Sancho (the supposed subsequent marriage of Sancho to a third wife, Philippa of Toulouse, appearing in a later chronicle, is now thought to be erroneous).
Felicia gave birth to three sons, Ferdinand, Alfonso and Ramiro, the latter two following her step-son Peter I of Aragon and Navarre in Aragon (Alfonso also in Navarre). Through Ramiro's only daughter Petronila of Aragon, she was ancestor of the later rulers of Aragon.

Rugby and Stamford Railway

The Rugby and Stamford Railway was an early railway in England built in 1850. The London and Birmingham Railway had already built a branch from Blisworth to serve Northampton and extend to Peterborough. The success of this, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway encouraged the directors to look for other ventures. They decided upon a branch from Rugby to Stamford which would link up with other new railways in the east of the country.
At approximately the same time the Midland Railway was building its Syston to Peterborough line which opened in 1848. It was therefore necessary to share its line between Luffenham and Stamford
Authorisation.
The ""Act to empower the London and Birmingham Railway Company to make a Branch Railway from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford."" (The Rugby and Stamford Railway Act, 1846). 9 Victoria, cap. lxvii. was passed in 1846. a month before the line became part of the London and North Western Railway.
Construction.
Like the earlier branch it was built as a single line which could be doubled at a later date if needed. From Rugby the line followed the valley of the Warwickshire Avon and then the Welland Valley. Although it eased construction with few earthworks it involved a number of river crossings. During the construction the major contractor became bankrupt in 1848. Joseph Firbank, railway contractor, lost much of his savings as a result.
Opening and expansion.
The section from Rugby to Market Harborough, opened in 1850. Originally single track, it was doubled at the end of 1878.
Market Harborough to Rockingham opened a month late, but the remainder to Luffenham was not completed until a year later. The line was not doubled throughout until 1878.
The increased traffic into Rugby proved a problem, particularly when the Northampton Loop Line opened in 1881. The LNWR therefore applied to build a flyover at the south end of the station and a single track viaduct of some 30 arches which would bring the line in from Clifton Mill. These were completed in 1885.
At Market Harborough the Midland Railway arrived in 1857 on its way to Bedford and London. The Midland arranged to share the station but traffic increased to such a degree that a flyover was planned over the LNWR lines north of the station. However instead the two companies build a new joint station which opened in 1884 although not fully completed until February 1886. Passenger traffic was not great, with only a few trains each way on weekdays and two on Sundays.
In order to gain a more direct route the LNWR gained permission to build a line from Seaton to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway line near Wansford. This opened for freight on 2 July 1879, and passengers on 1 November. Although the line from Seaton to Luffenham was now of little importance, it remained double and Morcott station was built as a double line station. The section was not singled until 1907.
Closure.
Despite offering a more direct route between the Midlands and East Anglia, the line was closed on 6 June 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe in favour of the longer Birmingham to Peterborough Line which served larger population centres.

No. 601 Squadron RAF

No. 601 (County of London) Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, based in London. The squadron battle honours most notably include the Battle of Britain and the first Americans to fly in World War II were members of this squadron.
History.
601 Squadron was formed at RAF Northolt on 14 October 1925 when a group of wealthy aristocratic young men, all of whom were amateur aviators, decided to form themselves into a Reserve Squadron of the RAF after a meeting in White's Club, London. The original officers were picked by the first commanding officer, Lord Edward Grosvenor, youngest son of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. Grosvenor tested potential recruits by plying them with alcohol to see if they would behave inappropriately. Grosvenor wanted officers "of sufficient presence not to be overawed by him and of sufficient means not to be excluded from his favourite pastimes, eating, drinking and Whites". The Squadron was initially known as "the millionaires squadron", a nametag gained because of a reputation for filling their ranks with the very 'well-heeled'. Most of these affluent young pilots had little regard for the rigid discipline of the regular service; they lined their uniform tunics with bright red silk and wore blue ties rather than the regulation black. They played polo on brand-new Brough Superior motor cycles, drove fast sports cars (the squadron car park was said to resemble a Concours d'Elegance) and most of the pilots owned their own private aircraft. 
World War Two.
The Squadron became a day fighter unit in 1940 and operated both the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire. Aircrew attrition and transfers to other units war quickly took its toll on the pre-war personnel and as replacements were drafted in from all walks of life and all parts of the Commonwealth to cover casualties and promotions, the Squadron became as cosmopolitan as any other.
Postwar operations.
The unit reformed in 1946 as a fighter squadron within the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF), initially equipped with the Spitfire, followed by the jet powered De Havilland Vampire and the Gloster Meteor twin-jet. The squadron disbanded along with all other RAuxAF units during the defence cuts of early 1957.

Steinvikholm Castle

Steinvikholm Castle ("Steinvikholm slott") is an island fortress on the Skatval peninsula near Stjørdal, in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The castle was built over seven years, from 1525 to 1532, by Norway's last Catholic archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson. Steinvikholm castle became the most powerful fortification by the time it was built, and it is the largest construction raised in the Norwegian middle age.
Castle.
The castle occupies about half of the land on the rocky island. The absence of a spring meant that fresh water had to be brought from the mainland. A wooden bridge served as the only way to the island other than boat. Although the castle design was common across Europe in 1525, its medieval design was becoming obsolete because of the improved siege firepower offered by gunpowder and cannons.
History.
The castle was constructed after Olav Engelbrektsson returned from a meeting with the Pope in Rome, presumably in anticipation of impending military-religious conflict.
As Archbishop Engelbrektsson's resistance to the encroachment of Danish rule escalated, first with Frederick I of Denmark and his successor Christian III of Denmark, Steinvikholm Castle and Nidarholm Abbey became the Catholic Church's military strongholds in Norway. In April 1537, the Danish-Norwegian Reformation succeeded in driving the archbishop from the castle into exile in Lier in the Netherlands (now in Belgium), where he died on 7 February 1538. At the castle the archbishop left behind St. Olav's shrine and other treasures from Nidaros Cathedral (Trondheim). The original coffin containing St. Olav's body remained at Steinvikholm until it was returned to Nidaros Cathedral in 1564. Since 1568 St. Olav's grave in Nidaros has been unknown.
From the 17th to 19th century, the island was used as a quarry and some of its masonry was sold and removed from the site. This activity was condoned by the Danish-Norwegian authorities as a way of eliminating a monument to the opposition of the Danish–Norwegian Union.
Modern usage.
Steinvikholm fort is owned and operated today by The society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments(Fortidsminneforeningen).
The island has been the site of the midnight opera which details the life and struggles of the archbishop. The opera is held in August annually. The opera is organized by Steinvikholm Musikkteater since the beginning in 1993.

Simon Hayhoe

Simon Hayhoe wrote the monographs, "Grounded Theory and Disability Studies" on the application of grounded theory in his study of blindness, "Arts, Culture and Blindness" on social and cultural factors affecting the arts education of blind adults and school children, and "God, Money and Politics", the first book on the history of English education for the blind, since Illingworth's "History of the Education of the Blind" in 1910. These and previous works on this topic have been cited in papers on subjects such as perceptual psychology and human geography.
<br>
Hayhoe's work on the history and the epistemology of blindness is the subject of Course PSYC54 Cognition and Representation at the University of Toronto (Canada). In addition, his writing has been the topic of discussion on BBC Radio 4 in the UK and syndicated radio in the USA and a theatrical installation project in London by Extant and the Open University.
Early career.
During his early work on blindness and arts education, Hayhoe was a student of Professor Maurice Galton, head of the Faculty of Education at Leicester University (now Senior Research Fellow at Homerton College, Cambridge University); and then of John M Hull, Professor of Religious Education at Birmingham University (now Emeritus Professor, and Honorary Professor of Practical Theology at The Queen’s Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education), author of the autobiographical book "Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness". He also worked as a research officer on two major research projects in the field of social exclusion in England for Birkbeck, University of London and the Institute of Education, University of London. He then worked in Canada at Toronto University, Scarborough, during which time he developed the BART (Blindness in Art) project, studying cultural and social exclusion of blind students in visual arts education, and wrote on the development of an epistemological model of disability.
Current and recent work.
Hayhoe is currently a senior lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University, and a centre research associate in the Centre for the Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics, where he is researching the epistemology of disability and ability, with special reference to education, inclusion, technology and the arts.
<br>
Whilst teaching in London, he developed the Four Senses project in conjunction with the Royal London School for the Blind (part of the Royal London Society for the Blind) and the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the designed the Computing and Blindness in Education project, which was the first research of its type to investigate the cultural and social factors affecting blind adults and school children using visual programming languages. The COMBINE project was presented to BETT 2009 and 2011, at Kensington Olympia, London, in a lecture to the British Computer Society, and appears in books on Mulsemedia and IT in education. Its reports are also published in conjunction with the British Computer Association of the Blind (part of the RNIB).
Other posts and awards.
Hayhoe's articles on disability and blindness appear in works such as the American Foundation for the Blind's "Art Beyond Sight" and, more recently, the "Encyclopedia of American Disability History", Global Sustainable Communities Handbook, and Learning in a Digitalized Age. In addition, his articles also appear in special issues of the Harvard Educational Review, the British Journal of Visual Impairment, the Society for Disability Studies' Disability Studies Quarterly, and the National Federation of the Blind's Journal of Blindness Innovation and Research.

Clifton Mill railway station

Clifton Mill railway station was a railway station serving Clifton-upon-Dunsmore in the English county of Warwickshire. It was opened on the Rugby and Stamford Railway in 1850.
History.
Parliamentary approval was gained in 1846 to the directors of the London and Birmingham Railway for a branch from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford. In the same year the company became part of the London and North Western Railway. The section from Rugby to Market Harborough, which included Clifton Mill, opened in 1850. Originally single track, it was doubled at the end of 1878. 
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
The site today.
Station Road leads from the village centre terminating in a small Mill Lane. Some distance along the former are a number of buildings, where traces of the old track bed may still be made out.

Kreuzkirche, Kaliningrad

The Kreuzkirche is a church in the former city district of Lomse in Königsberg, Germany, now Kaliningrad, Russia. The church was designed by architect Arthur Kickton and built between 1930 and 1933 for the evangelical community of Königsberg. Between the two towers a monumental cross from Kadyny maiolica is situated. The church was only lightly damaged in World War II and became a garage and a factory for fishing equipment thereafter. After a fire it was decided in 1988 to use the building as a church again, now for the Kaliningrad Orthodox community. Both towers were connected to the nave again in the restoration that followed. The original clock of the church now hangs on the Church of the Holy Family.

Dickerson combination press

The Dickerson Combination Press is a printing press invented by Edward "Ted" Dickerson. It was made for intaglio printing, relief printing, and lithography. It could be used either electrically or hand driven. It earned patents in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 1,069,796) and Great Britain (British Patent No. 238,946).
History.
Dickerson earned his Master of Science in Art at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the mid-1950s. While considering possible subjects for his master's thesis, he began thinking about the need for a better printing press. He had a revelation about how to design a single press that would do the work of two presses, and would do it better than either. Dickerson found a European craftsman to build him a prototype of the press in his garage.
After Dickerson worked on the press more, he eventually earned patents in the U.S. and Britain and began selling the printing presses to colleges and artists all over the world. From that point on, the Dickerson Combination Press was Dickerson's main source of income.
This press design is still in production in various sizes. You can find them at Conrad Machine Co. and Printmakers Machine Co.
Intaglio Printing.
The user is able to adjust pressure easily and rapidly to the exact degree needed for any given plate. One would bring the upper roll down to the plate by turning a single adjustment screw. The roll automatically reaches a perfect parallel position with the plate (blanket) surface. Then two end adjustment screws would be turned down to meet the top of the roll's bearing blocks. If the user needed to add pressure on one end of the roll, he could simply turn the appropriate adjustment screw. The user is able to release or reapply pressure at any time (without changing pressure adjustment) by merely raising or lowering a lever. This eliminates problems such as starting or removing paper or felts that do not run out completely from between the rolls.
Relief Printing.
The flexibility of the Dickerson Press allows numerous approaches not possible with other machines. When using the top roller, the user can adjust it so that the thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or scraper bar in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive pressure adjustment allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays. Reliefs can be printed either face up or face down, to provide perfect color registry.
Lithography.
For use as a stone lithography press, standard size wooden scraper bars replace the upper roller. The scraper, in its holder, is suspended from a central adjustment screw which allows it to conform to the surface of the stone. Metal plate lithographs may be printed with the scraper bar or the printing roll.

Comus (Arne)

Comus is a masque in three acts by composer Thomas Arne. The work uses a libretto by John Dalton (1709-1763) that is based on John Milton's 1634 masque of the same name. The work premiered at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London on 4 March 1738.
History.
"Comus" was Arne’s first major success, and the masque enjoyed regular revivals throughout his lifetime. The work boasts some of his finest music with songs like "Now Phoebus sinketh in the West" and "Would you taste the noontide air" displaying a fresh lyrical style. The work was published in 1740 but without the recitatives and choruses. The original score containing the additional music is now lost, but a copy of that score, made around 1785, does exist with all of the original music and some additional pieces taken from Handel’s "L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato" that supplement Arne’s limited chorus writing.
Synopsis.
A lady is lost in the forest where the magician Comus dwels; masquerading as a shepherd he entices her to his palace. A spirit warns the lady’s two brothers that their sister is in Comus’s control. They are waylayed by Comus’s stooges. The spirit supplies the brothers with an enchanted potion to help them thwart Comus’s spell over the lady. A banquet is organized in Comus’s palace and the lady, succumbed to the power of the spell, is diverted by the songs and dances of the festivities. Comus forcefully encourages her to drink from his cup but the brothers dash in just in time, putting Comus to flight. The nymph Sabrina frees the lady from the magician's spell and all rejoice the triumph of virtue in the masque's final chorus.

Virtual product development

Virtual product development (VPD) is the practice of developing and prototyping products in a completely digital 2D/3D environment. VPD has four main components: 
VPD typically takes place in a collaborative, web-based environment that brings together designers, customers/consumers, and value chain partners around a single source of real-time product “truth.” VPD enables practitioners to arrive at the right idea more quickly, and to accurately predict its performance in both manufacturing and retail settings, ultimately minimizing time to value, market failure potential, and product development costs.
Virtual Process Planning is a relatively new concept for manufacturing companies, although the concept has been in use for the construction industry for several years. BIM (Building Information Modeling) is the system used by many construction, architectural and contracting firms. The detail and scheduling aspects are some of the more valuable aspects of the system. By utilizing Virtual Process Planning, the entire production process can be designed to both maximize efficiency and avoid the trial and error method employed by most manufacturers. 
Various software exists with differing levels of information. The placement of work stations, inventory, personnel and equipment can be valuable for space planning. The interaction of the previously mentioned can also be investigated, allowing the user to identify potential issues from safety, quality and ergonomic standpoints.

Fitzhugh Andrews

Fitzhugh Lee Andrews (February 12, 1873 – March 10, 1961) was an American teacher, composer and performer of both classical and popular works for the piano.
Andrews was born in Buda, Texas, the son of Jason Lindsey Andrews and Crissie Crawford Andrews. At an early age, the family moved to Kyle, Texas, where he taught mostly the piano to the young ladies, who would perform for their families after dinner in the parlour of their homes.
The Great Depression, and the advent of radio, the phonograph and motion pictures eventually eclipsed parlour music as the preferred after-dinner entertainment. Families no longer invested their hard-earned income in the musical talents of their children as they once did. To augment his income from music lessons he offered, Fitzhugh became a part-time farmer. He died in Kyle in 1961. His second wife followed him in death the next day.
Some of Fitzhugh’s piano compositions are reminiscent of vocal music, lending the score an operatic flair. Tricky passagework and effective rapid runs lend the compositions a quality that is not unlike Liszt transcriptions – at least outwardly .

Barbara Campanini, known as La Barberina, (7 June 1721 - 7 June 1799) was a famous Italian ballerina, one of the most important ballet dancers of the 18th century.
Barbara Campanini was born in Parma. She became a student at Teatro Farnese under the instruction of Antonio Rinaldi Fossano, with whom she gave her debut at the Paris Opera in 1739, which became an immediate success. In 1740, she became well known for her talent not only as a dancer but also as an actress. People began to call her La Barbarina or "The Flying Goddess" because of her impeccable execution of entrechats. She is sometimes thought to be the reason for the early retirement of Marie Sallé.
After a tour in London she performed in Vienna before she returned to Paris in 1743. She was noted by the young Prussian king Frederick the Great, who offered her a position at the newly erected Court Opera in Berlin, where she performed from 1744 onwards. She appeared in her first performance there on May 13, 1744. Before she arrived, however, she had eloped her contract to Venice with her lover Lord Stuart Mackenzie, and King Frederick used political pressure arresting a Venetian envoy to have her turned over to Prussia. Jean-Jacques Rousseau who was a secretary at the French embassy at that time, was involved with her case.
In Berlin, she had a privileged position, demonstrated by the fact that she negotiated her own annual salary of 7,000 Reichsthaler,which was unusually high, and five months vacation a year. The king granted her these terms as long as she stayed unmarried. There were speculations that she had an affair with King Frederick (though reputed as misogynic), as well as many other persons. She broke her contract suddenly by accepting a proposal by Carl Ludwig von Cocceji, son of the Prussian chancellor Samuel von Cocceji, onstage in 1749, causing a veritable scandal. Her fiancé went to prison, Campanini herself once again eloped to London, but returned to Berlin and secretly married Cocceji. Her spouse was finally pardoned by the king and appointed district governor at Glogau in Silesia, where the couple lived until they were divorced in 1788. The king granted her the title of Countess von Barschau. During her last years, she was active within charity.
Barbara Campanini died on her 78th birthday at her country estate in Barschau near Lüben, Silesia. She donated her money by will to a foundation for poor noblewomen, which lasted until World War I.

Color space

A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or "color components" (e.g. RGB and CMYK are color models). However, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.
Adding a certain mapping function between the color model and a certain reference color space results in a definite "footprint" within the reference color space. This "footprint" is known as a gamut, and, in combination with the color model, defines a new color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB model.
In the most generic sense of the definition above, color spaces can be defined without the use of a color model. These spaces, such as Pantone, are in effect a given set of names or numbers which are defined by the existence of a corresponding set of physical color swatches. This article focuses on the mathematical model concept.
Understanding the concept.
A wide range of colors can be created by the subtractive primary colors of pigment (cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K)). Those colors then define a specific color space. To create a three-dimensional representation of a color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X axis, the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.
However, this is not the only possible color space. For instance, when colors are displayed on a computer monitor, they are usually defined in the RGB (red, green and blue) color space. This is another way of making nearly the same colors (limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (CRT) or filters and backlight (LCD)), and red, green and blue can be considered as the X, Y and Z axes. Another way of making the same colors is to use their Hue (X axis), their Saturation (Y axis), and their brightness Value (Z axis). This is called the HSV color space. Many color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional (X,Y,Z) values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as Pantone, cannot be represented in this way at all.
Notes.
When formally defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.
Since "color space" is a more specific term for a certain "combination" of a color model plus a mapping function, the term "color space" tends to be used to also identify color models, since identifying a color space automatically identifies the associated color model. Informally, the two terms are often used interchangeably, though this is strictly incorrect. For example, although several specific color spaces are based on the RGB model, there is no such thing as "the" RGB color space.
Since any color space defines colors as a function of the absolute reference frame, color spaces, along with device profiling, allow reproducible representations of color, in both analogue and digital representations.
Conversion.
Color space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.
Density.
The RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation is the 24-bit implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per channel. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256×256×256 ≈ 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same gamut with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different bit depths.
Partial list of color spaces.
CIE 1931 XYZ color space was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by James Clerk Maxwell, König & Dieterici, and Abney at Imperial College) and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The CIERGB color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the CIELUV, CIEUVW, and CIELAB.
Generic color models.
RGB uses additive color mixing, because it describes what kind of "light" needs to be "emitted" to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. RGBA is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency.
Common color spaces based on the RGB model include sRGB, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, scRGB, and CIE RGB.
CMYK uses subtractive color mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of inks need to be applied so the light "reflected" from the substrate and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).
YIQ was formerly used in NTSC (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a luma value roughly analogous to (and sometimes misidentified as) luminance, along with two chroma values as approximate representations of the relative amounts of blue and red in the color. It is similar to the YUV scheme used in most video capture systems and in PAL (Australia, Europe, except France, which uses SECAM) television, except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33° with respect to the YUV color space and the color axes are swapped. The YDbDr scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. 
YPbPr is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, YCbCr, used widely in video and image compression schemes such as MPEG and JPEG.
xvYCC is a new international digital video color space standard published by the IEC (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and BT.709 standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards. 
HSV (hue, saturation, value), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB colorspace, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB colorspace from which it was derived.
HSL (hue, saturation, lightness/luminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) is quite similar to HSV, with "lightness" replacing "brightness". The difference is that the "brightness" of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the "lightness" of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.
Obsolete color spaces.
Early color spaces had two components. They largely ignored blue light because the added complexity of a 3-component process provided only a marginal increase in fidelity when compared to the jump from monochrome to 2-component color.

Jonna Christensen (née Pirinen, born 28 December 1982), better known by her stage name Jonna, is a pop and R&B singer/songwriter from Finland. She has released three albums, over ten singles and several music videos. Her latest release is the song "Simple life", in June 2011.
She became known in 2002 for her participation to the Finnish edition of talent scouting show Popstars, where she was selected as fourth member of the girls' group Gimmel. However, after less than a month she quit from the group and embarked on a solo career.
Jonna was successful in her solo career, but wanted to start singing in English but her record label Sony BMG did not support her proposal to now focus on English-language songs. As a result, the contract ended. Jonna decided to move to Los Angeles to start working on her English-language album and find new influences for her music. After a stay of one and a half years in Los Angeles, she returned to Finland.
Back in Finland, in December 2010, Jonna released her first independently produced song "Puppets". On 14 January 2011, she participated with "Puppets" to the first semifinal for the Finnish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. She released her second single "Simple life" from her upcoming album in June 2011 and during the summer of 2011 she is playing the female lead part in a summer theater production called "Rölli ja Metsänhenki" (The troll and the forest Spirit) in Joensuu, Finland.
Jonna has previously been in the musical "Hair" (2003) and "Grease" (2002–2003) and "Hello Dolly!" (2000) and she was hosting a TV-show called "Voice out!" on TV2 (Finnish national TV) in 2004. She has worked as a backup dancer for a dance artist called K-System and performed as a dancer in show dance groups "Step up" (2001–2002) and "Cat people" (1996–2001). She has won 3 Finnish championships with show dance and hip hop group formations and was the best female solo dancer in the Disco and show dance competition in 2002.
Jonna has worked as a dance teacher since 1996 in such dance schools as "Pohjois-Karjalan tanssiopisto" and "Helsingin tanssiopisto". She has been making dance choreographies to her music videos such as "Tyytyväinen" ("Pleased"), "Kaikki talossa" ("All in the house"), and "Puppets".
Jonna has written all the lyrics and melodies to her songs. She has worked with such song writers as Jim Holvay (The Buckinghams), Miika Colliander (Husky Rescue), Nikki Forova and Jukka Immonen.
Jonna became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the end of 2003.

Welford and Kilworth railway station

Welford and Kilworth railway station was a railway station serving Welford and North and South Kilworth in the English county of Leicestershire. It was opened as Welford on the Rugby and Stamford Railway in 1850.
Parliamentary approval was gained in 1846 by the directors of the London and Birmingham Railway for a branch from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford. In the same year the company became part of the London and North Western Railway. The section from Rugby to Market Harborough, which included Welford, opened in 1850. Originally single track, it was doubled at the end of 1878.
Originally the plan had been to build a station at Husbands Bosworth but due to objections it was situated a couple of miles westward near the village of North Kilworth. Originally, the station was named "Welford" after the larger village of that name two and a half miles further south. Later the name "Lutterworth" was added in an attempt to attract custom from that town even though it was some six miles from the station.
The original station was built - as was normal at that time - at ground level. Later, when a platform was added the building's windowsill facing the platform was at ankle level. This original building was of brick, but a variety of additions and extensions in different materials and styles were added over the years.
A cottage was built on the opposite side of the line near to the road crossing and the box. Consequently the signal box had to be high enough to give a view over it. There were two sidings on the up side behind the station building, with a loading dock and goods shed, and, in the opposite direction, beside the up line there were two long sidings. On the other side of the road crossing towards Stamford a further siding catered for a dairy. A milk train would arrive from Rugby at about 3.30 in the morning, returning empty at 5.00 a.m. Welford also proved handy for parking defective wagons.
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The station was closed on the sixth of June 1966 and all trackwork lifted shortly afterwards. Although the main station buildings were demolished, the 1878 built down platform shelter is preserved at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire. There is still a Station Road and the trackbed can still be traced crossing the A4304 road.

Theddingworth railway station

Theddingworth railway station was a railway station serving Theddingworth in the English county of Leicestershire. It was opened on the Rugby and Stamford Railway in 1850.
History.
Parliamentary approval was gained in 1846 by the directors of the London and Birmingham Railway for a branch from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford. In the same year the company became part of the London and North Western Railway. The section from Rugby to Market Harborough, which included Theddingworth, opened in 1850. 
Although the official opening was not till 1 May 1850, some services may have been run on 29 April for the Market Harborough fair. Initially there were three train services daily each way. 
A neat, compact station house was provided on the up (Rugby) side next to the level crossing with the signal box opposite. On the opposite down platform was a small timber waiting-room with a substantial awning.
Originally single track, the line was doubled at the end of 1878. There was a siding on the up (Rugby) side with a horse loading bay behind the railway offices and, in the Rugby direction, there was a long head shunt. At some time early in the century the signal box caught fire and a lack of running water made it difficult to put out. It was rebuilt with a modern superstructure on the original LNWR brick base. 
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. At the end of the 19th century there were eight trains on the line each day, four of them stopping at the intermediate stations. Around 1950 the service was six or seven trains a day, but this business disappeared in the next decade. Freight service was discontinued on 6 April 1964, and passenger services on 6 June 1966.
Filming for the 1967 film "Robbery" took place to the east of Theddingworth station. Scenes of the actual robbery were shot there.
There is still a Station Road with a pronounced dogleg where it crossed the track. The station building has been carefully preserved by its present owners, along with the signal box, waiting room and level crossing gates.

Jamie Hoffmann

Jamie Richard Hoffmann (born August 20, 1984, in New Ulm, Minnesota) is an American professional baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He played in Major League Baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2009 and 2011. 
Baseball career.
Hoffmann, a former hockey prospect selected in the 2003 NHL Draft by the Carolina Hurricanes in the eighth round, was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2003 out of New Ulm High School and assigned to the Gulf Coast Dodgers where he was an All-Star third baseman during the 2004 season, hitting .310 for the team.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
He then switched to the outfield in 2005 while playing for the Columbus Catfish and Vero Beach Dodgers. In 2007 he played for the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, and in 2008 for the Jacksonville Suns. The Dodgers added him to their 40 man roster prior to the 2009 season.
Hoffmann participated in the 2008 Arizona Fall League season with the Surprise Rafters.
He began 2009 in Double-A with the Chattanooga Lookouts and was then promoted to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes. On May 22, he was called up to the Los Angeles Dodgers when reserve outfielder Xavier Paul was placed on the disabled list. He made his MLB debut, flying out as a pinch hitter, the same day.
Hoffmann's first Major League hit was a three-run home run in the 2nd inning against Matt Palmer of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on May 24. He played in 14 games with the Dodgers and then was optioned back to the Minors. He was designated for assignment on September 1 and then released by the Dodgers after clearing waivers. He was shortly resigned and sent back to Albuquerque.
Hoffmann was selected as the first overall pick in the 2009 Rule 5 Draft by the Washington Nationals on December 10, but was immediately traded to the New York Yankees for Brian Bruney, as the player to be named later. On March 22, Hoffmann was returned to the Dodgers and assigned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes, where he hit .310 in 139 games. He was then added to the Dodgers 40-man winter roster, which protected him from being lost in the 2010 Rule 5 Draft. 
He appeared in two games with the Dodgers in April 2011 during a brief appearance in the Majors and was 0-4 before being optioned back to Albuquerque. With the Isotopes, he appeared in 133 games, hitting .297 with 22 home runs and 84 RBI.
Colorado Rockies.
The Colorado Rockies claimed Hoffmann off of waivers on December 5, 2011. Hoffmann elected free agency after being sent outright to the minors during Spring Training.
Baltimore Orioles.
On March 31, 2012, Hoffmann signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles.
New York Mets.
On November 20, 2012 he signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets.

Snog Marry Avoid?

Snog Marry Avoid? is a British reality television show broadcast on BBC Three, produced by Remarkable Television. The first four series were presented by Atomic Kitten member Jenny Frost, with Ellie Taylor presenting from the fifth series onwards. The show focuses mainly on transforming 'fakery obsessed' or 'slap addicts' in Britain into natural beauties by stripping them of their skimpy clothes and layers of make-up and giving them a makeunder instead of a makeover with the help of POD – the Personal Overhaul Device. POD's commentary is created by comedian Doug Faulkner and is voiced by the series 1-3 producer.
Overview.
"Snog Marry Avoid?" has given 'makeunders' to a range of people in Britain, including celebrities.
Within the world of the programme, POD is a computer that "only understands natural beauty". It conducts a public analysis to ask the public whether they would snog (kiss), marry or avoid the participant, as well as another random question which offers those questioned another chance to praise or criticise. After the questions it allows the person to choose their style based on a celebrity and dresses them accordingly. It sometimes orders the person to do a 'deep cleanse' where they have to take off all of their make-up. After the transformation POD will ask the public what they think of the person. The person is then re-introduced to their partner or relative outside the TV studio and their reaction is recorded, generally a positive one towards the more natural look. Later on in the show, the presenter (Jenny Frost in series 1 – 4) meets with the person to see if they have kept their look and discusses the transformation. In series 5, with new host Ellie Taylor, the show visits towns and cities nationwide on the first ever "Snog Marry Avoid?" roadshow. Also changed in this series, the person's new style is no longer based on a celebrity - it is now solely POD's creation. In series 6, a catwalk was also introduced, whereby the person shows off their look to their friends, family and other locals.
As with many BBC programmes, previews are uploaded to YouTube before the programme is screened on TV. One of the most viewed "Snog Marry Avoid?" videos on YouTube is "Scotland's No1 Male Barbie", which got interest around the world due to celebrity blogger Perez Hilton featuring it on his Twitter page. The most viewed video is the makeunder of Chloe Victoria Mafia, who is also known for auditioning for the seventh series of "The X Factor".
Episodes.
Series 3.
To promote the third series, BBC Three aired a one-off special called "Snog, Marry, Avoid – Top 10 Shockers", a count down of the most memorable make-unders on 15 December 2009. Series 3 kicked off on 4 February 2010, with an 12-episode series.
Series 4.
Series 4 began on 11 January 2011 at 8pm. There were 12 episodes and it ended on 15 March 2011.
Series 5.
With new host Ellie Taylor, series 5 commenced on 14 May 2012, at 10.30pm on BBC Three. There were 10 episodes and it ended on 16 July 2012.
Series 6.
Series 6 began on 18 March 2013, airing every Monday at 10:00pm. There will be 12 episodes.
Ratings.
"Snog Marry Avoid?" has received positive reviews, complimenting its useful beauty tips and 'cliche' gimmick. BBC Three's boss has declared it a "roaring success". Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has said that she is a fan of the show, admitting "It's very interesting TV".
Viewership had climbed throughout the first two series, on average over 750,000 people tuning into each of the second series' episodes. Repeats also gained good ratings, becoming one of BBC Three's top shows.
International format.
A German version started airing in November 2008 on the commercial channel ProSieben. ""Love Date or Hate –die ehrlichste Starstyle-Rubrik der Welt"" ("Love Date or Hate – the most honest starstyle-column in the world") was a part of the weekly showbiz-oriented television programme ""red! – Stars, Lifestyle & More"", but due to harsh criticism the column was taken off the show after a few months. POD was called "Stylomat" in this format (portmanteau of the words "style" and "automat").
A Russian version named "Косметический ремонт remont" (Redecorating) has aired since 23 May 2011 on musical and entertainment channel Muz-TV. It is presented by the Russian theatre and television actress, Aleksandra Rebenok.
In Italy, the original British version is aired (dubbed in Italian language) on Real Time with the title "Dire, Fare, Baciare".

Consular identification card

Consular identification (CID) cards are issued by some governments to their citizens who are living in foreign countries. They are not certifications of legal residence within foreign countries, so CID card holders could be legal or illegal aliens. Issuing travel documents and passports are some of the functions performed by consular offices for their citizens. "According to the Department of State, issuance of CID cards falls within the general scope of permissible consular functions." The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 defined the allowable activities for consulate offices such as registering its citizens within foreign countries.
A report prepared for the United States Congress by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) acknowledges the controversy over the use of CID cards. It states that supporters of consular identification cards argue that they are important in a post 9/11 America to improve security and bring transactions out into the open where they can be monitored more as well as improve bilateral relations by notifying consulates when foreign nationals are detained. While others say CID cards are only needed "by aliens who are illegally present in the United States and serve to undermine U.S. immigration policy" and that at best better regulation is needed of these cards to "reinforce immigration policy and to defend against terrorism." Foreign governments are accused of "issuing consular identification cards in the United States for purposes other than those intended by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, namely to circumvent U.S. immigration law, and that the issuance of the cards should be subject to U.S. regulation."
In 2005, the REAL ID Act became law which requires that applicants for driver's licenses are "lawfully present in the United States" and that "an official passport is the only acceptable foreign identity document." In November 2004, the U.S. Congress restored funding for the Treasury Dept. to implement regulations that allow financial institutions to accept CID cards for banking (H.R. 4818/P.L. 108-447).
The 9/11 Commission recommended the U.S. establish standards for sources of identification, however required documents to acquire CID cards vary from country to country as displayed below in the chart 'Countries with Consular Identification (CID) Cards'.
The Argentinian Consulate in Los Angeles advertises their CID card's U.S. benefits for the colonies of Argentine citizens as a means to avoid deportation, board air planes, access to banking, credit, libraries, municipal programs and funerals.
The United States government does not issue CID cards, but recently has begun issuing the U.S. Passport Card to U.S. citizens for land and sea port re-entry into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda, but not for international air travel.

Venetian Festival along St. Joseph River

Venetian Festival is a festival full of music, activities, food, and other attractions that takes place on the St. Joseph River, in Saint Joseph, Michigan. Over the last 30 years the Festival has brought communities together and continues bring them together today. There are three traditions which have not changed since the first Festival: the Blessing of the River, Lighted Boat Parade, and a Classic Boat Parade.
History.
The Venetian Festival started in 1979, with the focus set on the beautiful beaches and river banks. The St.Joseph community wanted the Festival to be centered on the water, and wanted to residents and friends together. The name "Venetian Festival" was chosen because of the long and hot summer days, and boat rides that St.Joseph and Venice, Italy—where Venetian Festivals originated—have in common. Because St. Joseph is known as having boat rides, love songs, and couples holding hands, they believed that Venetian should be that and more.
In 1987 the USS Oliver Hazard Perry came to port, and the generous commander let the Festival-goers line up for a free tour. This initiated the many US Navy ships that have since came to the Festival. St.Joseph became so famous with the US sailors, it became known as "Port Paradise".
Music.
Music has been one of the biggest contributions to the success of this festival. There are three areas for the music to be heard: the Bluff, Shadowland Pavilion, and the Main Stage. Many local musicians come out and play on the Bluff and Pavilion, while well known bands play on the Main Stage. Beach Boys, Cheap Trick, Little Big Town, and Jason Micheal Carrol are just a four of the most recent bands who have played on the Main Stage.
Food.
Venetian Festival is a time when South West Michigan can bring out their finest foods inspired by cultures around the world. Each year they serve up many delicious and filling foods to the community. Fresh squeezed lemonade, Philly steak sandwiches, Polish and Italian sausage, and gyros are just a few of the most popular dishes that are served each year. Before getting your food, you have to exchange your cash for coupons, using that as your method of payment.
Competitions.
Many competitions take place along Silver Beach and the Saint Joseph River during this festival. The Lighted Boat Parade and the Classic Boat Display both take place along the St. Joseph River and have been a part of the Venetian Festival since 1987, when the first festival occurred, and fills the surroundings with warmth love. Volleyball tournaments, River run & walk, and sand sculpturing are some of the other competitions which take place during the festival.
Events.
Fireworks are one of the biggest attractions, bringing people from bigger cities such as Chicago. Along with the fireworks comes an assortment of rides which allows people of all ages enjoy a quick thrill. The Blessing of the river is done July 30, and continues as a tradition to this day. They also have many children events and local merchandisers set up along the bluff.

Shenyang (singer)

Shenyang (; born March 20, 1984) is a Chinese bass-baritone singer. His repertoire encompasses operatic roles, chamber music and Lieder recitals. 
Shenyang was born in Tianjin, the son of professional musicians, but did not start singing until the age of sixteen, after his voice broke. He took inspiration from recordings of the German Lieder singer Hans Hotter. At age nineteen, he entered the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where he studied at the Zhou Xiaoyan International Opera Center.
At the Conservatory, in early 2007 he attended a masterclass given by soprano Renée Fleming. She arranged vocal coaching for him that spring at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and he went on to win the 2007 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition. After the win, noting confusion in the Western press over the name "Shen Yang", he decided to change its spelling to "Shenyang".
Subsequently, he entered the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the artist diploma program at the Juilliard School. He gave the Juilliard's 2009 Alice Tully Vocal Arts Debut Recital, in which he sang a program in tribute to Hans Hotter, marking Hotter's centenary. His debut at the Metropolitan Opera came in April 2009, as Masetto in "Don Giovanni". He sang the role of Colline in "La Bohème" at the Met in February 2010.
Other awards he has won include a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award in 2008, and Montblanc New Voices at Saint Petersburg’s White Nights Festival in 2010.
In May 2011 he made a return visit to Shanghai to give a recital of Chinese art song at the Shanghai Grand Theatre, at which he declared his intention to promote that repertoire.

<doc id="21578794" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21578794" title="Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)">
Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)

Marc Edwards (born 1964) is a civil engineering/environmental engineer and the Charles P. Lunsford Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech.
An expert on water treatment and corrosion, Edwards's research on elevated lead levels in Washington, DC's municipal water supply gained national attention, changed the city's recommendations on water use in homes with lead service pipes, and caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to admit to publishing a report so rife with errors that a congressional investigation called it "scientifically indefensible". He is considered one of the world's leading experts in water corrosion in home plumbing, and a nationally recognized expert on copper corrosion.
Edwards was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2007. The program cited him for "playing a vital role in ensuring the safety of drinking water and in exposing deteriorating water-delivery infrastructure in America’s largest cities". In 2004, "Time" magazine featured him as one of the United States' most innovative scientists.
Biography.
Edwards, a native of the Buffalo, New York area, received a Bachelor of Science degree in biophysics from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1986. He received his Master of Science in 1988 and his Ph.D. in engineering in 1991 from the University of Washington.
Edwards taught at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech's department of civil and environmental engineering. From 2001 to 2005, he served as president of the board of directors for the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. He delivered Virginia Tech's Graduate School Commencement address on December 19, 2008.
He lives with his wife and two children in Blacksburg, Virginia.
Lead levels in Washington, DC water supply.
Edwards's research in the mid-1990s focused on an increasing incidence of pinhole leaks in copper water pipes. Homeowners contacted him about the leaks, some of which were occurring 18 months after installation. After a century of using copper for water pipes, the expectation is that they will last for 50 years in residential applications. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA) funded Edwards's research into the cause of the leaks.
A group of Washington, DC homeowners asked Edwards to investigate their corroding copper pipes in March 2003. Suspecting the water, he tested for lead. The accepted limit for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion (ppb). Edwards's meter, which could read values up to 140 ppb, showed off-the-scale readings even after he had diluted the sample to ten percent of its original strength. The water contained at least 1,250 ppb of lead. "Some of it would literally have to be classified as a hazardous waste", he said. At the time, WASA recommended that customers in areas served by lead pipes allow the water to run for 30 seconds to one minute as a precaution. Edwards's tests showed that the highest lead levels occurred 30 seconds to a few minutes after the tap was opened.
When Edwards brought his concerns to WASA, the agency threatened to withhold future monitoring data and research funding from him unless he stopped working with the homeowners. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discontinued its subcontract with him. With his funding cut off, Edwards paid his engineering students out of his own pocket so that they could continue the research.
After the "Washington Post" ran front-page stories in January 2004 about the problem, a Congressional hearing was held in March 2004 where Edwards testified. At the hearing, Edwards identified the cause of the readings as chloramine, a disinfecting chemical that had replaced chlorine in the water supply in March 2000. Chloramine-treated water, he said, picks up lead from pipes and solder and does not release it, resulting in elevated levels. Chloramine also doesn't break down over time, as chlorine does, so there is always some in the water system. Edwards also testified that WASA's attempts to replace lead pipes with copper pipes could exacerbate the problem, because the copper increases corrosion of the old lead.
Following the discontinuation of chloramine treatment in 2004, Edwards and his colleagues continued to study the long-term effects of the elevated water lead levels; their article "Elevated Blood Lead in Young Children Due to Lead-Contaminated Drinking Water", published in the journal "Environmental Science and Technology", won that publication's Editor's Choice Award for the best science paper of 2009. 
Referring to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that essentially dismissed the idea of health risks from DC's lead-contaminated water, Edwards wrote to James Stephens, the CDC's associate director of science: "Why is it that every child I have personal knowledge of, who had a strong chance of having elevated blood lead from water, is either deleted or otherwise misrepresented in the data that CDC has and used for this publication?" Edwards did not receive a response until March 2008, when Stephens wrote "We have examined CDC's role in the study and have found no evidence of misconduct."
As a result of Edwards's research, the United States House of Representatives' science and technology subcommittee conducted a congressional investigation into the matter. They concluded that the CDC made "scientifically indefensible" claims that the lead levels in DC were not harmful, knowingly using flawed data. In the wake of the investigation, Edwards called for the CDC paper's senior author to resign. The day after the House report was released, the CDC released a public statement admitting to their errors. James Elder, former national director of groundwater and drinking water for the EPA, said "Had Edwards not gotten involved, this would never have come out".
In 2010, the CDC said that 15,000 homes in the DC area might still have water supplies with dangerous levels of lead. Following Edwards's recommendation, the DC water authority now warns homeowners with lead water-supply lines to let the tap run for ten minutes before drinking or cooking.
During his work on the Washington water quality, said Bill Knocke, head of Virginia Tech's civil and environmental engineering department, Edwards was so concerned about the public health impact that he was hospitalized due to the stress.
Later work.
In 2006, Edwards suggested that the EPA testing procedure for lead in tap water could miss elevated levels because it called for homeowners to remove the aerator from their faucet before drawing water for testing. The screen in the aerator, he said, could trap lead particles; if so, water drawn for testing would not reflect the full lead exposure experienced by people drinking from the faucet under normal use.
In 2007, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill hired Edwards to investigate water-quality problems in three buildings. (When UNC asked its engineering faculty for guidance, their response was "We have two words for you—Marc Edwards.") He found "low-grade and fixable" lead contamination, which he blamed on "lead-free" brass plumbing fixtures. According to Edwards, Federal regulations permit up to 8 percent lead in "lead-free" brass fixtures, which can leach from the fixtures if the water is corrosive. He says that the Federal standard uses a water formulation that is remarkably tame compared to actual water supplies, allowing such fixtures to pass lead-leaching tests. Edwards provided a solution to UNC's problem: Accelerate the leaching of the lead by running each faucet at full flow for ten minutes, and then leaving it open at a trickle for three days, after which most of the lead had leached out.
In a 2008 radio interview, Edwards noted that the United States has over five million lead water pipes, many of which are nearing the end of their useful life. "In some cases, you can take a single glass of water," he said, "and if you're unlucky, and it has that piece of lead in it, you can get a very high dose of lead, similar to that which you could obtain by eating lead paint chips."
During the Society of Environmental Journalists' 2008 annual meeting, the group was given a tour of Edwards's lab. He told them that the number one cause of waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States is pathogens growing in home water heaters. Energy-conscious households may set their water heater's thermostat to , but that temperature encourages the growth of microbes such as mycobacteria. A setting of would kill such organisms. Edwards says that infections from inhaling steam from contaminated water in the shower, or contact with contaminated water in a hot tub, kill an estimated 3,000 to 12,000 Americans each year.
Responding to a 2009 Associated Press investigation of contaminants found in the drinking water of schools across the United States, Edwards was quoted as saying "If a landlord doesn't tell a tenant about lead paint in an apartment, he can go to jail. But we have no system to make people follow the rules to keep school children safe?"
Edwards has also warned about the unintended effects of state-of-the-art water conservation techniques being used in new buildings. Systems such as rainwater capture and water recycling, he says, may reduce the flow of water from the city's system so much that the water remains in the plumbing for as much as three weeks before use. This can cause the water to pick up lead and grow bacteria. He has called for a more holistic approach to water quality monitoring.
In 2011, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Public Health Law Research Program funded a $450,000 study of the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, an EPA regulation relating to drinking water. Edwards will spearhead the study.

Billy Bryans

William Taylor "Billy" Bryans (September 15, 1947 – April 23, 2012) was a Canadian percussionist, songwriter, music producer and DJ, known as one of the founders of The Parachute Club, among other accomplishments in music. As a producer, he worked on projects for artists as diverse as Dutch Mason, Raffi, Lillian Allen and the Downchild Blues Band. He was born in Montreal, but spent most of his adult life in Toronto, and was particularly supportive of world music as both a promoter and publicist, focusing on bringing Caribbean, Cuban and Latin American music to a wider audience.
Career.
Bryans' childhood was spent in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, where he was associated with his first professional band, M.G. and The Escorts. This band released three singles, and primarily played in the area bounded by Montreal, Ottawa, Brockville and Kingston, including gigs at Expo 67 and as the opening act at a Montreal concert by The Beach Boys. Bryans was also a high school friend of Jack Layton, whom Layton credited with giving him the advice that led to his successfully being elected president of their high school student council.
After graduating with a degree in English literature from Sir George Williams University, Bryans moved from Montreal to Toronto with his group Theodore's Smokeshop in 1970, and soon developed a reputation as a musician, engineer and record producer in the burgeoning counterculture scene around Rochdale College. He quickly became associated with the Downchild Blues Band, including as producer of the band's first notable hit single, "Flip, Flop and Fly", and as the engineer on the band's seminal album, "Bootleg" (1971), thought to be the first artist-produced and independently distributed album in Canadian history. In 1972, Theodore's Smokeshop, now renamed Horn, recorded its only album, "On the People's Side", with Bryans performing as percussionist, sound remixer and co-producer.
During the 1970s, Bryans continued to develop his reputation as a musician, engineer and producer, working on records by the Time Twins, The BobCats and the Downchild Blues Band. Daniel Lanois credited Bryans' sonic experimentation as one of the inspirations behind the development of his own distinctive production style.
In 1979, he was introduced to Lorraine Segato, who was then the lead singer and a principal songwriter with Mama Quilla II. The two have collaborated musically since that time. Their first collaboration was the band V, playing a mix of funk, soca and reggae music with Mojah, then the lead singer of the Toronto reggae band Truth and Rights. Bryans also sometimes performed with Mama Quilla II; as the only man performing with an otherwise all-female band, his bandmates jokingly gave him a T-shirt which read "Token Male".
The next collaboration of Bryans and Segato was The Parachute Club. Prior to that time, Bryans was the drummer for the Toronto new wave and art punk band The Government, while Segato continued her association with Mama Quilla II. The Parachute Club was formed in the summer of 1982, in response to an invitation to Bryans to play at a party at the Toronto International Film Festival. Based on the performance invitation, Bryans and Segato formed a band which ultimately became The Parachute Club. While working with Parachute Club, Bryans also continued to work as a producer, most notably on Lillian Allen's Juno Award winning reggae albums "Revolutionary Tea Party" and "Conditions Critical". In 1987, he also recorded a rearrangement of Moe Koffman's "Curried Soul", which CBC Radio One continues to use to this day as the introductory music to the second half-hour of its nightly news program "As It Happens".
Following Parachute Club's breakup, Bryans continued to work as a producer for artists such as AfroNubians, Raffi and Punjabi by Nature, as well as doing session work for musicians such as George Fox, Loketo and Buffy Sainte-Marie. He produced "The Gathering", a compilation album of Canadian world music artists which won the inaugural Juno Award for World Music Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1992. In 1997, Bryans was one of the producers and mixers associated with the film soundtrack to the Disney movie "Jungle 2 Jungle", which featured much African music.
In the 2000s, he focused extensively on promoting Latin music in Canada, playing a prominent role in the emergence of artists such as Laura Fernandez, Aline Morales and Alex Cuba.
In 2006, Bryans announced that he was suffering from lung cancer, and was incapacitated for a period of months, commencing in April of that year. In August 2006, in celebration of his recovery, a number of notable Toronto musicians performed a benefit in Bryans' honour. In early 2012, it was announced that Bryans' cancer had returned and he was in palliative care. Another benefit concert was held on April 19 at Toronto's Lula Lounge to help defray his healthcare costs. He died a few days later in Toronto, on April 23, at age 62.

Fourier domain mode locking

Fourier domain mode locking (FDML) is a laser modelocking technique that creates trains of frequency swept laser pulses.
A Fourier domain mode locked laser consists of a ring cavity of length formula_1 with tunable optical bandpass filter and gain element. For FDML operation, the filter tuning frequency formula_2 needs to match the inverse cavity roundtrip time formula_3 or a i-th harmonic thereof,
with the group speed of light formula_5 in the cavity.
A basic FDML laser configuration - as shown in the figure - consists of a:
A main application for FDML lasers is optical coherence tomography.
New work suggests that FDML lasers are suitable for the generation of short pulses in the range of 60 picoseconds. Furthermore the work suggests that FDML lasers could overcome the limitations of conventional pulsed laser operation. Here, the energy of the light field is optically stored in the delay fiber, enabling high energy pulses to be produced directly with a low-power semiconductor laser. Shorter pulses in the femtosecond regime might be possible in the future.

<doc id="21578820" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21578820" title="The Paper Cranes">
The Paper Cranes

The Paper Cranes are a Canadian indie pop band from Victoria, British Columbia. The band is composed of the husband and wife duo of Ryan McCullagh (Guitar, Bass, Vocals) and Miranda Roach (Keyboard, Drum Sequencing). Despite several line-up changes during their career the group remains centered around the husband-wife team. The band take their name from the book, "Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes" by Eleanor Coerr.
History.
The band was formed in January 2005 by multi-instrumentalist Ryan McCullagh (Vocals, Guitar, Keyboard), James Watson (Drums), John Quissy (Bass), and Mark Vondrasek (Guitar). The group recorded 5 demo songs together including early versions of "I'll Love You Until My Veins Explode", "Out On The Horse Tracks", and, "Deus Ex Machinegun" which circulated on the internet though the recordings were never officially released. 
In the summer of 2005 Greg Ipp, a Toronto DJ and music blogger, founded Unfamiliar Records and signed The Paper Cranes. In the autumn of that year Miranda Roach joined the group as their keyboard player. Following some opening slots for Wolf Parade and Pretty Girls Make Graves the band recorded their untitled debut EP usually referred to as the "Veins EP." The Album was recorded at Mushroom Studios in Vancouver BC and was engineered and produced by Howard Redekopp. In December 2005 Ryan and Miranda were married.
The Veins Ep was released on Unfamiliar Records as the label's first release in the spring of 2006. The single, "Ill Love You Until My Veins Explode" was given a 4 star rating by Pitchforkmedia.com. Shortly after, Mark Vondrasek left the band and a few months later, following the band's first Canadian tour James Watson and John Quissy both left as well to finish their degrees at the University of Victoria. 
In 2007, The Paper Cranes recruited Braeden Paterson (Guitar), Mark Lavoie (Bass), and Evan Middleton (Drums) to record their first full-length album, Halcyon Days. The album was recorded at The Hive Studio in Burnaby, BC by Jessie Gander over 3 days. Most of the album was recorded live from the studio floor. Shortly after the recording of Halcyon Days, "I'll Love You Until My Veins Explode" and "Milkrun" from the Veins Ep were released in the UK as the double-A side single, "I'll Love You Until My Veins Explode/Milkrun" on the Longest Mile label, owned in part by Ross Millard of The Futureheads. Halcyon Days was released in February 2008 on Unfamiliar Records. 
After the release of "Halcyon Days" Evan Middleton left the band. Mark Lavoie continued to perform with The Paper Cranes but subsequently left to tour with fellow Victoria musicians, Maurice. 
James Alexander Bodman and Jeffrey Mitchelmore of the Victoria indie-rock band, The Racoons joined the group in 2008 and both can be heard on The Paper Cranes' 2009 online-only single, "Telephone."
In the August 2009 The Paper Cranes released their second full length album, Chivalry's Dead on Unfamiliar Records. The album was recorded over 2 months in the Spring of 2009 at Mankind Studio in Victoria BC. Grand Piano on the album was recorded at The Victoria Conservatory of Music. 
Shortly after the release of Chivalry's Dead, citing scheduling conflicts with the supporting band's other musical projects,The Paper Cranes' core members Miranda Roach and Ryan McCullagh restructured the band as a duet utilizing drum loops and electronic instruments to take the place of live back-up musicians. 
In the fall of 2008, "Rabbit in a Snare" from the band's "Veins" Ep was featured in a Canadian television commercial for the Nissan Rogue and in 2009 The Paper Cranes were voted Victoria's Favorite Band at the 2009 Monday Magazine M Awards.
Their music has been playlisted on CBC Radio 3.

Greenline (Pennsylvania)

The Greenline was a proposed $138 million mass transit line for the Upper Schuylkill Valley region in southeastern Pennsylvania in the United States. The line was advocated by the group Citizens for the Train. Grant money needed to fund a feasibility study was not successfully obtained. As of 2012, there are no plans to move forward with the project.
Planning.
Citizens for the Train spearheaded the Greenline's planning stages, and concluded a preliminary study (performed by engineering firm Gannett Fleming Inc.) to determine the feasibility of the project. The group compiled $250,000 for an alternative analysis to see if a different transportation project, such as widening roads or adding bus routes, would work better. The study was slated for completion by the end of 2009.
Citizens for the Train pursued an estimated $1.5 million for an environmental and engineering study. Funding for the project was sought from both public and private sources.
Due to the ill-fated $2 billion Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) project, the Greenline proposal received support from regional politicians and businesses. The Greenline remains part of the Chester County Transportation Improvements Inventory (TII) document for 2009-2010. No funding has been allocated for design or construction.
Route.
The proposed route was to originate in Oaks, Pennsylvania, with the Oaks terminal situated at the new Greater Philadelphia Expo Center At Oaks. The route would utilize Norfolk Southern Railway's (NS) derelect 11-mile Phoenixville Industrial Track (former Pennsylvania Railroad Frazer Branch), with an additional seven miles of new railway construction built between end-of-track in Devault (where trains will be stored) and the current Amtrak/SEPTA Paoli Station.
The bulk of the route is the Phoenixville Industrial Track. Never a prominent line, the route gained momentum in its later years. With aid from PennDOT, the single-track line received a substantial infrastructure upgrade via Conrail in the late 1980s. New wooden ties were laid, and drainage was significantly improved. In addition, grade crossings received additional protective hardware, including flashers and gates. Freight service continued through 2004, when sole customer American Sweetener Corporation, whose plant was located at the end of the line in Devault, closed its doors. NS applied to officially discontinue rail service on the line in October 2007, which became effective that December.
The route transverses the Pickering Valley region, terminating at SEPTA's heavily used Paoli/Thorndale Line of commuter rail. Paoli Station also hosts Amtrak's "Keystone Service" and "Pennsylvanian", serving trains en route to Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and New York City.
Equipment.
Diesel-electric DMUs.
Several options for train equipment were being considered. One is the Stadler GTW-built diesel-electric DMU (diesel multiple unit) cars used on New Jersey Transit's River LINE. Equipment was to be stored at the unused depot in Devault; these tracks were previously used by the Maslo paper company.
The RiverLINE's unique rail cars offer a tighter turning radius than typical main line light rail vehicles, and thus are capable of the street running needed on Morehall Road. The rail cars are also used regularly in Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
RDCs.
Another less expensive option was refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, which last carried passengers through Phoenixville in July 1981 when SEPTA terminated all diesel trains between Pottsville and Philadelphia.

Deloss Walker

Vernon Deloss Walker (August 14, 1931 – April 19, 1996) was a notable advertising executive and political campaign consultant. Walker founded the Memphis, Tennessee-based advertising firm Walker + Associates, Inc. in October 1965. Walker played a major role in politics, corporate marketing and philanthropy throughout the South from the 1960s to 1990s.
Political Campaign Consulting.
Noted by "Time" magazine as a political Media Mesmerist, Walker and his firm consulted with and managed the successful campaigns of some of the South’s most preeminent politicians including Albert Gore, Jr., and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Bill Clinton and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Fob James of Alabama and Joe Frank Harris of Georgia.
Recalling Alabama's 1978 Governor’s race in which Fob James defeated a number of seasoned political veterans, Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers wrote, "Fob realized he was no political professional ... so he sought out professional advice. He had the money to think big and wanted to know who the best political consultant in the South was. It was an easy answer: Deloss Walker, a political public relations genius who lived in Memphis, Tenn. His track record for electing governors of southern states was 5–0. The scenario was the same for all five upset victories. He took an obscure, unknown candidate and elected him governor over a well-known incumbent or favorite. He had just taken an unknown school board member named Dale Bumpers and made him Governor of Arkansas. Deloss Walker was the most renowned and expensive political guru in the country in 1977."
In his 1998 autobiography Joe Frank Harris, "Personal Reflections on a Public Life", the former Governor of Georgia recalls the hiring of Deloss Walker and Walker + Associates to run his campaign in 1982: "The broadcast and newspaper media are, of course, a potent force, and if you can gain access to them effectively and with enough repetition, you can move name identification along very quickly. We were able to do that with the assistance of Deloss Walker and Walker and Associates, a public relations group from Memphis, Tennessee whom I had met though a mutual friend…At the time we signed on Deloss had handled some fifty political campaigns and had won all but two of them."
Advertising Agency Leader.
Deloss Walker's firm, Walker + Associates, Inc. has served a variety of notable clients, including the regional co-op for McDonald's, the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development, and Lucite International. In 1987, Deloss Walker was named the Silver Medal Award winner. The award is the Memphis Advertising Federation's highest honor, recognizing an "entire career of outstanding accomplishment and contribution in advertising."
Since 1996, the firm has been led by president and chief executive officer Ceil Walker.
Early years.
Deloss Walker was born in O'Kean, Ark. He attended Southern Baptist College, in Walnut Ridge, Ark. Walker served in the Korean War and was awarded the Bronze Star in combat in the battle of Heartbreak Ridge. Before founding Walker + Associates, Inc. advertising agencey, Deloss Walker was general manager of Jonesboro, Arkansas radio station KNEA.
Community involvement.
Deloss Walker led or supported many initiatives to improve the community. In 1996, the Memphis Symphony honored Deloss and Ceil Walker with the Hebe Award for outstanding contributions and service to the arts. That year, well-known historian Shelby Foote was also honored by the Symphony with its Amphion Award.
Walker + Associates Today.
The communications agency Deloss Walker founded in 1965 continues to operate today. In fact, many of Walker + Associates' clients have stayed with the agency long-term, including McDonald's, which has been a client for more than 23 years.
The agency continues to win industry awards such as International MarCom Creative, Communicator, ADDY, and VOX awards, among others. On March 30, 2013, the Commercial Appeal highlighted four awards (two ADDYs and two International MarCom Creative Awards) given to Walker + Associates for videos created for the DeSoto County (Miss.) CVB / Tourism Association. On March 13, 2009, the Memphis Business Journal highlighted Walker + Associates' platinum International MarCom award for a movie poster parody titled "No Country for Old Couches."

3 on 3 NHL Arcade

3 on 3 NHL Arcade is an NHL-licensed arcade-style hockey sports game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, using the "NHL 09" engine. The game was developed by "NHL 09"'s EA Canada under the EA Sports Freestyle banner.
A demo for the game is available on the PlayStation 3 version of "NHL 11" and "NHL 12". For "NHL 13", there is a code to unlock the whole game.
Gameplay.
As the name implies, the game is pared down to single contests of three NHL players plus one goalie per team, who are big head versions of their actual selves. Online gamers have nicknamed the game 'Blorp' as a shoutout to the sound effects heard within the game's menu. The game allows for multiplayer online and off-line play. The game is played on a 'first to...' basis rather than within a set time limit, meaning there can be a near-unlimited amount of periods per match. Powerups can be obtained which can give advantages to either team.

The Tale of the Unknown Island

"The Tale of the Unknown Island" () is a short story by Portuguese author José Saramago. It was published in Portuguese in 1997, and English in 1999.
Plot.
A man requests the king to give him a boat so he can go in search for the unknown island. The King questions him about the existence of such an island and tries to convince the man that all islands already appear on maps. The man states that only the known islands do. This debate concludes with the king granting him a boat.
During the following passages the man's quest to know himself expands into greater introspection. There he finds, much to his amazement, that the journey of exploration has started even before he has set the sails on the ship. He brings the floor cleaner from the Castle of the King to help him in his journey. Throughout the trip the two reveal feelings for each other and, perhaps, though it is not certain, they discover the Unknown Island.
Writing Style.
Saramago greatly uses uncomplicated yet metaphor-rich language instrumental in the development of the story. This book, while only a short story and using comparatively lighter themes than in other books, has everything that Saramago is known for: criticism of bureaucracy, discovering the unknown, a smooth text flow and profound messages in concise sentences. Saramago was awarded Nobel prize in literature a year after this book was published in 1998.

<doc id="21579017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21579017" title="Andy's Gang">
Andy's Gang

"Andy's Gang" was a children's television program that ran on NBC from August 20, 1955, to December 31, 1960. It was hosted by actor Andy Devine and was the successor to the radio and television programs "Smilin' Ed McConnell and his Buster Brown Gang", later shortened to "Smilin' Ed's Gang". Devine took over the television program when Ed McConnell died suddenly from a heart attack in 1954. He inherited a number of the characters on the earlier show and the sponsor, Buster Brown shoes.
The cast for the programs included:
Smilin' Ed.
The green puppet, Froggy the Gremlin, appeared in a puff of smoke ("Hi Ya, Kids, Hiya, Hiya, Hiya!") and was always interrupting the story and causing trouble.
On the original programs, Smilin' Ed McConnell started the show with "Hiya kids" followed by the audience singing the sponsor's song (Buster Brown Shoes) "I got shoes, you got shoes, everybody's got to have shoes, but there's only one kind of shoe for me-good old Buster Brown shoes!" Then Ed said "Thank you buddies and sweethearts. Good old Buster Brown shoes are on the air out here in Hollywood for another good old Saturday hullabaloo."
Originally, the show was filmed in front of a live audience but, as McConnell's health deteriorated, they used prefilmed children's reaction shots intercut with the studio performance.
The backdrop was a clubhouse. Produced on a very small budget, the show was a success - bringing the Buster Brown advertising characters to life and helping to sell millions of shoes based on icons that had existed for decades. It was also one of the first children's shows filmed in Hollywood.
Music and stories from Smilin' Ed's Storybook were regular features. The show also featured "Gunga, the East India Boy," a serial set in India. Led by The Maharajah, Gunga Ram and his pal Rama set out on great adventures around the village of Bakore in filmed segments.
The most popular segment was the visit from Froggy the Gremlin who would appear when Smilin' Ed yelled his famous catch-phrase, "Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!" This same phrase was later used by Andy Devine.
McConnell died of a heart attack in 1954, and Andy Devine took over the show in 1955.
Andy Devine.
The show then went to the rough voiced, gentle giant, Andy Devine, who had earlier appeared as Jingles on "The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok" show with Guy Madison. The studio reaction shots were again intercut and Devine did his segments without a live audience. This also allowed some limited special effects such as when Froggy appeared or disappeared.
The show began with Andy sitting in a big easy chair reading from a book, Andy's Stories, which were illustrated by film clips. Regular characters were Midnight the Cat, Squeeky the Mouse (portrayed by a hamster), and Grandie the Talking Piano. Midnight, a big black cat, would sometimes operate an organ grinder. Midnight would also sometimes say "Nice" in a falsetto meow when asked what she thought about something.
In filmed segments, Gunga Ram was an Indian boy played by Nino Marcel. Gunga (Ghanga Rama during Smilin' Ed's tenure) and his friend Rama (Vito Scotti) helped out the Majarajah.
Comic actor Billy Gilbert regularly appeared on the show and was often interrupted by Froggy or told to do what Froggy wanted. The enraged Gilbert would then chase Froggy until he disappeared. One surviving clip shows Vito Scotti trying to explain singing, while Froggy keeps interrupting or making fun of him; eventually, Scotti tries to grab Froggy but the gremlin suddenly disappears.
Devine closed with, " "Yes, sir, we're pals, and pals stick together. And now, gang, don't forget church or Sunday school."
Legacy.
Some of the original filmed programs hosted by Andy Devine have survived, including a few segments filmed in color near the end of the show's run in 1960. Both VHS and DVD home videos have been issued of the programs. Clips of the telecasts are available on several websites. The entire inventory, over a ton of filmed programs and presumably the broadcast rights, are the property of Hubbard Broadcasting, St. Paul/Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Buckner & Garcia paid tribute to Smilin' Ed McConnell and Froggy the Gremlin on a 1982 novelty song "Froggy's Lament" about the Sega arcade game Frogger from their album "Pac-Man Fever" with its lyrics "Hiya kids" and "Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!".

City identification card

In the United States, a city (or municipal) identification card is a form of identification card issued by a municipality, such as a city, rather than a state or federal government. Under federal law, cities may issue their own identification cards as they see fit, and do not have to consider the immigration or criminal status of an applicant before doing so. New Haven, Connecticut issued the first municipal identification cards in the United States, the Elm City Resident Card, in 2007. On January 15, 2009, the city/county of San Francisco launched the SF City ID Card, a municipal identification card program modeled after New Haven's. Other cities that issue identification cards include Asbury Park, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C. (DC One Card). In Mercer County, New Jersey, a community ID card is being issued by a local non profit organization with the endorsement of various law enforcement agencies.

Los Angeles.
On November 8, 2012, the Los Angeles City Council voted 12 to 1 to solicit proposals for a municipal identification card. It will be modeled on the Oakland City ID system.
Oakland, California.
The city of Oakland, California, has debated a proposed municipal identification system, which would include a debit card function, for all city residents, regardless of immigration status, a move backed by the Oakland City ID Card Coalition. On September 13, 2011, the Oakland City Council decided to wait for a cost and feasibility study to be completed by late October before proceeding, hoping to begin issuing ID cards in 2012, barring any unforeseen circumstances. This, however, extended into 2012, with the City Council voting in favor of the final portion of the program on October 16, 2012. The first cards of the program are slated to be issued on February 1
Richmond, California.
On July 5, 2011, the Richmond city council voted unanimously to issue municipal identification cards to Richmond residents, regardless of immigration status. In a letter to the council urging passage of the measure, a city council member and the mayor argued that "many Richmond residents lack the necessary forms of official identification that are required to access financial institutions, jobs, housing, and protections for the home and workplace. These residents include immigrants, children, students, the homeless, transgender people, the indigent, the disabled, the elderly, runaway youth, and adult survivors of domestic violence." The program will be administered by a third-party vendor at no cost to the city.
San Francisco, California.
In November 2007, the board of supervisors of San Francisco voted to issue municipal ID cards to residents of the city, regardless of immigration status. The cards were officially launched on January 15, 2009. Proof of identity and of city residence is required.
Other states.
Washington, D.C..
The city of Washington, D.C. issues the DC One Card to legal residents or visitors of the U.S., though some services may be available only to residents of the District. (Some illegal aliens may get the card if they have been issued a state driver's license or state non-driver ID card by one of the states that issues these credentials to illegal immigrants, such as New Mexico, Utah, and Washington; or a school ID card.) The DC One Card is a consolidated credential designed to give adults and children access to DC government facilities and programs that was designed to help the District consolidate printing ID cards and save money. The DC One Card is also a building access card for DC government employees. For all public school secondary students and those who request it, the card includes immediate Metro SmarTrip® capability to help them travel.
New Haven, Connecticut.
The Elm City Resident Card is an ID card used in New Haven, Connecticut, in the United States. The card was originally designed to protect the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 illegal immigrants in New Haven from being robbed or assaulted. All city residents can receive the card, which serves as a form of identification, debit card with a capacity of $150, library card, and a way to pay for parking meters. The cards were first issued in July 2007, and were the first municipal identification cards issued in the United States. The card costs $5 for children or $10 for adults.
Asbury Park, New Jersey.
Asbury Park issues an identification card to city residents.
Mercer County, New Jersey.
Starting in April 2011, the Mercer County Area Community ID Card is being issued with the endorsement of the offices of the Mercer County Sheriff, the Mercer County Prosecutor, and the police departments of several municipalities, including Trenton, Princeton Borough and Princeton Township, West Windsor, Ewing Township and Plainsboro. The card is issued by the non profit Latin American Legal Defense and Education Fund (LALDEF) and is accepted by law enforcement agencies, municipal agencies, clinics, hospitals, libraries, social service agencies, and many stores and banks. Although is not an official government ID card, it facilitates access to basic community services to those who are unable to obtain other documents such as immigrants, youth, homeless persons, and those in recovery or re-entry programs. This card replaces the Trenton and Princeton Community ID cards that were issued in 2009 and 2010.
New York City.
In July 2007, a New York City councilman proposed setting up a municipal identity system for New York City residents similar to the New Haven plan. However, after opposition developed the proposal was shelved.
On February 10, 2014, in his first State of the City address, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new plan to create a New York City municipal identification card, which would be available to all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status. While any city resident could obtain a card, the mayor announced it as a way to allow city residents who lack legal immigration status in the United States to access municipal and private services and facilities that require photo identification. If the plan were enacted, the card would be made available by the end of 2014.

William H. Latham is a 77 ton icebreaker owned and operated by the New York Power Authority on the Niagara River.
Named after William H. Latham, a senior engineer with the Power Authority who died in 1987, her mission is to keep the Power Authority's inlet ports clear of ice. Occasionally, she is used to break open the Buffalo river, or the Lake Erie ice boom for emergency repairs. "William H. Latham" has been used for DEC fish stocking out of the Dunkirk Harbor, search and rescue for downed aircraft, and search duties for missing hikers on frozen Lake Erie.
During emergencies two crews have worked twelve-hour shifts to keep the vessel at work twenty-four hours a day.
The vessel's design and construction was overseen by Randy D. Crissman.
"William H. Latham" is assisted by a second vessel, a modified tugboat, known only as "Breaker".
Ontario Hydro operates a similar vessel, "Niagara Queen", to clear the inlet ports for hydroelectric power generators on the Canadian side.

Michael Collins (footballer born 1977)

Michael Collins (born 16 September 1977 in Belfast) is a retired professional footballer who last played for Irish League club Crusaders.
Early career.
Collins started his career at Cliftonville, before leaving for unsuccessful spells in England with Sheffield United and Darlington, before returning to Cliftonville in 1996.
Cliftonville.
Collins was an integral part of the Reds side that won the Irish League title in 1998 – the first time the club had been champions in 88 years.
Three years later an incident during an UEFA Intertoto Cup tie brought his time with the club to an end. Collins had already been sent-off when he head-butted an opponent on his way off the pitch Laurence Stitt, the manager at the time, suspended Collins and put him on the transfer list.
Portadown.
He then joined Portadown and won the league in his first season at Shamrock Park, followed by the Irish Cup three years later.
Unfortunately, Reds boss Ronnie McFall began to see his services as an unaffordable luxury, such was the regularity of his run-ins with officials. He was forced to substitute Collins in a pre season friendly against his old club Sheffield United F.C. in July 2007. Collins returned from a lengthy ban to see red in his first and only 2007–08 Irish League Cup appearance. He famously pushed IFA referee Alan Black in the chest after being sent off for elbowing Newry City's Stephen Ferguson and was given a lengthy suspension. Such was his fiery temper, McFall finally lost patience with him and he was made available to other clubs.
He was also sent off at VMFD Žalgiris Vilnius in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup 
Newry City.
In December 2007 Newry City ironically stepped in to avail of his assets. He was given a one and a half-year contract.
His first game was in the reserves where he scored the winner against former club Cliftonville. He was then drafted into the first team and settled into the centre midfield position. He became a very important player and helped Newry to one of their best ever runs in the league.
Dundalk.
Collins' contract ended in February 2009 and was subsequently signed by Dundalk. However, he failed to get international clearance and was prevented from playing competitively until July. He did play in several pre-season friendlies, including the annual Jim Malone Cup match against Drogheda, where he was sent off early in the first half after clashing with Gavin Whelan. He finally played for the Lilywhites against Derry City and was influential as they won 1–0. He scored twice in a match versus Galway United which they comfortably won 3–0 at Terryland Park. He also started the following week in the 4–2 win against Drogheda United and Dundalk's good form at the present is largely thanks to Collins' contribution. Collins' was released at the end of Dundalk's season by the board after the Dundalk Manager Sean Connor's contract was not renewed.
Crusaders.
He signed for Crusaders on 20 November 2009. He made his debut against old club Portadown on 2 January, and helped the side to the County Antrim Shield. He scored his only goal against Coleraine on 23 January. However he was released after just four months for financial reasons. After having preliminary talks with Donegal Celtic prior to the 2010/11 season, he decided to retire from football.

Council on Foreign Economic Policy

The U.S. Council on Foreign Economic Policy (CFEP) was a high-level organization created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1954 to coordinate the development of the foreign economic policy of the United States.
On July 12, 1954 the President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization chairman Nelson Rockefeller and the director of the Bureau of the Budget Rowland Hughes recommended to President Eisenhower that a detailed study be made of the adequacy of executive branch organization for the development and coordination of foreign economic policy. Eisenhower agreed that such a study was needed and ordered them to conduct the study, and to secure a top-notch individual to direct the necessary staff work. The individual selected to make the study was Joseph M. Dodge. Dodge spent the next three months contacting various government agencies and analyzing their roles in the field of foreign economic policy. In his final report to the President, dated November 22, 1954, Dodge recommended the creation of a White House staff organization devoted exclusively to the orderly development of foreign economic policy as the best method of ensuring proper coordination between the various agencies.
On December 11, 1954, the President sent a letter to Joseph Dodge which became the authority for the CFEP. Dodge was appointed a Special Assistant to the President and given the responsibility of assuring the effective coordination of foreign economics policy matters among the various executive agencies. The basic members of the CFEP were to be the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration. Ex officio members were to be the President’s Administrative Assistant for Economic Affairs, the President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The first meeting of the CFEP, on December 22, 1954 was basically an organizational meeting to acquaint members with the CFEP and its responsibilities. Policy issues were not discussed in earnest until the second meeting on January 4, 1955. Thereafter the CFEP met on a weekly basis while the most pressing policy problems were debated. 
Dodge resigned from the CFEP on July 10, 1956 and Clarence Randall succeeded Dodge as CFEP chairman. Clarence Randall was a long-time official of the Inland Steel Company of Chicago, Illinois, and in 1948 served as a steel consultant for the Economic Cooperation Administration in Paris, where he became involved in the planning of Western Europe’s steel production. In August 1953 President Eisenhower appointed Randall chairman of the President’s Commission on Foreign Economic Policy (commonly known as the Randall Commission), an ad hoc body created by Congress to study the foreign trade policy of the United States.
In addition to resolving policy disputes, the CFEP often conducted detailed studies of various aspects of foreign economic policy. Although this was sometimes done at the CFEP’s own initiative, the studies were usually made at the request of an executive agency to help the agency formulate policy. Because of its role as a coordinator, the CFEP often acted as a clearinghouse of information on foreign economic policy. One major activity of the CFEP staff was the preparation of a Handbook on Foreign Economic Policy. This was a collection of abstracts of presidential statements and government policy papers which describe the U.S. position on all aspects of foreign economic policy. The Handbook was distributed to many government agencies where it served as a useful reference work in the determination of policy matters.
During the last two months of the Eisenhower administration the amount of work of the CFEP decreased as the government prepared for the transition to the Kennedy administration. The last CFEP meeting was held on December 20, 1960.

Fairytale (Alexander Rybak song)

"Fairytale" is a song written and composed by Norwegian violinist/singer Alexander Rybak, and the first single from Rybak's debut album "Fairytales". This song was the winner of the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow, Russia.
Writing and inspiration.
In February 2009, Norwegian media reported that "Fairytale" is about Rybak's ex-girlfriend Ingrid Berg Mehus whom he got to know through the Barratt Due Institute of Music in Oslo. Rybak has since confirmed this. At a press conference in May 2009 he revealed that the song's inspiration came from the Huldra, a beautiful female creature from Scandinavian folklore, who lures young men to her, and then may curse them for all time. The Russian-language version of the song is entitled "Skazka" ().
Eurovision 2009.
The song was elected through the Norwegian festival Melodi Grand Prix 2009 on 21 February, winning in the biggest landslide of the contest's history, and competed against eighteen other Eurovision entries in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, where it qualified for the final. The final took place on 16 May and the song won with 387 points – a new ESC record. It was Norway's third Eurovision Song Contest win.
The backing dancers for the Eurovision performance, Sigbjørn Rua, Torkjell Lunde Børsheim and Hallgrim Hansegård, are from the Norwegian dance company Frikar, performing the folk dance halling.
The backing singers, Jorunn Hauge and Karianne Kjærnes, wore long pink dresses designed by Norwegian designer Leila Hafzi.
Music video.
The first official music video for the song, which was used to present the song before the Eurovision final, was Alexander Rybak's Performance at the Melodi Grand Prix 2009 in Norway. The most recent video was of Alexander Rybak playing the Violin and singing with his backing dancers behind him, where the background occasionally changes from white to black.
A video of Rybak's performance of the song at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest final in Moscow, was chosen by YouTube as one of its 31 most memorable videos of 2009.
Record.
In the Norwegian preselection, Melodi Grand Prix 2009, Rybak's "Fairytale" won with a combined televote and jury score of 747,888, in the biggest victory of the contest's history. The song received over 600,000 votes more than the runner-up, which made it the clearest win in the history of Melodi Grand Prix.
At the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, Rybak won with the highest recorded score since the contest began, with 387 points (out of a maximum of 492), surpassing Lordi's 2006 record of 292. His average score of 9.4 points from every voting nation was the highest since the wide use of televoting began in 1998. Rybak received sixteen scores of 12 points, also a new record, surpassing the previous record of ten held by Katrina and the Waves (1997) and Helena Paparizou (2005); this record was surpassed in 2012, by Loreen, who received eighteen.
Charts.
The song also debuted on the Norwegian Singles Chart on the week of 11 February 2009 at number 3, before rising to number one on the following week, the week of the Melodi Grand Prix final. This was the first time that the Melodi Grand Prix winner reached number 1 before winning the contest. The song remained at number 1 for 8 consecutive weeks. The song has since entered the Swedish Sverigetopplistan, debuting at number 47, before rising to number 7 in its third week, the week of Eurovision - eventually reaching the top spot. After the song gaining the Top Spot on Eurovision, it entered the Top Ten of many Charts across Europe, and also the No. 1 position in many countries. The song debuted on the UK charts at #10 on Downloads Alone and then dropped to #38 the next week, it also reached Number 3 on the Download Chart. "Fairytale" is the ninth non-UK Eurovision entry to reach the top ten in the UK charts since the contest began in 1956, most recently Johnny Logan reached #2 representing Ireland in 1987. It sold over 8,000 copies in Finland which means it received a Gold certification, 20,000 copies in Norway thus getting a Gold certification and 200,000 copies in Russia and therefore it was certified platinum.
Russian certification.
The single went multi-platinum in different formats in Russia. It first went platinum as realtone/ full track and sold 100,000 copies. Then it was certified 2x platinum as ring-back tone with another 400,000 copies sold.
Combined sales of the song are 500,000 copies without online downloads.

Robert Bruce Raup (March 21, 1888 – April 13, 1976), was a Professor in the Philosophy of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University. He was a well-known writer in the 1930s, whose writings were influenced by his own teacher and mentor, the American philosopher John Dewey. Like his mentor, Professor Raup is often associated with the pedagogical concept of promoting practical ("i.e. pragmatic") judgment as something appropriate and necessary within the context of a modern democratic society. He was best known for his criticism of the American public education system, which he claimed was inadequate and ineffective in its methods.
Life.
R. Bruce Raup was born in Clark County, Ohio to Gustavas Philip and Fanny Mitchell Raup on March 21, 1888. As a young man he attended public school first in Lagonda and later in Springfield, Ohio.

It's America

"It's America" is the third studio album by American country music singer Rodney Atkins. It was released on March 31, 2009 (see 2009 in country music) on Curb Records. The album's first single, its title track, was released on November 24, 2008 and has become Atkins' fifth Number One hit on the "Billboard" country singles charts. It was followed by "15 Minutes" (a Top 20 hit) and "Chasin' Girls." The album was re-issued in mid-2010 with a new single, "Farmer's Daughter."
The album debuted at No. 15 on "Billboard"'s album chart selling 34,877 copies.
As of August 2010, the album has sold 129,820 copies in the US.
Singles.
The album's first single release was its title track, written by Brett James and Angelo Petraglia. Released in late 2008, the song went on to become the fifth Number One single of his career. It was followed by "15 Minutes" at number 20, and "Chasin' Girls", which failed to make the Top 40. The latter was partially re-written for its radio edit. The song debuted in September 2009 but failed to reach the country Top 40, peaking at No. 48.
In March 2010, the album was re-released with "Farmer's Daughter" added to the tracklist, and the radio edit of "Chasin' Girls" in place of the original recording. "Farmer's Daughter" has reached Top 20 on Hot Country Songs.
Critical reception.
Todd Sterling of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, saying that Atkins "plays it safe and sticks to the same formula used on "If You're Going Through Hell"." Also giving it three stars, Roughstock critic Liz Jungers thought that the album was "feel-good through and through" and that it had "killer musicianship," but criticized it for lacking musical variety. Pierce Greenberg of The 9513 also criticized the album for having too many "frothy feel-good, I-am-blessed" songs, saying that it such songs "would benefit from being on a more diverse album." He rated the album two stars out of five. In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a "dud" rating, calling it "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought."

Bertha of Aragon

Bertha of Aragon (c. 1075 – bef. 1111) was a Queen consort of Aragon and Navarre. Nothing is known about her childhood or the names of her parents, it is believed that she is Italian since her name was "Berta", which is Italian.
She was married to Peter I of Aragon in 1097, shortly after the death of Peter's first wife, Agnes of Aquitaine, with whom he had two children: Peter and Isabella. Bertha and Peter had no children.
Peter and Isabella were both dead by 1104 and King Peter needed an heir. They had no children and Peter died the following year. The crown of Aragon and Navarre passed to Alfonso who was the half brother of Peter.
Bertha got a dowry but Alfonso got all of Peter's lands. It is unknown when Bertha died or where she died.
Genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay has speculated that Bertha may have been a daughter of Peter I, Count of Savoy and another Agnes of Aquitaine, perhaps the Agnes who was the final wife of Peter's father Ramiro I of Aragon and first-cousin of Peter's own first wife.

Stanford Financial Group

The Stanford Financial Group was a privately held international group of financial services companies controlled by Allen Stanford, until it was seized by United States (U.S.) authorities in early 2009. 
Headquartered in the Galleria Tower II in Uptown Houston, Texas, it had 50 offices in several countries, mainly in the Americas, included the Stanford International Bank, and said it managed US$8.5 billion of assets for more than 30,000 clients in 136 countries on six continents. On February 17, 2009, U.S. Federal agents put the company under management of a receiver, because of charges of fraud. On February 27, 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint to describe the alleged fraud as a "massive Ponzi scheme".
History.
Allen Stanford traced his company to the insurance company founded in 1932 in Mexia, Texas, by his grandfather, Lodis B. Stanford. However there was no direct connection between the insurance company and Allen Stanford's banking business, which he started on the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat in the West Indies in the 1980s. Allen Stanford's move into banking utilised funds he had made in real estate in Houston in the early 1980s. 
In 2008, Stanford Financial Group announced it would open a new global management complex in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, to include the base for the corporate support functions such as business technology, compliance, finance, human resources, investment strategy and legal, as well as the chairman's office. Completion was planned for July 2009, but this will now not occur due to the company's dissolution.
The company was bound by a web of personal and family ties. Stanford's chief financial officer and second-in-command, James M. Davis, was his roommate at Baylor University. The chief investment officer, Laura Pendergest-Holt, grew up attending a church in Baldwyn, Mississippi where Davis was a Sunday school teacher. Many top officials were related to each other. This led former employees to claim the company was fraught with nepotism; former executive Charles Satterfield told Bloomberg News that whenever someone asked questions, a common response was "I'm not going to question my brother-in-law."
Affiliated companies.
Stanford Financial Group comprises several affiliated companies:
Sponsorships and charity.
In 2007, Stanford Financial Group assumed title sponsorship of the Stanford St. Jude Championship, a top PGA Tour event to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital of Memphis, Tennessee. On March 20, 2009, after the Group's fraud was revealed, the PGA announced that they would be dropping their affiliation with the company and that for 2009 the event would be called the St. Jude's Classic.
Stanford Financial Group was the lead financier for the 2007 film "The Ultimate Gift". According to the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy, the story of "The Ultimate Gift" promoted philanthropy in not-for-profit health care institutions.
The group established a significant presence in golf, polo, tennis, cricket and sailing, sports which were popular among Stanford’s wealthy clients. Stanford Financial Group was the title sponsor for such sporting events as the Stanford U.S. Open Polo Championship, the Stanford USPA Silver Cup, the Stanford Antigua Sailing Week, the PGA Tour Stanford St. Jude Championship, and the Stanford International Pro-Am. Stanford also sponsored professional golfers Vijay Singh, Camilo Villegas and David Toms as well as Morgan Pressel on the LPGA Tour. In tennis, the company was a sponsor of the Sony Ericsson Open. Stanford also sponsored the Champions Series Tennis Tournaments featuring Jim Courier, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras.
The Stanford Financial Tour Championship, previously known as the LPGA Playoffs at The ADT and the ADT Championship, was the season-ending golf tournament on the US-based LPGA Tour. Beginning with the 2009 event, it was to be sponsored by Stanford Financial Group. 
As one of the founding partners, Stanford Financial Group was also involved in Tiger Woods's annual golf tournament, the AT&T National.
Regulatory investigation.
During the week of February 13, 2009, Stanford issued a letter to clients saying: "Regulatory officers have visited our offices and have stated that these are routine examinations". On February 17, 2009, U.S. Federal agents entered the company's Houston and Memphis offices. Law enforcement officials placed signs on the office doors stating that the company was temporarily closed: "The company is still in operation but under the management of a receiver". 
The Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) charged Allen Stanford, Pendergest-Holt and Davis of fraud in connection with Stanford Financial Group's US$8 billion certificate of deposit (CD) investment scheme that offered "improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates". This led the Federal government to freeze the assets of Allen Stanford, Stanford International Bank, Stanford Group Co., and Stanford Capital Management. In addition, Stanford International Bank placed a 60-day moratorium on early redemptions of its CDs.
On February 18 and 19, 2009, Ecuador and Peru suspended the operations of local Stanford units, and, in Venezuela and Panama, the governments seized local units of Stanford Bank. Mexico's financial regulator announced on February 19 that it was investigating the local affiliate of Stanford bank for possible violation of banking laws.
On February 27, 2009, Stanford official Laura Pendergest-Holt was arrested by Federal agents in connection with the alleged fraud. On that day the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a "massive Ponzi scheme", misappropriated billions of dollars of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. "Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional," the SEC said.
United States District Judge David Godbey froze all of the Stanford personal and corporate assets. Godbey gave them to Ralph Janvey, a Dallas receiver; Janvey will retain control until the SEC suit is resolved. A British receiver took the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank.
On July 1, 2009, James M. Davis, the CFO of the company, agreed to change course from his not guilty plea and plead guilty to three charges related to the Ponzi scheme fraud, once details can be worked out.
On November 13, 2009 The US District Court Ordered Brokerage Accounts to be transferred to Dominick & Dominick LLC. The transfer became effective on January 20, 2010.
In 2011, an auction of Stanford's goods was held in Houston.
On March 19, 2012 the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a federal judge’s ruling from last year that threw out three class action lawsuits that are trying to use state laws to recover investor losses resulting from Stanford’s scheme. The ruling allows lawsuits by investors who lost millions in Stanford Ponzi scheme to go forward against several 3rd parties. 
Headquarters.
Stanford was headquartered in the Galleria Tower II in Uptown Houston, Texas, U.S. Previously the company was headquartered in 5050 Westheimer Road, a three story, building across from The Galleria. Jennifer Dawson of the "Houston Business Journal" described the facility as "high-end office digs." By 2007 Stanford's headquarters moved to Galleria Tower II.
On May 18, 2010 the receiver entered into a stalking horse contract for the sale of 5050 Westheimer Road. During that month Black Forest Ventures LLC was the designated bidder to defeat at the auction, with a minimum bid being $12.5 million. The auction was scheduled to be held on Thursday June 24, 2010 at the offices of Baker Botts, L.L.P. in One Shell Plaza in Downtown Houston. The auction was canceled due to a lack of bids, and Black Forest's stipulated that it would acquire the building for $12.2 million. Black Forest bought the 5050 Westheimer building in July 2010.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a non-contagious skin condition with apparent genetic origin in the SART3 gene. It most often presents in sun-exposed areas of the body. Some DSAP cases have been reported in patients with acute immune compromised situations, particularly in the elderly. For those with sun damaged skin, the lesions usually begin to appear in the patient's 20's and increase in number and visibility in the 40's or 50's. Commonly, though not always, the number and visibility of lesions is in direct proportion to the amount of sun damage to the affected area.
Lesions generally are characterized by an irregularly-shaped thread-like ring that is usually the size of a pencil eraser, though lesions vary and may be half or double that size. The thread-like ring is very thin, much like fabric thread for sewing, and raised such that it is both palpable and visible. The interior of the ring may be rough like sandpaper, or smooth. The interior is often discolored, though colors vary from patient to patient. Lesions, due to their vascular nature, can also vary according to body temperature, environmental temperatures, and other external stimuli. The internal ring color is most often reddish, purplish, pink, or brown.
Some patients report itching and irritation associated with the condition, though many report no notable sensation at all. Though no known hormonal link has been found, DSAP occurs more commonly in women.
A study in 2000 was done on a Chinese family, in which a locus for a gene was located.

Mission of the Vixen

The mission of the "Vixen" was a conflict between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom that occurred in 1836.
Preconditions.
Under the treaty of Adrianople the Russian Empire had been granted the East coast of the Black Sea by the Ottoman Empire. However Russia did not have complete control over these territories (the Circassian Coast) from Anapa in the north to Sochi in the south. The "mountaineers" (the ) resisted the Russian authorities and did not admit Russian Control over their country Circassia, because Circassia was not part of the Ottoman Empire and the relations between Circassia and the Ottoman Empire were mainly a commercial and religious relations only. The mountaineers (Adyghe) were supported by English, French and the Polish immigrants. They were supplied with weapons and ammunition from abroad. On March 4, 1832 an instruction for the Black Sea cruisers was published in attempt to stop these deliveries. It said: 
"For preservation of the Russian possessions from infection and to prevent the delivery of military supplies to the mountain people, military cruisers will permit foreign commercial vessels only to two points – Anapa and Redoute-kale in which there is a quarantine and customs..."
Great Britain regarded it as infringement of the principle of freedom of commerce.
Provocation.
In November 1836 the Russian military brig "Ajax" detained the British schooner "Vixen" in () in the sea port Sudzhuk-Kale (nowadays Novorossiysk). At the moment of detention, 8 guns, 28,800 pounds of gunpowder, and a significant amount of other weapons had already been unloaded. This was deemed a provocation by the Russians, instigated by the first secretary of the British embassy in Constantinople David Urquhart. The Polish immigrants also participated in the organisation of the incident. The crew received instructions to go in Sudzhuk-Kale where meeting with a Russian cruiser was almost inevitable. The owner of a schooner was recommended not to avoid it, but, on the contrary, to search for this meeting in every possible way.
Reaction.
The reaction in London to the seizure was one of outrage. The Conservatives brought up in parliament a question on the legality of Circassia being under the jurisdiction of the Russian empire. Russia was threatened with war. After angry statements from London Nikolay I ordered the army and fleet into a condition of raised battle readiness. The schooner, according to the instruction, was confiscated, and its crew was sent to Constantinople.
Consequences.
The conflict threatened to develop into war between Russia and Great Britain, but by April 1837 relations had settled down. Urquhart was withdrawn to London. Britain was reluctant to antagonise Russia further, as it could not find a continental ally willing to lend support in a war. The official answer of the government and the Liberal Party to an inquiry by the Conservatives stated that Russia owned Circassia lawfully under the Adrianople peace treaty. Russia therefore continued its blockade of the east coast of Black sea. The conflict became one of a number of episodes of Russian-British rivalry of the 1830s & 1840s which were eventually to contribute to the Crimean war.

Melzer See (Waren)

The Melzer See or Melzersee is a lake at Waren in Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. 
The Melzer See lies on the northeastern perimeter of the town of Waren (Müritz). It has an area of 12.9 hectares and lies at an elevation of . Its maximum dimensions are 670 by 260 metres. It is fed from the ditches of the nearby Lehmkuhlenbruch and its waters exit through a short ditch into the Tiefwarensee, from which it is only separated by a narrow isthmus and small road. The location between two lakes was the occasion for the origin of the name of the Waren quarter of Werdersiedlung.
Whilst small gardens are ranged along its southern shore, the Melzer See is bordered to the northwest by meadowland. It lies entirely within the protected area of the Torgelower See. Visitors can walk around the lake on a two-kilometre-long footpath. The Ice Age Trail along theTiefwarensee also runs past the Melzer See.

Crewe Alexandra.
He made his debut on 13 December 2008 in a 1–0 home win against Swindon Town. He scored his first goal for Crewe in a 4–1 away win against Hartlepool United on 28 December 2008. His second goal for the club came in a 3–2 FA Cup replay loss to Millwall on 13 January 2009. He finished his breakthrough season with 11 appearances as Crewe were relegated from League One. He scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season in a 5–3 away loss to Accrington Stanley and scored his second and final goal of the season in a 3–2 away win against Chesterfield on 2 December.
Murphy scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season on 11 September 2010 in a 3–0 win against Bury. He scored again the following game in a 1–1 draw against Burton Albion. His third goal of the season came in a 5–5 draw away to eventual League Two winners Chesterfield. Murphy extended his contract with Crewe in November 2010.
Murphy missed the final month of the 2010–11 season after having a hernia operation. During the 2011–12 pre-season Murphy who had been playing as a right winger was moved into his favoured more central position alongside Ashley Westwood. His 10th league goal for Crewe came in the 2011–12 season, during a 3–2 against Plymouth Argyle, where he scored two goals. He scored his fifth goal of the 2011–12 season in a 2–0 home win to Accrington. He ended the season with 8 goals and helped Crewe secure promotion after beating Cheltenham Town in the 2012 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, to win promotion back to League One.
After the departure of Ashley Westwood to Aston Villa, Murphy was appointed as the new Crewe Alexandra Captain in August 2012. In September 2012, Murphy signed a new 2 year deal at Crewe. On 7 April 2013, Murphy scored the first goal in the Football League Trophy final against Southend United, which Crewe went on to win 2–0. In the final match of the 2012/13 season, Murphy led out a Crewe Alexandra side against Walsall in a 2–0 win in which Murphy scored the opening goal for Crewe. The game made history being the first English fixture a side had fielded a team entirely made out of their academy players.
Murphy who was the captain of Crewe Alexandra collected the clubs Player Of The Year award for the 2012/13 season, a season in which he scored 9 goals, gained 12 assists and captained Crewe to victory for the Football League Trophy. Murphy also finished 4th in the voting for the League One player-of-the-season for 2012/13. Murphy was also named in in the 2012/13 PFA Team of the Year for League One. After the season Murphy proclaimed that he was ready to step up to play at a higher level. Murphy was heavily linked with a move to Premier League side Aston Villa to join up with ex-teamate Ashley Westwood. On 25 June, Crewe assistant manager Neil Baker revealed he expected Murphy to leave the club for a higher level and that he would go with the club's blessing.
Leeds United.
In June 2013, Crewe accepted bids believed to be over £1 million from both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers for the player. Despite this on 1 July, Leeds United confirmed the signing of Luke Murphy on a three-year deal. Crewe Manager Steve Davis revealed the transfer fee for Murphy was above £1 million. The signing of Murphy was the first time that Leeds had spent over £1 million on a transfer fee since signing Richard Cresswell in 2005.
Murphy made his debut against Brighton & Hove Albion on 3 August in the first game of the season, he scored a dramatic 94th minute winner in the game to give Leeds a 2–1 victory. On 12 April 2014, Murphy scored both goals in Leeds' 2-0 victory against Blackpool. On 15 April, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino revealed after the game that he advised the then Leeds manager Brian McDermott to play Murphy in a more attacking midfield role.

Vistula River Railroad

Vistula River Railroad (Polish: Kolej Nadwiślańska) was a railroad system, opened on August 17, 1877. It ran from northwest to southeast, through the territory of the former Congress Poland, known after the November Uprising as Privislinsky Krai (part of the Russian Empire).
Starting in Mława, which back then was located near the border with the German Empire, the connection ran through Ciechanów, Warsaw, Dęblin, Lublin, and Chełm, to the strategic railroad junction of Kovel (now Ukraine). In Mława, the system reached the Prussian railway network, as the nearby German border station of Działdowo (Soldau) was another important junction, with connections to Gdańsk (Danzig), Olsztyn (Allenstein), and Toruń (Thorn).
Altogether, the length of the system was 522 kilometers, and originally, it was a wide gauge line. In 1887, the Vistula River Railroad employed 2364 workers. During the World War II (1939) the railroad was partitioned forming the Soviet Kovel Railways as one of its successors. In 1953 Kovel Railways were merged with Lviv Railways.
Lublin Station still has the original main station building dating from 1877 (though rebuilt in the 1920s), which opened together with the railroad and is well preserved to this day.

Friendship Force International (FFI), is an international cultural exchange program, founded in 1977 by Wayne Smith, a Presbyterian minister and former U.S. missionary to Brazil. For the first five years, it used chartered airplanes to shuttle delegations of 150 to 400 visitors between partner cities. The first exchange involved 762 travelers from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, and Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Staying in private homes is a central feature of the program.
In 1982, the plan was changed from large simultaneous exchanges to smaller one-way visits using scheduled airlines, but retaining the basic homestay theme, supported by local clubs in the host countries. Expanding from a few large simultaneous exchanges annually in the early years, Friendship Force now organizes 250-300 smaller exchanges of 20 to 25 visitors each year. It has active clubs in more than 50 countries. In 2007, 5763 visitors, called "friendship ambassadors," traveled between 58 countries, with thousands of club members hosting visitors in their homes.

The Jitters

The Jitters were a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto in 1981 by Blair Packham, Danny Levy and Matthew Greenberg. Five years of constant performing established them as one of the premier club bands in the Greater Toronto Area.
They caught the attention of producer Bob Ezrin in 1982, but studio sessions with him did not produce any results. An independent video in 1984 for the song "Take Me As I Am" brought them limited national exposure, though the song never appeared on any full length release.
1986 saw The Jitters in an opening slot for Huey Lewis and the News at the Canadian National Exhibition, and tying for third place in Q107's Homegrown Contest with the song "Last of the Red Hot Fools". These two events helped open doors with Capitol Records who proceeded to sign the band.
The Jitters had several songs that were ready for release, and after spending some extra time in the studio with producer Paul Gross, released their eponymous debut in 1987.

Crateology was the 'science' of identifying the contents of Soviet shipments to the Island of Cuba carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Crateology has declined as a discipline in recent years due to globalisation and the decline in the usage of custom made wooden crates in favour of standard metal shipping containers. As well as making the world 'flatter' and smaller', globalisation has resulted in the loss of not merely a science, but a 'beautiful art form'.

The Renoir Towers ("Renoir Residencias de Altura") are two residential towers currently under development in the Puerto Madero neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
The Renoir One tower is 136 m (446 ft) tall and has 41 floors and, upon completion, the Renoir Two tower will be 175 m (574 ft) tall and have 51 floors. The complex was actually planned to be the tallest towers in Puerto Madero and Buenos Aires; but in 2007, work began on the Cavia Tower (from the Le Parc Figueroa Alcorta complex), which became the tallest skyscraper in the city upon completion in 2008. 
DYPSA, the project's developers, modified the height of the Renoir Two building, extending it from 171m to 175 m, making the latter tower the tallest in the city upon its 2011 completion.
Third tower.
DYPSA had confirmed that a third tower would be built in a third lot acquired by the company. The third tower will be 136 m (446 ft) tall, and will have the same height as the Renoir I - but with a different design. The tower will be home to the Puerto Madero Renoir Alvear Palace Hotel, the second Alvear Palace Hotel in the city.

Debuting at the height of "Garfield"’s popularity, this King Features Syndicate strip showed Betty Boop as a working woman and Felix as her pet (replacing Pudgy as Betty's pet). Unlike most other incarnations of the famous cat, Felix never spoke in this strip; his ideas and opinions are conveyed to the reader in thought balloons. Also, Felix’s squash and stretch abilities and magic bag are absent, and Betty’s sex appeal is downplayed.

Christophe Agou

Christophe Agou (born 1969, Montbrison, France) is a French documentary photographer currently living in New York City.
Biography.
Since the early 1990s, Christophe Agou has been building up a body of intimate and personal documentary-style photographs in both black and white and color which take an allusive approach to the human condition. He has extended his expression into other media, making assemblages and short films.
A self-taught photographer, Agou grew up in a small town in the Forez region. In 1992 he moved to New York City, where he developed a love for the city and for photography. He began taking photographs in the streets, work that evoked a sense of longing and isolation. He first came to prominence with photographs taken in the subway, and published "Life Below" in 2004 (Quantuck Lane Press / W.W. Norton & Company).
In the winter of 2002, Christophe Agou felt the emotional need to return to his native Forez and roamed around the valleys and the mountains, which has never left his mind. He got to know and quickly became friends with a community of family farmers whose identities are deeply rooted to the land. After eight years, this resulted in, In the Face of Silence, which is far from just a documentary about rural life in early twenty-first century France. 
Agou's work is held in the collections of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris; Musée d'Art Roger Quilliot, Clermont-Ferrand; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.; Akron Art Museum, Akron; Southeast Museum of Photography, Daytona, Florida; The New-York Historical Society; The New York Public Library; and Les Galeries Photo Fnac, France.
In 2006, he was chosen as a finalist for the W. Eugene Smith Award and in 2008 for the Paris Académie des Beaux-Arts Photography Prize. In 2009, he received a special mention in Le Prix Kodak de la Critique Photographique. In 2010, he won the European Publishers Award for Photography for his project "Face au Silence".
"Life Below".
In his "Life Below" series, Agou presents a lyrical and surprisingly personal portrait of the New York subway, with many of the images shot at surprisingly close range, revealing people lost in their own thoughts and not having put on a mask.
"Face au Silence" / "In The Face of Silence".
In the winter of 2002, Agou began documenting the daily lives of French farming families in his native Forez region, which lies on the eastern side of the Massif Central. He traveled to the lesser-known parts of the region, and over time built a relationship of trust with his subjects so that they allowed him to both photograph and film them at work and at home. The work goes beyond just documenting their labor-intensive lives and presents a deeper, more intimate portrait. For Christophe Agou, "Face au Silence" is a meditation on life and death as well as the silence and solitude that are ever-present in our lives.
Statements by Christophe Agou about his work.
"The distance between a photographer and his subject should not be greater than his arm's length"
"When I use the camera, I often feel like I know part of the person or place I come in contact with."
"Looking and seeing are two different notions. One is to observe without being seen, the other, is to create an emotional connection with your subject."
"The mysteries of the human soul fascinate me the most and photography allows me to reveal on a deeper level what is under the surface."

North Cross School is a charter member of both the Blue Ridge Conference (BRC) for our girls’ teams and the Virginia Independent Conference (VIC) for our boys’ teams at the JV and varsity levels. The varsity football program is a member of the Old Dominion Football Conference (ODFC). North Cross School is also a member of the Virginia Independent School Athletic Association (VISAA). VISAA is the state governing body for independent school athletics and sponsors all state playoffs for varsity sports.
Carter Athletic Center.
The Carter Athletic Center (CAC) is a facility that offers something for everyone, including swimming lessons for four-year-olds to exercise classes specifically for senior citizens. The CAC is home to the CCA Marlins, a nationally recognized USS swim team.

Going Green.
North Cross School students and their families, along with the faculty and staff, have embarked on an ambitious effort this year to reduce the School’s "carbon footprint" and increase "sustainability" by “going green.” 
Spanish Teacher and Community Service Director Malcolm Douglas is spearheading the effort as the chair of the School’s newly formed Environmental Action Committee (EAC). The committee began its work over the summer and has developed an extensive plan that involves the entire School community and focuses the School’s energies on a coordinated program. The program has three components: recycling, energy conservation, and education. 
In addition to the EAC, three student groups are helping to run the program: SAVE (Students Actively Volunteering for the Environment), the middle school Environmental Club, and the lower school SCA. 
One of the first changes the School made in its efforts to “go green” was the transition to environmentally friendly supplies and materials across campus – in classrooms, common spaces, and the Lemon Dining Hall. Additionally, recycling containers are now located in dozens of places across campus.
The Athletic Department, thanks to the diligence of Athletic Director Donna Satterwhite, has doubled up off-campus game schedules to reduce the number of miles buses travel. 
On Nov. 13, 2008, Seeley challenged the entire School to reduce the amount of electricity and natural gas consumed by 10 percent between the first day of the Winter term, Dec. 2, and the last day of April. Other elements of the challenge include reducing the amount of solid waste sent to landfills and instituting school-wide “Grey Days,” in which a concerted effort to turn off unneeded lights will be encouraged. Also on the horizon is a composting program in the Lemon Dining Hall, run by middle school students.
Adding to the educational component to the program, the lower, middle, and upper school each have a special “Green Board,” where energy use, solid waste and recycling numbers is posted, and information about energy issues and programs is displayed. The Boards will be maintained by the student groups involved.
Fundraising Events.
Big Flea.
Each year, North Cross School holds its annual Big Flea event. This is one of three Red and White fund raising events which supports the mission of North Cross School while increasing important outreach and service to the greater Roanoke Valley. Red and White events consist of three annual events designed to bring the community together to raise awareness about campus resources. 
This enormous “yard sale” held for the last 30+ years, sells clothing and household goods donated to North Cross School by families, friends, and local businesses. At the conclusion of the sale, all unsold items are donated to local charities. Proceeds from the Big Flea help support the educational programming at North Cross School.
Field Day.
Field Day is the annual “Red and White Festival” that supports the School’s programs. Attended by hundreds of students and parents, plus members of the local community, the two-day event includes an art show, family picnic, athletic competitions, games, music, a food court, bake sale and raffle.
Games and booths, such as a moon bounce, bungee run, cake walk, and face painting are set up for children. Homemade foods like casserole and individually wrapped treats are available for purchase, along with a garden shop with a variety of plants. There is also a raffle drawing each year, giving away prizes like gas cards, jewelry, grocery gift cards, and cruises.

Pollicipes pollicipes

Pollicipes pollicipes, known as the goose neck barnacle, goose barnacle or leaf barnacle is a species of goose barnacle, also well known under the taxonomic synonym Pollicipes cornucopia. It is closely related to "Pollicipes polymerus", a species with the same common names, but found on the Pacific coast of North America, and to "Pollicipes elegans" a species from the coast of Chile. It is found on rocky shores in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and is prized as a delicacy, especially in the Iberian Peninsula.
Distribution.
"Pollicipes pollicipes" is chiefly distributed from 48°N to 28°N, along the coasts of France, Spain (including the Canary Islands), Portugal, Morocco, and south to Senegal, with a further population disjunctly located around the tropical Cape Verde Islands at about 16°N. The periphery of the species' range also extends as far north as the British Isles, with outlying populations on the south coast of England and possibly in southwestern Ireland, although there are no recent records there. The species is present, but rare, in the Mediterranean Sea. It is possible that the outlying populations are not self-sustaining, being instead maintained by immigration of larvae from self-sustaining core populations.
Ecology.
"Pollicipes pollicipes" grows in groups on rocks, as well as on the hulls of shipwrecks and on driftwood. It is a filter feeder, living on particles that it can glean from the water passing over its extended cirri; these possess a complex assortment of setae, enabling "P. pollicipes" to have a varied diet, including diatoms, detritus, large crustaceans, copepods, shrimp and molluscs.
The larvae pass through seven free-swimming stages (six nauplii and one cypris) over the course of at least a month. After this time, they settle into the adult, sessile form.
"P. pollicipes" is harvested for consumption in many parts of its range, mostly for the Spanish market, where it may sell for as much as €90 per kilogram. As a result, the species is thought to be in decline. It is harvested manually, and archaeological evidence suggests that the species has been harvested in this way for over 10,000 years.

The Lilly Brothers

The Lilly Brothers, (Bea Lilly, born Michael Burt Lilly, December 15, 1921 – September 18, 2005 and brother Everett Lilly, born July 1, 1924 - May 8, 2012) were bluegrass musicians born in Clear Creek, West Virginia. They have been credited with bringing bluegrass to New England and with influencing such future bluegrass artists as Peter Rowan, Joe Val and Bill Keith, among others.
Biography.
Influenced by the traditional music they heard in their youth, Bea began playing the guitar and Everett the mandolin. In 1938, they made their radio debut on the Old Farm Hour show at WCHS in Charleston, West Virginia. Other radio works followed at WJLS in Beckley, West Virginia and on several other Southern radio stations during the 1940s. In 1945, they appeared on the Molly O'Day radio show at WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1948, the brothers signed with the WWVA Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia as members of "Red Belcher's Kentucky Ridge Runners", but they quit two years later because of a financial dispute and the brothers retired temporarily. In 1951, Everett joined Flatt & Scruggs as mandolin player. The next year, in 1952, 'Tex' Logan, whom they had met at the WWVA Jamboree, persuaded the brothers to reunite.
The Lilly Brothers moved to Boston and formed a group called the "Confederate Mountaineers" who consisted of the brothers on guitar and mandolin, Logan on fiddle, and Don Stover on banjo. They performed on WCOP’s Hayloft Jamboree and as a house band at local clubs such as the Plaza Bar, the Mohawk Ranch, and the Hillbilly Ranch. Soon, they were making records for the Folkways, Prestige and Event labels. Somewhere along the line they changed the group's name to the Lilly Brothers.
In the 1960s they appeared in concerts at several major colleges and at folk festivals. The personnel of the Lilly Brothers didn't change between 1952 and 1970 and is considered one of bluegrass music's most stable lineups. The death of Everett Lilly’s son, Giles, in a car crash in 1970 brought to an end the brothers’ career in Boston and Everett left the town. For the remainder of the 1970s, the brothers would reunite on several occasions. In 1973 the Lilly Brothers made a tremendously successful tour of Japan, including the release of three live albums. The Lilly Brothers’ career was later chronicled in a 1979 documentary "True Facts in a Country Song". In the 1980s, as Bea retired, Everett and his son Mark played together in the group "Clear Creek Crossin'".
Everett Lilly continued to play and perform with his sons in a band called Everett Lilly and the Lilly Mountaineers until his death in 2012.
Afterwords.
Joe Val once said of the Confederate Mountaineers’ influence on urban Massachusetts, "Those guys hit on like a bombshell. Nobody’d ever heard anything like that before."
The Lilly Brothers’ singing has been described as "rich, mountain-flavoured bluegrass" and their brand of dynamic, no holds barred traditional bluegrass has been noted as "haunting and earthy."

Nietingsee (Nieting Lake) is a lake in Müritz rural district, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is located in the middle of the Müritz National Park, in the area of Kargow municipality, north of the hamlet of Speck. At an elevation of 65 m, its surface area is 0.0085 km². The almost perfectly circular lake has a diameter of 100 metres. It is located in a shallow depression in the terminal moraine that crossed the national park. The depression was covered with fen, until a mill run drained the area and the ground water table fell so low that the fen dried out and natural succession in form of forest began to take over. After a decision was made to re-flood the depression, the mill run was closed in 1993, the forest then began to retreat and the fens surrounding the Nietingsee to redevelop.
A circular hinking trail passes close to the lake on its way to Speck.

Love in a Village

Love in a Village is a ballad opera in three acts that was composed and arranged by Thomas Arne. A pastiche, the work contains 42 musical numbers of which only five were newly composed works by Arne. The other music is made up of 13 pieces borrowed from Arne's earlier stage works, a new overture was by C. F. Abel, and 23 songs by other composers, including Bishop, Boyce, Geminiani, Giordani, and Galuppi, albeit with new texts. The English libretto, by Isaac Bickerstaffe, is based on Charles Johnson’s 1729 play "The Village Opera". The opera premiered at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden in London on 8 December 1762. One of its best known songs is the "Miller of Dee".
History.
"Love in a Village" was received enthusiastically at its premiere and became one of Arne's more popular operas, enjoying 40 performances in its first season alone. The work's success began a vogue for pastiche opera in England that lasted well into the 19th century. The opera has subsequently been revived numerous times, both during Arne's lifetime and after. A notable revival occurred at the Lyric Hammersmith in London in 1928, using an adaptation by Alfred Reynolds. The opera was first published in 1763, but without recitative or librettos. A copy of the full score, which is partly in the composer’s hand, also survives and is in the collection of the library at the Royal College of Music. Most of the music displays a simple and lyrical nature with the exception of the music for Rosetta. Rosetta, a role written for Arne's lover Charlotte Brent, requires a gifted a coloratura soprano, particularly for the aria "The traveller benighted" which has several challenging passages containing wide vocal leaps, fast runs, and trills.
Synopsis.
The heroine of the story, Rosetta, is fearful of her impending marriage to a man she has never met. Worried that she will be miserable, she runs away from home and acquires a position as a chambermaid in the home of Justice Woodcock. Meanwhile the son of Sir William Meadows, Thomas, is in an equivalent situation. He also avoids his impending marriage by posing as a gardener in the Justice's household. Rosetta and Thomas meet and soon fall in love. However, both of their families are determined to make them marry their intended future spouses. Just as all seems hopeless, Sir William arrives and reveals that the young lovers have in fact been betrothed to each other the whole time.

Angelology (novel)

Angelology is a first novel by Danielle Trussoni. It was published by Viking Press in March 2010.
Plot.
The story follows a nun in New York who unwittingly reignites an ancient war between Angelologists, a group who study angels, and a race of descendants of angels and humans called the Nephilim. The story blends ancient biblical pericopes, the myth of Orpheus, and the fall of rebel angels.
Publishing and film interest.
Eric Simonoff, then at Janklow & Nesbit, agented the book. In early 2009, seven different publishing houses vied for the manuscript. It eventually went to Viking Press for an undisclosed amount. According to "Publishers Weekly", a reputable industry publication, the final offer was "well into six figures".
Apart from publishing industry interest, two motion picture studios, Columbia Pictures and Universal Pictures, bid against each other for the film rights, with Columbia winning.
Andrea Gianetti and DeVon Franklin (Columbia's executive producers on "The Da Vinci Code" and "Angels & Demons") are currently overseeing the project. Will Smith and James Lassiter's Overbrook Entertainment will co-produce with director Marc Forster. Marc Forster will be directing the film.

The three circles model

The three circles model can be applied to different research approaches and models of organizational culture.
This model represents the interaction between the managerial culture, the workplace culture and the surrounding culture.
Managerial culture is the values of the management, and its norms, practices and artifacts. The workplace culture is the work and behavior norms as perceived by the workers point of view. The surrounding culture stands for the local norms and practices which characterize a national culture/ religious culture etc.
The diagram presents a partial overlapping between the three circles. One must keep in mind, the relations among the circles are dynamic and their borders depend on the situation being studied. The model is not an area model and doesn't intend to describe certain numeric relations. Its objective is to describe the terms in a schematic manner.
The first circle describes the managerial culture, which is often perceived as the organizational culture.
The common part of circles 1 and 2, designates areas of congruity and acceptance, or "devotion" in management parlance. The second circle also provides room for "countercultures" and for workers' subversion of managerial culture.
The third circle represents the surrounding local culture, whose values, norms, and socialization can influence both acceptance and resistance to the managerial culture.‏‏
The three circles model is connected to some known theories in organizational sociology:

Rose Francine Rogombé

Rose Francine Rogombé ("née" Etomba) (born 20 September 1942) is a Gabonese politician who was Acting President of Gabon from June 2009 to October 2009, following the death of long-time President Omar Bongo. She constitutionally succeeded Bongo due to her role as President of the Senate, a post to which she was elected in February 2009. She is a lawyer by profession and a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG). Rogombé was the first female head of state of Gabon. After her interim presidency, she returned to her post as President of the Senate.
Early life and career.
Rose Francine Etomba, a member of the Galwa ethnic group, was born in Lambaréné, French Equatorial Africa (now Gabon), in 1942. After studying in France, she worked as a magistrate in Gabon. She also served in the government as Secretary of State for the Advancement of Women and Human Rights during the 1980s. She left politics during the transition to multiparty politics in the early 1990s, instead devoting herself to law; she eventually became Vice-President of the Special Criminal Court. In 2007, she received a degree in theology.
2008 local elections and 2009 Senate election.
In the April 2008 local elections, Rogombé was elected as a municipal councillor in Lambaréné; she was subsequently elected as a Senator from Lambaréné in the January 2009 Senate election. Following the latter election, she was elected as President of the Senate on 16 February 2009, receiving the support of 90 of the 99 Senators who voted.
Rogombé, who was nicknamed the "iron lady", was a somewhat obscure figure when President Bongo effectively selected her to become President of the Senate, and her selection reportedly surprised many in the PDG leadership. Despite her relative obscurity, she was reportedly familiar with the operation of political power in Gabon, being close to Bongo and a friend of the family of Georges Rawiri, a prominent politician who became President of the Senate before his death in 2006.
Presidency.
As President of the Senate, Rogombé was the constitutionally designated successor to the Presidency of the Republic in the event of a vacancy in the latter office; if this occurred, she was to serve only in an interim capacity prior to the holding of a new presidential election, in which she would not be allowed to run. Following the death of President Omar Bongo on 8 June 2009, the Constitutional Court designated Rogombé as interim President on 9 June, and her swearing in was scheduled for the following day. In her capacity as interim President, the Constitutional Court said that Rogombé, unlike an elected President, would not have the power to dissolve the National Assembly or call a referendum. A new presidential election was required within 30 to 45 days, according to the Gabonese constitution, although it was considered very likely that it would be delayed beyond that point due to the need to update the voter rolls.
Rogombé was sworn in on 10 June 2009, in the presence of members of the Constitutional Court, government, Senate, and National Assembly, as well as foreign diplomats. She took the oath after a minute of silence in Bongo's memory, swearing "to devote all my strength to the good of the Gabonese people, with the aim of promoting its well-being and protecting it from all harm, to respect and defend the constitution and a state of law, and conscientiously to carry out my duties and to be fair before everyone". Internet access had been cut and television channels played only religious music following the announcement of Bongo's death.
After Rogombé assumed the Presidency of the Republic, Léonard Andjembé, the First Vice-President of the Senate, succeeded her as President of the Senate in an interim capacity.
In the presidential election held on 30 August 2009, PDG candidate Ali Bongo was victorious according to official results. Bongo was sworn in as President on 16 October 2009, and Rogombé returned to her post in the Senate on 20 October, taking over from Andjembé. There was no provision in the constitution specifically enabling her to return to her former post, but it was believed that Rogombé's resumption of duties in the Senate could constitute a precedent in that regard. In recognition of her work in leading Gabon through the early presidential election, Marcel Sandoungou, the oldest Senator, presented her with a medal of honor on the occasion of her return to the Senate. She said that the Senate was ready to work with Bongo as he pursued his planned reforms.
Post-Presidency.
Rogombé distributed 23,000 toys to children in Lambaréné on 30 January 2010 in a belated celebration of Christmas.

Charles Wintour

Charles Vere Wintour, CBE, MBE (Mil) (18 May 1917 – 4 November 1999), was a British newspaper editor and was the father of editor-in-chief of "Vogue" magazine, Anna Wintour.
Wintour wrote articles for the "Radio Times" while he was at Oundle School, and won a prize awarded by the "Daily Mail". He completed his education at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge, where he studied English and history and briefly edited "Granta" with Eric Hobsbawm.
After university, Wintour took a job in advertising, but left at the start of World War II to join the Royal Norfolk Regiment. During the war, he was awarded the military MBE, the Croix de Guerre and the Bronze Star.
In 1946, Wintour became a leader writer for the "Evening Standard". He was soon promoted to political editor, then moved to the "Sunday Express" as assistant editor. He returned to the "Standard" as deputy editor, during which period he convinced Lord Beaverbrook to launch the Evening Standard Awards for theatre.
Wintour became managing editor of the "Daily Express" in 1958, then in 1959 moved back to the "Standard" as editor. During this period, he had five children, of whom two: Anna and Patrick later became prominent journalists.
Although circulation fell under Wintour's editorship, he was well regarded, and was considered for the post of editor of "The Times" in 1967. He was particularly passionate about the paper's politics and high-society gossip column, the Londoner's Diary, once remarking that: "To go to a decent London dinner party without having read the Diary would be to go out unprepared for proper conversation."
Wintour remained editor until 1976, when he became managing director of the "Daily Express", supervising its transition from broadsheet to tabloid. He took part in the negotiations to merge the "Standard" with the "Evening News", championing the case for keeping the staff and approach of the "Standard". As a result, the proposed merger was called off. The Express Group was sold to Trafalgar House, and new owner Victor Matthews appointed Wintour editor of the "Standard" again in 1978. In 1979, Wintour joined the Press Council, serving for two years. In 1980, the "Standard" and the "News" were finally merged. While the name of the "Standard" was ultimately retained, Wintour was replaced by former "News" editor Louis Kirby.
In 1981, Wintour launched the "Sunday Express Magazine" with new wife Audrey Slaughter, and in 1984 they launched "Working Woman" magazine. In 1985, Wintour became editor of the "Press Gazette", and he gave advice on the launch of "Today", "The Independent" and the new "Daily News", in addition to TV-am.
Wintour retired in 1989 and spent his later years supporting the Liberal Democrats and chairing the regional National Art Collections Fund.

Alex McCarthy

Alex Simon McCarthy (born 3 December 1989) is an English footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Reading. A product of Reading's Academy, McCarthy spent time out on loan in the Conference before signing professional terms with the club in 2008. He made his Football League debut in 2009 whilst on loan to Aldershot Town and spent the following season at Yeovil Town before making his Reading debut in 2011. He has since spent time on loan at Leeds United and Ipswich Town.
At international level McCarthy has represented England and made his debut for the under-21 side in 2010, appearing three times in total. In May 2013 he was called up to the senior squad for friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil though he did not make an appearance.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Guildford, Surrey, McCarthy began his career as a schoolboy at Wimbledon and Wycombe Wanderers before joining Reading on a scholarship at 16. He was a regular in the Academy team for two years and was part of a group that included several future first-team players including Jem Karacan, Alex Pearce and Gylfi Sigurðsson. His first experience of senior football came in August 2007 at Woking where he made one appearance cover for the injured Nick Gindre. On 26 March 2008 he joined fellow Conference National team Cambridge United on work experience, making his debut two days later in a 3–0 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers. He made no further appearances and returned to Reading before signing his first professional contract in July 2008. McCarthy moved on loan again on 24 October 2008, joining Conference South team Team Bath as injury cover. He made his debut the next day in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round against Salisbury City and also played in the First Round defeat defeat to Forest Green, making four appearances in total. Another short loan spell followed with McCarthy joining League Two side Aldershot Town for one month on 2 February 2009. He made his Football League debut twelve days later in a 3–2 defeat to Exeter City and played three further matches before returning to Reading at the beginning of March.
At the start of the 2009–10 season McCarthy joined League One side Yeovil on an initial six-month loan and made his debut on 8 August in a 2–0 home win over Tranmere Rovers. A month later he received the first sending-off of his career after fouling Stockport County's Nicholas Bignall who was also on loan from Reading. McCarthy's loan spell was renewed in January 2010 and again in February, before being extended for the rest of the season on 24 March. Over the course of his spell he played 44 league games and kept all twelve of Yeovil's clean sheets. Following his successful loan, McCarthy was given a new three-year contract at Reading, keeping him with the club until 2013. He again departed on loan in August 2010, joining Brentford, though he remained there for just one month before being replaced by fellow Reading loanee Ben Hamer.
Reading debut and further loans.
After returning from loan at Brentford in September 2010, McCarthy spent the next five months on the bench as cover for Adam Federici. He eventually made his Reading debut on 19 February 2011, coming on as a substitute for the injured Federici in the 84th minute against Watford and helping to secure a 1–1 draw. With Federici out for six weeks with knee ligament damage, McCarthy had a run in the side and made his full debut three days later in a 2–1 win over Millwall. In his next outing he saved a penalty against Crystal Palace as Reading twice came from behind to draw the game 3–3. He also played an important role in the 1–0 FA Cup fifth round win over Everton, producing a late save to deny Leon Osman in a performance described as "tremendous" by former England manager Kevin Keegan. Despite another strong display in the next round against Manchester City at Eastlands, Reading lost the match 1–0 to a Micah Richards header. He continued in goal until 30 April when he was displaced by a fit again Federici for the 0–0 draw at Coventry City and remained an unused substitute during Reading's play-off campaign.
With Federici remaining the first choice Reading goalkeeper for the 2011–12 season, McCarthy was loaned to Leeds United for a month on 4 November to gain Championship experience. An injury to Andy Lonergan and the indifferent form of Paul Rachubka saw him go straight into the team for the game against Leicester City. He kept a clean sheet on debut as the game ended in a 1–0 win. Further clean sheets against Nottingham Forest and Millwall followed and were enough to keep him in the side ahead of the returning Lonergan. In the last game of his initial spell he saved an injury time penalty against Watford, allowing Leeds to rescue a point with a last minute equaliser. Following the game, he revealed that he was keen on extending his loan at Leeds, with Reading agreeing to renew it for a second month two days later. Ineligible to face his parent club on 17 December, he was replaced by Lonergan and made no further appearances, returning to Reading on 3 January 2012. He signed a new three-year contract with Reading on 9 January before joining Ipswich Town on loan until the end of the season. On his return to Elland Road with Ipswich he was sent off for handling the ball outside the penalty area with twenty minutes remaining. Ipswich, one goal up at the time, went on to lose the game 3–1. After ten appearances, all coming in the league, he returned to Reading at the end of the season.
Premier League.
Again starting the season as second choice goalkeeper, several mistakes and an injury meant McCarthy replaced Adam Federici for the 3–1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 16 September 2012. He retained his place in the team for the next few games and put in an impressive performance against Swansea City on 6 October leading to suggestions of a senior England call up in the future. His good form continued with a man of the match performance in Reading's next game against Queens Park Rangers, firstly tipping Esteban Granero's free-kick onto the crossbar before saving from Adel Taarabt at close range. The game ended badly though as he injured himself colliding with the goal post after diving to stop a Taarabt shot. Despite initial hopes the injury was not too serious, he was forced to undergo shoulder surgery in early December potentially ruling him out for remainder of the season. He recovered quicker than expected though and returned to the side on 13 April 2013, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw with Liverpool. After making ten saves during the game, he was widely praised with his performance described as "fantastic" by Nigel Adkins and "absolutely staggering" by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He remained in goal for the rest of the season, making 14 appearances in total.
International career.
McCarthy trained with the England under-19s before joining the under-21 set-up for the first time in September 2009. He received several further call-ups to the under-21s in 2009–10 and eventually made his debut as a second half substitute against Uzbekistan in August 2010. In March 2011 he was named in a 31-man squad to face Denmark and Iceland as preparation for the European Under-21 Championship. He played a full 90 minutes in the first game and 45 in the second as England won 4–0 and lost 2–1 respectively. He travelled with the squad to championships in Denmark but did not play any games, finishing with three caps at under-21 level.
In April 2012 he was named in the 80-man long list of potential players for the Great Britain football team at the 2012 Olympics. He had made it down to the provisional 35 players for the tournament though ultimately did not make the final 18. In May 2013 he was called up to the England senior team for the friendlies against Republic of Ireland and Brazil, becoming the first Reading youth team graduate to gain an full England call-up since the Academy era began in 1998.
McCarthy is eligible for the Republic of Ireland football team.

The Fairy Prince is a masque in three acts by composer Thomas Arne. The English libretto, by George Colman the Elder, is based on Ben Jonson’s "Oberon, the Faery Prince" (1611). The work premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London on 12 November 1771. 
History.
Despite being designated as a masque, the work is sung throughout, and is in many respects reminiscent of a comic opera. It is set by Windsor Castle, and depicts satyrs and fairies who guard the castle and its inhabitants during ceremonial occasions. The masque concludes with a banquet with the King and Queen in attendance. Of particular note is the wood nymphs’ aria "Let us play and dance and sing", which has a large range of approximately 2 and a half octaves and has some impressive coloratura passages. The Act 1 choral finale, "Then all the air shall ring", is also particularly fine.
"The Fairy Prince" was very well received at its premiere and was performed 36 times during the 1771-1772 season. While critics and audiences praised both the music and the elaborate sets of the production, the work was strangely never revived. The masque's score was published in 1771 but without the dance music, recitatives, and some of the choruses.

Elly Heuss-Knapp

Elisabeth Eleonore Anna Justine "Elly" Heuss-Knapp, "née Knapp" (born January 25, 1881 in Strasbourg; died July 19, 1952 in Bonn), was a German liberal politician, author and wife of Theodor Heuss—from 1908 until her death. She was the founder of the Müttergenesungswerk (the Elly Heuss-Knapp Foundation), which is named in her honour, as well a co-founder and Vice President of the European Movement in Germany. She also served as a Member of Parliament of the state of Württemberg-Baden (1946–1949).
Life.
Elly Knapp was the daughter of the renowned economist Georg Friedrich Knapp (1842–1926), the founder of the chartalist school of monetary theory, who taught at the University of Strasbourg. Her mother Lydia Qorghanashvili, who was from Georgia, became mentally ill shortly after her birth, and Elly and her sister Marianne were raised by their father alone, uncommon at the time.
She studied to become a teacher, taking the exam in 1899, and worked as a teacher at a girl's school in Strasbourg from 1900, of which she was one of the co-founders. She early became politically influenced by Friedrich Naumann, a prominent liberal, and in 1905, she went on to study economics, and became a frequent public speaker on political issues. In 1908, she married then-journalist Theodor Heuss, an assistant to Friedrich Naumann. The wedding was presided over by Albert Schweitzer. Their only son, Ernst Ludwig Heuss, was born in 1910. Due to complications during that birth (which was nearly fatal for Elly), she could not have more children.
From 1922, she became more interested in theological questions and became active in the Protestant congregation of Otto Dibelius.
During the period of Nazi rule, she was forbidden to speak publicly, and her husband was fired from his job at a university. Their home became a meeting place of people opposed to the regime, including Martin Niemöller. Elly Heuss-Knapp became an author and worked in advertising to support her family. Her autobiography, "Ausblick vom Münsterturm", was published in 1934, and a second edition in 1952. Heuss-Knapp and her husband lived in Heidelberg in the final stage of the Second World War.
From 1946 to 1949, she was elected a Member of Parliament of the state of Württemberg-Baden, as a representative of the liberal Demokratische Volkspartei (DVP) and later the Freie Demokratische Partei (FDP). Her work as a politician concentrated on child care and social policy in general.
Both Elly Heuss-Knapp and her husband had been candidates for the liberal Deutsche Demokratische Partei in the German election, 1919.
Together with her husband, Elly Heuss-Knapp was one of the co-founders of the European Movement in Germany in June, 1949, and was Vice President of the organisation.
She also founded the Müttergenesungswerk, which was later named Elly Heuss-Knapp-Stiftung Deutsches Müttergenesungswerk in her honour.
Elly Heuss-Knapp died in 1952 at the university clinic in Bonn, and was buried at the Waldfriedhof Stuttgart.

Black (2008 film)

Black is a 2008 French blaxploitation film directed by Pierre Laffargue.
Synopsis.
Black, a Frenchman with African roots, commits in France a heist with some complices. The early arrival of alarmed police kindles a shooting. Black's complices are killed and he can only scarcely escape by jumping from a bridge onto a running train. When he is all alone in his hideout, he receives a long distance call from a cousin in Africa. Black is asked to rob diamonds from a bank. His cousin makes him believe this was easily done. Black travels consequently to Africa. Once there, he has to realise that the responsible Africans he intends to rob are more sophisticated than he had thought. Moreover a group of Russian soldiers of fortune also wants to steal the diamonds. Black outsmarts them and retrieves the diamonds during their holdup. Unfortunately his cousin tries to betray him. That is his cousin's downfall. Now all on his own, Black is caught by a feisty female police agent. Soon both are hunted by vengeful former Russian commandos. While trying to elude, they get entangled in a local mystic prophecy and their struggle is lifted to a higher, supernatural level.

Madia Gond

Madia Gonds or Madia or Maria are one of the endogamous Gond tribes living in Chandrapur District and Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra State, and Bastar division of Chhattisgad State India. They have been granted the status of a Primitive tribal group by the Government of India under its affirmative action or reservation programme. The Madia Gonds are strongly affected by Naxal activities. The Madia Gond use the self designation Madia, and call the area where they live Madia Desh. The Ethnologue code for classification, classifies the Madia language as :Dravidian/South-Central/Gondi-Kui/Gondi/Maria. A study mentions living megalithic practices amongst the Madia Gonds. One of the findings of The Bench Mark Survey done in 1997–1998: 91.08 percent of Madia Gond families lived Below Poverty Line.
Tradition and culture.
Madias today are doctors, teachers, government employees and naxalites. Performance of school going Madia children is on par with other children of Maharashtra state, a Madia girl student has figured in the merit list of candidates at the state level. The following are the descriptions of the Madia Gond as recorded by the British Rulers in the District Gazettes, which has been carried in the Gazettes of independent India.
Description in the Chanda district gazette.
The Chandrapur district gazette description of the Madia is as follows: ""The Marias inhabit the wilder tracts, and are in their unsophisticated state a very attractive people. The villages are usually built deep in the jungle near some wide shallow stream, which offers facilities for the gata cultivation, and the surrounding jungles supplement the fruits of their agricultural efforts. Few villages lack the customary grove of toddy – Palm wine trees, the juice of which, fermented or unfermented, is ever acceptable to the Gond. The Marias are a lithe, active looking, well-built set of men, open, hearty manner, and the cheerful smile of good fellowship. Their dress is scanty, consisting of a compromise between a langoti (a loincloth) and a dhoti, a strip of cloth wound tightly round the waist in rope-like folds and passed between the legs with the spare end hanging down in front below the knees. Often this garment diminishes to the scantiest rag. They adorn their necks with handsome strings of beads and their arms occasionally with metal and glass bangles. Their ears are pulled out of shape by the weight of numerous brass rings with which they are usually garnished and occasionally they wear pagris. A curved knife with a brass mounted handle is stuck into the waist cloth and, from the shoulder dangles the ever handy axe without which a Gond seldom moves. Maria women wear a lugada of strong cloth usually white with a coloured strip in the border. They wear no choli (blouse), no Gond woman ever does, and their necks, like their husbands are garnished with beads. They frequently tattoo their faces and limbs in intricate patterns.""
Dance.
"All Gonds and especially Madias, are very fond of dancing. It is the great amusement of the people. Night after night in the eastern tracts in the cool, moon-lit nights of the hot weather ,the rhythmic lilt of a Gondi chorus fills the air, as the villagers dance round a fire in some open space near the hamlet. The favourite dance is a peculiar rippling step forward with the foot dragged, not very graceful when done by a single individual, but looking quite different when done in unison by a great circle of dancers singing a 're-la', 're-la', chorus to which the step keeps time. In some villages, where the headman is an enthusiast for the pastime, a trained band performs weird and wonderful step dances to the sound of the drum. At a big dance, the trained band occupies the inner ring round the fire, while the common folk, men and maids, in separate rings move round in great circles in opposite ways. All are dressed for the occasion in their best, bearing in their hands weird ornaments of wicker work, with garlands of flowers on their necks and in their hair, feather ornaments humorously or coquettishly placed. Seen in the glow of a huge log fire, glinting on the shining beads and barbaric ornaments of the dancers, with the throb of the drums and the beat of many feet moving in unison to the wild music of the voices in chorus, a Madia dance is a spectacle not easily forgotten, but lingers as a characteristic scene when other details have faded out of the memory. Men and women ordinarily dance in separate circles but in the dances where the young men choose their brides, they dance in couples."
Government's liquor policy.
The Government has granted concession to Adivasis to manufacture and possess toddy for domestic consumption on obtaining toddy licences for a period of one year (i.e. July to June every year). This privilege is given to the people of this community as they are used to toddy drinking as a part of their food for ages. According to the excise arrangements now in force in that area, each individual applicant is granted Toddy licence for tapping trees ranging from 1 to 5 for domestic consumption. The permit fee and tree tax per toddy tree is 75 paise per annum respectively.[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/CHANDRAPUR/other_social_prohibition_dept.html]
Mundha.
Mundha is one-piece decorative wooden pillar carved by a bridegroom after he is engaged. It is kept in front of "Ghotul" during his marriage ceremony perhaps the best example of skill in wood carving. These are reminiscent of the totem poles of the Americas.
Myths.
About menstruation, the Maria Gond believe that the vagina once contained teeth and that when these teeth were removed, the wound never healed completely
Contemporary life style.
Naxal Activities.
A Frontline Cover Story calls the Bhamragad Taluka where the Madia Gond Adivasis live, the heart of the naxalite-affected region in Maharashtra. In the jungles and 120-odd naxalite-affected villages of eastern Gadchiroli, it is the Adivasis who pay the price for extremist violence. "Whether a policeman or a naxalite, it is the Adivasis who is caught in the crossfire. The bosses are never Adivasis. They are safe in their offices or hideouts," a resident of Bhamragad is mentioned saying in the article.The police are quoted as saying that The Communist Part of India (Maoist) has around 250 full-time members and 3,000-odd local supporters. Many tribals accused of being informers are killed by naxalites or harassed by the police. Despite the constant fear, Adivasis do agree that naxalites have forced contractors to give them higher wages for tendu leaves collected and bamboo cut. The possibility of justice and action against their exploiters – the forest Department, the police, the government, the contractors, makes the Madia Gonds sympathise with the naxals. Harassment by the police pushes many naxalite sympathisers underground.
Eka Nakshalwadya Cha Janma.
Eka Nakshalwadya Cha Janma, (Marathi: एका नक्षलवाद्याचा जन्म – The birth of a Naxal), a novel written by Vilas Balkrishna Manohar, a volunteer with the Lok Biradari Prakalp, is a fictional account of a Madia Gond Juru's unwilling journey of life his metamorphosis from an exploited nameless tribal to a Naxal, a fugitive from the law.
Collection of tendu leaves.
Tendu patta, or the leaves of the Diospyros melanoxylon (an ebony tree with date-like fruit) in which tobacco is rolled to make beedis; is for the poor in this impoverished eastern Maharashtra district a crucial source of livelihood. Summer when temperatures touch 45 degrees Celsius, is peak earning time for the Madia. Tens of thousands of tribal women and children are engaged in collecting tendu leaves every summer. Women and children get up at 4.30 in the morning and walk towards the forests near their village. In no time the forests are transformed into a beehive of activity, with small armies of women and children plucking tendu leaves with assembly-line precision. The plucking session ends around 11 am and the women and children walk back balancing the weight of the leaves on their heads. Back in their villages, the women sort out the leaves and tie them up in bundles, squatting for hours inside their huts. They do the bulk of the work; it is they who bear the brunt of the hot sun and the drudgery. The day's collection of tendu patta is taken to the market or phad at around 4.30 pm and laid out in long, neat rows that stretch for acres in sun-baked fields or dry riverbeds. Men appointed by private contractors count the bundles and record them in their registers for future payments. Interestingly, the names in the register are those of the men. It is the husbands and fathers of the toiling women and children who claim the money. Although the tendu patta season doesn’t last more than two weeks, each healthy family unit can make a significant earning in this time. Tendu patta thus helps the poor earn enough money to survive the two months before the onset of the monsoons.
Status of women.
A Madia Gond girl has the freedom to have premarital sex and choose husband. As a married woman she has a freedom to take divorce if the husband gives ill treatment to her or if she cannot beget a child from him. She has a right to spend her earnings. A husband does not interfere in her affairs. However, even these women are taboo during menstruation and are not allowed attending the festivals.
Organisations associated.
"the board of trustees recognizes their enhancing the capacity of the Madia Gonds to adapt positively in today's India, through healing and teaching and other compassionate interventions".
Health issues.
Historically the Madia Gond were victims the of ravages of small-pox and skin-diseases and a mild form of leprosy called Gondi rog. Prevalence of sickle cell anemia is very high amongst the Madia Gond.
Research studies.
The primitive tribe status of the Madia Gond make them the subject of various studies, such as the following:
Genetic diversity.
A Microsatellite diversity was analysed in Gondi language speaking Madia Gonds of Maharashtra and three other Marathi speaking Proto – Australoid tribal groups, to understand their genetic structure and to identify the congruence between language and gene pool. Allele frequency data at 15 Short tandem repeat (STR) loci in studied tribes was compared with data of 22 Indo-European- and Dravidian-speaking caste and tribal populations using heterozygosity, allele size variance, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), GST (Glutathione S-transferase) estimate, PC plot, and Mantel correlation test. Results demonstrate that Gondi tribes comprising the Madia-Gond, a hunter-gatherer population, harbour lower diversity than Marathi tribal groups, which are culturally and genetically distinct. The Proto-Australoid tribal populations were genetically differentiated from castes of similar morphology, suggesting different evolutionary mechanisms operating upon the populations. The populations showed genetic and linguistic similarity, barring a few groups with varied migratory histories. The microsatellite variation clearly demonstrates the interplay of sociocultural factors including linguistic, geographical contiguity, and microevolutionary processes in shaping the genetic diversity of populations in contemporary India.
Emancipation of women.
The study is a record and analysis of the following events. The coming together of Madia women to form a "Self Help Group", in Bagul village of Gadchiroli District, to assert their independence, the breaking of Madia customs which triggered a group member to be brutalised and paraded naked by her husband, her committing suicide, the subsequent coming together of the other members in protest, further breaking of tribal taboos, the decision taken to wear blouses and to the breaking of isolation and pollution norms during menstruation, the initiative taken in execution of government development schemes. The Naxal fear of loss of influence in the face of development and inclusion in the mainstream of the Madia. Their opposition to the activities of the "Self Help Group". The murder of an engineer by the Naxals. The ongoing struggle engaged by the Madia women against poverty, prejudice, male domination and vested interests in the form of the Naxals, the politicians and the bureaucracy.

Temple Hall

Temple Hall is an early 19th-century Federal-style mansion and working farm near the Potomac River north of Leesburg in Loudoun County, Virginia.
History.
Temple Hall was constructed in 1810 for William Temple Thomson Mason (24 July 1782–1862), a son of Thomson Mason and his second wife Elizabeth Westwood Wallace of nearby Raspberry Plain, and nephew of George Mason. The estate became a hub of Leesburg society and was visited by Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette during his grand tour of the United States on 9 August 1825. Lafayette was accompanied by President John Quincy Adams and former President James Monroe, who was then residing at his Oak Hill plantation in southern Loudoun County. The three gentlemen witnessed the baptism of Mason's two youngest daughters at Temple Hall with Lafayette serving as godfather for Mary Carroll, and Adams and Monroe serving as Maria Louisa’s godfathers. Altogether, Mason and his wife, Ann Eliza Carroll, raised ten children at Temple Hall. In addition to the Mason family, approximately twenty enslaved African-Americans resided on the property. Under Mason's management, the Temple Hall estate was a modestly successful farm. Mason cultivated orchards and raised corn, wheat, and livestock.
Mason retired to Washington, D.C. in 1857 and sold his farm to Henry A. Ball. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Henry Ball's sons left the Temple Hall to join the Confederate States Army. In 1862, Henry Ball was arrested for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to the Federal Government. Ball was released after spending nearly a year in the Old Capitol Prison. John S. Mosby visited Temple Hall on 5 July 1864 and dined with the Ball family. While at the house, Mosby received information that led to the Action at Mount Zion Church. Temple Hall remained in the Ball family until 1878 when it was sold at auction.
In 1940, after a succession of owners, the Temple Hall property was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. James H. Symington. The Symingtons restored the mansion and made extensive renovations. They modernized Temple Hall by adding indoor plumbing and electricity. The Symingtons planted a variety of crops and eventually began specializing in popcorn. They became the largest suppliers in the eastern United States until the popcorn market collapsed after World War II. Afterwards, the Symingtons turned to raising livestock, including cattle and hogs, as well as wheat, corn, and hay for animal feed. Mrs. Symington assumed management of the farm's operations after her husband became ill in the 1970s, and continued to operate it after his death. Concerned about Loudoun County's rapid development and population growth, Mrs. Symington donated the 286 acre farm to the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) in 1985. Since then, the NVRPA has operated Temple Hall as a working farm and interpretive center. Temple Hall, along with several neighboring estates including nearby Mason family estate Raspberry Plain, is a contributing property in the Catoctin Rural Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 31 January 1989. Temple Hall was listed on the National Register on 13 February 2007.
Architecture.
Temple Hall is an early 19th-century Federal-style mansion. It is a Flemish bond brick house with a five-bay facade and is topped by a hipped roof. A small Doric portico shelters the central entrance which is surmounted by a graceful semicircular fanlight. Temple Hall also exhibits tall six-over-six double-sash windows, a frieze encircling the building, and tall interior end chimneys. The property also features a square brick smokehouse and two 19th-century frame barns.

Ganllwyd

Ganllwyd is a small village and community in southern Gwynedd, Wales, through which the A470 passes. It lies in the Snowdonia National Park to the north of Dolgellau.
The village includes Dolmelynllyn Hall (now a Hotel and owned by the National Trust), and the area is also referred to as Dolmelynllyn. One author suggests an Arthurian link to the village but there is no other corroboration.
The village, which lies where the old Roman road used to ford the old River Eden just before it joins with the rivers Mawddach and River Gamlan has 3 large waterfalls and many smaller ones all within Coed y Brenin (the forest of the king).
The village is now surrounded by Forestry Commission and National Trust parkland of conifers and oaks. A large area of surrounding ancient oak woodland is a designated SSSI and has a particularly rich temperate maritime Bryophyte community. The forest has a group of "Wellingtonia" planted in the early 20th century and Dolmelynllyn has two trees dating from the 1850s in the meadow, one being the second largest in Wales . The forests are full of wildlife, with deer, red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, otters, and other mammals, and a variety of birds from black grouse to merlins, buzzards, and red kites. There are many walks from the village into the forest, and several free car parks.

Grigna

The Grigna is a mountain massif in the province of Lecco, Lombardy, northern Italy, with an elevation of . It is part of the Bergamo Alps, and it has two peaks, Grignone or Grigna settentrionale, the higher, and the lower Grignetta or Grigna meridionale (2,177 m).
Geography and climbing routes.
To the southwest, the Grigna massif descends precipitously towards an arm of Lake Como known as Lake Lecco. To the east, the mountain runs more gently through fields and forested land into Valsassina. The northern side of the mountain, which is known for its many caves and crevices, arrives at Passo del Cainallo and the town of Esino Lario.
The easiest route to the Grignone peak is from the southeast starting at the town of Ballabio in Valsassina. Further up the valley is Pasturo, another traditional starting point for the ascent. The mountain's relative isolation affords it panoramic views of Alps towards the north and on a clear day the Milan cathedral can be seen to the southwest. 
The Rifugio Brioschi (a mountain hut with food and has accommodations) sits on the Grignone peak and is open most of the year. There are other rifugios lower down on the massif including Rifugio Bietti, Rifugio Arnaldo Bogani, Rifugio Pialeral and Rifugio Rosalba.
Every year in September Grigna hosts a Skyrunning event known as the "Trofeo Scaccabarozzi" which starts and finishes in Pasturo. The route passes over Grigna Meridionale and Grigna Settrionale and covers a distance of 43 km.

Julia (novel)

Julia is a 1975 novel by Peter Straub. The work is Straub's first novel to deal with the supernatural and was published through Coward, McCann & Geoghegan. "Julia" was later adapted into the 1977 film "The Haunting of Julia" (occasionally referred to as "Full Circle") starring Mia Farrow.
The work is Straub's third novel and his second published novel, as "Under Venus" was not officially published until 1984. Straub began writing "Julia" at the advice of his literary agent after "Under Venus" was rejected by his publishers, as his agent recommended that he try writing a gothic novel.
Synopsis.
Julia Lofting has just purchased a large house in London as a means of escaping her overbearing husband, Magnus, and to start her life over following the death of her nine-year-old daughter, Kate. But she begins to suspect that she is not alone, and after a seance is held at her home she comes to fear that a malevolent supernatural presence is stalking her.

Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program

The U.S. President’s Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program (the Fairless Committee) was created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 22, 1956. The purpose of the committee was to study and make recommendations on the role, scope, operation, and impact of military, economic, technical and other foreign assistance programs in relation to the foreign policy and national interest of the United States. It reported to the president on March 1, 1957, and ceased operations by the close of that month.
The committee received testimony and reports on foreign aid programs from major military and foreign policy figures. The committee also made a six-week round-the-world trip during which members interviewed leading military and political figures in European and Asian nations receiving American aid. Committee members also received briefings from American military assistance advisory teams and embassy staffs during the trip.
While the committee received an appreciable amount of input on military aid, its major recommendations were in the field of economic assistance and administrative changes in the foreign aid program. It recommended gradual reciprocal tariff reduction to the end of achieving minimal foreign quantitative restrictions on American trade. Also recommended were support of regional organizations like the European Common Market; tax incentives for American private investment abroad; continued government loans to supplement efforts of the Export-Import Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; and continuation of the agricultural surplus sales program (PL 480).
In the administrative field, the committee recommended separation of military and economic appropriations, integration of the International Cooperation Administration into the U.S. State Department, two-year appropriations for foreign aid, and greater discretionary authority for the executive branch in spending foreign assistance funds.

Thomas Carlos Mehen

Thomas Carlos Mehen (born September 8, 1970) is an American physicist. His research has consisted of primarily Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the application of effective field theory to problems in hadronic physics. He has also worked on effective field theory for non-relativistic particles whose short range interactions are characterized by a large scattering length, as well as novel field theories which arise from unusual limits of string theory.
Mehen was born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras where he learned Spanish as his first language. In 1974 at the age of three he relocated with his family to McLean, Virginia, USA. He was educated at the University of Virginia (B.S., 1992), and Johns Hopkins University (M.A., Ph.D., 1998). He served as a research associate and John A. McCone Postdoctoral Scholar in the Division of Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology from 1997 to 2000.

Chcete být milionářem?

Chcete být milionářem? (English translation: "Do you want to be a millionaire?") was a Czech game show based on the original British format of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The show was hosted by Vladimír Čech, Ondřej Hejma and Martin Preiss (changed by some time). The main goal of the game was to win 10 millions Czech korunas (€345,500) by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. There were 3 "lifelines" - fifty fifty ("50:50"), phone a friend ("přítel na telefonu") and ask the audience ("rada publika"). The game show was shown on the Czech TV station TV NOVA. When a contestant got the fifth question correct, he left with at least 10,000 CZK. When a contestant got the tenth question correct, he left with at least 320,000 CZK. Nobody won the main prize. The show was later renamed to "Milionář".

The Reno Renegades were a short-lived American professional minor league ice hockey team based in Reno, Nevada. The team was a founding member of the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL).
Although the Renegades never moved past the first round of the WCHL playoffs, the team achieved notoriety in 1996 by signing female goaltender Manon Rhéaume, who earlier in the decade played in preseason games for the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning. Rhéaume appeared in 11 regular season games for the Renegades during the 1996-97 season.
In 1997 the team was renamed the Reno Rage, but folded after the 1997-98 season.
Possible return as an ECHL team.
In 2000 rights to the defunct Renegades/Rage organization were purchased by businessman Larry Leasure of Boise, Idaho. When the WCHL was absorbed by the ECHL in 2003, Leasure announced his intention to base the team in that league as the Reno Raiders. Although Leasure hoped to have the team operational by the 2007-08 season, he has been unable to secure an interest in a suitable arena in the Reno area. Leasure has said he would reassess his progress after the season.
As of the 2013-14 season, the franchise is still inactive.

Allen, Allen, Allen &amp; Allen

Allen, Allen, Allen & Allen is a United States law firm based in Richmond, Virginia. Founded in 1910 in Lunenburg County, Virginia the firm now has 23 attorneys and more than 127 employees in 8 offices in Virginia. They have offices in Richmond, Chesterfield, Mechanicsville, Petersburg, Garrisonville, Fredericksburg, Charlottesville and Short Pump.
History.
In 1910, George E. Allen, Sr., opened his first law office in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He later moved his office to Victoria, Virginia, where he also served as the youngest mayor in the town's history.
In 1931, during the Depression, George Allen moved his firm and his family to Richmond. Over the ensuing years, his three sons – George E. Allen, Jr., Ashby B. Allen, and Wilbur C. Allen – joined their father in the practice of law.
The firm's founder, who also served a term as a Virginia state senator, sought to expand the legal rights of persons injured through no fault of their own. He was a highly respected appellate lawyer who frequently argued cases before the Virginia Supreme Court and established new legal principles benefiting injured persons. George Allen served as president of the Richmond Bar Association in 1959 and was the first president of the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association.
In 1965, the American College of Trial Lawyers presented him with its first Award for Courageous Advocacy as a result of his work defending a member of a minority group against unjust charges. Mr. Allen also was a founder of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers.
During the early 1950s, Allen & Allen successfully represented injured plaintiffs in a landmark product liability case, Mahone v. Ford Motor Company, one of the earliest successful products liability cases against a U.S. automobile manufacturer. It was during this period that Allen & Allen decided to limit its practice to personal injury law.
In February, 2009, Coleman Allen, Jr., a trial lawyer with the firm, was co-signer with Rodney A. Smolla for Vicki Iseman of the public statement released upon Ms. Iseman's settlement (without cash) of her defamation suit against "The New York Times". Ms. Iseman had sued over coverage of her part in the John McCain lobbyist controversy, during Sen. McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. The statement rested much of the case on whether Ms. Iseman was a private citizen or public figure in the situation, with her lawyers arguing for her rights as a private citizen.

Childhaven

Childhaven is a King County nonprofit organization that serves children between the ages of one month and five years who have been abused or neglected, or are at risk. The agency runs three programs: Therapeutic Child Care, the state's first program in which children referred by Child Protective Services or Child Welfare Services receive treatment geared toward their particular developmental needs; the Drug-Affected Infant Program, which includes children affected by in-utero or environmental drug use (and requires parents to enroll in outpatient chemical-dependency treatment); and the Crisis Nursery, King County's only 24-hour program to care for children when their parents face a crisis situation.
The agency encompasses three branches: the Broadway Branch in First Hill, the Eli Creekmore Memorial Branch in Burien, and the Patrick L. Gogerty Branch in Auburn. In addition to other in-state organizations, agencies in South Carolina and Calgary have imitated Childhaven's model.
History.
Childhaven was founded in 1909 by the Reverend Mark A. Matthews. Its original name was Seattle Day Nursery, and at the time it was one of only 50 child-care centers in the U.S. The agency's original nursery building was constructed in 1921 in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood; today, the site is home to Childhaven's Broadway Center, which was completed in 2004 thanks to the Capital Campaign, which raised $15.5 million.
Seattle Day Nursery's name and purpose transformed following a shift in leadership that started in 1973. That year, Patrick Gogerty became the organization's executive director, and he soon changed its focus, establishing the Therapeutic Child Care Program in 1977 with 10 children. This occurred two years before Washington state made the reporting of child abuse mandatory. Under Gogerty's guidance, the agency began to garner national acclaim; in 1984, it was the subject of a major article in "Life" magazine. The following year, Seattle Day Nursery was formally renamed Childhaven.
That same year, Congress threatened to cut off Childhaven's funding. Gogerty enlisted the help of his friend Rep. Jim McDermott, who brought the "Life" article to a House session and told the story of a specific child the agency had rescued. Persuaded, Congress continued to provide funding for Childhaven's work. Before Gogerty retired in March 1998, "The Seattle Times" published an editorial lauding his achievements; its headline was "Fighting for Kids Unable to Fight for Themselves."
Childhaven recently celebrated its centennial, and a number of events were planned, including a large-scale luncheon and several open houses.
Crisis Nursery.
Childhaven's Crisis Nursery, which offers parents up to 72 hours of emergency overnight child care, is one of roughly 70 such nurseries in the United States. (There are eight in Washington state.) Parents usually place their children in the Crisis Nursery through a voluntary and confidential process. The program serves children up to 7 years old and relies on foster families for overnight care and a North Seattle day-care center for daytime placement. Parents use the Crisis Nursery for a wide variety of reasons, including sleep deprivation, postpartum depression, or even participation in an in-patient chemical dependency treatment program. (Children of parents in drug treatment may receive Crisis Nursery care for as long as 30 days.)

Repocura River

The Repocura River of the La Araucanía Region of Chile has its source in the eastern slope of the Nahuelbuta Range northwest of the town of Cholchol and runs towards the southeast to join the Cholchol River on its western bank across from Cholchol. It is wide and of a depth that allows the navigation of small boats. The river crosses flat and fertile fields.
This valley of the Repocura River was the location of the densely populated Rupucura rehue and was the location of the principal placer gold mines of the old city of La Imperial before the Mapuche Uprising of 1598. Rupucura also was the name of one of the aillarehue of the Lafkenmapu Butalmapu. Rupucura was located on both shores of the Cholchol River, from entrance of the Colpi River, to the Cautín River, and from the Cautin, from hills of Nielol to the Nahuelbuta Range. By the bank of the Repocura river Fort de la Encarnación was built in 1666 by the Royal Governor of Chile Francisco de Meneses Brito. A fort and a mission with the title of Repocura or Repucura were founded in December 1694, replacing to the Fort de la Encarnación destroyed during a Mapuche rising earlier that year. These were also ruined in the Mapuche Insurrection of 1723 and were again restored in 1764 but the Mapuche again destroyed them completely two years later in the Mapuche Rebellion of 1766.
Its Mapudungun name according to Diego de Rosales meant rock road, from the words "rypu" "way" and "cura", "stone".

Charles Hall (economist)

Charles Hall (1740–1825) was a British physician, social critic and Ricardian socialist who published "The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States" in 1805, condemning capitalism for its inability to provide for the poor. In the book, Hall argued that inequalities in wealth and the production of luxuries led to the exploitation of the poor, and their suffering. Hall famously claimed that the exploitation of the poor was so severe that they "retained only the product of one hour's work out of eight".
As a remedy for the problems in society, Hall proposed land reform and progressive taxation. His views and economic theory, particularly his views on severe exploitation of the poor, were important to the development of Marxism, and have led many to consider him one of the earliest socialists.
Biography.
Hall was born in England around 1740, and studied medicine at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. After completing his medical studies, Hall practiced in the West Country of England, where he acquired "intimate knowledge of the living conditions of the poor". Hall read the theories of a number of influential classical economists, including Malthus, David Ricardo and Adam Smith. While he disagreed with many of the ideas of classical economics, it shaped his thinking. Hall's thinking was also shaped by his friendship with the land-nationalization advocate Thomas Spence, with whom he corresponded regularly.
Hall moved around throughout his career, but probably spent most of his life in Tavistock, Devon, practicing medicine. In 1785, he published "The Family Medical Instructor", a medical reference book. Thereafter, his publications were primarily economic in nature. In 1805, he published his principal work, "The Effects of Civilization", followed by "Observations on the Principal Conclusion in Mr. Malthus's Essay on Population" in 1813. In 1816, Hall was arrested for failure to pay a debt of £157, and he spent the next nine years in the Fleet Prison, before being released on June 21, 1825. While the exact date of his death is uncertain, it is believed that he died shortly thereafter.
"The Effects of Civilization".
After witnessing high food prices and food shortages in England from 1795–1801, Hall began to write "The Effects of Civilization on the People in European States" which set forth his economic theories. Hall argued that the root cause of food shortage, was that too few people worked in agriculture, while too many were employed in trade and manufacturing. From this argument, Hall proceeded to his definition of wealth, arguing that "wealth consists not in things but in power over the labour of others".
The cause of shortages.
From his definition of wealth, Hall argued that the problem in civilized societies came from the ability of the wealthy, through their control of the labor of others, to determine what is produced. Because the wealthy quickly provide for their own necessities, they spend their surplus on luxuries, which "make it possible for a rich man to consume and destroy infinitely more of the produce of other men's labours than he would be able to do if only foodstuffs and basic necessities were available". Because the rich exploit the poor to produce their luxuries, Hall argued that "the wealth of the rich and the misery of the poor increase in strict proportion". Thus, the rising power of the rich is the cause of the suffering of the poor.
Statistics.
In addition to developing a theoretical model in "The Effects of Civilization", Hall attempted to use scientific methods and government statistics to provide evidence for his view. According to his estimates, the top 20% of society, the rich, consumed 7/8 of what was produced by the poor, leaving the poor with only one eighth of what they had produced. Later scholars, however, have calculated that the inequalities described by Hall were not quite so severe.
Remedies.
After describing the challenges facing society, Hall proposed several remedies. Hall was a strong proponent of progressive taxation to even out the inequalities of society. He also argued that if marriages between two people who owned land were prohibited, then wealth would gradually spread more evenly throughout society. Most importantly, on the basis of his argument that luxuries caused the suffering of the poor, Hall argued that luxury goods "should be prohibited, or subject to punitive taxation". Hall believed that his remedies were "readily practicable", and would improve the station of the poor, but were unlikely to solve the problems of society completely.
Legacy.
Hall is widely regarded as a key to the development of Marxist thought, and Karl Marx referred to him as "a true phenomenon in the history of economic thought". Hall was also an important precursor to Henry George, and one of the first modern land reformers.
Many scholars also identify Hall as one of "first of the early socialists", and one of the first thinkers to recognize the importance of surplus value and rents to societal inequality.

Church of the Transfiguration, Pyecombe

The Church of the Transfiguration is an Anglican church in the village of Pyecombe, in the Mid Sussex district of West Sussex, England. The mostly 12th- and 13th-century building, in an isolated setting facing the South Downs, has been designated a Grade I Listed building. It is the parish church of Pyecombe.
History.
The small village of Pyecombe is situated in a long, deep valley (or coombe) formed by the river Wellesbourne as it flows towards the English Channel at Brighton. (The river is now a winterbourne and runs underground for most of its length.) The South Downs rise to about to the east and west. The village is in two parts about apart. The original medieval settlement formed around the church and an ancient trackway across the South Downs; when this declined, new development took place to the west. A 16th-century cottage which may have been part of the manor house is in this newer area. Pyecombe manor was probably split from the larger manor of Pangdean (mentioned in the Domesday Book) by the 13th century, although they were later reunited.
The church was built on the west side of the trackway, which was at the centre of three ancient routes across the South Downs which split at the south end of the village. The western route became the main London Road, now the A23; the eastern route forms the A273 to Clayton, Hassocks, Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath. The church existed, under the name of Pangdean (or Pingeden) Church, at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, when the St Pancras Priory at Lewes held the advowson. In 1537, during the Reformation, it passed to King Henry VIII.
The oldest parts of the present structure, the chancel, chancel arch and nave, are 12th-century; a date of 1170 has been attributed. The Norman tower at the west end was built in the 13th century and holds one 15th-century bell. A roughcast finish was applied to the whole exterior in 1898, but this has now been removed except on the outside of a blocked doorway on the south side. As well as this restoration, some work was carried out on the church in 1844 and 1914.
Architecture.
The church is aligned from east to west with its chancel and altar at the east end. It consists of a 12th-century chancel and plain, semicircular chancel arch; a nave of the same age, with two rectangular windows on each side; and a short tower from the 13th century, with two angled buttresses at the southwestern and northwestern corners. The former has a 13th-century gravestone incorporated into the stonework, but the buttresses are no earlier than 14th-century. On the north side is an entrance porch and a vestry. Horsham stone tiles are used for the church and porch roofs and the shallow "Sussex cap"-style roof of the tower.
In common with many Sussex churches, flint was used as the main building material. This was hidden under the roughcasting for about a century, but has now been revealed again. There are modern stone dressings around the windows. Some of the windows themselves are also 19th-century copies, although those in the nave are from the 15th century.
Inside, the chancel arch has a smaller modern arch on each side. The tiled floor of the sanctuary dates from the 13th century; the encaustic tiles were made at St Pancras Priory, and retain designs showing animals and birds. The carved pulpit is dated 1636, although it was remodelled in 1898. The lectern has similar carvings. One surviving 12th-century internal fixture is the font, made of one strip of lead bent into a drum shape and sealed at the join. The exterior has ornate scrollwork designs.
Tapsel gate.
There is a rare design of gate on the north side of the churchyard. Unique to Sussex, and named after the Sussex family who were responsible for its invention, the Tapsel gate is one of only six remaining in the county, although others may have existed in the past. All are found within of Lewes. The Tapsel gate at Pyecombe is an early 20th-century replacement: the original was put in place in the 18th century. It incorporates the hooked end of a Pyecombe crook—a type of shepherd's staff made in the village since the 18th century.
Tapsel gates are mounted on a central pivot. Even when fully open, they are too narrow to allow cattle to enter churchyards, but they are easier for pallbearers to negotiate than a normal side-hinged gate: they can pass on each side and the coffin can be rested on the central pivot if necessary.
The church today.
The Church of the Transfiguration is part of the Benefice of Poynings with Edburton, Newtimber and Pyecombe. This covers five downland villages, each with one church: the others are St Andrew's Church at Edburton, Holy Trinity Church at Poynings and St John the Evangelist's Church in Newtimber. The former church of the Good Shepherd at Fulking is no longer in use but is nominally part of the Benefice. The parish itself covers Pyecombe village and the surrounding farms and downland, as far south as the Brighton and Hove boundary and north to Clayton.
The church was Grade I listed on 28 October 1957. The local District Council designated the area around the church a conservation area in January 1989.
Two services take place each month, and Pyecombe Parish Council holds its meetings in the church.

Delia Brown

Delia Brown (born 1969) is a New York-based artist originally from California. She is one of several artists who gained notice at a moment when much attention was being paid to the graduates of Los Angeles-area MFA programs. Brown graduated from UCLA in 2000.
Life and work.
Best known for painted scenes that include her friends cavorting in places of specific privilege (such as art collectors' homes), Brown gained notoriety in October 2000 when the New York Times Magazine ran an 8-page spread of her watercolors posing as fashion editorial. This publication coincided with her debut exhibition at D'Amelio Terras gallery in Chelsea, titled What! Are You Jealous? (featuring scenes of women drinking champagne poolside in Beverly Hills-ish backyards, with the title borrowed from a Gauguin painting of Tahitian women lounging likewise), which was attacked by Times critic Michael Kimmelman who called the buzz around her work a "pseudo-event".
Brown's work is primarily engaged in exploring desire as an individuated experience that connects the personal to the collective unconscious, often mediated through advertising and commercial culture. Referencing early bourgeois painting genres, she paints herself and friends enacting their own fantasies of being part of the leisure class, with props from snacks and beverages to million-dollar artworks functioning as important accessories in the assumption of privilege.
In interviews, Brown has often referenced her upbringing in a left-wing activist family as influential in her choice of subject matter. She has expressed discomfort about the role of the painter/artist as serving as high-status entertainment and decor for the patron class, and much of her work seems to contain a subtle grain of hostility, implying the discomfort she feels in her own complicity in this economic arrangement.
Brown's background includes several years pursuing a career as a hiphop lyricist in a two-girl group called The Fuzz (with Evelyn Charlot, a.k.a. Evenflo), as well as studies in the Stanislavsky Method of acting. These experiences inform Brown's practice in various ways including her use of role-playing and dress-up for her paintings, and occasional forays into performance and video.
Brown has worked with actress Hollis Witherspoon in developing a fictional artist character called Chelsey Green, whose paintings and performances Brown devises and then hands off to Witherspoon the job of playing "author" to the projects. To date, Witherspoon-as-Green has been seen in a painting and video exhibition at the Margo Leavin Gallery in Los Angeles (2006) titled Step-and-Repeats and Double Self-Portraits.
Witherspoon also plays a character in Brown's on-going project titled Felicity and Caprice, a narrative series of paintings and drawings which draw upon Claude Chabrol's camp masterpiece of 1960s French cinema, "Les Biches". A series of drawings on this theme was exhibited at D'Amelio Terras in 2007 and received praise from critics. Writing in the New York Times, Martha Schwendener says "Ms. Brown has taken hold of a cache of references, from commercial illustration to French erotic cinema, and spun it into a deadpan, streamlined narrative about women, friendship and patronage".

Bulgarian Dreams

Bulgarian Dreams is a UK-registered property sales agent, specialising in the sale of off plan properties in Bulgaria to buyers mainly from the UK and Ireland. The company announced in December 2008 that it had ceased trading.
Berkeley Square Trading.
Bulgarian Dreams is a trading name of Berkeley Square Trading Limited, a UK limited company (no. 04647920) registered at 120 Moorgate, London, EC2M 6SS. The company secretary is Mariya Georgieva, and the directors are Mariya Georgieva and Robert Jenkin. They were also the only shareholders as of the company's 2007 annual return.
Offices.
Bulgarian Dreams operated from several offices with headquarters at 120 Moorgate, London, UK, EC2M 6SS - now closed
Early success.
Bulgarian Dreams sold off plan properties in Bulgaria, marketing the country as an up-and-coming destination with a rapidly developing economy and growing tourist trade. The company was well regarded and won International Residential Property Awards for Real Estate Agency in three consecutive years 2004-2006 including Best Real Estate Agency, Best Property in Bulgaria, Best Property Website and Best Development in Bulgaria from 2004 through to 2006.
The company received widespread news coverage.
Ceasing Trading.
The London office closed around the end of 2008 but the Sofia office remains open and in contact with clients. The Bulgarian Dreams website was replaced in early 2009 with a statement from the company stating that they had decided to cease trading due to prevailing economic conditions. Customers were instructed to liaise directly with the developers of their properties.
Customer complaints and adverse publicity.
Bulgarian Dreams has received negative media coverage, with customer dissatisfaction gaining pace through 2008 and into 2009. Buyers have complained that the properties they have paid for (either in part or in full) were left incomplete, or delayed due to financial problems and/or planning permission issues.
The BBC’s consumer affairs programme Watchdog featured a story on Bulgarian Dreams which aired on 9 February 2009 in the UK. This highlighted the problems experienced by one buyer who purchased an apartment at the Windows To Paradise development on the Black Sea coast being built by the development company Interlink. It was noted that Robert Jenkin had been a director of the company until November 2006.
Watchdog broadcast an update to the story the following week, on 16 February 2009. This featured more dissatisfied customers.
Bulgarian Dreams declined to be interviewed on air but issued the following statement:
Robert Jenkin was interviewed with Chris Dale in Sofia by Watchdog with whom he had been liaising. The interview largely focused on the Windows To Paradise development. This meeting was featured in a Watchdog programme which aired on 18 May 2009 in the UK.
At the meeting Robert Jenkin explained that Windows To Paradise had run into difficulties due to a cash-flow problem at the development company, that building costs had been higher than expected and that the global slowdown had hit sales. Additionally a number of purchasers hadn't paid their final payments and that these funds could be used to fund completion of the properties. He said that following these problems he and his customers were now moving forward. "Myself and the owners, we're talking about the majority of owners in many developments now, we've put that behind us, we've drawn a line in the sand." When asked about his connections with the development company Interlink, Robert Jenkin stated that he'd once been a manager (until 2006) and that his wife was still a manager, but he explained that these appointments were non-executive and made to allow Bulgarian Dreams to have access to increased information flow on behalf of purchasers.
It was reported in the interview that a new structure was being proposed to move the development to completion but that if this failed it was likely that the properties would be auctioned off in relation to an outstanding loan due by the development company.
Related companies.
Bulgarian Dreams also operated a sister company called "Go Visit Bulgaria" (rentals).

Anvil Island

Anvil Island, is the third-largest of the islands in Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, and the northernmost of the major islands in that sound. It is located northeast of Gambier Island and southwest of Britannia Beach and west of Porteau Cove. The Defence Islands are to its northeast and are Indian Reserves of the Squamish Nation. A summer camp, Daybreak Point Bible Camp, operates on the south of the island, and people are located on the southern side of the island.
Name origin.
The name was conferred on June 14, 1792 by Captain George Vancouver, whose journal for the day reads:
The reason for this peculiar name in caused by the shape of the island when looking at it upside-down. Its supposed to look like an anvil, but most people do not get the upside-down part of it. So they end up saying it looks like an Elephant with a party hat on.
Terrain.
The terrain of Anvil Island is mostly cliffs and hills. Starting at the south-side of the island it is more of a flat and plain terrain. At the very tip is Irby point; but also called _______ by the natives, means 'a good place to hunt'. 'The Point' as it is often referred to by the local population, is the place where most of the deer would go to feed. Going west along the coast of the south-side, there is Daybreak Point where a Bible Camp is located.
People.
Anvil Island has a small population living on the island year-round, and is mostly populated during the summer.

Tapsel gate

A Tapsel gate is a type of wooden gate, unique to the English county of Sussex, which has a central pivot upon which it can rotate through 90° in either direction before coming to a stop at two fixed points. It was named after a Sussex family of bell-founders, one of whom invented it in the late 18th century. Only six examples survive, all within a radius of Lewes, the county town of Sussex. Tapsel gates have the dual advantage of keeping cattle out of churchyards and allowing the efficient passage of coffins carried to and from the church during burials. The name sometimes is used more generally to describe swivelling gates of a similar design elsewhere.
Origins.
The Tapsel family first was recorded in Sussex in 1577, when the churchwardens in the parish of West Tarring paid for some church bells. The surname was recorded as "Topsayle" and many other variant spellings have been recorded subsequently: Tapsell, Tapsil, Tapsayle, Tapsaille, Topsil and Topsel. As a result, the name of the gate sometimes is spelled differently. Several generations of the family worked as bell-founders and rope-makers from a foundry in Tarring, although they travelled throughout Sussex to undertake repairs and cast new bells.
Research suggests the most likely inventor of the Tapsel gate was John Tapsel (or Tapsell), who lived in Mountfield near Battle in the early 18th century, although this is not known for certain. The first record of a Tapsel gate is in the churchwarden's accounts book from St. Pancras Church at Kingston near Lewes. An accounting entry in 1729 notes that 1s. 6d. was paid by the church for the installation of a gate in its churchyard.
Location of the gates.
Gates of various ages exist at village churches in East and West Sussex. -St. Simon and St. Jude Church at East Dean, St. Mary the Virgin Church at neighbouring Friston, and Coombes Church in the hamlet of Coombes retain their original gates, without any restoration. The gate at St. Andrew's Church in Jevington was the only one with an integral stile, but this has been removed and it was restored in 1933. The local parish council has adopted the gate as its logo. The gate at the Church of the Transfiguration in Pyecombe is a replica of its original, and is topped by the curved end of a Pyecombe crook—a type of shepherd's crook popular among downland shepherds, which was made in a forge opposite the church.
St Pancras Church at Kingston near Lewes, has a modern replacement for the old gate which was first set up in 1729. 
A short distance from Coombes Church, a modern Tapsel gate dated 2003 links St Botolph's Church in Botolphs, West Sussex, with an adjacent burial ground.
No gates of the true Tapsel design have ever been reported outside Sussex, although variations on the concept have been seen occasionally. In 1896, for example, the Sussex Archaeological Society used the name "Tapsel gate" in its description of a device which opened and closed by means of a wheel, chain, and counterweight. This was at St. Leonard's Church in Heston, Middlesex (now Greater London). The name also is used to describe gates of related, but not identical, design at St Wilfrid's Church in Burnsall, North Yorkshire (this gate is operated by a pulley mechanism), Hayes in West London, and North Cerney in Gloucestershire (these are integrated into lychgates rather than being free-standing).
Design.
Tapsel gates are made of wood and are balanced on a solid wooden or metal pivot, instead of being hinged on one side. They can be opened easily, in either direction, with a small push; they therefore are much easier to negotiate than more typical gates. Common problems of side-hinged gates—heaviness and susceptibility to breakage, for example—are avoided. Also, a Tapsel gate can be opened in a smaller area than would be needed for a side-mounted gate. Because the gate is mounted in the centre of the opening in a wall, it effectively halves its width, which prevents passage by large animals, but allows people to pass through on either side easily. This characteristic is especially beneficial in churchyards, enabling pallbearers to carry a coffin through a gate without difficulty.

Princess Maria Augusta of Saxony

Maria Augusta Nepomucena Antonia Francisca Xaveria Aloysia (; ) of Saxony (born Dresden, 21 June 1782; died Dresden, 14 March 1863) of the House of Wettin was the daughter of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony and Amalie of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld.
Her father, Frederick Augustus, was the King of Saxony and prince of the Duchy of Warsaw. She was his only child to reach adulthood. Her family had a claim to the throne of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) and the Constitution of May 3rd (1791) named her as a potential successor to the Polish throne if the male line of the Wettin family were to end. In Poland, she was called the "infanta of Poland".
Plans to marry her to a family that would be able to strengthen its claim on Poland failed, as none of the contemporary powers wanted to strengthen Saxony or restore the Polish kingdom. One of her potential suitors was Józef Poniatowski.

One Strike-Three Anti Campaign

The One Strike-Three Anti campaign () was a national campaign in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1970. The 'Strike' referred to a crackdown on the activities of 'counter-revolutionary' elements in China, while the 'Three Antis' were 'graft and embezzlement', 'profiteering' and 'extravagance and waste'.
Background.
The One Strike-Three Anti campaign was launched by the central Communist Party leadership of the PRC in 1970 in an effort to improve China's economic situation and curb the corruption and anarchy in industry. At the end of 1969, production of every major item (with the exception of crude oil) failed to reach its respective target level, and across China production was hindered by continued factionalism and the actions of more radical groupings. The campaign was an attempt to tackle this worsening situation.
Course of the movement.
In February 1970, the leadership in Beijing announced the start of the One Strike-Three Anti campaign with immediate effect. The order to local authorities in China to 'strike' against 'active counterrevolutionary elements' was issued by Zhou Enlai with Mao Zedong's blessing on 31 January, and the 'Three Antis' ('graft and embezzlement', 'profiteering' and 'extravagance and waste') were unveiled a week later on 5 February. In order for these issues to be effectively tacked, the Beijing leadership called for a national 'tide' of denunciations and the involvement of the 'masses' in the campaign.
However, these fairly vague parameters for what constituted 'active counterrevolutionary elements' led to a situation where interpretations and actions against these elements varied considerably in their definition and in their ferocity, tending to err on the harsh rather than the lenient side. For example, in Yinchuan, three university graduates were arrested and executed for supposed 'counterrevolutionary' activity whilst only pretending to study communist theory (such activity included the desecration of a copy of the 'Little Red Book'), and in Hunan province the outspoken wife of Chen Yun was subjected to struggle sessions and solitary confinement for the putting up of two controversial big-character posters. It was also more generally the case that those condemned in the movement were attacked for financial reasons rather than their political views or actions- for example, in Zhabei in Shanghai, only 6% of all cases in the movement were for political reasons.
The crackdowns on unsavoury elements in the cities were periodic and therefore known as 'red typhoons'. In Shanghai, under the guidance of Wang Hongwen, these 'red typhoons' occurred on average every two months, and involved the mass mobilisation of thousands of police and militia to undertake raids across the city, in the hope of uncovering evidence of 'counterrevolutionary activity'. The ambiguous nature of the wording of the original orders from Zhou Enlai and Mao also meant that in Shanghai (and elsewhere) any small crime could be quickly made into a crime against the 'people'.
Denouement.
The One Strike-Three Anti campaign did not have a definite end, as it came to its conclusion at various times across China. In the capital, the proceedings were largely over by the end of 1970, with the report on the campaign reporting the discovery of 5,757 'counterrevolutionaries', the resolving of 3,138 criminal cases related to major crimes and 'counterrevolutionary' activity and the highlighting of over 6,000 cases of the 'Three Antis'. Elsewhere, however, the campaign continued until as late as 1972 or 1973, with it ending in Shanghai in late 1972. According to the official report, 64,000 people from Shanghai and the surrounding area were 'struggled' against. Officially, the CCP reported that over 280,000 arrests of 'counterrevolutionaries' occurred in the first 10 months of the campaign, up to November 1970.

SdKfz 265 Panzerbefehlswagen

The SdKfz 265 "Panzerbefehlswagen" was the German Army's first purpose-designed command tank, and the primary German command tank in service at the beginning of World War II. Converted from the Panzer I "Ausf". B, the SdKfz 265 was to see considerable action during the early years of the War.
History.
The SdKfz 265 was designed to fulfil a growing need within the German Army for a command tank, following the realization that the leaders of a massive panzer formation would themselves have to travel in a tank of some type. This vehicle would have to carry extra equipment and personnel to assist the field commander in his duties.
In 1935 Krupp offered a command tank design based on the existing Panzer I Ausf B training tank chassis. The "Ausf". B was a turretless chassis version of the Panzer I designed solely to train tank drivers, and lent itself easily to conversion into a command vehicle.
Design.
To increase space for a radio operator the rotating turret of the PzKpfw IB was eliminated and replaced with a larger fixed "box" superstructure. This allowed room for map boards, paperwork and a more powerful FuG6 radio transmitter in addition to the earlier FuG2 radio (Panzer I's had only FuG2 radio receivers). Despite these modifications the vehicle's interior remained small, a factor leading to its rapid replacement by conversions of larger tanks. The cramped quarters also made operation of the vehicle's single ball-mounted MG13 or MG34 machine gun virtually impossible. Because of this, most SdKfz 265 were also equipped with pistol ports, and many had their machine guns removed entirely. A large frame antenna was mounted to the hull of many early version SdKfz 265s. The antenna gave the upgraded radio transmitter units better range and reception.
Because it would be necessary for a command tank to keep up with the tanks under its command, the original 60 hp Krupp M305 gasoline engine of the Panzer I was replaced by the more powerful 100 hp Maybach NL38TR gasoline engine, resulting in a design that was 3 km/h faster, despite weighing 300 kg more than the Panzer I. Increased fuel capacity also gave the SdKfz 265 a range of 290 kilometres, nearly 160 kilometres further than the Panzer I.
Despite its ungainly appearance, the SdKfz 265 was 1.97 m high, only 25 cm taller than the original Panzer IB.
Production.
About 190 SdKfz 265 "Panzerbefehlswagen" conversions were produced by Daimler-Benz between 1935 and 1937, and were produced at the same time as the Ausf B.
In combat.
Between 1935 and 1940 the SdKfz 265 "Panzerbefehlswagen" was the standard command tank of the German Panzer divisions. Each Panzer division contained sixteen tank companies, grouped into four battalions, two regiments or one brigade, for a total of twenty-three headquarters. Each headquarters would be issued at least one command tank. In 1940 the SdKfz 265 was also issued to the signals and observation battalions of the Panzer artillery regiments.
The SdKfz 265 first saw combat in the Polish Campaign of September 1939. Afterwards, many were converted to "Sanitatskraftwagen" I (Sd.Kfz. 265) armoured ambulances which served in the French Campaign of 1940. Of the 190 produced, 96 were still in used in May 1940 at the start of the invasion of France and the Low Countries. Following a 15 mm increase in armor protection (to a total of 28 mm) that was hastily applied to the surfaces of the superstructure as a result of combat experiences in Poland, the SdKfz 265 command tank continued in use throughout the invasions of France and Holland, and in 1941 many were shipped across the Mediterranean to participate in the North African Campaign. SdKfz 265 also saw considerable action in the Balkans Campaigns of 1941 before being replaced by larger command vehicles. Though replaced at the company level, many would continue to see service at higher levels of command through 1942. Some were also used as radio control vehicles for "Minenraeum-Wagen" BI/BII (Sd.Kfz.300). A small number were also exported to Hungary. A few were still in service with the German Army when the war ended, though largely delegated to training roles.

Dori Monson

Dori Monson (born 1961) is an American radio personality who hosts the pre-game, post-game and halftime shows on the Seahawks Radio Network and the "Dori Monson Show", an afternoon talk radio show in Seattle, Washington, on KIRO-FM.
Personal life and early career.
Monson, who is of Icelandic heritage, was raised in Ballard, a Scandinavian ethnic enclave in Seattle. He graduated from Ballard High School. As a student at the University of Washington he was the play-by-play announcer for Husky football on campus broadcaster KCMU-FM. He began his professional broadcasting career as a producer at KING-TV and sports reporter at KING-AM, then moved to KIRO as part of the "Pat Cashman Show".
Monson is married with three daughters and lives in Lake Forest Park, Washington, where he coaches girls' youth basketball. He has variously described himself as "right-leaning," "center right," and "libertarian", and said he voted for Bob Barr in the 2008 presidential election.
Current work.
In 1995 Monson was given his own show on KIRO in the noon to 3:00 p.m. time slot, replacing Dave Ross who moved to the preceding 9:00 a.m. to noon morning slot.
"The Dori Monson Show" is heard from noon to 3:00pm PDT on KIRO-FM and is primarily a politically oriented talk radio program. As of winter 2008, his show was the highest rated talk radio program in the Seattle-Tacoma market. In 2008 Monson was nominated for Radio & Records News/Talk/Sports Local Personality Of The Year, ultimately losing to Bill Handel of KFI-AM (Los Angeles).
The dominant political orientation of his program began as roughly middle-of-the-road throughout the 1990s. He often sided with then President Bill Clinton against the conservative Republicans running Congress, particularly during the impeachment hearings following the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He said he voted for Al Gore in the year 2000 presidential election. However, his show turned decidedly conservative around the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001, frequently attacking local Democratic politicians such as former King County Executive Ron Sims, enthusiastically supporting the Iraq invasion, and decrying global warming as a hoax perpetuated by "evil cultists." He also once asked Washington State Democratic Party Chairman Dwight Pelz if he was a communist.
Among the regular features on "The Dori Monson Show" is the weekly "one on one against the nuns" segment where Monson tests his football acumen against two nuns, Sisters Kath Silverthorn and Cele Gorman of the Archdiocese of Seattle, each making predictions for the next Sunday's NFL games. "I wanted to find the absolute most incongruous people we'd normally never associate with football analysis," Monson explained. "I thought that would be either Sherpas or nuns and it'd probably be easier to find nuns." Another feature is the annual "Dori Awards" where listeners are invited to vote on the most annoying local and national personalities of the past year. Past national Dori winners include Sarah Palin, Al Gore, Rosie O'Donnell, Cindy Sheehan, Michael Moore, Michael Jackson, Trent Lott, and George W. Bush. Past local winners include former Seattle Supersonics owner Clay Bennett, former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire, Congressman Jim McDermott, Ron Sims, conservative initiative and referendum sponsor Tim Eyman, and Dori Monson himself.
Since 2002 Monson has hosted "Hawk Talk", a day-of-game broadcast carried on the Seahawks Radio Network, a network of 46 radio stations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alaska, and British Columbia, that airs games of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks. Monson also anchors the pre-game, post-game and halftime shows during Seahawks broadcasts, when he is joined by Sam Adkins, Paul Moyer, and Dave Wyman.

Reginald Rickman

Reginald Binns Rickman (6 May 1881 - 22 November 1940) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1906 and 1911 and captained the side in 1908 and 1909.
Rickman was born at Doncaster, Yorkshire, the son of Samuel Rickman and his wife Emily Rachel Binns, daughter of Charles Binns manager of the Clay Cross Company. The family lived in Devon, and Rickman's first games were Minor Counties matches for Devon in 1901 and 1903.
In the 1906 season, Rickman made his debut for Derbyshire in an uninspiring performance against Lancashire in May. He continued to play in 1907 and in 1908 was captain in a season which saw Derbyshire move up to third from the bottom in the County Championship. He captained again in the 1909 season but the team slipped a notch in the table. He played seven games in the 1910 season but appeared in his last single game in the 1911 season. Rickman was a right hand batsman and played 65 matches for the club and 118 innings. His highest score was 68 and he averaged 11.47. He was a right arm medium bowler and took 62 wickets at an average of 31.72.
Rickman saw service in the army and became a Lieutenant Colonel. He died at Chelsea, London at the age of 61.

Manchester Boddy

Elias Manchester Boddy (pronounced "Boady") (1891–1967) rose from poverty to become the publisher of a major California newspaper and a candidate for Congress. His estate, Descanso Gardens, was bequeathed to the County of Los Angeles as a floral park.
Birth and education.
Boddy was born November 1, 1891, in a log cabin on a Lake Tapps, Washington, homestead. He was said to have walked five miles daily to and from school and later attended Washington State College and the University of Montana.
Personal.
In World War I, Boddy was a second lieutenant in the infantry. He was gassed in the Argonne and sent home disabled. He spent months in a hospital. He was said to have resembled the actor Adolphe Menjou, and Time magazine said much later that he was "High-voiced, quick-moving, affable, . . . an efficient horseman, pistol shot and fisherman."
Career.
Sales.
Boddy's career was called by Art Berman of the "Los Angeles Times" a "classic example of the self-made man, with his early years marked by poverty." Boddy's university years were interspersed with periods of working as a "door-to-door flatiron salesman, ditch digger, janitor and miner." He was also a milker, ditch-digger, janitor, recruiter for the University of Montana, and New York City subway guard, then an Encyclopædia Britannica salesman in that city, where he persuaded poor families to band together to buy the volumes. In Massachusetts, he evaded a ban on book salesmen at Harvard University by hiring students as his agents. He was then promoted to sales manager for the encyclopedia.
After the war he resumed his old sales vocation by selling back issues of the magazine "Current History" as bound volumes titled "The European War." He moved west for his health, founded a book publishing company in Los Angeles and sold copies of the "Mexican Year Book" and other titles for "Los Angeles Times" publisher Harry Chandler. For fifty dollars he purchased an unsuccessful publication called "Smiles" and persuaded the Commercial Board of Los Angeles to take the magazine as its house organ thereby establishing himself as a publisher.
Newspaper.
In 1926, Boddy was hired as editor of the "Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News," a failing newspaper originally been founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. The following year, with the newspaper bankrupt, he persuaded a stockholder committee and then, a federal judge to allow him to take over the newspaper. Within years, it became immensely profitable with Boddy as editor and publisher.
Boddy assumed ownership of the newspaper on August 5, 1926. Its plant, at Pico Boulevard and Los Angeles Street, was deeply in debt. He rejected Vanderbilt’s editorial philosophy of emphasizing good news by turning the "Daily News" into a crusading newspaper that addressed police corruption, gambling and prostitution. He quickly earned the enmity of Los Angeles Police Chief James E. Davis, who attempted to silence the "News" by arresting Boddy. Davis used an obscure municipal law that made it illegal to publish horse-racing entries and results in a general circulation newspaper. The charges never got beyond the arraignment stage, and Boddy continued reporting vice and corruption in his paper.
Boddy was a Republican and supported Herbert Hoover in the 1932 Presidential election. He believed the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt was a “terrible mistake.” Still, he recognized that Roosevelt’s New Deal policies had merit and could lift the country out of the Depression. The "Daily News" was the only Los Angeles newspaper to openly endorse Roosevelt and give him balanced coverage. It also devoted considerable coverage to Technocracy, a type of scientific management of society and the economy. Boddy gave news space to Robert Noble’s “Ham ‘N Eggs” plan and Dr. Francis Townsend’s “Townsend Plan,” which proposed that state and federal governments would issue funds to people over age 60. The "Daily News" also extensively covered Upton Sinclair’s run for California governor and his controversial End Poverty in California (EPIC) campaign. Competing newspapers either ignored the campaign or wrote vehement editorials against Sinclair’s programs.
Just before World War II in October 1941, a disastrous explosion and fire in Fall River, Massachusetts destroyed a large plant of the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company and with it a large part of government's supply of raw rubber, necessitating scrap drives to collect rubber. Boddy was on the air every night for more than four months, appealing to the public to collect and turn in their old automobile tires and other scrap. In a memo to President Roosevelt, Boddy outlined a plan to get rubber out of Japanese-held Malaya. Three weeks after he had written the memo, Boddy received a letter from the President thanking him for the idea and telling him that the operation was under way. Whether or not the operation actually took place, the story became the basis of the 1950 Hollywood film "Malaya", in which the character "John Manchester," portrayed by Lionel Barrymore, was based on Boddy.
Boddy’s editorial policies in these early years established the "Daily News" as the city’s only liberal journalistic voice.
After the end of World War II, Boddy’s interest in the newspaper began to wane. His efforts to stimulate interest in various plans to boost the country’s economy and his crusades for noble causes had ended with the war. Los Angeles had become a mecca for job-seekers and a refuge for new arrivals from the frozen East Coast. Postwar Los Angeles was emerging as an increasingly cosmopolitan city, and many of Boddy’s editorial policies seemed quaint to the city’s new residents.
Boddy spent less and time at the newspaper as he focused his energies on his estate, Descanso Gardens, in La Canada. He eventually turned the day-to-day operations over to his general manager, Robert L. Smith. Without Boddy, the newspaper lost its spunk and no longer tilted at windmills, reported newspaper researcher and writer Les Wagner. By the fall of 1953, the "Daily News" was losing $75,000 a month, and it folded in December 1954. The assets were purchased by the Times Mirror Company. The "Los Angeles Mirror", a Times-owned afternoon tabloid newspaper, took the "Daily News" name to become the "Mirror-News".
Interests.
Horticultural.
In 1936, Boddy purchased a parcel in La Canada, north of Los Angeles. Boddy had a wide range of interests, including horticulture, ranching, plant science, and politics. In 1942, he bought Mission Nursery of San Gabriel—and its stock—from the Yoshimura family, who were interned. Boddy named his estate in La Canada as Rancho de Descanso, which translates as “Ranch of Restfulness (or Repose).” The estate was deeded to Los Angeles County and is now open to the public as Descanso Gardens.
Political.
"For more, see United States Senate election in California, 1950."
In 1950, U.S. Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas challenged Democratic Senator Sheridan Downey for the Democratic senatorial nomination from California. When Downey bowed out of the campaign, citing ill health, Boddy entered the race. California's Democratic State Central Committee had tried to draft Boddy to run for office in previous elections in 1942 and 1946. Boddy refused, claiming he had no interest in public office. For the 1950 Senate race, Boddy offered no specific reasons why he was running for office other than to say it was a "challenge" and he would meet interesting people.
Boddy's campaign got off to a late start and, according to Wagner, was disorganized. He received an important endorsement from Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, a Republican, and also got strong support from labor unions. His primary campaign plank was public ownership of hydroelectric plants across the state. He also supported a controversial proposal to limit land ownership in the Central Valley to . His primary weakness was the lack of solid programs to boost California's economy.
"Los Angeles Times" political reporter Kyle Palmer wrote that "words flow" easily from Boddy, but his late start and lack of political credentials were handicaps to a successful campaign.
In May 1950, just weeks before the primary election, Boddy labeled Douglas the "Pink Lady" by implying that she was aligned with Communists and was part of a group of "red hots" trying to seize control of Democratic county committees in the state. Boddy and Douglas ran a bitter primary campaign, leaving Douglas, the Democratic victor, badly wounded in her race against the winner of the Republican primary, Congressman Richard Nixon. Boddy came up with the idea of comparing Douglas' voting record to that of leftist Congressman Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party—a tactic that was seized on by Nixon and his campaign manager, Murray Chotiner in the final election.
On June 6, 1950, Douglas beat Boddy at the polls largely on the strength of her popularity with African-American voters. She garnered 889,000 votes to Boddy's 532,000. Nixon, who had crossed-filed in both parties in the primary, won 1,060,000 votes. Douglas lost to Nixon in the November general election 
Death.
Boddy died in Pasadena, California, of congestive heart failure at the age of 75 on May 12, 1967. He was survived by his wife, the former Berenice M. Klotz, and two sons, Calvin and Robert.

Commission on Foreign Economic Policy

The U.S. President's Commission on Foreign Economic Policy (the Randall Commission) was established on August 7, 1953 by Public Law 215 entitled "Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1953" which extended the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 for one year. On April 7, 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower requested that Congress extend for one year the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, a measure which had originally been passed in 1934. Under this act and its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction. In his message of April 7, the President called for a commission to study U.S. foreign economic policy in general. Section 301 of this Act provided for a bipartisan commission which consisted of seventeen members: seven appointed by the President, five appointed from the Senate by the Vice President, and five from the United States House of Representatives by the Speaker. President Eisenhower appointed Clarence B. Randall, Chairman of the Board of Inland Steel Company, as Chairman of the Commission. The Commission was directed to examine and report on the subjects of international trade, foreign economic policy, and the trade aspects of national security and total foreign policy. It was to recommend appropriate policies, measures, and practices, based on its findings, in a report to Congress.
The Commission held an organizational meeting with President Eisenhower on September 22, 1953 and hearings began October 2, continuing through November 19, including sessions in Paris, France, November 9–12. Most of the hearings were closed except for public hearings on October 28–29 when representatives of national associations, trade unions, etc., presented their views on foreign trade. In order to limit the number of witnesses before the Commission, Randall sent out 15,000 letters asking for written statements from individual industries, labor unions, etc. He received of 300 statements in response to these letters.
The Commission staff, composed of specialists on various aspects of foreign economic policy, digested the written testimony and information provided by the Department of State, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies, in preparing 800 pages of staff papers upon which the Commission Report was based. This report was divided into twelve sections, such as Dollar Problem, Foreign Aid, Tariff and Trade, East-West Trade, etc. and was presented to Congress on January 23, 1954.
This Commission was dissolved on April 23, 1954, three months after it presented its report to Congress.

Tarakjuk

Tarakjuk is a variety of "juk" (죽), or Korean porridge, made by boiling a mixture of milk and finely ground rice soaked in water. It is also called "uyujuk" (우유죽), both terms meaning "milk porridge".
History.
The old Sino-Korean vocabulary, "tarak" derives from the Mongol word, "taraq (torak)". The history of "tarakjuk" dates back to the consumption of milk in Korean history. According to old records, the royal court of Korea began to consume milk since the fourth century, but milk cows were rare so milk was only available when a cow gave birth. Moreover, the freshness of milk was a vital factor, it could not be delivered from far places. Milk was considered a supplement food for special occasions, or recovery food after illness.
During the Joseon Dynasty, Mount Naksan located in the east of Seoul had a ranch for the royal court. Physicians of the royal health clinic "Naeuiwon" took charge of gathering milk and making "tarakjuk" to present to the king.
The recipe for "tarakjuk" is recorded in the Joseon Dynasty records of "Jeungbo sallim gyeongje", "Gyuhap chongseo", and "Buin pilji".
The recipe in "Gyuhap chongseo" indicates the ratio between milk and "muri" (무리, the deposits after soaked rice is grounded with a millstone and filtered with a sieve) as 1:0.8, with adjustments allowed according to taste. However, it advises the amount of milk not to exceed that of "muri".
Preparation.
Pre-soaked glutinous rice is ground and sieved, then simmered with water. When the mixture has come to a boil, milk is slowly added and simmered once again on a low flame with constant stirring as to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pot. Seasoned with salt or honey if a sweet taste is desired.
