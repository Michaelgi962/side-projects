The Trio Grande

The Trio Grande was a line of professional ice hockey forwards who played together for the New York Islanders from the late 1970s through the early 1980s. The line consisted of Hall of Famers Bryan Trottier at center, Clark Gillies at left wing and Mike Bossy at right wing.
Background.
All three members of the Trio Grande were highly regarded as amateur players. The Islanders drafted Gillies 4th overall and Trottier 22nd overall in the 1974 NHL Entry Draft, and drafted Bossy 15th overall in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft. Gillies made the Islanders roster that season, while Trottier spent another year in the WCHL before joining the Islanders in 1975–76, winning the Calder Trophy as Rookie of the Year and participating in the NHL All-Star Game.
Formation.
The Trio Grande emerged in 1977. Bossy made the Islanders Coach Al Arbour break up his former top line of Trottier, Gillies and Billy Harris in training camp, inserting Bossy, as a rookie. The results were immediate, as Trottier emerged as a points leader, Bossy emerged as a league's leading goal scorer, while Gillies, the team captain and a larger presence than Trottier and Bossy, served as an aggressor, as well as a scorer. Bossy won the Calder Trophy that season. Gillies, at the time 23, was the oldest of the three.
Playoff success.
The Islanders had made the playoffs the three seasons prior to the formation of the Trio Grande, but had not gotten past the Semifinals. In 1977–78, the Islanders won their first Patrick Division championship, but lost in the Quarterfinals. In 1978–79, the Islanders repeated as Patrick Division champions and won the President's Trophy (which they would also win in 1980–81 and 1981–82) but lost in the Semifinals.
Following the disappointments of the prior two seasons, Gillies willingly relinquished the team captaincy to Denis Potvin prior to the 1979–80 season.
The Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups in 1979–80, with Trottier winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs in 1980 and Bossy winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1982, scoring 7 goals in the 4 game series against the Vancouver Canucks. The Islanders also made the Stanley Cup finals in 1984, losing to the Edmonton Oilers. Bossy had scored 8 goals after the first three rounds of the playoffs (and 17 goals in the past three consecutive post-seasons), but was silenced completely in the finals series.
Post-dynasty.
The Islanders returned to the playoffs in 1984–85 and 1985–86, losing in the Division Finals and Division Semifinals, respectively. Following the 1985–86 season, during which his scoring output decreased significantly, Gillies was waived by the Islanders and acquired by the Buffalo Sabres. Bossy experienced a severe back injury, which forced him to retire following the 1986–87 season. Trottier would remain with the Islanders until being released after the 1989–90 NHL season, before signing with the Pittsburgh Penguins, where he would win two more Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992.
Personal achievements.
In 1978–79, Trottier scored 134 points to earn the Art Ross Trophy, as well as the Hart Trophy as league MVP. In 1980–81, Bossy scored 50 goals in the first 50 games of the season, the first achieve this milestone since Maurice Richard. Bossy also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in 1982–83 NHL season, 1983–84 and 1985–86.
The three members of the Trio Grande made the NHL All-Star Team in 1977–78 and 1978–79, with Trottier and Gillies making the First Team and Bossy making the Second Team, beaten out by Guy LaFleur both years. Bossy would make the First Team in 1980–81, 1982–83, 1983–84, and 1985–86. Bossy also made the Second Team in 1984–85, and Trottier was named to the Second Team in 1981–82 and 1983–84.
All three members of the Trio Grande were named to the 1978 NHL All Star Game. Bossy and Trottier were both named to the 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 All Star Games. In addition, Bossy was named to the All Star Game in 1981.
Bossy still holds the team records for most goals in a season (69 goals in 1978–79) and most points in a season (147 points in 1981–82). Trottier holds the team record for most assists in a season (87 assists in 1978–79) as well as most games played as an Islander (1,129).
All three have had their numbers retired by the Islanders, and all three have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bossy was inducted in 1991, Trottier in 1997, and Gillies in 2002.

Ryongtongsa

Ryŏngt'ong-sa is a Korean Buddhist temple located on Mt. Ogwan in Kaesŏng, North Korea.
History.
Founded by the Chontae Buddhist sect in 1027, the temple is believed to be one of the first of the sect's temples in Korea. Destroyed by a fire in the 16th century, and further damaged by American bombing during the Korean War, little remained of the original temple when reconstruction began in 2000 as a joint Korean cultural project. After five years of work, the restoration was completed on 31 October 2005. The temple contains the ashes of Taegak Guksa, the sect's founder. A son of Emperor Munjong of Koryo, he spent most of his life in Kaesŏng before retiring to the temple as an ascetic, where he lived until his death. The temple was thus closely connected with the royal family of Koryo, and was where they would attend services.
Architecture.
The main temple is divided into two sections: a west court and an east court. The main entrance to the temple is through the South Gate, in front of which are located the temple's original stone banner pillars. Through the gate is an unwalled plaza containing a monument to Taegak Guksa, founder of the Chontae sect. Erected in 1125, the much-worn stele rests on the back of a lion-turtle, and commemorates episodes from the life of the great monk. It is listed as National Treasure #155. From here, both the Middle and East Gates are accessible. The Middle Gate, directly across from the South Gate, leads to the temple's large West Court, which is dominated by Pogwang Hall (, "Hall of Universal Light"), the temple's main shrine. To the right, the East Gate leads to the smaller courtyard fronting Pojo Hall (, "Hall of Universal Clarity"), devoted to veneration of the Bodhisattvas.
In front of Pogwang Hall there are three pagodas, two three-storied, and one five-storied. The smaller three-storied pagoda measures 4.1 meters, The five storied pagoda is 5.5 meters. The pagodas are plainly carved in sandstone, with upturned eaves surmounting square segments decorated only with raised vertical lines on the corners. All three date to the Koryo dynasty. The pagodas are registered as National Treasure #133.
Directly behind Pogwang Hall is Chunggak Hall (), a meditation room and lecture hall decorated with paintings of important Buddhist monks. Behind this there are two gates to the back courtyard of the temple, where Sungbok Hall () is located. This building once held the living quarters for the temple's monks.
Behind the main temple and up the mountain is Kyŏngsŏn Hall (), containing a shrine to Taegak Guksa; The stone stupa in front of the hall contains his ashes.
The roofs of the main buildings are decorated with ceramic ornaments in the shapes of fish (known as Wenshou in Chinese). These are believed to keep the buildings safe from evil and fire.
Altogether, the reconstructed temple consists of over 26 buildings in an area of over 4,000 square meters.

Alzheimer Society of Canada

The Alzheimer Society of Canada identifies, develops and facilitates national priorities in order to enable its members to effectively alleviate the personal and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and promotes research to search for a cure. It was founded in 1978 and is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
The Society.
The Alzheimer Society is the largest nationwide health organization for people affected by dementia in Canada. The Society is a large funder of Alzheimer research and training, provides care and support to people with the disease, their families and their caregivers, and is active in advocacy with all levels of government. Active in more than 140 communities across Canada, the Society is also a key player in Alzheimer's Disease International, a leading organization in world wide efforts to fight dementia.
Currently, there are 500,000 Canadians living with dementia and within a generation, dementia may affect more than one million people across the country.
History.
In 1978, the Alzheimer Society had its beginnings as a Steering Group of researchers concerned about the lack of support for people with Alzheimer's disease. Their focus on family support, education and research laid the foundation for an Alzheimer movement that has grown into a nationwide Society that helps hundreds of thousands of Canadians touched by dementia every year.
During its first decade, the society worked diligently to convince the public that dementia was an actual disease, and not just a normal part of aging. The society organized programs and services to dispel myths, and help caregivers and families learn more about the disease. Working toward even greater awareness, increased understanding and support for the disease, the society joined with the American Alzheimer's Association, as well as organizations in seven other countries, to be a founding member of Alzheimer's Disease International.
In the second decade, the Alzheimer Society Research Program was launched, offering young and upcoming researchers as well as established ones an opportunity to receive grants to further their work in hopes of finding a cure. Over 20 years, the program has awarded approximately $30 million to Alzheimer research. Canada has some of the leading researchers in the world working in biomedical research into the causes and a cure for the disease. Canadian researchers are also working to improve quality of life, including caregiving, family support and long-term care.
Further advancements were made during its third decade as the public showed more and more understanding of the disease. Treatments became available to help alleviate symptoms, allowing people with the disease to become active members of their local societies. This trend has continued as more and more people with the disease became spokespeople and volunteers. The Society has appointed a person with dementia to its board of directors since 2003.
Programs and services.
The Alzheimer Society of Canada is dedicated to helping people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias through supportive programming and educational resources. Services are available in every province across Canada and in over 140 local communities. These programs and services are highly important to people living with dementia, their families and caregivers.
The Society has been dedicated to providing help in many different ways, one of which is support and information to people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, families, physicians and other health-care providers.
Through its offices across Canada, the Alzheimer Society provides many programs and services to help people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias:
The Society refers people to support groups that provide a safe place to share information, thoughts, feelings and experiences. It also helps people find programs and services they need, such as day and respite programs, home support and help with the difficult transition to long-term care. It offers a wide range of information in print, videos and audiotapes on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias including warning signs, diagnosis and treatment, caregiving, risk factors, research and other related topics. The Society provides resources designed specifically for the person with the disease, as well as materials for family and health-care professionals. The Society holds informational meetings and workshops organized by different locations across Canada. The Society has programs like the Safely Home Registry to help save lives by making it easier for the police to find a person with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia who has become lost, and return them safely home. Over 30,000 Canadians are registered with the Society’s Safely Home program. The Society offers First Link, another critical program in some provinces that connects people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia to their local Alzheimer Society and other community resources as early in the disease process as possible.
Research.
The Alzheimer Society is a leading source of funds for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research in Canada. Together with its partners, the Society has contributed approximately $30 million to research in Canada since the inception of its research program 20 years ago. In 2008, the Society and its partners funded 27 new grants and training awards, amounting to over $2 million to speed up the search for the causes and cure of Alzheimer’s disease, and improve the lives of those affected.
Committed to supporting research into all aspects of Alzheimer’s disease, the Alzheimer Society provides grants and training awards that fund research at Canadian universities and hospitals and help nurture new talent. Canadian researchers supported by the Alzheimer Society have made major advances, including discoveries related to genetic causes of the disease. The Society places equal importance on biomedical research that provides insights into Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and on quality of life research that leads to improvements in care.
Canadian Alzheimer facts.
In January 2009, the Alzheimer Society of Canada released sobering new statistics on the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in Canada. Today, half a million Canadians have Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia with 71,000 of them under age 65. Women represent 72 per cent of all Alzheimer's disease cases. Fifty per cent more Canadians and their families could be facing Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia in just five years. If nothing changes, over one million Canadians will have Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia within 25 years.
Events.
Coffee Break
Coffee Break is the Alzheimer Society's major nationwide annual fundraiser where friends, co-workers and customers gather in communities across Canada to raise funds for local Alzheimer Societies. Participants at these events make a donation in exchange for a cup of coffee. The money raised stays in that province or community to help support local programs and services.
Alzheimer Awareness Month
Every January the Alzheimer Society launches a campaign to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and to reduce stigma.
Rising Tide
In January 2010, the Alzheimer Society will release a pivotal study on the current state of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in Canada. "Rising Tide: The Impact of Dementia on Canada" will, for the first time since 1991, provide new startling information on the growing economic impact of dementia in Canada.
ADI 2011
The Alzheimer Society of Canada hosted the 2011 Alzheimer's Disease International Conference in Toronto, March 26–29, 2011.

Cursinho (in Portuguese, "little course", also called "curso pré-vestibular") is a type of cram school, in general private, existing in many Brazilian cities, and attended by students who are trying to enter the university via the entrance exams ("vestibular"). Cursinhos always have extensive and semi-extensive courses, extensive courses taking place during most of the year, and semi-extensive ones taking place during the second semester, while the exact month to start can be variable. 
Most of the Cursinhos revise the subjects that the students need to know to take the vast majority of the vestibulares: Mathematics, Portuguese language (literature and grammar), History, Geography, Biology, Physics, Chemistry and English language. Some still offer extra classes for deeper studies on specific subjects, current news (which may be required in some of the vestibulares) and techniques on writing an essay, which is required in all vestibulares.
It is also common to separate the students by the area of knowledge they wish to study in the university (humanities, exact sciences and biological sciences), providing a deeper study in different subjects accordingly with the area (History and Geography; Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry; Biology and Chemistry respectively, with similar focus on Portuguese and English for all groups).

Raspberry Plain

Raspberry Plain is a historic property and former plantation in Loudoun County, Virginia, near Leesburg. Raspberry Plain was one of the principal Mason family estates of Northern Virginia. Raspberry Plain currently operates as an event site, hosting weddings and other special events year round. 
History.
Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron granted the title to the Raspberry Plain property to blacksmith Joseph Dixon in 1731. In 1754, the "houses, buildings, orchard, ways and watercourses" of Raspberry Plain were purchased by Loudoun County's first sheriff, Aeneas Campbell. Under Campbell's ownership, the property became the site of Loudoun County's first jailhouse. Raspberry Plain was then purchased by George Mason's younger brother Thomson Mason from Campbell, in 1760. In 1771, Thomson built the mansion at Raspberry Plain. Upon Thomson's death, the Raspberry Plain estate was deeded to his eldest son Stevens Thomson Mason, U.S. senator from Virginia. The mansion at Raspberry Plain was added to throughout the 19th-century and demolished around 1910. Senator Mason's son, Armistead Thomson Mason, of Selma, was shot and killed by his cousin, John Mason McCarty, in a duel fought at the Bladensburg dueling grounds in Bladensburg, Maryland, in February 1819. McCarty lived at nearby Strawberry Plain, the home and jail of Aeneas Campbell, which had been parceled off from the Raspberry Plain property. That mansion has long since disappeared. In 1910, Raspberry Plain was rebuilt for copper millionaire John Guthrie Hopkins. Raspberry Plain, along with several neighboring estates including nearby Mason family estates Temple Hall and Locust Hill, is a contributing property in the Catoctin Rural Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 31 January 1989. 
Present Day.
Today, Raspberry Plain is operated as a venue for weddings, receptions, corporate events and other special occasions. The Grand Conservatory, which can seat up to 200 guests comfortably, was added to the Mansion House in 1998. Raspberry Plain is open for visits on Saturdays from 11a-2p and by appointment.
Architecture.
Although destroyed in 1910, the 1771 mansion that is depicted in old photographs appears to be a Georgian-style brick dwelling with gambrel-roofed brick wings. It was replaced by the present large Colonial Revival brick mansion around 1910. The -story, Flemish bond brick dwelling possesses a two-story tetrastyle Roman Doric portico with a lunette in the triangular pediment. A row of four pedimented dormers extends across the slate gable roof with overhanging eaves and a wide frieze with dentils encircles the building. Windows are six-over-six double-sash types with louvered shutters and wood lintels. A large central Palladian window sheltered by the portico is the dominant feature of the house. Several tenant houses, farm buildings, gambrel-roofed barns, a bank barn, and stables are scattered around the farm.
Burial ground.

<doc id="21554170" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554170" title="Friedman doctrine">
Friedman doctrine

The Friedman Doctrine, also known as the stockholder theory, is an idea proposed by economic theorist Milton Friedman, which states that a company's only responsibility is to increase its profits.
Friedman argued that a company should have no "social responsibility" to the public or society because its only concern is to increase profits for itself and for its shareholders. He wrote about this concept in his book "Capitalism and Freedom". In it he states that when companies concern themselves with the community rather than focusing on profits, it leads to totalitarianism.
In the book, Friedman writes: "There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."
The idea of the stockholder theory, some argue, is inconsistent with the idea of corporate social responsibility at the cost of the stakeholder. For example, a company donating services or goods to help those hurt in a natural disaster, in some ways, may be considered not taking action in the best interest of the shareholder. Some may argue that goods provided to society in a time of need builds further allegiance to a corporation and in theory, meeting the stockholder theory's requirement to look in the best interest of the stockholder.
The Friedman Doctrine is controversial. In left-wing social activist Naomi Klein's book "The Shock Doctrine", she criticizes the theory, saying most citizens become impoverished while corporate elites gain enormous wealth.

<doc id="21554256" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554256" title="Anton–Babinski syndrome">
Anton–Babinski syndrome

Anton–Babinski syndrome, also known as visual anosognosia, is a rare symptom of brain damage occurring in the occipital lobe. Those who suffer from it are "cortically blind", but affirm, often quite adamantly and in the face of clear evidence of their blindness, that they are capable of seeing. Failing to accept being blind, the sufferer dismisses evidence of his condition and employs confabulation to fill in the missing sensory input. It is named after Gabriel Anton and Joseph Babinski.
Characteristics.
Anton–Babinski syndrome is mostly seen following a stroke, but may also be seen after head injury. It is well described by the neurologist Macdonald Critchley:
The sudden development of bilateral occipital dysfunction is likely to produce transient physical and psychical effects in which mental confusion may be prominent. It may be some days before the relatives, or the nursing staff, stumble onto the fact that the patient has actually become sightless. This is not only because the patient ordinarily does not volunteer the information that he has become blind, but he furthermore misleads his entourage by behaving and talking as though he were sighted. Attention is aroused however when the patient is found to collide with pieces of furniture, to fall over objects, and to experience difficulty in finding his way around. He may try to walk through a wall or through a closed door on his way from one room to another. Suspicion is still further alerted when he begins to describe people and objects around him which, as a matter of fact, are not there at all.
Thus we have the twin symptoms of anosognosia (or lack of awareness of defect) and confabulation, the latter affecting both speech and behaviour.
Anton–Babinski syndrome may be thought of ideally as the opposite of blindsight, blindsight occurring when part of the visual field is not consciously experienced, but some reliable perception does in fact occur.
Causes.
Why patients with Anton–Babinski syndrome deny their blindness is unknown, although there are many theories. One hypothesis is that damage to the visual cortex results in the inability to communicate with the speech-language areas of the brain. Visual imagery is received but cannot be interpreted; the speech centers of the brain confabulate a response.
Patients have also reported visual anosognosia after suffering from ischemic vascular cerebral disease. A 96 year old man, who was admitted to an Emergency Room complaining of a severe headache and sudden loss of vision, was discovered to have suffered from a posterior cerebral artery thrombosis and consequently lost his vision. He adamantly claimed he was able to see despite an opthalmologic exam proving otherwise. An MRI of his brain proved that his right occipital lobe was ischemic. Similarly, a 56 year old woman was admitted to the Emergency Room in a confused state and with severely handicapped psychomotor skills. Ocular movements and pupil reflexes were still intact, but the patient could not name objects and was not aware of light changes in the room, and seemed unaware of her visual deficit. An MRI revealed ischemic lesions in the left occipital lobe and a CT angiogram brain scan unveiled vasculitis of the brain arteries. 
Case Study.
Most cases of Anton–Babinski syndrome are reported from adults. The European Journal of Neurology published an article in 2007 that examines a case study of a six year old child with Anton–Babinski syndrome and early stages of adrenoleukodystrophy. The child reportedly had abnormal eye movements, would often fall, and would reach for things and often miss his target. When his sight was tested at <20/200 he was still unable to read the large letters on the chart. He denied suffering from headaches, diplopia, or eye pain and seemed unconcerned and unaware of his poor eyesight. Upon examination, his pupils were equal in shape, round, and reactive to light. His mother commented that he developed unusual eye movements and that they had a ″roving quality.″ 
In popular culture.
Anton–Babinski syndrome was featured in two-part episode of the television series "House M.D.", titled "Euphoria", although it was ascribed to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a disease that usually does not cause the syndrome in real life.
The syndrome features prominently in the Rupert Thomson novel "The Insult". It is also mentioned in the science fiction novel "Blindsight", by Peter Watts.
It is mentioned frequently as "Anton's Blindness" as one of the primary metaphors in Raj Patel's "The Value of Nothing".
In Lars von Trier's film "Dogville", the character Jack McKay acts as if he can see but gives many signs he can't.

Presing

Presing is a Serbian alternative rock band from Belgrade. Formed in 1990 and named after pressure defense in basketball (and some other team sports), Presing were, together with Darkwood Dub and Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša, representatives of the so-called "NeoBeo" sound, alternative, guitar-based rock music produced in Belgrade in early 1990s. New York Press wrote about Presing: "It's a sound that kicks the pants off the recycle-rock of The Strokes, The Vines and the White Stripes, just to name a few... You can hear bits of the melodic era of The Fall ("This Nation's Saving Grace" through "Frenz Experiment"), some Nick Cave, some Neil Young–and even some P-Funk via Kraftwerk". 
The original lineup consisted of Zoran Radović "Kiza" on vocals, Vladimir Marković "Kraka" on guitar, Roman Goršek on bass guitar and Slobodan Asanović on drums. Radović and Marković remained in the band continuously, while other members kept changing. Highly artistic lyrics of Radović, performed in a rap manner, merged with harmonic and somewhat dissonant guitar tunes of Marković, thus creating a style of post-rock sound. Presing members are also involved in other art forms, such as fiction and poetry (both Radović and Marković released their books), painting and sculpture (Radović and Grubačić). They also have musical side projects such as Tron and Stereo Ikar by Radović and Tornado Ptice and Xanax by Marković.
History.
Formation and first breakup (1990-1993).
The band was formed in 1990, in the lineup consisting of former Pasmaters member Zoran Radović "Kiza" (vocals, bass guitar), Vladimir Marković "Kraka" (guitar) and drummer Slobodan Asanović "Boban". Before joining the band, Marković lived in London, working as a window-washer and bassist in a reggae band, but returned to Belgrade on Radović request of joining the band. Soon after, Radović quit playing bass, with former Euforija member Roman Goršek taking over the bass duties. The lineup had their first recordings, the songs "Mačo" ("Macho") and "Oboye" ("Both") released on the various artists compilation "Želim jahati do ekstaze", released by Slušaj Najglasnije and Nova Aleksandrija record labels, which, due to the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars, did not have a proper distribution.
The outbreak of the war forced the band members to leave the country and for a while bassist Nikola Rađenović, a former Gastrbajters and Avtomobili member, and drummer Blaža Drecun, a former Darkwood Dub member, were replacements. On Goršek's return, the band, with the new drummer Miladin Radivojević, a former Klajberi member, recorded their debut album "Priča o totemu, duhu koji hoda, psu i razočaranoj ženi" ("The Story of Totem, a Ghost that Walks, a Dog and a Disappointed Woman"), featuring elements of punk rock, funk and noise music. The album, available on compact cassette only, was released by Slušaj Najglasnije record label in Croatia, and a slightly altered version of the album was released in Serbia by Sorabia Disk. It reached the second Yugoslav album of the year by both the magazine "Ritam" and the Italian Udine Radio.
After the album release, the band performed at the Zaječar Gitarijada festival, after which Goršek and Radivojević left the band, forming Plejboj, being replaced by the former Kazna Za Uši bassist Rudolf Cibulski and former Sport i Reinkarnacija drummer Saša Bugarčić. The new lineup also started recording new material, but due to Radović's health problems only two tracks were recorded, the song "Mamutska brda" ("The Mammoth Hills") and the instrumental "Godzila" ("Godzilla"), the former being released in 1994 on the various artists compilation "Radio Utopia (B92: 1989-1994)". "Mamutska brda" also appeared on the "Geto" ("Ghetto") movie soundtrack, however it was never released officially. During the same year, the tracks "Mačo", "Šurikeni" ("Sure-cans"), "Sve zvezde" ("All the Stars"), and "Ona vreba" ("She is Lurk"), appeared on the split album "3", also featuring Overdose and Kazna Za Uši.
Reformation (1993-2007).
The band had a three-year break in its career, during which Marković formed the band Tornado Ptice, also featuring Vladislav Rac (of Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša) on bass guitar, Ognjenka Lakićević (later Autopark vocalist) on vocals, Predrag Ilić on drums, Nenad Pejović on the other guitar, Nebojša Mrđenović on cello and violinist Vladimir Nikolić, releasing the album "Prozračno poslepodne" ("An airy afternoon") on Automatic Records. With the former Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša bassist Vladislav Rac and drummer Miladin Radivojević, Radović and Marković reformed Presing in 1996. Two years later, the song "Mačo" appeared on the soundtrack for the Radivoje Andrić movie "3 palme za 2 bitange i ribicu" ("3 Palm-Trees for 2 Punks and a Chick").
In 2001, the lineup changed and drummer Radivojević was replaced by Dejan Utvar, a former Kanda, Kodža i Nebojša and Kazna Za Uši drummer. The following year, on June 12, the second studio album "600 nebo" (pun for "6th heaven") was released, recorded during May and June 1999 and produced by Željko Božić. The album was critically acclaimed and it reached No. 1 on the lists of best albums of the year 2002 in FR Yugoslavia by pop culture monthly "OK magazin", "Blic" daily and "Reporter" weekly, and the US weekly magazine "Boston Phoenix" ranked the album as "one of the best five albums to emerge from Europe in the past decade". The sound of the band on this album evolved towards more harmonic structures of soul, free jazz, country and even krautrock. The single "Ritam u kojem stojiš" ("Rhythm that You're Standing In") reached No. 1 in video charts of Radio Television of Serbia 3rd Channel, TV Studio B and No. 2 in the lists of best music videos of the year 2002 by TV B92 and Music Television of Serbia.
In 2003 the debut album, "Priča o totemu, duhu koji hoda, psu i razočaranoj ženi", was rereleased on CD by Sensart and Beograund independent record labels. The following year, a former Trenje bassist Marko Grubačić "Gega", and E-Play drummer Damjan Dašić became the new band members, immediately starting a year and a half long recording sessions at the Master Blaster and Vesa studios for the third studio album, "Zanos bez snova" ("Enchantment without Dreams"), combining a more subtle sound, featuring increased use of string sections of tango and modern classical music, with loud and dissonant guitar sound. Guest appearances on the album featured Ivana Smolović (vocals), Dušan Petrović (saxophone), Milica Milojević (flute), Boris Krstajić (synthesizer), Marko Petronijević (trumpet, jaw harp) and Vladimir Nikolić (violin, viola).
On March 30, 2007, the band held a farewell concert at the Belgrade Youth Center, featuring guest appearances by Aleksandar Jovan Krstić on flute and Jarboli member Daniel Kovač on acoustic guitar. After the band disbandment, Radović released a solo album "Arax" and founded an electronic music duo Tron with the former Supernaut member Svetolik Trifunović "Trile". Marković with Sana Garić formed the supergroup Xanax, also featuring musicians from various Belgrade alternative bands.
Reunion (2011-present).
In December 2011, the band reunited in the lineup which beside Marković and Radović featured a new bassist Dušan Zdravković, an upright bass graduate at the Norvegian Stanvager Music Academy, and the drummer Ernest Džananović, a Kristali member. The band had their first reunion performance on December 29.
In July 2013, the band released the compilation album "Skrivena planeta - Najbolje od Presinga" ("Hidden Planet - The Best of Presing"). The album, beside Presing's old songs, featured two new songs, "Zvona se uklapaju sa suncem" ("The Bells Are Matching with the Sun"), and "Robot čioda" ("Robot Pin"), the latter featuring Pavle Popov as guest, both of which will appear on the band's new studio album. In December of the same year, the band released the single "Mi nismo verni" ("We Are Not Faithful"), announcing their new studio album. The song featured Zoja Borovčanin of Lira Vega as a guest.

The East London line extension (ELLX) project is a British railway engineering project in London, managed by Transport for London. The project involves extending the East London Line (formerly part of the London Underground network) and making it part of the mainline London Overground network. This is being done by re-opening sections of disused railway line and by converting track electrified by the third-rail system, signalling, lineside signage and communication systems, etc. to mainline standards. New rolling stock was introduced and four new stations built along the route, with possibly a fifth to be added later.
The work, costing around £1 billion, began in 2005 and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was completed on 23 May 2010 with a service from via the historic Thames Tunnel under the River Thames and along part of the Brighton Main Line to West Croydon and . Trains also go to , where they make connection with the South Eastern Main Line. On 28 February 2011 the line was connected at its northern end to the North London Line at Highbury & Islington. In the second phase of the project, on 9 December 2012 a branch was connected to the South London Line enabling services to run to .
Project overview.
Phase 1.
Phase 1 of the ELLX project involved the extension of the original line at its northern and southern ends. The northern extension runs from to , connecting with the North London Line; this section became operational as far as in late May 2010, and to Highbury & Islington on 28 February 2011, with trains every 5 minutes on the central section between Dalston Junction and Surrey Quays.The southern extension of phase 1 from to and West Croydon was completed simultaneously with that to Dalston in 2010 and a full service began in May 2010. 
The northern extension makes use of disused trackbeds on the Kingsland Viaduct that formerly carried the North London Railway branch to Broad Street station, closed to the national rail system in 1986. It bypasses station, which closed permanently in June 2006. The new line diverges before the closed Shoreditch station, traverses the former site of the Bishopsgate Goods Yard and crosses Shoreditch High Street on a bridge, before running north along the Kingsland Viaduct. Four new stations have been built at , , and . From there, the double-track line continues under Kingsland High Street and Boleyn Road and then parallels the existing North London Line with services running through (for interchange with the North London Line eastbound) to (for interchange with the Victoria line, North London Line westbound and Northern City Line).
The stations between New Cross Gate and Crystal Palace/West Croydon were previously managed by Southern, which ran all train services to these stations; they were later transferred to TfL control.
The existing section of line was completely overhauled, with the replacement of all track and signalling upgraded to Network Rail standards.
Phase 2.
The ELLX Phase 2 project extended the line from Surrey Quays on to the Network Rail Inner South London Line. Trains on this route run to via , , , and . From Wandsworth Road, instead of running to Victoria, westbound trains branch off at Factory Junction, passing through Battersea towards Clapham Junction.
After a period of uncertainty, funding for this phase was finally announced in February 2009, with a prospective completion date of May 2012, in time for the start of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, held in London, in July 2012; however, TfL later put back the opening date to 9 December 2012. 
A new station was proposed at . In September 2010, funding for this was refused by the Department for Transport, but the developer Renewal later agreed to fund it as part of its Surrey Canal development scheme, due to start in 2013, and Lewisham Council granted planning permission. The new station could open in 2015, depending on the pace of new housing development in the vicinity.
At Clapham Junction, former Platform 2 is being divided into two separate, staggered platforms, Platform 1 (for the existing Overground services to/from Willesden Junction and Stratford) and Platform 2 (for the new services to/from Highbury & Islington). In addition, a disused staircase at Platform 2 is being brought back into use and a new lift installed to improve access from the newly refurbished Grant Road entrance.
Trains will run every 15 minutes between Clapham Junction and Highbury & Islington. There are no plans to operate trains through from the South London line to the West London line, so passengers from one to the other will have to change at Clapham Junction. Transport for London will take over the management of Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road stations when the new service starts.
Train services and rolling stock.
The core section of the line, between Dalston and Surrey Quays, is served by 16 trains per hour. New Cross Gate to Sydenham has 8 trains per hour. The remainder of the line is served by four trains per hour. A total of 30 stations are served by the new line.
As part of the upgrade, new mainline rolling stock replaced the former London Underground A60 and A62 Stock, which had been in service for 50 years. the line operated 23 Class 378/1 "Capitalstar" four-car electric multiple units (similar to the Class 376 already in use by Southeastern). Unlike the London Underground stock which they replaced, the trains have longitudinal seating similar to most classes of Tube trains, to cater for the expected higher level of usage.
Transfer to London Overground.
The stations from New Cross Gate to Crystal Palace and West Croydon were previously managed by Southern, but London Overground took over control of these stations in September 2009 in preparation for the new London Overground services.
Contractors.
Parsons Brinckerhoff were selected by TfL as the programme managers in May 2005, and in June 2005, TfL awarded Taylor Woodrow a £30 million contract to undertake enabling works on the Kingsland Viaduct and other sites. Mott MacDonald was also appointed the project's technical advisor. The main works on the line were undertaken by a consortium of the engineering and construction groups Balfour Beatty and Carillion. TfL announced in October 2006 that the two companies had been awarded a £363 million contract to carry out the work, beating a rival consortium made up of Laing O'Rourke, AMEC Spie and Vinci. Some 2,000 jobs were planned to have been created at the peak of the contract and the contractors were obliged to hire local staff. The contract awarded bonuses to the contractors if they complete work ahead of schedule, but penalised them up to £50,000 a day for late delivery.
Carillion has also been awarded a contract to maintain the extended line. The seven-year £80 million contract, announced in February 2009, requires Carillion to provide TfL with management, technical resources, plant, equipment and labour.
Bombardier supplied the line's rolling stock as part of a £259 million contract to provide trains for the London Overground network. In August 2006 Transport for London placed an initial £223 million order for 152 carriages, comprising 20 four-coach trains for the East London line and 24 three-coach trains for the North London line. The order was expanded in July 2007 at an additional cost of £36 million, to provide an extra three trains for the East London line. Manufacturing work began at Bombardier's Derby plant at the start of 2008 and the last train was scheduled to be delivered by May 2010. The company beat three other bidders - Siemens, Hitachi and the rolling stock operating company Porterbrook, which would have supplied pre-owned trains.
Funding.
On 12 October 2004 the Mayor of London confirmed that phase one of the East London Line Project would be delivered as part of the Capital Investment programme. On 16 November 2004 he announced that control of the project had passed from the Strategic Rail Authority to TfL, so that the project could be initiated and funded from TfL's five-year investment programme. The planned service was initially described as a "metro-style (National Rail) train service".
The bulk of the funding for phase 1 of the project was provided by the European Investment Bank, which granted TfL a loan of £450m (€660m). The bank's involvement was intended to promote the regeneration of the deprived areas of London through which the line runs. The second phase of the project is being co-funded by the Department for Transport, which is providing £64 million, and TfL providing a further £11 million. This funding does not cover the £10 million cost of building a new station at Surrey Canal Road and it remains unclear whether the station will be built, but provision is being made for it to be built at a later date. It has been suggested that Millwall Football Club might contribute to the cost of the new station, which would be close to The Den football ground.
History.
Proposals and problems.
Extensions of the East London line have been discussed for many years. During the 1980s London Transport considered converting the line into a light railway similar to the Docklands Light Railway, or restoring the disused connection to Liverpool Street.
By 1989 a proposal had emerged to extend it north to Dalston and south to Peckham Rye and Dulwich, sharing track and stations with the mainline network, in a similar fashion to parts of the Bakerloo line, District line and Metropolitan line. The plan was costed at £100-£120 million and the extended line was envisaged to open in 1994.
The extension project was proposed several times during the 1990s but was repeatedly rejected or postponed owing to lack of government support and insufficient financing. In November 1990 Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson rejected a proposed parliamentary Bill that would have authorised the project and two years later the extension plans were postponed indefinitely owing to cutbacks in Tube funding. Another proposal was made in 1993 to extend the line from Whitechapel to Dalston Junction, involving the construction of new stations at Bishopsgate, Hoxton and Haggerston, and received the support of a public inquiry in 1994. Construction was envisaged to begin in 1996 and to be completed by 1998. The project was finally approved by the Government in 1996 but a lack of financing again forced the project to be put on hold in 1997.
A solution to the funding issue was found in 1999 when London Transport announced that it was seeking private funds to realise the extension plans. Control of the project was given to the Strategic Rail Authority rather than to London Underground, in view of the impact that it would have on mainline services. It was also proposed that the East London line and other sub-surface Underground lines would be transferred to Railtrack, the privatised company responsible for maintaining the mainline network. This would have seen the line integrated with the London suburban commuter network. However, it was soon decided that this was impractical and the Railtrack proposal was abandoned.
Network Rail's South London Route Utilisation Strategy in 2008 considered changes to the Inner South London Line services unavoidable, particularly in respect of the even more restricted capacity during the reconstruction of London Bridge.
Alternative routes.
A number of different routeing proposals were put forward before the route of the northern, southern and western extensions was finalised.
The southerly route across south London's existing network of suburban railways underwent many changes before a final route was decided. Initial proposals around 1992 envisaged the western extension running from Peckham Rye to East Dulwich.
Construction.
The East London Line extension project was officially initiated by the Government on 9 October 2001, with construction of the northern extension due to begin in December 2001. However, it was held up when it came to light that the Grade II listed 19th-century Braithwaite arches in the former Bishopsgate Goods Yard were to be demolished as part of the project. Campaigners launched legal action against London Underground in an effort to prevent the demolition, but the project finally received legal clearance in the Court of Appeal on 7 July 2003.
Because of an inability to extend the platforms at the existing and stations and make them fully compliant with current rail safety regulations, it was thought that they would close, but on 18 August 2004 Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, announced that both stations would remain open.
Preparatory work by Taylor Woodrow began in June 2005 and continued through to the end of 2006, involving the replacement and refurbishment of 22 bridges along the Kingsland Viaduct. On 9 June 2006, Shoreditch underground station closed permanently to facilitate work on the extension, with services from Whitechapel being replaced by buses. The rest of the East London line closed on 22 December 2007, with rail replacement buses linking the stations north and south of the Thames (but not crossing the river due to height restrictions in the Rotherhithe Tunnel).
On 5 September 2006 it was announced that the line would form part of the London Overground, branded with a version of the Underground roundel with red replaced by orange, the colour used on Tube maps for the East London Line.
Three major new bridges were installed on the line between March and May 2008. On 29 March 2008, a new bridge weighing 350 tonnes was lifted into place over Shoreditch High Street. The bridge was manufactured to a tied arch or bowstring design in Chepstow by engineering firm Fairfield Mabey, and was lowered into place by the UK's biggest mobile crane, weighing 1,200 tonnes.
On 3 May 2008, a 1,300-tonne Warren truss bridge (GE19 bridge) spanning Great Eastern Main Line tracks out of Liverpool Street station was put into place. Although the bridge launch was successful, on 28 May the bridge dropped 200 mm onto its permanent supports as it was being jacked down. Debris fell onto the tracks, forcing the suspension of services in and out of Liverpool Street station until the following day and causing major disruption to commuters. The problem was traced to errors made by the sub-contractors.
The last of the three bridges, a 600-ton truss steel structure, was put in place at New Cross Gate between 10 and 12 May 2008. Test running on the completed line began on 5 October 2009.
Re-opening.
Before the full service launch, a limited "preview" service began on 27 April 2010 between Dalston Junction and New Cross/New Cross Gate, and the line came into full operation between Dalston Junction and West Croydon/Crystal Palace on 23 May.
The proximity of the line re-opening date to the forthcoming parliamentary general election also generated speculation about political motives, with opposition parties suggesting Mayor Boris Johnson was seeking to make political capital out of a project originally begun by his predecessor and political opponent Ken Livingstone.
Highbury & Islington.
On 28 February 2011 the line was extended northwards to .

Jardin des Plantes de Rouen

The Jardin des Plantes de Rouen (8 hectares) is a municipal botanical garden located at 7, rue de Trianon, Rouen, Seine-Maritime, Upper Normandy, France. It is open daily without charge.
The garden dates to 1691 when Louis de Carel acquired forest land within which he built a walled garden and pavilion. Scottish banker John Law purchased the garden in 1717, and in 1741, after several other owners, it was opened to the public. In 1806 Sophie Blanchard made a solo balloon ascension from the grounds, in 1811 Napoleon purchased the garden to establish the "Sénatorie de la Seine-Inférieure", and in 1817 Elisa Garnerin parachuted from a balloon launched on the site. In 1820 English horticulturist Crac Calvert set up greenhouses for dahlias. The municipality of Rouen purchased the site in 1832 for its botanical garden, to designs by Désiré Lejeune and construction by Guillaume Dubreuil, which in 1840 opened to the public as the "Jardin des Plantes". In 2004 the garden was recognized by the "Association des jardins botaniques de France et des pays francophones".
Today the garden contains over 5600 plant taxa, representing 600 species, with a notable collection of fuchsias (991 varieties). It contains a rock garden (1300 m²), garden of iris and hemerocallis (450 m²), rose garden (670 m²), squares of medicinal plants (60 plants), as well as an orchard and collections of aromatic and carnivorous plants.
Buildings include an orangery, the central greenhouse (1839-1842), seven additional greenhouses (1883-1884) including a palmarium, and tropical greenhouses (1936-1938). The garden also contains statues of local writer Eugène Noël (1816-1899), a runic stone from Denmark placed in 1911, and a bust of the god Pan.

Piano Trio No. 1 (Brahms)

The Piano Trio in B major, Op. 8, by Johannes Brahms was composed during 1854. The composer produced a revised version of the work in 1889. It is scored for piano, violin and cello, and it is the only work of Brahms to exist today in two published versions, although it is almost always the revised version that we hear performed today. It is also among the large multi-movement works to begin in a major key and end in the tonic minor; another being Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony. 
The trio is in four movements:
First movement.
This movement is a sonata form movement in B major, with a broad theme that begins in the cello and piano and builds in intensity. It is counterpoised by a more delicate anacrustic second theme in G sharp minor. This theme appeared only in the second version of the trio, replacing a more complex group of themes and a fugal section in the first version.
Second movement.
The B minor scherzo combines delicate filigree passages with fortissimo outbursts. The exuberant mood of the first movement returns in the trio section. A tierce de picardie sets the scene for the Adagio. The only alterations Brahms applied to this movement in his revision of the work were a doubling of the climactic trio melody in the cello, and a reworking of the coda.
Third movement.
This movement, returning to B major, opens with a spacious chordal theme in the piano, counterpoised by a middle section in which the cello plays a poignant G sharp minor melody making use of chromaticism. In the first version, a different second theme was used, and an Allegro section was included near the end of the movement.
Fourth movement.
Back in B minor, the first theme of this movement is highly chromatic and slightly ambiguous tonally, with a very agitated dotted rhythm. This is perhaps the movement Brahms altered the most between the two versions, with the cello's original smooth second theme in F sharp major—an apparent allusion to Beethoven's "An die ferne Geliebte", also quoted in Schumann's Fantasie Op. 17—being replaced by a more vigorous arpeggiated piano theme in D major. After a B major episode recalling the mood of the first movement, the music returns to minor and ends very turbulently. The original ending was even more overtly tragic, and it is worth recalling that 1854 was the year Brahms's friend and mentor Schumann attempted suicide and was confined to an asylum.

Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres

Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres was a Mexican land grant in present day Los Angeles County, California given by Governor Micheltorena in 1843 to Maximo Alanis. The area that was given to Alanis now occupies Westwood, UCLA, Holmby Hills, and Bel Air, Los Angeles. The ranch extended from what is now Sepulveda Boulevard to Beverly Hills.
History.
Maximo Alanis became the first property owner when he moved to the area in the 1820s. By 1843 the Mexican governor, Manuel Micheltorena (1842 - 1845) gave Jose Maximo Alanis (in all likelihood this is Alanis' son) a one square league grant of land. Jose Maximo Alanis utilized the land as a ranch until he sold it to Benjamin "Don Benito" Wilson in 1858.
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Benjamin D. Wilson and W. T. B. Sanford in 1866. 
Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres was sold to John Wolfskill in 1884. Wolfskill secured a judgment against the Los Angeles and Santa Monica Land and Water Company and the Los Angeles and Pacific Railroad. The railroad had a "right of way" through Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres that was thirty feet wide and had set up eight hundred lots for the town of Sunset. In February, 1891, Wolfskill was awarded $293,000 due to him for the railroads confiscation of the ranch. The ranch was returned to Wolfskill, but it wasn't worked or utilized for agriculture.

Jerry Hill (politician)

Gerald A. "Jerry" Hill (born April 18, 1947) is a Democratic member of the California State Senate representing the 13th district. Over a period of 20 years in public service he has been on the San Mateo City Council, where he served one term as Mayor, and the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors.
Personal life.
Born in San Francisco and raised in the Bay Area, Jerry Hill attended local public schools and graduated from Balboa High School in San Francisco. Hill attended University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree after spending a year at the College of San Mateo. He later attended San Francisco State University, where he received a lifetime secondary teaching credential. Shortly thereafter, Hill went to work with his father in the family's swimming pool business that he still owns and runs.
In the 1980s Hill became president of his local homeowners association. This led him to join the battle to prevent mid-rise buildings from being constructed in downtown San Mateo and in 1991 led to a successful campaign for a seat on the San Mateo City Council.
San Mateo City Council (1991-1998).
During Hill’s tenure on the San Mateo City Council he authored a City of San Mateo ordinance that regulates the sale of tobacco and restricts smoking in public places. While a member of the city council and as Mayor of San Mateo, Hill also served as a board member for San Mateo Transit District (SamTrans) and the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Authority (Caltrain). Hill served a term as mayor in 1994
San Mateo County Board of Supervisors (1998-2008).
Elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors in 1998, Hill worked with stakeholders to establish a new homeless shelter for the county that was widely hailed for being farther from local neighborhoods yet more accessible for the people who depend on the services. As a result of the new location the shelter expanded to year round service and increased in size to meet the homeless population's needs with minimal increase in cost to the public. Hill also led the charge to expand the Children’s Health Initiative so 17,000 children would get the health care they need by leading health care leaders to explore the funding mechanism of the county’s nonprofits without any additional cost to the average taxpayer. While serving on the California Air Resources Board, Hill worked to promote and protect public health, welfare and ecological resources while preserving the economic stability of the state and as chair of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Hill has tightened anti-pollution rules
California State Assembly (2008-2012).
Despite a strong showing by Millbrae Mayor Gina Papan, daughter of former Assembly Member Lou Papan, and Richard Holober, President of the San Mateo County Community College Board and consumer advocate, Hill won the Democratic primary for California's 19th State Assembly district in June 2008. The primary is often tantamount to election for the highly Democratic district.
In the November 2008 general election, Hill earned 73 percent of the vote against Republican Catherine Brinkman's 23 percent. Hill succeeded South San Francisco Democratic assembly member Gene Mullin, who had been termed-out of office. Hill was re-elected in 2010 with a similar percentage of the vote.
California State Senate (2012- ).
Jerry Hill announced his campaign for the California State Senate after the California Citizen's Redistricting Commission released the new map of the 13th District.
In the June 2012 primary election, Hill finished first among four competitors, with 51% of the vote.
Awards.
Hill has been recognized by the California Healthcare Institute which named him its Legislator of the Year. Hill has also received recognition from TechNet, TechAmerica, California State Sheriffs Association and California Small Business Association. He has received 100% voting records from LGBT community, California Labor Federation, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, Consumer Federation of California, Congress of California Seniors, Equality California, and Planned Parenthood.
The California Clean Money Action Fund named Jerry Hill "Clean Money Champion" for "his leadership in pushing for real reform".

United States Stamp Society

The United States Stamp Society (USSS) is the largest philatelic organization dedicated to the research and study of United States postage and revenue stamps. The Society is a non-profit collector-based organization with a world-wide membership of over 1700. The USSS is Affiliate #150 the American Philatelic Society (APS). Since 1930 the Society has encouraged philatelic study through voluntary membership in specialized committees. Some committees specialize in specific stamp issues like the Washington-Franklin heads, the Prexie or the Liberty Series, while other committees study specialized areas of U.S. philately such as Plate Numbers and Marginal Markings, Private Vending and Affixing Perforations, Booklets and Panes, and Luminescence. Research is made available through published books, research papers and articles in the monthly journal, "The United States Specialist".
History.
The Society was founded as the Philatelic Plate Number Association in 1926. The name was changed in 1930 to the Bureau Issues Association, recognizing the Association’s enlarged scope of interest as the entire philatelic output of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. At that time the Bureau of Engraving and Printing produced all United States postage and revenue stamps. Instead of plate numbers only, the Bureau’s output of postage and revenue stamps, coils, booklets, possessions, paper, gum, marginal markings, as well as methods of manufacture became subjects of study and collection.
In 2000, the organization became the United States Stamp Society. The new name reflects the society’s continuing focus on U.S. postage and revenue stamps while recognizing the role of non-Bureau contract security printers in stamp design and production.
Members of USSS receive the authoritative monthly journal, "The United States Specialist", which is devoted to all aspects of U.S. philately. Over the years "The Specialist" has been especially strong in reporting on stamp printing technology, plate varieties, plate layouts, marginal markings and plate numbering. Many important discoveries in U.S. collecting have been published in its pages which have resulted in new and variety listings in the "Scott Specialized Catalogue of U.S. Stamps and Covers".

<doc id="21554680" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554680" title="Film director">
Film director

A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. In some European countries, the director is viewed as the author of the film.
The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the films budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films. 
Responsibilities.
Film directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized. Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production, as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines. This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve his or her vision of the film. This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set. Moreover it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew, thus, excellent communication skills are a must. 
Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary. Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure". It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again. Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget. Additionally, the director may also have to ensure an intended age rating. Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film, however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star. Even so, it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else, considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one. It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".
Under European Union law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the French word for "author"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.
Career pathways.
Some film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school to "get formal training and education in their craft". Film students generally study the basic skills utilized in making a film. This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrolment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works. Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television. The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE. <br>
A handful of top directors made from $13 M to $257 M in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. The average movie director makes a lot less. In May 2011, the average US film director made $92,220.
Characteristics.
Different directors can vary immensely amongst themselves, under various characteristics. Several examples are:
Professional organizations.
In the United States, directors usually belong to the Directors Guild of America. The Canadian equivalent is the Directors Guild of Canada. In the UK, directors usually belong to Directors UK or the Directors Guild of Great Britain.
In Europe, FERA, the Federation of European Film Directors, represents 37 national directors' guilds in 30 countries.
Notable individuals.
For each director, one notable film that they directed is given as an example of their work. The chosen film may be their film which won the highest awards or it may be one of their best-known movies.

Barrier cream

A barrier cream is a topical formulation used in industrial, medical, and sporting environments to place a physical barrier between the skin and contaminants which may irritate (contact dermatitis or occupational dermatitis), or infect the skin.
Medical application.
Barrier preparations which can be a cream, ointment or aerosol spray often contain substances which repel water such as silicone, zinc oxide, or dimethicone, sometimes as combinations such as "Silon" (dimethicone and zinc oxide). Typical applications are in occluded skin-to-skin contacts such as body folds or flexural areas. A common use for barrier creams and ointments is diaper rash. Examples of these products are Desitin and Penaten.
Industrial applications.
Barrier creams have been used in industry to protect workers' skin from the contaminants encountered in manufacturing trades. In this application a barrier cream may also be water repellent but may also need to repel certain solvents present in mineral oils, gasoline, paints, lubricants and ink. China clay or kaolinite can be added to physically block the skin's pores. Industrial barrier creams have different formulations according to the type or work undertaken. One of the first producers of such barrier creams were Rozalex and they still manufacture application specific barrier creams for the Industrial market.
Sporting application.
Wrestlers and others who regularly grapple are exposed to a wide variety of skin problems arising from small cuts and scrapes and germs and bacteria transmitted by close contact. Wrestling teams commonly apply barrier creams before each practice in an attempt to reduce prevalence of skin infection. Studies have shown that use of a barrier cream, in addition to following a strict skin disease protocol reduces the occurrence of ringworm among athletes. Commonly used barrier creams include Kennedy Industries 'KS Skin Creme' and Defense Soap's 'Defense Barrier Foam'.

Ola Bauer

Ola Bauer (24 July 1943 – 12 June 1999) was a Norwegian novelist and playwright. He made his literary debut with the novel "Graffiti" in 1976, under the pseudonym Jo Vendt. Among his best known books are "Humlehjertene" (1980), "Rosapenna" (1983), and "Metoden" (1985). Bauer was awarded Gyldendal's Endowment in 1982, and the Dobloug Prize in 1998. He died of cancer in 1999.
Early life.
Bauer was born 24 July 1943 in Holmenkollåsen, Oslo, during the German occupation of Norway. His father was a baker, and an active member of the Norwegian resistance movement. In 1943, he was arrested, while the rest of the family went undercover in Hadeland. Bauer's father was eventually deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he died three months before the end of the war. Bauer's family continuously moved from place to place, and Bauer had a hard time adjusting to the changes, and finding friends. He found himself consistently making friends with children of traitors, those who had supported the Germans during the war. "We were all innocent children, who had to pay for our fathers' choices. We could understand each other", Bauer later said. He used to make up stories about his father's death, a new version for every new place his family moved. He graduated from Oslo Språkskole in 1965, on his second attempt, "with a D in Norwegian, as usual".
Bauer started his literary career translating short stories from Danish to Norwegian for "Allers". He quickly advanced to becoming sports reporter for "Det Nye", and later a traveling journalist for "Vi Menn". He stayed in Paris for more than a year in the late 1960s, and later traveled around Africa. From 1972 on he made frequent visits to Belfast, and made many friends there.
Literary career.
Bauer had grown up with the notion that his father was a war hero, having died as a prisoner of war. As an adult, he learned that his father had in fact died of methanol poisoning, having gotten hold of what he thought was alcohol. In his autobiographical debut novel, "Graffiti" (1976), Bauer confronted his mother with the fact that she had kept this secret from him. "I grew up in a lie about a man I have never known", he commented. Because of the novel's contents, one of his relatives insisted that he publish it under a pseudonym, to protect his mother. Despite "having nothing to hide self", he therefore released the novel under the pen name Jo Vendt. "Graffiti" was very well received by critics. Roar Petersen of "Verdens Gang" noted the poetic quality of many of the passages in the novel. Johan Borgen described the debut as "measuring 7.3 on the Richter earthquake scale".
Bauer published the freestanding sequel to "Graffiti", "Bulk" (1978), under his own name. The novel depicts a young man returning to Oslo after spending some time at sea. Alcoholism is a central theme, both the protagonist and his mother are portrayed as heavy drinkers. His next novel, "Humlehjertene" (1980), depicts the protagonist's stay in Paris from 1967 to 1969, where he becomes involved in the May 1968 student riots. The novel was heavily based on Bauer's own experiences from Paris during the same period. "I suppose every writer actually writes about themselves", he told "Verdens Gang". The Troubles in Northern Ireland would become the topic of "Rosapenna" (1983), named after a street in Belfast. Bauer felt that the Norwegian press was giving a one-sided picture of The Troubles, something he wanted to correct. To get the necessary distance to the source material, he decided to let the novel take place in 1973. Bauer himself arrived in Belfast in 1972, shortly after the Bloody Sunday, as a journalist for "Vi Menn". He became an eyewitness to the bombing of the Abercorn restaurant in Castle Lane. Bauer could not believe the IRA was responsible for the bombing, and defended them in "Vi Menn". He eventually became closely involved with the IRA. "England is to blame for the conflict in Northern Ireland. The antagonism is based on economic differences ... this is not a religious war", Bauer said in an interview shortly after the release of "Rosapenna". Bauer's 1985 novel "Metoden" introduced the protagonist Bo Brandt, the son of a wealthy, alcoholized, ship-owner. The novel serves both as a crime thriller and a psychological study.
Bauer's last novels would revolve around Tom, who starts out as a ten-year-old in "Hestehodetåken" (1992), and returns as a teenager in "Svartefot" (1995), and a twenty-year-old in "Magenta" (1997). Bauer referred to the books as "a reluctant trilogy". In the fourth novel in the series, "Forløperen" (1999), Tom returns to Norway after spending forty years traveling abroad. The book was finished while Bauer was terminally ill, and released posthumously.
Aside from his novels, Bauer was also a playwright. Two of his plays, "Vesper" (1987) and "Brendan" (1993), depict the conflict in Northern Ireland.
Death and legacy.
Bauer died 12 June 1999, having battled cancer for one and half year. Bauer was involved in a dramatic television production, "Jakttid", but as his condition worsened, he had to prioritize finishing his last novel, "Forløperen". It was published 26 August 1999. Three years later, an anthology was published in Bauer's honor. "Bauers bok", edited by Lars Saabye Christensen, contained contributions by among others Christensen, Kjartan Fløgstad, Espen Haavardsholm, Per Petterson, Dag Solstad, and Tove Nilsen. He was described by Solstad as extremely well-read, being particularly interested in authors like Louis-Ferdinand Céline and Jean Genet. In the anthology, Petterson compared Bauer's protagonists to Holden Caulfield of "The Catcher in the Rye", a novel important to Bauer.
Bauer was survived by his wife Anne Gun, and his daughter, Anya Bauer Hartmark, born in 1972. Bauer had wanted her to be named "Mulele", after Pierre Mulele, and Bauer and his friends would refer to her using the nickname Mulle as a tribute to the Congolese revolutionary.

Love Is Red

History.
Love is Red was a melodic hardcore band hailing from Nashville, Tennessee. The band formed in 2000 In Florence, Alabama with the original line up of Rob Mcfeters (vocals), Dane Taylor (drums), Adam Riser (guitar), Roger Kilburn (guitar), and Kinsman Mackay (bass). After their first demo, the band released their debut full length record, "All Thats Ahead Points to Forever",on the Kansas City based indie record label Recorse Records. After a few southeastern tours, Rob Mcfeters quit the band because he was unable to control his bowels. The band recruited Hunter Weeks on vocals. The band then re-recorded some demo tracks and released a split EP on Recorse Records with Nashville Band, Olivers Army in 2002.
The band toured the east coast for a while until Dane Taylor and Kinsman Mackay quit the band . New members Kyle Mims (drums), and Jeff Yancey (Bass), joined the band to form their final line up. The band toured the United States extensively for a few years and finally caught the attention of Jamey Jasta from the band Hatebreed and the founder of record label Stillborn Records. The band recorded a full length album on Stillborn called "The Hardest Fight" in 2004. The band toured on this record with such bands as Hatebreed, Saosin, Strung Out, Agnostic Front, With Honor, Embrace Today, and others. Love is Red shot a video that aired on MTV2 for the heavy music show "Headbangers Ball", hosted by Jamey Jasta. The video featured a single, "Close my Eyes", from their last release. The band then had some turbulent times, and only after a year of touring on the newest album, they broke up in the early spring of 2005. 
Many members of Love is Red have gone on to play with other melodic hardcore bands. Kyle Mims joined the band Evergreen Terrace shortly after the band's demise and played with them until 2010. Adam Riser played live guitars with the California hardcore band Betrayed, and has since started his own metal project called Lone Wolf. Roger Kilburn joined the hardcore punk band Sinking Ships, which broke up in 2008, and is currently playing in the hardcore band Wait in Vain, featuring members from the Seattle hardcore band Trial. Jeff Yancey spent the next few years filling in on bass for Bracewar (Richmond) and Cast Aside (rip) and spent some time as a roadie with Throwdown, Down to Nothing and Soilwork.
On December 18, 2010, Love Is Red got back together to play a reunion show in Nashville, TN at Rocketown with Hollywood, traitor, Ill Patriot and Modernhell. As of right now, there are no plans at doing anymore shows.

Murong Xuecun

Murong Xuecun (, born 1974) is the pen name of Chinese author Hao Qun. His debut work "Leave Me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu" (), which was distributed online, propelled him to stardom. On July 22, 2008 Murong made the long list for the Man Asian Literary Prize. , his microblog account has nearly 1.1 million followers. 
Murong's writing deals mostly with social issues in contemporary China, exploring themes such as corruption, business-government relations, and general disillusionment over modern life. His literature is known for its nihilistic, realist, racy, and fatalist style. Following his rise to fame, Murong has emerged as one of the foremost critics of censorship in China.
Criticism of censorship.
In 2009, Murong Xuecun wrote an exposé on a pyramid scheme in Jiangxi province. The work, "China: In the Absence of a Remedy" (), was a first-hand account of Murong's personal experiences with the pyramid scheme network that lasted twenty-three days. Murong Xuecun was awarded the 2010 People's Literature Prize () for the work. 
In his acceptance speech for the Prize, Murong wrote a scathing commentary about his editor that he worked with for "China: In the absence of a remedy." He also launched into a critique of the state of censorship in China in general. The speech was banned at the awards ceremony, but made its rounds across the internet. The draft of the speech was translated into English and delivered to the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents’ Club in February 2011, followed by a publication by "The New York Times" in November 2011. In the draft, Murong alluded to a wide array of censorship restrictions, including limits on discussing current affairs, contemporary personalities, and being forced to change the phrase "Chinese people" to "some people" in parts of his work. More obscure restrictions were also discussed, such as scrubbing the use of "Henan people" because it carries the air of regional discrimination, and removing references to "India-flavoured farts" because the editor was concerned about a diplomatic rift between China and India. Murong wrote that "The only truth is that we cannot speak the truth . The only acceptable viewpoint is that we cannot express a viewpoint. We cannot criticise the system, we cannot discuss current affairs, we cannot even mention distant Ethiopia."
In his feature story in Norwegian newspaper "Aftenposten" in 2011, his criticism of Chinese authorities included claims that for detainees of China, there are a number of "odd ways of dying while under arrest" — at least one individual allegedly "died while playing hide-and-seek", and at least another allegedly "died while he was drinking water", and at least one allegedly "died while he was dreaming".

Roger Jones (footballer born 1902)

Reginald "Roger" Jones (1 September 1902 – 11 December 1967) was an English footballer who played at left-half for Port Vale from 1923 to 1937. He made a total of 346 appearances, 326 of which came in league games in the Football League. He helped the club to win the Third Division North title in 1929–30.
Playing career.
Jones played for minor non-league sides Middleport and Ravensdale, before joining Port Vale in July 1923. He made his Second Division debut in the 1923–24 season, but remained a bit-part player in 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, and 1927–28. He scored his first senior goal on 10 March 1928, in a 3–1 win over Southampton at The Dell. He hit four goals in 19 games in 1928–29, including two in an 8–1 demolition of West Bromwich Albion at The Old Recreation Ground on 9 March. Despite this comprehensive victory, Vale lost 17 of their 21 away games, and were relegated at the end of the season.
Vale rebounded straight away by winning the Third Division North title in 1929–30, with Jones featuring in 38 league games throughout the campaign. The 1930–31 season was the club's most successful in terms of league position, as Vale finished fifth in the Second Division, just three places and seven points short of promotion into the First Division. He struck two goals in 28 games in 1931–32, with both of his goals coming in a 2–2 draw with Millwall at The Den on 3 October.
Jones featured 41 times in 1932–33, 29 times in 1933–34, and 30 times in 1934–35. He scored once in 38 appearances in 1935–36, as the "Valiants" were relegated; Vale had finished just one point behind Barnsley, who avoided the drop. Jones was released at the end of the 1936–37 season. Ironically he had just posted his most prolific season, scoring nine goals in 39 games, including hat-tricks against Mansfield Town and Halifax Town.

Le Moulin de la Galette (Van Gogh series)

Le Moulin de la Galette is the subject and title of several paintings made by Vincent van Gogh in 1886 of a windmill. The Moulin de la Galette was near Van Gogh's apartment with his brother, Theo in Montmartre. The owners of the windmill maximized the view on a butte overlooking Paris, creating a terrace for viewing and a dance hall for entertainment. The windmill paintings are a subset of paintings from Montmartre (Van Gogh series).
Paris.
In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris and the guidance of his brother Theo van Gogh. While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he would have the opportunity to be influenced by Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art. His circle of friends included Émile Bernard, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others.
Montmartre, sitting on a butte overlooking Paris, was known for its bars, cafes, and dance-hall. It was also located on the edge of countryside that afforded van Gogh the opportunity to work on paintings of rural settings while living in Paris.
The landscape and windmills around Montmartre were the source of inspiration for a number of van Gogh's paintings. Moulin de la Galette, still standing, is located near the apartment that van Gogh shared with his brother Theo from 1886 until 1888. Built in 1622, it was originally called Blute-Fin and belonged to the Debray family in the 19th century. Van Gogh met artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Signac and Paul Gauguin who inspired him to incorporate Impressionism into his artwork that, among other things, resulted in lighter, more colorful works of art.
"Moulin de la Galette" was also the name of an outdoor dance hall that was located between two of the last windmills on a Montmartre hilltop. In addition to van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Pierre-Auguste Renoir also painted Moulin de la Galette. Renoir's painting of the dance hall is titled "Bal du moulin de la Galette".
The paintings.
Three paintings with similar compositions.
In van Gogh’s first year in Paris he painted rural areas around Montmartre, such as the butte and its windmills. The colors are somber and evoke a sense of his anxiety and loneliness.
Other paintings titled "Le Moulin de la Galette".
"Le Moulin de la Galette," also called "The Blute-Fin Windmill, Montmartre" (F274) reflects van Gogh's artistic transition from his work in the Netherlands which was somber and heavy. Influenced by Impressionism, van Gogh's painted this work with lighter colors and unrestrained brushstrokes to capture light and movement. Van Gogh made the painting from an empty lot on rue Lepic, the street in which he lived with Theo. The painting features the Moulin de Blute-Fin, a 17th-century grain-mill, which was an attraction for its views of Paris. At this time there were three windmills on the butte, but this was the windmill van Gogh favored as a subject for his paintings. Moulin a Poivre, a second windmill, is just inside the left frame of the painting on the horizon. The painting was sold by Scottish art dealer Alex Reid to William McInnes and with van Gogh's "Portrait of Alexander Reid" is in the collection of Glasgow Museums.
Le Moulin de la Gillette (F348) is an example how van Gogh used a technique for heavily applying paint called impasto that it created a relief effect, partly to convey emotion. The brushstrokes in the windmill and doorsteps are noticeable. The faces of the two people were created with just a couple of brushstrokes.
Blute-Fin windmill paintings.
In addition to "Le Moulin de la Galette" (F274), which is also named "The Blute-Fin Windmill, Montmartre", there are several other paintings with the name Blute-Fin.
Other windmill paintings.
Here are the images of paintings from van Gogh's period in Paris that include windmills:

<doc id="21554936" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554936" title="Redistribution of income and wealth">
Redistribution of income and wealth

Redistribution of income and wealth or redistribution of wealth is the transfer of income, wealth or property from some individuals to others caused by a social mechanism such as taxation, monetary policies, welfare, charity, divorce or tort law. The desirability and effects of redistribution are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.
Types of redistribution.
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most democratic countries. In a progressive income tax system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate than a low income earner. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.
Two common types of governmental redistribution of wealth are subsidies and vouchers (such as food stamps). These "transfer payment" programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor, who pay fewer or no taxes. While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society, as it gives society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.
Objectives.
The objectives of income redistribution are varied and almost always include the funding of public services. Supporters of redistributive policies argue that less stratified economies are more socially just.
One basis for redistribution is the concept of distributive justice, whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a socially just, and possibly more financially egalitarian society. Another argument is that a larger middle class benefits an economy by enabling more people to be consumers, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of John Rawls, another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.
Some proponents of redistribution argue that capitalism results in an externality that creates unequal wealth distribution. Studies show that a lower rate of redistribution in a given society increases the inequality found among future incomes, due to restraints on wealth investments in both human and physical capital.
Some argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of economic crises, and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the underconsumptionism school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of Keynesian economics; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by Marxian economics. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster.
'Maximin Criterion' for social welfare.
One is the social welfare function, or the concept that society’s utility is made up in some way through the utilities of its individuals. The 'Max-Min' or 'Maximin Criterion' for social welfare explains this concept:
This states that the utility of society (W) is dependent on that of the least (min) individual (Yi), or in terms of income, the poorest individual.
Economic effects.
Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued per capita), on the other. The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial stress, status anxiety it creates.
A 2011 report by the International Monetary Fund by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."

<doc id="21554942" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21554942" title="Historic Cairo Restoration Project">
Historic Cairo Restoration Project

The Historic Cairo Restoration Project (HCRP) is an effort by the governments of Egypt and Cairo to restore and renovate historic Medieval Islamic Cairo. "Al-Qahira" (Cairo) was officially founded here in 969 CE by the Fatamid caliphs as an imperial capital and walled city, just to the north of the preceding capital Fustat. There are two parts to the HCRP: the remaking of the historic area and the restoration of its monuments.
Concept.
The Historic Cairo Restoration Project is a project started by the governments of Egypt and Cairo. The main project's intention is to create new museums in a sequence of historical sites in an open-air museum district, that will be widely accessible to both the citizens of Cairo and tourists. The project is currently focused on restoring historic landmarks from the medieval Fatamid era in Cairo (969 CE - 1250 CE). The number of potential historic monuments is estimated between 450 and 630 structures.
According to the Ministry of Culture, the HCRP plan is to ""to transform the whole area into an open-air museum."" The HCRP is first focusing on this Islamic arts district in order to be a part of the Museum With No Frontiers. This is a museum organized by the European Union, and the Fatimid area project will be a part of its Euromed Heritage program — "Islamic Art in the Mediterranean." 
Projects.
A primary concept of the project is to feature the actual historical sites as the main exhibits for this open-air museum by providing extensive information resources and catalogs on-site at each of them. Visitors would therefore be able to truly experience medieval Egyptian culture and history by seeing the structures and sites while concurrently learning more about them from the on-site resources.
As a part of this project, to increase pedestrian accessibility there are plans to create a paved walkway along al-Muizz li-Din Allah, the main ceremonial path of Fatimid Cairo. There are also plans to demolish less significant adjacent vernacular structures to create large garden settings surrounding the landmarks.
Criticisms.
Medieval context.
The HCRP has issued many plans, which have been met with resistance by some Cairens, the citizens of Cairo. For example, the plans to create gardens and walkways is seen by some as an assault on the original dense medieval layout and 'urban fabric' of Fatimid Cairo that diminishes the historical value of the retained sites.
The reasoning is that in Medieval Cairo, the context of a building was determined by its relationship to neighboring buildings. Buildings and monuments of importance were intentionally constructed adjacent to conventional ones, to convey and enhance their high stature and prestige. It is this urban clustering and juxtaposition that actually gives the landmark buildings authentic context and meaning for visitors to experience. Some Cairens think that by eliminating this context from the buildings the HCRP is lessening the value and historical understanding of their heritage sites.
Some architectural conservation experts have claimed the HCRP has used incorrect building materials in its conservation work. Other conservation experts counter that the massive and immediate intervention for landmarks, despite the inevitable mistakes, has stopped the threat of many just disappearing.
Funding.
Some residents of historic Cairo have also become suspicious of the HCRP motives, questioning if the project really has historical preservation and interpretation as its true primary intention. Some believe that tourism and commerce are instead the main reason for the project's creation and funding. The large amount of spending necessary for the intended project has also become a point of controversy, with some estimates as high as $350 million. Some residents believe that the massive cost of creating the open-air museum and restoring its landmarks would be better spent for other local public social and economic needs.

Grand final.
Again, a Finals match up between the 2 clubs provided controversy. With just under 10 minutes remaining the Melbourne Storm fullback, Billy Slater was bringing the ball off his own line. Whilst playing the ball he appeared to drop the ball. However, referees Archer and Hayne gave a penalty saying that Parramatta fullback Jarryd Hayne had knocked the ball out of Slater's hand. From the subsequent penalty Storm centre Greg Inglis kicked a field goal to prevent a Parramatta comeback. In 2010 it was found that the Melbourne Storm had cheated the salary cap and as a result both this Premiership and the 2007 Premiership were wiped from the club as well as the 3 Minor Premierships it had gained and the World Club Challenge.

Naseer Ijtehadi

Syed Naseer Hussain (Allama Syed Naseer-ul-Hussain Ijtehadi) (b. 1931 - d. February 3, 1990) was the eldest son of Hakeem Syed Aqa bin Syed Ahmed Allama Hindi bin Syed Mohammad Ibrahim Shams Ullema bin Ayatollah Syed Mohammad Taqi bin Syed-ul-Ulma Syed Hussain Eleen bin Mujtahid-e-Awal-fil-Hind Shariyat-e-Madar-ul-Aqa Syed Dildar Ali Nasirabadi "Ghufran Maab".
Early life.
He started his religious studies from Nazmia College in Lucknow, India. He also went to Allahabad University for Islamic studies and passed numerous courses from Lahore Board of Education. He had the Ijizat (certificates) from Ayatollah Uzma Syed Kazim and Ayatollah Syed Abul Qasim. Later he passed all the qualification of Mujtahid and was called Ijtehadi (A Mujtahid is an Islamic scholar, competent independently to interpret divine law in practical situations using Ijtihad, or independent thought. In some, but not all, Islamic traditions, a Mujtahid can specialise in a branch of Sharia - economic or family law for example. The qualifications for a mujtahid were set out by Abu’l Husayn al-Basri (died 467 AH / 1083 CE ) in “al Mu’tamad fi Usul al-Fiqh” and accepted by later Sunni scholars, including al-Ghazali.)
In Pakistan.
From his college days in Nazmia he used to participate in all speeches and debates and had won numerous prizes and awards. After he shifted to Lahore, Pakistan he started to recite more and more Majalis, and pretty soon became very popular among intellectuals of all sects of Islam. Beside Urdu, he was also fluent in Arabic and Persian and used Ashar (poetry) and quotes from Arabic and Persian books too. He was very fond of Allama Iqbal and Ghalib and would use their verses pretty frequently. He also had a photographic memory and would quote book's name, author name, page number, and paragraph of the book, so people could refer the books.
In 1971 he moved to Karachi and started reciting his Majalis at Markazi Imam Bargah at Liaqat-a-baad. People would come in as early as three hours to find space in the Imam Bargah and the rest would stand outside the Imam Bargah, sit in their parked car, and stand on the footpath, to listen to their beloved Alim on a loud speakers. Every Ashra (first 10 days of Muhharram) people used to pour in from all over, and pack roads with cars and people for about a quarter of a mile (from the Imam Bargah to Al Azam Square).
Majils recitation at PTV.
In 1977, he started reciting Sham-e-Ghariban Majalis on Pakistan Television (PTV- back then it was the only TV channel) and did that from 1976 to 1989:
According to numerous intellectuals that every time they listen to these Majalis, they seem fresh, related to current affairs and they always discover something new. It seems like he had the blessings from Imams when he was preparing for these Majalis as they are timeless. After his Ali-Izm speech the famous Nara (slogan) started “Nagar, Nagar, Gali, Gali, Ali, Ali,Ali, Ali…”. Since he recited Sham-e-Ghariban for 13 years on Pakistan Television, he was also known as Zakir-e-Sham-e-Ghariban.
Death.
On February 3, 1990, Allama Syed Naseer Hussain Ijtehadi died of a massive heart attack at the age 59. He left a wife, 3 daughters, and 2 sons.
Due to his "ilm" (knowledge) and control over "Am-aur-Khas" (mass), people in high position in Government respected him, but were afraid of his control over so many Muslims. Though they could not do much during his life, however after his death they deleted almost all of his Majalis from Pakistan Televisions(or they are hiding it), his books in library of Islamabad were stolen, and his book "Nahaj-ul-Fashat" was published under some other name. Thus a wealth of knowledge and research was wasted and a big loss for not only for the people of Pakistan, but Muslims all over the world.
Before his death he was able to complete a mosque, Imam Zain-ul-Abdeen mosque in Karachi, Pakistan. He was buried in the border of the mosque. He was also working on Tafseer of Quran and had only finished first two Paras (Chapters). Also, he was working on Serat-e-Muhammad. After his death he was given Sitar-e-Imtiaz by Government of Pakistan.

The American Physician Scientists Association (APSA) is a national organization dedicated to addressing the needs of future physician-scientists with respect to their training and career development. The APSA strives to be the student physician-scientists' leading voice for improving educational opportunities, advancing patient-oriented research, and advocating for the future of translational medicine. In this regard, it carries out local and national initiatives, provides student leadership opportunities, facilitates communication between physician-scientist trainees, and hosts a joint annual meeting for its members. It also collaborates with leading research and health organizations, including the National Institutes of Health.
History.
The American Physician Scientists Association was initially conceived in 2003-2004 and formally incorporated in 2005 by a group of MD/PhD students. Since then, the organization has expanded rapidly, and is now officially represented at almost 100 institutions across the U.S. Its growing membership has helped make it the largest organization specifically representing physician-scientist trainees.
Leadership.
The American Physician Scientists Association is led by the Executive Council. Executive Council members are voted in by Institutional Representatives. These are physician-scientist trainees and APSA members who serve as liaisons between students at local institutions and the APSA leadership. Institutional Representatives help the Executive Council better grasp the needs of trainees at their local institutions.
The Executive Council is overseen by the Board of Directors, which serves as an advisory board to the rest of the organization, and consists of active physician-scientists and former APSA Executive Council members. In addition to the Board of Directors and Executive Council, there are five standing committees who lead most of APSA's projects. Members of the APSA have the opportunity to serve on any of the organization's five standing committees, each of which has a unique role within the organization to help it achieve its mission. Currently, the standing committees operate in the areas of organizational finances, membership recruitment, organizational policy, public relations, and Annual Meeting planning. The APSA also works with numerous partner organizations and supporters.
Meetings.
The APSA has held its Annual Meeting since April 2005 in conjunction with the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians in Chicago, Illinois. The meeting serves as an opportunity for mentoring and networking across the entire spectrum of the physician-scientist career pathway, including career development sessions and panels. A number of prominent speakers have been featured at these meetings including current NIH Director Francis Collins, nobel prize winner and current National Cancer Institute director Harold Varmus. Several dozen competitive travel grants are typically available for APSA members who wish to present their research at the meeting. The Annual Meeting is also when the Executive Council of APSA meets to conduct a yearly review, propose future initiatives, and vote for positions on next year's Executive Council.
Starting in 2006, the APSA began hosting regional meetings and currently hosts four in the fall of each year in cities across the United States. The primary focus of these regional meetings is on building a regional community of physician-scientist trainees and focusing on outreach to current and future trainees who are unable to attend the Annual Meeting.
2013 APSA Regional Meetings:
The next APSA Annual Meeting will be held in Chicago, IL in April 2015.

Ermita de Santa Quiteria (Almazora)

The Santa Quiteria Chapel located in the municipality of Almazora, (Castellón Province, Spain) appears to have been documented since the first half of the seventeenth century.
History.
There are some indications that this area was populated long before this date: a 1330 contract speaks about a church next to the Mijares; there was news of religious processions to neighbouring towns; in 1394, the inhabitants of Vila-real, mentioned, among other places, a town named Almassora, which is most likely Santa Quiteria; a payment was made in 1495 to a hermit, to add a cell to the river's bridge, and a fifteenth-century coin was later found between the corners when work was being done on the roof.
Military hospital.
1647 it is turned into a refuge and a hospital, coinciding with the plague that ravaged the nation. It was reconstructed and widened when the plague ended. Also in the War of the French, at the beginning of 19th century, it served as a field hospital, that is, a French military hospital. It was rehabilitated for religious purposes in 1829.
Remodelling.
The present Hermitage, which is a single story with simple steeples, is from 1682, according to Sarthou Carreres. It is documented that it underwent work in 1726, directed by Jose Vilavalle, who built the espadaña, the pulpit, part of the roof, the sacristy, the steps of the altar, the pavement and remodelled the outside. The pulpit, the center, as well as the main altar have disappeared, from 1726, surely the work of one of the Ochando brothers. It was consecrated again, after the 1936-1939 war ended, with a new image created by the Almazoran sculptor, Enrique Serra. It underwent several renovations in 1984 and 1991. To the left of the presbytery there is a painting by Enrique Limo containing a scene of the life of the saint. The current bell is modern, dating from 1940.

Giant electric ray

The giant electric ray or Cortez electric ray, "Narcine entemedor", is a species of numbfish, family Narcinidae, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama. It is found in shallow water on sandy bottoms and sometimes adjacent to reefs. This species is closely related to the lesser electric ray ("Narcine bancroftii") from the western Atlantic, and may represent the same species. The specific epithet "entemedor" seems to be the Spanish equivalent of "intimidator".
This species attains a maximum length of 76 cm (30 in). The flattened pectoral fin disk is round, as long as it is wide, and overlapping the origin of the large pelvic fins. The eyes are much smaller than the spiracles, which are edged with small tubercles. The nostril on each side is not divided into two separate apertures. The teeth are mostly exposed when the mouth is closed. The tail is equal in length to the disk, with loose lateral folds of skin and two dorsal fins of equal size. The tips of the dorsal and caudal fins are angular. The skin is soft and loose, without denticles or thorns. The coloration is generally grayish tan to brown above; some individuals have several pairs of faint ocelli. The dorsal and caudal fins often darken towards the tips but have fine white margins. There is a record of a partially albino adult female, measuring 69 cm (27 in) long.
Like other numbfishes, the giant electric ray can deliver a painful electric shock. This species is nocturnal and spends the day half-buried under sand. At night, it moves into shallow bays to feed, mostly on polychaete worms but perhaps also on sea squirts. It moves along the bottom by "hopping" on its flexible ribbed pelvic fins. If threatened by a predator, it exhibits a characteristic defense behavior in which it erupts from the bottom, arches its back, and performs a "somersault" in the water column. In one case, a diver was shocked when the ray landed on his back after such a maneuver. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by uterine "milk" produced by the mother. The females give birth to 4-15 young, measuring 11–12 cm (4.3-4.7 in) long. The reproductive cycle is annual, with ovulation and fertilization taking place in July and August. Males may exceed 11 years of age, and females 15 years.
Known parasites of the giant electric ray include the tapeworms "Acanthobothrium franus" and "A. inbiorium", and the copepod "Taeniacanthodes dojirii". This species is harvested by an artisanal ray fishery in the Gulf of California.

The Temple Beau

The Temple Beau is a play by Henry Fielding. It was first performed on 26 January 1730, at Goodman's Fields after it was rejected by the Theatre Royal. The play, well received at Goodman's Fields, depicts a young law student forsaking his studies for pleasure. By portraying hypocrisy in a comedic manner, Fielding shifts his focus from a discussion of love and lovers.
The play's relative success when compared to other plays at Goodman's Fields was in part caused by the relative freedom granted by Goodman's Fields, though the play was not dramatically different from Fielding's first play, "Love in Several Masques". No contemporary reviews exist, but modern critics pointed to a general improvement in Fielding's play writing though it still had several noticeable weaknesses.
Background.
Fielding wrote "The Temple Beau" sometime after leaving Leiden in April 1729. It was the fourth play that Fielding wrote and he finished it by the end of 1729. Although his first play was performed at the Theatre Royal, "The Temple Beau" was rejected by the theatre. He turned to Goodman's Fields and the play was first advertised, in the 16 January 1730 "Daily Journal", as being rehearsed and to open 22 January. A deferral notice was posted on 22 January 1730 in the "Daily Journal" and "Daily Courant" stating that the play would open 26 January.
It first ran on 26 January 1730 at Goodman's Fields, a new theatre that first opened 31 October 1729. The play was the first new play staged at Goodman's Fields and it ran for nine nights until 5 February 1730. Three of the nights were author's benefits. For the first author's benefit on 28 January, Fielding added a new song titled "Like the Whig and the Tory". Later showings of the play came immediately on 10 February and 3 March 1730. Other revivals included showings on 5 June and 9 July 1730 but it slowly disappeared, with only two showings the next year, on 13 March and 4 December 1731, and a later revival in 1736 on 25 March and 27 April, all taking place at Goodman's Fields. A revised version of the play titled "The Temple Beau; or, The Intriguing Sisters" was performed on 21 September 1782 at the Haymarket theatre.
On 2 February 1730, it was published along with a prologue added by James Ralph that attacked the treatment of authors by society, making the beginning of a theatrical relationship between Ralph and Fielding. The publication was advertised in "The St. James's Evening Post", the "London Evening Post", the "Whitehall Evening Post", and the "Monthly Chronicle". The edition printed was the only London edition of the play on its own with a Dublin edition printed in 1730. The play was later collected in Arthur Murphy's edition of Fielding's "Works" (1762).
Cast.
The cast according to the printed billing:
Plot.
Wilding is a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure. He is a rake who uses people and wishes to marry Bellaria simply for money. Unlike "Love in Several Masques", Fielding cares more about revealing hypocrisy than with a discussion of love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites in a manner that emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.
Themes.
The play's rejection by the Theatre Royal proved beneficial to Fielding because it allowed him to experiment with his plays in ways that would be unaccepted at larger locations. This is not to say that the play was different from his first; "The Temple Beau" (1730), like "Love in Several Masques" (1728), exemplified Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form. The connections are deeper, and, as Harold Pagliaro believes, that "Though "The Temple Beau" is more complex in its intrigues than is Fielding's first play, both promote the ideal of love and marriage, showing money to be necessary for a happy marriage but bad as the primary reason for it."
"The Temple Beau" is straightforward unlike "Love in Several Masques", and it relies on a simpler set of patterns: instead of triplicates, the images are repeated only once. Additionally, many of the characters are analogous to the roles of the characters within the other play (Wilding and Wisemore, Veromil and Merital, Valentine and Malvil, etc.). However, the plot of the two plays are different because Fielding focuses more on hypocrisy and how characters interact with Wilding. Bellaria's two aunts, Lady Pedant and Lady Gravely, representing immodesty and prudishness respectively, try to influence her actions; Bellaria is able to avoid the suggestions of both, and believes that one should not hide their love for another and should be passionate towards a virtuous man. When it comes to matters of gender, the play expresses a view of equality between the sexes that manifests in marriage. However, the play reveals that there are different standards for the genders even though the male characters may express concerns about these double standards.
Critical response.
"The Temple Beau" was one of the best received new plays at Goodman's Fields, with only the "Fashionable Lady" as a rival. Its initial run lasted for an equal amount of time during April 1730. The "Daily Journal" reported that the play was well received. On the author's benefit nights, Fielding was able to raise about 100 pounds. There are no direct contemporary reviews on "The Temple Beau" that have survived. A few plays may have been influenced by "The Temple Beau", including Theophilus Cibber's "The Lovers" (1730) or Benjamin Hoadly's "The Suspicious Husband" (1747). The play was mostly ignored until John Genest, in "Some Account of the English Stage, from the Restoration in 1660 to 1830" (1832), declared the play as better than Fielding's other plays with little explanation as to why. In 1911, Austin Dobson wrote, "The "Temple Beau" certainly shows an advance upon its predecessor; but it is an advance in the same direction, imitation of Congreve." Leslie Stephen backs this up by saying that the play is "much in the vein of the first, with less smartness in dialogue".
F. Homes Dudden declared "The Temple Beau" as "a fairly good comedy of intrigue" and says that "The plot of the comedy, though rather too complicated, is more skilfully constructed than that of "Love in Several Masques", and some of the situations are diverting. One of the best things in the piece is the interview between the deluded Sir Harry [...] young Wilding [...] and Pincet". Robert Hume believed that "Fielding had begun to master the mechanics of intrigue comedy. The results are not wonderful, but they show distinctly more technical competence. Fielding still employs more characters than he can comfortably control [...] but at least he involves them in related complications." Albert Rivero believed that "The initial rejection of "The Temple Beau", however, convinced Fielding that his future success would depend on his ability to satisfy the town's taste for less conventional entertainments." Harold Pagliaro describes the play by saying, "Though the dramatic structure of "The Temple Beau" is improved over that of Fielding's first play, it has some obvious weaknesses. The lovers are too nearly perfect to engage us in what is or ought to be their burdensome complication of distress. They are so sure of each other and of themselves that they are unassailable, however threatened by the loss of love, freedom and financial self-sufficiency."

Grimeborn

Grimeborn is an annual East London musical theatre and opera festival which coincides with the world famous East Sussex Glyndebourne Opera Festival. Founded by Arcola Theatre’s artistic director Mehmet Ergen in 2007, the festival is held at Arcola Theatre in Dalston, East London. It runs for two weeks during August and is considered a dynamic alternative to the traditional "summer season".
History.
The festival's name is a punning reference to Glyndebourne, as it deliberately supports emerging performers and writers, rather than the polished, prestigious output of Glyndebourne. The "grime" comes from it having a "dirtier" backdrop in a converted textile factory in the congested bustle of Hackney as opposed to the scenic gardens of East Sussex. The festival showcases new and experimental works. Many see Grimeborn as the fashionable alternative to Glyndebourne, due to its E8 location.
Originally devised as a contemporary contribution to the Battersea Arts Centre's (BAC) Opera Festival. The BAC Opera Festival's Artistic Director at the time, Tom Morris, asked Ergen, who was working at the BAC as an Associate Producer, to create something different from normal operatic preconceptions, in a manner similar to that of the Tête à Tête opera company at the Riverside Studios who were also taking the stage at the BAC Opera Festival that year. Grimeborn is an opera and musical theatre festival in its own right, with the Arcola Theatre its exclusive host. The 2010 Grimeborn programme was curated by director and actor Andrew Steggall who also oversaw the festival's first outing in 2007. He considers the festival to be "a testing ground for young opera and musical theatre practitioners".

Salvia nubicola

Salvia nubicola is a herbaceous perennial native to a wide region that includes Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, southwest Asia, and Europe. The plant grows at elevations of in dry forests, often with "Pinus wallichiana", typically growing in large colonies in woodland clearings. It is especially common in the Muktinath Valley, and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine.
The specific epithet "nubicola" means "dweller among the clouds," referring to its high mountain habitat. For many years, it was considered the same plant as the similar European "Salvia glutinosa" (Sticky sage).
"Salvia nubicola" reaches high and wide, growing upright, with fresh-green colored leaves that are triangular shaped, with the largest, approximately , growing at the base of the plant. The petiole is typically about the same length as the leaf blade. The plant puts out numerous long inflorescences holding pale yellow flowers, in whorls of two to six, that have finely spotted maroon markings on the upper lip. The calyx is bright green, hairy, sticky, and glandular, giving off a medicinal odor when rubbed, described by one author as "resembling the distinct odour of a billy-goat," all of which cause animals to avoid it in its native habitat.

2009 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team

The 2009 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team represented the University of Notre Dame in the 2009 college football season. Charlie Weis entered his fifth season as head coach with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth. Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4-2, with close losses to Michigan and USC but ended the season with four straight losses, including a second loss to Navy loss in three years. Weis was fired as head coach the Monday after the Stanford loss at the end of the season. Although Notre Dame was bowl eligible with 6 wins, the University announced on December 4 that the Irish had chosen not to play in a bowl game. Irish athletic director Jack Swarbrick hired Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly after a 10-day coaching search.
Pre-season.
Coaching changes.
Following the 2008 season, offensive coordinator Michael Haywood left the team to become the head coach for the Miami (Ohio) University Redhawks. Following what some critics called a disappointing 7-6 season, Charlie Weis announced several major changes to the coaching staff, including the replacement of the offensive and defensive line coaches. Frank Verducci was hired to replace John Latina as the offensive line coach and was placed in charge of revamping the Irish running game as the running game coordinator. Tony Alford was hired to replace Mike Haywood as the running backs coach. Finally, Weis hired defensive line coach Randy Hart, a veteran coach at University of Washington from 1988-2008. Former Notre Dame standout and NFL veteran Bryant Young was also hired as a defensive graduate assistant with the possibility of eventually stepping in to coach the defensive line.
Roster changes.
Graduating players.
Senior safety and captain David Bruton was the only player drafted from the team, going in the fourth round to the Denver Broncos as the 114th pick overall. Five more players would sign quickly after the draft, including David Grimes with Broncos, Pat Kuntz with the Colts, Terrail Lambert with the 49ers, and fullback Asaph Schwapp and offensive lineman Mike Turkovich with the Cowboys. Defensive lineman Justin Brown and captain Maurice Crum Jr. also exhausted their eligibility.
Transfers.
Tight end Joseph Fauria transferred from Notre Dame to UCLA prior to the start of the season following an undisclosed University violation that would have sidelined him for the season.
Recruiting.
The Irish added 18 players to its roster with high school recruits. Included in the class were five-star linebacker Manti Te'o (top defensive player in the nation), four star runningback Cierre Wood, and five-star offensive lineman Chris Watt. The class was named No. 11 by Rivals, No. 14 by ESPN and No. 23 by Scout.
Award candidates.
The following players were announced to award watch lists prior to the start of the 2009 season:
Game notes.
Nevada.
Notre Dame beat Hall of Fame coach Chris Ault's Nevada squad 35-0 to give Charlie Weis his first shutout as Irish head coach. Irish quarterback Jimmy Clausen continued his efficient play from the Hawai'i Bowl victory the previous season (22-26 for 401 yards and 5 touchdowns), completing 15 of 18 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns. Clausen started the game by completing 10 of 11 passes for 184 yards and three touchdowns, highlighted by a then career-long 70-yard pass for a touchdown to Irish wide receiver Michael Floyd. Clausen bettered that in the third quarter with an 88-yard scoring pass to Floyd. The 88-yard touchdown was the third longest pass completion in Notre Dame history. Floyd leapt over Wolf Pack cornerback Doyle Miller and kept his balance when Miller tried to pull him down at the 50-yard line, then raced in for the score. Clausen also completed a 24-yard TD catch to Floyd and a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph in the first drive of the game. Irish running back Armando Allen logged the other touchdown on a 1-yard run. He finished the game with 72 yards on 15 carries.
The victory was Notre Dame's first shutout victory since a 42-0 win over Rutgers in 2002. The Irish defense set the tone early, stopping Nevada to three and out on its first three possessions. Irish linebacker Toryan Smith stuffed Wolf Pack running back Vai Taua for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 and also logged a sack. Highly touted freshman linebacker Manti Te'o also got in on the action for Notre Dame on his first play early in the second quarter. On third-and-15 from the Nevada 26, Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick took off and had some room but Te'o caught him from behind after an 11-yard gain, forcing the Wolfpack to punt. The Irish defense held Nevada to 153 yards rushing and 307 total yards. Kaepernick was 12 of 23 passing for 149 yards with two interceptions. Irish cornerback Robert Blanton intercepted a Kaepernick pass at the end of the half, and senior captain Kyle McCarthy logged the second interception of the day and the fourth of his career in the third quarter.
Michigan.
Offense ruled the day as the Fighting Irish were upset in the final seconds by archrival Michigan, 38-34. The 72 combined points were the most in the history of the Notre Dame – Michigan rivalry, and the game marked just the fifth time Michigan has scored 30 points or more against Notre Dame. Jimmy Clausen continued his impressive play, throwing for 336 yards and 3 touchdowns, but it was not enough to offset costly penalties (9 for 75 yards), questionable play-calling, and an efficient performance by Michigan freshman quarterback Tate Forcier (23 for 33, 240 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT).
After Daryl Stronum's 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped the Wolverines to an early 14-3 lead, Notre Dame roared back in the second quarter, largely on the strength of Clausen's passing. Clausen threw touchdowns on successive drives—the first to Golden Tate, the second to Michael Floyd—to give the Irish their first lead of the afternoon at 17-14. The teams traded field goals at the end of the quarter and Notre Dame took a 20-17 lead to the locker room.
On the first series of the second half, Forcier led Michigan down to the Notre Dame 9-yard line before a missed field goal gave the Irish a temporary reprieve. A Jonas Gray fumble on the ensuing Notre Dame possession was recovered by Michigan at the Irish 26-yard line, and five plays later, the Wolverines regained the lead on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Forcier to Kevin Koger.
Michigan extended its lead to 31-20 on the second play of the fourth quarter when Forcier, facing fourth-and-three, ran 31 yards for a touchdown. Clausen rallied the Irish with a 14-play, 80-yard drive that culminated with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate, and Kyle McCarthy intercepted Forcier on the next series, giving Notre Dame the ball at the Michigan 36. The 7-play drive was capped by an 8-yard Armando Allen touchdown run and a successful two-point conversion run by Allen off a well-executed Statue of Liberty play, giving the Irish a 34-31 lead with a little over 5 minutes remaining.
The Notre Dame defense stiffened and forced a punt, giving the Irish offense the ball back with 3:07 remaining. Allen rushed 13-yards to the Notre Dame 29 for a first down, but Robert Hughes was stopped on the next play for no gain and Michigan used its first timeout to stop the clock at 2:29. Rather than run the ball and force Michigan to use its two remaining timeouts, Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis called pass plays on second- and third-down, both of which fell incomplete, and the Irish punted the ball back to Michigan having only taken 54 seconds off the clock. Forcier made the Irish pay for their mistake, coolly driving the Wolverines down to the Notre Dame 5-yard line, where he connected with Greg Matthews for the game-winning touchdown with 11 seconds left in the game.
With the heartbreaking loss, Notre Dame fell out of the top 25 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.
Michigan State.
Notre Dame recovered from its tough loss at Michigan by beating rival Michigan State for the first time at Notre Dame Stadium since 1993. The win wasn't sealed until Kyle McCarthy intercepted Spartans quarterback Kirk Cousins at the Irish 4-yard line with 57 seconds remaining in the game. Trailing 30-26 midway through the fourth quarter, Jimmy Clausen connected with Golden Tate off a fly route for what proved to be a 33-yard game-winning touchdown. A key play occurred late in the third quarter when Irish defensive tackle Ian Johnson blocked a Michigan State extra point to leave the score 26-23 Notre Dame; had the extra point been successful, Michigan State could have won the game with a field goal on its final drive.
Clausen, playing through a turf toe injury, had another big game, going 22 for 31 with an even 300 yards and 2 touchdowns. Halfback Armando Allen rushed 23 times for 115 yards and a touchdown and also threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Robby Paris out of the wildcat formation. The defense continued to be a problem for Notre Dame, as it surrendered 459 yards of total offense to the Spartans, including 354 through the air.
The win also proved to be costly, as Notre Dame star wide receiver Michael Floyd was lost for the several regular season games to a broken collarbone suffered during the second quarter.
Purdue.
With the game on the line, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis put the game in the hands of his hobbled quarterback Jimmy Clausen. Slowed by a turf-toe injury sustained in the Michigan State game, Clausen engineered an 88-yard game-winning drive with 3:41 to go to give Notre Dame a 24-21 victory over the Boilermakers. Trailing 21-17, Clausen completed a 22-yard pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph to move the ball to the Purdue 32. After a Purdue forced Notre Dame into a 3rd-and-14. Clausen completed a 15-yard pass to wideout Robby Parris for a first down. A 17-yarder to Golden Tate set up a first-and-goal at the 4. After three plays netted two yards, Clausen found Rudolph in the end zone on fourth down for the winner with less than a minute remaining.
Clausen played mediocre for most of the game, completing 15 of 26 passes for 171 yards, and throwing his first interception of the season. After splitting time with backup quarterback Dayne Crist, who directed two touchdown drives in the first half, Clausen returned to the game when it got tight in the fourth quarter. The victory was the Irish's third straight game decided in the final minutes. Kyle McCarthy had an interception at the 4-yard line with 57 seconds left to seal Notre Dame's 33–30 win over Michigan State the week before. A week earlier, Michigan's Tate Forcier threw a 5-yard touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining to beat the Irish 38-34.
Southern California.
In the closest game against USC since the controversial 2005 loss, Notre Dame nearly overcame a 34-14 USC lead to cut the Trojans' lead to 34-27, but Jimmy Clausen ran out of magic on the final drive and couldn't score a touchdown that would bring the game into overtime.
Boston College.
Notre Dame notched its first victory vs. Boston College since 2000, outlasting the Eagles 20-16. In a game that had four lead changes, it was the Irish defense that came up big in the end, intercepting three passes by Eagles quarterback Dave Shinskie in the second half. Notre Dame linebacker Brian Smith sealed the victory by picking off Shinskie with 98 seconds left in the game.
The Irish scored first on a 37-yard Nick Tausch field goal. Boston College would log its first points of the game on a safety resulting from an intentional grounding penalty called on Jimmy Clausen. After Nick Taush kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 6-2, Dave Shinskie led the Eagles down the field to take the lead on a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Rich Gunnell. Jimmy Clausen and the Irish offense answered right back before the end of the first half with a 12-play, 74-yard drive culminating in an 11-yard touchdown pass from Clausen to Golden Tate. The Irish defense, however, could not maintain the lead to start the third quarter, giving up large pass plays and a 6-play, 56 yard scoring drive by the Eagles. After several stalled drives by the Irish offense, Jimmy Clausen finally connected with Golden tate on a 36-yard touchdown pass to put the Irish ahead for good with a little over eight minutes left in the game. Clausen would finish the game passing 26 for 39 with 246 yards and two touchdowns. Golden Tate logged his 5th 100+ yard receiving game, notching 128 yards on 11 catches with two touchdowns. Senior captain Kyle McCarthy also logged two of the second half interceptions to seal the Irish win.
Washington State.
In the first of several "offsite home games" scheduled over the next several football seasons, Notre Dame played host to Washington State in the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. The Cougars, who last played Notre Dame in 2003 losing in overtime 29-26, were routed 40-14. Notre Dame would score first with a Nick Tausch a 29-yard field goal. Notre Dame's next score came from a Jimmy Clausen pass to Duval Kamara for a 7-yard touchdown in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Golden Tate scored on a 16-yard run for a touchdown out of the wildcat formation. After a Robert Hughes touchdown put Notre Dame up 23-0, Washington State's Jeff Tuel would cut the Notre Dame lead to 23-7, connecting with Jared Karstetter for an 11-yard touchdown. Notre Dame regained momentum, however, as Clausen's second touchdown came with 7 seconds left in the half; a spectacular 50-yard hail-mary pass which Golden Tate caught in triple coverage. The play put Notre Dame up 30-7 at the half.
Notre Dame back-ups also saw game action, highlighted by backup quarterback Dayne Crist's 64-yard touchdown to John Goodman in the 4th quarter. Nick Taush also added a 23-yard field goal in the 3rd quarter, setting the Notre Dame record for consecutive field goals at 14. Clausen would finish the game 22-27, 268 yards and two touchdowns. Golden Tate would finish with 141 total yards and two touchdowns. Robert Hughes, starting in place for the injured Armando Allen, racked up 131 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries. Notre Dame's defense also stepped up, holding Washington State to 206 total yards and notching 5 sacks and two interceptions. Notre Dame would finish the game with 592 total yards in the game. Washington State freshman Jeff Tuel was 12-of-23 for 104 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions.
Navy.
Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years and the second time in a row at Notre Dame stadium.
Post-season.
Charlie Weis entered this season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth. Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4-2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Many of their wins were also close, aside from a 35-0 victory over Nevada and a 40-14 thrashing of Washington State. Sitting at 6-2, however, Notre Dame lost a close game at Notre Dame Stadium to an unranked Navy team, 23-21. This loss was the second to Navy in the last three years, after Notre Dame had beaten Navy forty three straight times dating back to 1963. Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick, when asked about what his biggest disappointment had been that season, took a long pause, then said, "the Navy outcome." While Swarbrick clarified that he would not evaluate the football season until season's end, he stated that "Up until the Navy game we were in the BCS conversation." The Navy game, however, was the first of a four game losing skid, as Notre Dame followed up the Navy loss with losses to a top-10 Pittsburgh team, an overtime loss to Connecticut at home, and a season ending loss at Stanford. The week prior to the Stanford game, Swarbrick announced Weis would not be recruiting following the game. Weis was fired as head coach the Monday after the Stanford loss. Swarbrick announced that wide receiver coach Rob Ianello would head football operations, including recruiting, until Brian Kelly was named. Although Notre Dame was bowl eligible with 6 wins, the University announced on December 4 that the Irish had chosen not to play in a bowl game.

Leti language

Leti is an Austronesian language spoken on the island of Leti in Maluku. Although it shares a lot of vocabulary with the neighboring Luang language, and is marginally mutually intelligible.
Fewer than 1% of Leti speakers are literate in Leti, though between a quarter and a half are literate in another language.
Varieties.
The main dialectological division in Leti is between eastern varieties, spoken in the domains of Laitutun and Luhuleli, and western varieties, spoken in the domains of Batumiau, Tutukei, Tomra, and Nuwewang. This article focusses on the Tutukei variety. Tutukei itself divides into two sociolects, "lirlèta" ('"lèta" language', "lèta" meaning '(walled) village') and "lirkòta" ('city language'). 
Leti also has two literary or ritual varieties, "lirmarna" ('royal language') and "lirasnïara" ('sung language'). Both of them prominently feature lexical parallelism. 
Per van Engelenhoven 2004, "the major issue in formal Leti discourse is to keep speaking as long as possible. Indeed, the important element in 'royal speech' is not what is said, but rather how it is said and how long it takes to be said". In particular "lirmarna" features formulaic pairs of clauses which are syntactically identical, each pair of corresponding words in the two clauses forming a lexical pair. 
"Lirasnïara" is the sung form of "lirmarna". It employs a repertoire of approximately 150 Luangic-Kisaric words with distinctive sound changes: e.g. 'flower' and 'point' are and in "lirasniara". Often borrowings from Malay are inserted as well. Again per van Engelenhoven 2004, "in Southwest Malukan society turn-taking in singing is ritualized and as such a fixed strategy, which makes it a powerful rhetoric device in Leti discourse. [...] song may not be interrupted when performed. Singing is thus a means to prevent interruption in a speech event or an instrument to surpass the other speech participants".
Phonology.
Consonants.
In addition, the phonemes , , , , and occur only in loans, mostly from Indonesian, Tetum, and the local variety of Malay.
Vowels.
These vowels can also occur long; the phonemic status of long vowels hangs on the interpretation of Leti's pervasive metathetic processes. 
The mid vowels are restricted to the penult of lexical morphemes, which is stressed. The majority of these morphemes provide no evidence for the height contrast — are found before an ultimate and in other positions — and diachronically there was no contrast. However, the contrast is set up synchronically on account of certain exceptions ( 'he, she', 'refuse', 'stay'), and the fact that when suffixed the conditioning vowel can disappear: 
Phonological processes.
Metathesis and apocope, together "binding" processes, are pervasive in Leti as a feature of combinations of morphemes. The preferred "flow of speech" in Leti seems to involve chains of CCV units. 
The free form of any Leti morpheme always features a final vowel, so those whose bound forms end in consonants feature two allomorphs which are related by CV metathesis. Thus 'skin, fly (n.), fish, bird' have bound forms (the latter two with long vowels) but free forms .
When a morpheme whose bound form ends in a vowel is prefixed to another component, that final vowel may apocopate or metathesise into the following component. CV metathesis happens when the metathesising vowel is high and it's followed by at most one consonant and a nonhigh vowel. The metathesised vowel is realised as a glide, written as "ï ü". Thus "sivi + ternu" 'chicken + egg' becomes "sivtïernu" 'chicken egg', "au + laa" 1st sing. pronoun + 'go' becomes "alüaa" 'I go'. In other contexts apocope happens, unless this would leave an illicit three-consonant cluster. So "sivi + ruri" 'chicken + bone' becomes "sivruri" 'chicken bone', "kusa + nama" 'cat + tongue' becomes "kusnama" 'cat's tongue'.
A similar metathesis is found with the nominaliser, historically an infix "-in-", but now taking the form "-nï-" among many other allomorphs (detailed more below): thus "sora" 'sew' derives "snïora" 'needle'.
Grammar.
Morphology.
Human nouns pluralise with the third person plural pronominal clitic "-ra", which must follow another suffixed element: "püata" 'woman', "püat=e" 'the woman', "püat=e=ra" 'the women'. Nonhuman nouns pluralise by repetition: "kuda" 'horse', "kuda kuda" 'horses'. 
Leti has four possessive suffixes, which undergo binding. 
The vowel V in the first person plural and third person suffix copies the last vowel of its base. 
Nouns can be zero-derived to verbs: e.g. "rita" 'roof' → "na-rita" 'he roofs' or 'it has a roof'. 
Nominal compounding is highly productive as a derivational process. Some examples are "rai + lavna" 'king' + 'big' → "ralïavna" 'emperor', "pipi + ïadmu" 'goat' + 'shed' → "pipïadmu" 'goat shed', "vutu + müani" 'ribbon' + 'man' → "vutumüani" 'man's ribbon', "vika + papa" 'buttocks' + 'cucumber' → "vikpapa" 'cockroach', "kapla + nèma" reduplicated 'ship' + 'fly' → "kapalnèmnèma" 'airplane'.
Verbs fall into two classes according to whether their subject prefixes exhibit binding or not: those of Class I do not, those of Class II do. By default verbs are in Class II. Certain verbs are lexically in Class I (like "nòa" 'advise'), together with all verbs with complex onsets ("ssòrna" 'cough') and denominal or causativised verbs
("veli" 'buy', from the noun "veli" 'price'). The subject prefixes are as follows. 
Verbs with first person singular inflection necessarily take the pronoun "a=" 'I' as a proclitic. 
Some causatives are marked only by class change: "pali" means 'float' in class II and 'make float' in class I. 
The nominalising affix productively derives nouns from verbs. It takes several different forms, most of which are infixes, depending on the phonological shape and the class of its base. 
Reduplication, which usually copies a root-initial CV or CVCV sequence with binding, has a variety of functions, among them adjectivisation of nouns ("üau" 'idiot' → "üa-üau" 'idiotic') and verbs ("mèra" 'redden' → "mèr-mèra"), derivation of nouns, especially instruments ("sòra" 'sew' → "sòr-sòra" 'needle'), marking atelicity, and relativising on an object ("n-vèèta" 'he pulls' → "(n-)vèvèèta" 'which he pulls').
Vocabulary.
Lexical parallelism.
Many of Leti's lexical items are organised into lexical pairs,
which are always deployed as fixed combinations in a fixed order. 
A few pairs involve adjectives or numerals, but the
vast majority consist of nouns (e.g. "püata // müani" 'woman // man', 
"üèra // vatu" 'water // stone') or verbs
(e.g. "kili // toli" 'look // see', "keri // kòi" 'scratch / scrape').
Some words are confined to lexical pairs, 
such as "tirka" in "tirka // llena" 'lightning', 
or both "dupla" and "mavla" in "dupla // mavla" 'witchcraft';
these pairs are restricted to "lirmarna".
In "lirmarna" the function of lexical pairs is to
highlight particular elements of a sentence, or simply to mark formality. 
When used in ordinary speech, the meanings of
lexical pairs can relate in various ways to those of their components:
Or they can simply have the sense of a conjunction, e.g.
"asu // vavi" 'dog // pig' = 'the dog and the pig';
these are the only sort of conjoined phrases that do not require
the conjunction "na".
History.
The phones of Luangic-Kisaric continue those of 
Proto-Malayo-Polynesian according to the following sound changes.
In Western Leti, LK has vanished and
LK from MP *e is manifested as .
In Eastern Leti, LK becomes 
and LK becomes in the penult before a low vowel.
Roger Mills suggests that Luangic-Kisaric retained distinct reflexes of PMP *ŋ, on the basis of other languages in the family, and *Z. Moreover, although the status of *Z as a PMP phoneme is unclear — Mills along with John U. Wolff and Robert Blust no longer admit it, realigning it with *z — the Luangic languages have no clear examples of inherited *z, despite numerous examples of *Z > . 
Mills explains the metathesis found in consonant-final basis
as arising from an original echo vowel added to consonant-final forms,
e.g. *"kúlit" 'skin' > "kúliti", after which the original
post-tonic vowel was deleted, e.g. yielding "kúlti" > Leti "ulti".
Jonker (1932) was the first full-scale investigation of Leti, based on a native informant and the few 19th-century works on the language then available.
Examples.
The following paragraph is the opening of the Sailfish story as told by Upa S. Manina of "Talvunu // Resïara" house in the Ilwiaru quarters in Tutukei and reproduced in van Engelenhoven (2004). The Sailfish story is of great importance to Leti society: it provides an origin story for the Leti 'boat owner clans' of Luang origin, describing the destruction of the mythical former Luang continent and the migrations that brought its inhabitants to Leti.

In 2002 graduating in strings, she followed her sister into the Yerevan State Conservatory, jazz vocal class, graduating in 2005.
Career.
In 2000, Inga and Anush entered the State Song Theater of Armenia. Both of them performed national, ethnic songs and songs written by A. Grigoryan and Anush. They sang in many cities of Armenia as soloists.
In September 2002, they left for the USA for a concert tour with song theatre soloists. After the concerts at "Alex" Theatre in Los Angeles, the sisters immediately got an offer to appear on the same stage with solo concerts. The song theater left for Tehran with the same program.
In 2002, the Armenian variety song festival "Golden Lyre 2002" congratulated Anush and Inga on the ""Sympathy of Audience"" nomination. In February 2003, the ""Seasons of Life"" concert program was prepared, the producer was A. Grigoryan. Ethnic, national as well as modern songs were included in the musical performance, as well as songs to the accompaniment of violin, guitar and piano.
In March 2003, solo concerts of Inga and Anush took place in the "Alex" Theater. At the same time their first album "We and our Mountains" was released. This was followed by invitations to appear on stage with the same program in New York, Toronto, Argentina and Paris. Eventually in November, they left the theatre staff and started working on their own.
In 2004, their rendition of the folk song ""Tamzara"" was announced as the winner of the "Golden Lyre 2004" festival. Additionally the song won the "Tigran Naghdalyan" award in the "“National Music Awards”" in December 2005.

The Arshakyan Sisters were chosen by the Armenian public on 14 February 2009, to represent the country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 to be held in Moscow, Russia, with the song "Jan Jan".
"Our song for Eurovision is written in the genre of folk, with elements of contemporary music trends" - said Anush Arshakyan at the press conference before the trip to Moscow. The song's music was composed by Mane Akopyan, and lyrics by Avet Barseghyan (the Armenian part) and Vardan Zadoyan (the English part.) arrangement has been prepared by Ara (Murzo) Torosyan. In her words, their goal is to represent Armenian folk music in a new way. "Small countries like Armenia should always take part in contests such as Eurovision, to present their culture to the world," - said the singer. "Contest success depends not only on the artists, but from our side we will try to do everything to achieve victory in Moscow," said Anush Arshakyan, adding that they would start preparations immediately.
The song won a place in the Eurovision final on May 16, winning one of ten spots from the first semi final on May 12. They eventually finished in 10th place with 92 points. Although it was Armenia's less successful performance in the Eurovision so far (until 2011), it gave the country a fourth successive top ten placing.
"Jan Jan" was also the first Armenian song that entered the Pmachinery Top 30. The song entered the chart on June 13, 2009 at number 26. Its highest chart position was number 3 (August 1, 2009) and it remained in the chart for 16 weeks.

Mons Somby

Mons Aslaksen Somby (14 February 1825 – 14 October 1854) Somby was one of the leaders of the Sami rioters that attacked several Norwegian shops during the Kautokeino rebellion of 1852. During the uprising a merchant and the town sheriff were killed and others were whipped. Several buildings were also destroyed during the riots. Somby was executed by beheading in 1854. Mons Aslaksen Somby was married to Inger Johannesdatter Hætta, with whom he had a son. 
Early life.
Mons Somby and his siblings were converts to the Laestadian Movement at the end of the 1840s, but because of the excesses of the Norwegian locals and government they became an extremist group and by the early 1850s they were no longer receiving advice from Lars Levi Laestadius, the leader of the religious movement. 
During the summer of 1851, Mons was arrested and sentenced to 15 days imprisonment on bread and water for the disruption of the religious services in the Skjervøy Church. His brother, also involved in the disruption, suffered the same punishment, while his sister was sentenced to 10 days in prison on bread and water. After their release, they traveled to a large siida headed by their father Aslak Olsen Somby during the summer of 1852. It was from this siida which the Kautokeino rebellion was carried out.
Aftermath of the Kautokeino rebellion.
Mons also had a 25-year-old brother who participated in the uprising, named Ole Somby, who died of a brain injury after being hit in the head with a bat while trying to escape capture during the transport from Kautokeino to Alta. The death penalty was not invoked for his sister Marit Somby, but she died in prison before her case came to trial. His father, Aslak Olsen Somby, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Their mother, Inger Mons Siridotter, who was 60 years old during the rebellion, was prosecuted, but was found innocent of the charges.
Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jacobsen Hætta were sentenced to death and decapitated at Elvebakken in Alta, Norway on 14 October 1854.
After their execution, their bodies were buried in graves just outside the Kåfjord church graveyard in Alta, which meant that they were outside the Norwegian State Church's blessing. However, their heads were sent on to the "Anatomisk Institute" at the Kong Medical Frederiks University in Oslo, where they became part of the university's skull collections.
Retrieval of Mons Somby's skull.
In 1985, a relative of Mons Somby, Niillas Somby tried to obtain Mons skull for proper burial, but the "Anatomisk Institute" refused the extradition, claiming that the skull was the department's property. The department also stated that Mons Somby was a convicted criminal and a murderer and that no attempt should be made to describe Mons as a martyr to any cause. After the Norwegian Television NRK of Finnmark aired a story about the case in 1996, the president of the Sami Parliament took up the issue up with university and shortly afterward, the skulls of both Mons and Aslak Hætta were released to relatives. 
In November 1997, the skulls of both Mons Somby and Aslak Hætta were buried in a grave at the Kåfjord Church in Alta, at the same spot as their bodies were buried over one-hundred and forty years earlier. The story of the extradition of Mons Sombys skull to Niillas was the focus of the 2000 movie, "Give Us Our Skeletons".

History of Randolph, Tennessee

[[File:Tipton Phase sites HRoe 2010 Randolph TN.jpg|thumb|300px|Indian villages of the Mississippian culture during the Tipton Phase (ca. 800 
CE to 1600 CE) ]]
Randolph is an unincorporated rural community in Tipton County, 
Tennessee, United States, located on the banks of the Mississippi River. The lands of the Mississippi River Basin were inhabited by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the Mississippi River valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River.
European settlers arrived in the area around 1800. The town of Randolph was founded in the 1820s as one of the earliest European settlements in Tipton County. The location of Randolph, on the second Chickasaw Bluff along the banks of the Mississippi River, just south of the lower mouth of the Hatchie River, provided for an ideal harbor for flatboats and steamboats and made the town an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. The commercial success of the community also depended on the use of slave labor in the cotton fields surrounding the settlement. In 1827, the Randolph Post office was established and in 1834, the first pastor was appointed at Randolph.
The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable mail route and an unsuccessful attempt to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. An unfinished project to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River and other factors also contributed to the commercial demise of the town. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the American Civil War in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces, which further promoted the decline of the once flourishing community.
In 2008, "Randolph Bluff Historic Park" was dedicated. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public. Once finished, the park will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to "create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River". As of 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present.
Indian cultures.
From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians and later Archaic-Indians lived as communities of hunter-gatherers in the area that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native American people that had developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph.
European explorers.
Hernando de Soto.
Hernando de Soto (c. 1496–1542) was a Spanish explorer who led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern United States and the first European documented to have discovered the Mississippi River.
In 1541, De Soto and 400 men reached the Mississippi River in the area of what is modern Shelby County in southwest Tennessee or DeSoto County in northwest Mississippi. Within four weeks of their arrival, the expedition had built several floats in order to cross the river and continue their expedition westward into what would later become Arkansas territory. There is a documented controversy about the exact location of Hernando de Soto's crossing over the Mississippi River. A report published in 1874 suggests that "De Soto (...) traveled up to Randolph, and there built boats and crossed the river". Other documentations claim that it is "generally believed and (...) probably true" that De Soto crossed the Mississippi River at Memphis.
Cavelier de La Salle.
René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643–87) was a French explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a canoe expedition to explore the Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The armorer Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by Chickasaw Indians. La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 6, 1682.
The exact location of Fort Prudhomme is unknown. Some historians claim that Fort Prudhomme was built on the first Chickasaw Bluff, in modern day Lauderdale County. The "Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture" suggests that the fort was constructed on the second Chickasaw Bluff near modern day Randolph. Other research mentions the third Chickasaw Bluff as the location of the fort, at the border of modern Tipton and Shelby Counties. Again other sources assume that the fourth Chickasaw Bluff in modern Shelby County at Memphis was the location of Fort Prudhomme.
European settlement.
Around 1800, Europeans began settling the land east of the Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.
Early European landowners were eager to secure their investment in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried to find ways to get a return on their share of land. In 1818, Judge John Overton wrote to General James Winchester that "We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above us be beforehand in laying off town—as it might damp the sale of ours". Overton and Winchester founded Memphis, Tennessee along with Andrew Jackson in 1819. Overton, Winchester and Jackson were trying to secure investments in property in the Memphis area that they owned and not give the advantage to investors "above", north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, in Randolph. Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) would become the 7th President of the United States in 1829.
Both Memphis and Randolph are located on one of the four Chickasaw Bluffs, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 19th century, the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54.
Establishment.
Early in the 1820s, landowners and investors John T. Brown and Robert Bedford were the proprietors of the land on the second Chickasaw Bluff that would form Randolph a few years later. Only north of Memphis by water, they described the area as "a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats". The Hatchie River, joining the Mississippi River just north of the second Chickasaw Bluff, was accessible to steamboats for upriver to Bolivar, in Hardeman County. Brown and Bedford chose the site on the second Chickasaw Bluff to lay out the plan for Randolph, a promising river town.
The "Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture" gives the date of Randolph's official establishment as 1823. Other reports date the foundation to 1827 or 1828. The founders of Randolph named the community for John Randolph (1773–1833), a leader in the United States Congress from Virginia and spokesman for the "Old Republican" faction of the Democratic-Republican Party. The Old Republican faction wanted to restrict the federal government's roles.
Cotton commerce.
Success.
Located on the banks of the Mississippi River on the second Chickasaw Bluff, the topology of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all stages of the river. Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee and an important cotton shipping point in the 1830s. The town was an early rival of Memphis over commercial superiority on the Mississippi River.
In 1830, Randolph was the most important shipping point in Tennessee. In the mid-1830s, Randolph shipped 35,000 to 40,000 bales of cotton on the Mississippi River every year, in 1839 cotton shipments added up to 20,000 to 25,000 bales. More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840. At the peak of its commercial success, the community was called the "great steamboat depot of West Tennessee".
By 1829, Randolph had three commission warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern; 20 to 30 families were making their living in the area around Randolph. Early in the 1830s, the town developed quickly. Randolph had a population of approximately 1,000 people in 1834. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, one of them a distillery, several private schools, and more than ten saloons. "Some time in the thirties" of the 19th century, the first bank was founded in Randolph.
In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the "Randolph Recorder" and the "Randolph Whig". The "Randolph Recorder" was founded in 1834 by F. S. Latham as the first newspaper in Tipton County. The paper continued business until 1836. The first issue of the "Randolph Recorder" was published on June 21, 1834, and the last publication of the newspaper dates to September 23, 1836. The "Randolph Whig" was established either late in 1836 or early in 1837 and published its first issue on January 6, 1838. The "Randolph Whig" did not last long. Shortly after its establishment, the publication "was soon discontinued".
Travel routes.
A stagecoach line, established in 1833 by James Brown, provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson in Madison County, located about east of Randolph. The stagecoach line offered a convenient alternative for travellers between the two towns and connected the villages along the way twice a week. Heading west from Jackson, the antebellum stage line roughly concurs with modern U.S. Route 70 up to Brownsville and Tennessee State Route 54 from Brownsville to Covington. From Covington, the stage road coincides with modern Tennessee State Route 59 (TN 59) to Randolph. TN 59 terminates at Richardsons Landing, west of Randolph at the Mississippi River.
Later in the 1830s, Randolph was connected by a direct route to Memphis in Shelby County, located about south of Randolph. The road was a segment of a weekly mail line between Jackson and Memphis on which mail was carried on horseback. The route provided a link between the two flourishing towns and connected the settlements on the banks of the Mississippi River in Tipton and Shelby Counties for trade and travel purposes. The exact routing of the mail line between Randolph and Memphis is unknown.
Slavery.
A good part of the commercial success of Randolph can be attributed to the use of slaves working the cotton fields of the area for their owners. Slavery was common in the Southern States in the time before and during the Civil War. Landowners who ran plantations on their lands, bought slaves to work their fields, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the "Randolph Recorder" during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves they owned. For the capture and return of runaway slaves, plantation owners offered monetary incentives between $10 and $100. Rewards up to $300 were offered for the return of a stolen slave if the thief of the slave could be convicted of the theft. The Tipton County jail also published "jailer's notices" in the Randolph Recorder to inform owners of a slave of their incarceration.
The abolition of slavery was prepared in Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1862–63. Slavery in the United States was eventually abolished when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 6, 1865. The amendment declared that "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude (...) shall exist within the United States". Abraham Lincoln (1809–65) was the 16th President of the United States.
Decline.
The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after the establishment of the town. Five years after the settlement was founded, a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on, arose over a faulty land title with land owner Ann Grambelling from New York. Until 1835, the pending lawsuit "prevented the growth of population" in and around Randolph. The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $8,000 in a settlement.
An unfavorable mail line also had an early and lasting influence on the fortunes of the town. When the mail route was established in 1829, it went from Nashville to Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Raleigh and ended in Memphis, but Randolph was left out. Randolph was put at the end of a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. The attempt to move the county seat to Randolph was defeated "by a bare majority of voters".
Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. Early in the Civil War, in March 1862, the town of Randolph is described as consisting of "half a dozen or so dilapidated frame houses". During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time. This contributed further to the declining fortunes of the community.
Civil War.
Fort Wright.
Fort Wright was the first Confederate Army fortification built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis "Appeal" published a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis from invaders. In a communiqué sent to LeRoy P. Walker, the first Confederate States Secretary of War, Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow endorsed Randolph on April 26, 1861 as "the most eligible situation for a battery to protect Memphis". Within a few days, in late April of that same year, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp at Randolph and complete the fortification. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. It took four months to fortify the bluff at Randolph with earthen defenses and artillery batteries in order to protect the fort from land and naval attacks. By June 1861, the construction of the fortification was not yet completely finished. However, 50 cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright by that time.
Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–77) and Alexander P. Stewart (1821–1908) trained at Fort Wright. Other future leaders in the Army of Tennessee and Forrest's cavalry received training at Fort Wright. The fort was Tennessee's first military training camp. Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861, it was abandoned by the Confederate infantry by 1862 but sporadically occupied by other southern forces during the Civil War. In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright.
Fort Randolph.
Fort Randolph, the second Confederate stronghold in the area during the Civil War, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861. The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about southwest of Fort Wright.
In a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a "rough and incomplete earthwork (...) more than 100 feet above the river". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for , both upstream and downstream. Boats approaching the fort on the river could be detected early from this strong position. Confederate troops at the garrison could prepare for naval attacks on the fort and Union Army supply boats passing on the Mississippi River could be attacked from the elevated position of Fort Randolph without much risk of immediate retaliation. In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence.
Destruction.
In 1862, Union Army Major General William T. Sherman (1820–91) and his troops assumed control of the defeated Confederate stronghold of Memphis and the surrounding areas, including the region of Randolph, located about north of Memphis by land. While trying to keep the area under Union control, Sherman became increasingly "frustrated by the constant guerrilla activity in his sector". Confederate guerrillas from the Randolph area weakened the Union forces, raiding their supplies and firing at boats that delivered cargo to the invading forces along the Mississippi River.
The Union supply ship "Eugene" was fired at by Confederate rebels on the Mississippi River at the second Chickasaw Bluff, while carrying supplies to Memphis in September 1862. Major General Sherman ordered Colonel Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Infantry to Randolph. He informed his subordinate officer that "the attack on the "Eugene" was by a small force of guerrillas from Loosahatchie, who by this time have gone back, and therefore you will find no one at Randolph" (emphasis in the original). Although he could not locate the snipers, Sherman was determined to punish those who helped them, thus sealing the fate of Randolph. Sherman instructed Walcutt to "destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place". Union Army soldiers under Colonel Walcutt's command burned Randolph in retaliation for the guerrilla activities emerging from the area. To his superior officer, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman reported that he had "given public notice that a repetition guerrilla attacks will justify any measures of retaliation, such as loading the boats with guerrilla prisoners where they would receive fire". In 1869, Ulysses S. Grant (1822–85) would become the 18th President of the United States and William T. Sherman would become commanding General of the United States Army.
The retribution for a military or paramilitary attack, by collective punishment of innocent civilians at Randolph, has been mentioned as an early scene of Sherman's "terror campaign" or named his "First Campaign of Destruction" in the Southern States. Subsequent Union Army attacks, hostage takings and executions of civilians in other southern communities led by Sherman were intended to break Confederate resistance in the South. Sherman argued that residents in areas of Confederate resistance were "accessories by their presence and inactivity to prevent murders and destruction of property", thus potentially exposed to retaliation. Union Army actions under Sherman's command have been criticized as examples of war crimes committed in the United States during the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln.
Randolph was burned down a second time by federal soldiers in 1865.
Church history.
Randolph United Methodist Church.
The town of Randoph was established either in 1823 or a few years later, in 1827 or 1828 by early settlers. In 1834, Reverend Samuel R. Davidson became the first pastor at Randolph. He was appointed by the "Tennessee Conference" of the United Methodist Church. The "Tennessee Conference" is an organ of the church focussed on "developing principled Christian leaders for the church" and also appoints leadership roles in the church. After his appointment as a pastor of the community, a congregation formed around Davidson and built a church at Randolph. Almost 20 years after the Civil War had ended, the second church at Randolph was built by the congregation in 1883. In 1953, construction of a new church building was completed on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The building was remodeled in 1975 and serves as a place of worship for the Methodist congregation of Randolph as of 2008.
The United Methodist Church at Randolph had 78 pastors as of 1983. William Clyde Martin (1893–1984) was born in Randolph and grew up in the Methodist community of the town. Martin would later serve as a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, The Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church. He also distinguished himself in military service during World War II in the Pacific as a Methodist pastor. Later in his life he would become President of the Methodist Council of Bishops. Bishop Martin retired in 1964 and died in 1984.
In 2008, Reverend Thomas M. Yoder and Reverend Ben Rainey are the appointed pastors at the Randolph Methodist community. Randolph United Methodist Church is located at 98 Ballard Slough Road. The worship attendance for the church is reported as 76 members of the congregation on the average.
Randolph Assembly of God.
Randolph Assembly of God is a second place of worship in Randolph, the church was founded in 2001. In 2008, the congregation is led by Pastor Larry Rose and Pastor Frank Russell. Randolph Assembly of God is located at 1135 Randolph Road.
Postal history.
A post office was established at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail to the post offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was left out of the main route and put at the end of a branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).
In the later 1830s, Randolph was connected to Memphis by a direct travel route. The road was part of a mail line that started in Jackson, it was routed through Brownsville, Covington and Randolph and terminated in Memphis. Mail on the route was carried on horseback and delivered to the post offices along the way on a weekly schedule. The southernmost segment of the mail route provided a direct link between Memphis and Randolph and connected the villages on the Mississippi River along the way for travel and trade purposes. The exact course of the mail line segment between Randolph and Memphis is unknown. A fragment of the route bearing the former road name, about in length, was in existence until about 2005. The remaining piece of Old Randolph Road was located about north of Mud Island and east of the Mississippi River, just south of the mouth of the Loosahatchie River at the western terminus of Klike Avenue in Memphis. In 2010 the remaining fragment of Old Randolph Road is destroyed. The land on which the historic mail route was located is used as an industrial property in 2010 and is owned by the Fullen Dock & Warehouse Company. The property is fenced in and not accessible to the public.
The Randolph Post Office was in operation until 1932. The exact location of the post office at Randolph is unknown.
In 2008, the U.S. ZIP code for Randolph is 38015 (Burlison, Tennessee). The telephone area code is 901 (Memphis metro area).
Modern history.
Agriculture is the dominant source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After the abolition of slavery in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.
On October 11, 2008, the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, a non-profit organization, dedicated Randolph Bluff Historic Park in a celebration with politicians, conservationists, historians and community members. The property on the second Chickasaw Bluff was purchased for $378,000. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public, additional revenue from tourism is expected for the community. Once "Randolph Bluff Historic Park" is finished, it will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to "create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River", the project also promotes economical development and the preservation of land and wildlife in the Tennessee counties bordering the Mississippi River.
In 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200, and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present.
Notes.
There is a documented controversy about the location and names of the Civil War fortifications at Randolph, Fort Wright and Fort Randolph. A publication dated 1868 mentions Fort Wright and claims that it was formerly named Fort Pillow and was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff, the author treats Fort Randolph as a separate fortification on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The known location of Fort Pillow and the location of Randolph are about apart. A recent publication dated 2009 suggests that only one fortification existed at Randolph which was first named Fort Randolph and later became known as Fort Wright. Different sources give different locations for both fortifications. The Tipton County Property Assessor's Interactive Mapping System provides the location for the parcel ID 084055 02500, named "Fort Wright Historical". This is also the location of the powder magazine that is still intact as of 2008. For Fort Randolph, other sources give the location , the exact locations provided for Fort Randolph differ from each other due to rounding after the fifth decimal place of the coordinates. The two locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph are about apart.
The "Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture" dates the beginning of construction work at Fort Wright to late April 1861 and states that over "the next four months" the location was fortified with "artillery batteries and earthen field defenses". According to Konstam et al. ("American Civil War fortifications"), the Louisville "Weekly Journal" reported on June 11, 1861 about Fort Wright that at Randolph there were "50 cannon" present and that "thirty-two of them are monuted". The same source provides a citation from the Memphis "Bulletin" published after a visit at the fortification on June 22, 1861. By that time, the "earthen breastworks have been sodded with grass" and were reported "twenty to thirty feet in thickness" (6–10 m). Only one "narrow defile on the landward side" was reported by the "Bulletin" which was "defended by heavy guns" and "crossed by an earthen wall thirty to forty feet in thickness" (10–12 m). A "crescent shaped wall" to the east of the fortification provided a defense from land attacks. The contemporary reports indicates a good degree of completion of the fort by late June 1861. Fort Randolph, according to a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, was constructed in Fall 1861 and it describes the state of the fortification by that time as a "rough and incomplete earthwork".
A final determination can not be made in this context whether Fort Wright and Fort Randolph were identical or separate fortifications. It is clear that Fort Wright and Fort Pillow are "not" identical. Fort Pillow was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff and the coordinates provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph place both on the second Chickasaw Bluff about south of Fort Pillow. As for the differences in the locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph, and for the different stages of completion reported for both fortifications at a similar date, it is assumed for this article that Fort Randolph and Fort Wright were in close proximity to each other due to the geological features the second Chickasaw Bluff provided, but that they were two distinct places.

Reflection of Joey's Live

Reflection of Joey's Live is Joey Yung's second world tour and fourth major concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum. 
Sony Ericsson Reflection of Joey's Live 2005 (Hong Kong).
The stage.
The stage was shaped like a big flower and consisted of several elevators throughout the stage floor. Above the stage were six large contractible pieces that could come together to create a large ball over the entire stage. Above the stage in the centre, a large projector screen faced all sides of the area playing both live footage as well as video backdrops. There were also LED screens in the centre of the stage floor.
The show.
The concert was divided into seven acts: The Beginning of Reflection, Once Upon a Bride, Kiss Kiss, Break n' Rain, The 80's, JY Platinum Hits and Never Ending JY.
Before the show started, the entire stage was covered by a large ball. Once the show began, the ball lit up and the audience was able to see Yung through the semi-transparent material that the ball was made up of. As Yung sang the first song "凝溶", the ball opened up like an upside-down flower blooming, revealing Yung singing on a metal swing with colorful gears spinning above her. After the first song, yung was lowered under the stage as dancers came out for a short dance interlude. She then sprang up and performed the second song "好事多為" with her dancers. Then Yung Joey chatted with the audience for a while before singing "這分鐘更愛你" and "爭氣". 
For the second part of the show, Yung appeared dressed like a Chinese bride. She performed a newly arranged version of "紅牌出場" while being lifted around by her dancers. This was followed by a performance of "還未" while dancing with a Chinese fan, after which she took off her dress to reveal another costume and performed "夢路". She then performed "煙霞".
For the third part, Yung sang several love songs including "再見我的初戀", "身驕肉貴" and "怯" while playing a game with the audience. For the game, the camera would go around the audience looking for couples. If the camera stopped at a couple, they would have to kiss with everyone watching on the projector screen. After the game, Yung performed "誰來愛我"
Yung started the next part by singing the song "SOS" and then "broke" three panels of glass before performing "混血兒" with only her female dancers. JShe then performed "流汗", which ended with a "shower" sequence with four male dancers (reminiscent of her ShowUp! performance). 
For the next part, Yung performed a medley of Cantopop hits from the 1980s, introduced the band and shook hands with some of the audience. She then performed two more songs, "天之驕女" and "痛愛".
For the sixth part, Yung performed a number of her hit karaoke songs and asked the audience to sing along. Songs performed include: "16號愛人", "一拍兩散", 啜泣" and "心淡".
The final part was also the "official", pre-planned encore. She started with a cover of Minnie Riperton's classic, "Lovin' You". This was followed by her own song "Lovin' U", and "未知", both of which were rearranged with a "Latin" flavour. Finally, Yung performed her last official song of the night, "越唱越強". Many of the shows also had an actual encore segment, and the set list of the segment varied every night.
Reflection of Joey's Live Tour.
The stage.
The stage for Joey's other shows outside of Hong Kong was smaller and less intricate. It consisted of a simple three-sided stage (as opposed to the large in-the-round stage used for her earlier Hong Kong shows) that had her name "JOEY" in the middle made with metal columns.
The show.
The set list was generally shorter than Yung's Hong Kong shows. The new rundown included a newly arranged dance song medley.
Set list.
This is the general rundown Yung sang for most of the shows, though certain shows had slightly different rundowns.

Edmund Chojecki

Edmund Franciszek Maurycy Chojecki (; Wiski, Podlasie, 15 October 1822 – 1 December 1899, Paris) was a Polish journalist, playwright, novelist, poet and translator. Originally hailing from Warsaw, from 1844 he resided in France, where he wrote under the pen name Charles Edmond.
Early on, Chojecki participated in leftist intellectual and political movements and edited Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz's political weekly magazine "La Tribune des Peuples" (The Peoples' Tribune). In time he entered elite Parisian learned and literary circles, became secretary to Emperor Napoleon III, and co-founded the Paris daily "Le Temps", predecessor to "Le Monde".
Chojecki wrote a notable Polish-language novel, "Alkhadar" (1854) and translated into Polish (1847) Jan Potocki's celebrated novel, "The Saragossa Manuscript".
Life.
Edmund Chojecki spent his youth in Warsaw, where his leftist political views crystallized. He was a friend of the poet Cyprian Norwid, wrote for the monthly "Przegląd Warszawski" (The Warsaw Review), "Echo" (The Echo) and the monthly "Biblioteka Warszawska" (The Warsaw Library, 1840–42), and was secretary of the Board of Directors of the Warsaw Theaters ("Dyrekcja Warszawskich Teatrów").
In 1844 Chojecki moved to France and after 1845 became active in European leftist movements. In 1846 he wrote "Czechja i Czechowie" (Czechia and the Czechs), a book about the history of the Czech lands. In 1848 he took part in a Slavic congress in Prague and was expelled for radicalism. In 1849 he became editor of "La Tribune des Peuples" (The Peoples' Tribune), a Polish-led French-language radical romantic-nationalist political weekly magazine that had been founded by the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. In this capacity, Chojecki came into contact with many prominent Russian and German émigrés. His "La Tribune des Peuples" was published in Paris between March and November 1849, with a hiatus (14 April – 31 August 1849) caused by censorship. Chojecki also wrote for the progressive "Revue Indépendante" (Independent Review), co-edited by George Sand, and for the socialist newspaper "La Voix du Peuple" (The Voice of the People). For his pains, he was expelled from France. He visited Egypt, Turkey (where he enlisted in the army during the Crimean War) and Iceland (where he went as secretary to Prince Louis Napoleon).
Until the 1850s, e.g. in "Rewolucjoniści i stronnictwo wsteczne w r. 1848" ("The Revolutionaries and the Reactionaries in 1848", published in 1849), Chojecki had promoted revolutionary-democratic and utopian-socialist ideas.
In time, he entered elite Parisian learned and literary circles. In 1856 he became secretary to Louis Napoleon, who in 1852 had become Emperor Napoleon III of France. In 1861 Chojecki co-founded the Paris daily, "Le Temps", predecessor to France's most popular modern newspaper, "Le Monde". He became director of the Senate Library. In later years, as a French citizen, he wrote novels and plays under the pen name "Charles Edmond" and enjoyed the friendship of the Goncourt brothers and Gustave Flaubert.
Chojecki is remembered in the history of Polish literature as the author of a fine realistic novel, "Alkhadar" (1854), about the vicissitudes of a romantic conspirator against the backdrop of Polish Galicia's landed gentry, which was being brought to ruin by capitalism.
Chojecki also translated into Polish many French-language works, including (in 1847) the novel "The Saragossa Manuscript" by the Polish polymath aristocrat Jan Potocki. After sections of Potocki's novel had been lost (other fragments having been published as separate parts in 1804 and 1813–14), the missing sections were restored by back-translation into French from Chojecki's Polish translation.

Taube Foundation for Jewish Life &amp; Culture

The Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture was founded in 2001. Its mission is to help support the survival of Jewish life and culture in the face of unprecedented global threat to the Jewish people, especially in Israel; strengthen Jewish identity and sustain Jewish heritage in the United States in the face of assimilation; celebrate current Jewish achievement in all aspects of human endeavor; and work for the reform of Jewish institutions.
Jewish Heritage Initiative in Poland.
In 2004, the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture founded the Jewish Heritage Initiative in Poland (JHIP). The Initiative aims to nurture the revival of Jewish life in Poland, further awareness of this resurgence among Jews and non-Jews and foster positive interest in Poland and Polish Jews among American Jews. This mission reinforces the Taube Philanthropies’ broader purpose of sustaining Jewish culture in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The JHIP is a partnership program, made up of founding sponsors and new partners from the United States and Europe. 
Jewish life in Poland received an almost mortal blow during the Holocaust committed by Germans in occupied Poland. Decades of Communism followed World War II, see History of Poland (1945–1989). As a result, Jewish schools closed, public programs on Jewish culture were forbidden and only a handful of historians were permitted to study the archives of Polish Jewish history.
The fall of Communism in 1989 changed all of this dramatically. Many Poles have learned about their Jewish heritage for the first time and Jewish culture has flourished. The JHIP is supporting institutions and individuals –– in Poland as well as in the United States –– who are helping preserve Jewish heritage or are enriching the cultural and intellectual landscape today. A list of grantees appears on the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture's [http://taubephilanthropies.org/node/74] website.
To further the goals of the JHIP, the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture has established a base of operations in Warsaw at the Taube Center for the Renewal of Jewish Culture. The Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture is the only American Jewish foundation with an office and ongoing presence in Poland. 
The JHIP Director is Shana Penn, author and visiting scholar at the Theological Union’s Center for Jewish Studies in Berkeley, California.
Founder.
Tad Taube is the chairman and founder of the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture. He also serves as president of the Koret Foundation. He is chairman and founder of the Woodmont Companies, a diversified real estate investment and management organization. He has served as trustee of the University of Notre Dame de Namur, the University of San Francisco, and as governor of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
At his alma mater, Stanford University, Mr. Taube is founder and advisory board chair of the Taube Center for Jewish Studies, which was established in 1986. He is a member of the Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution and serves on its Executive Committee, and was founder and past chairman of the advisory board of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR). In addition, Mr. Taube is past chair of the Stanford Athletic Board. His involvement in Stanford Athletics includes his family's principal gift to Stanford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium and his significant support of Stanford's new football stadium, built in 2006.

Boxhill (Louisville)

Boxhill, also called Winkworth, is a Georgian Revival house in Glenview, Kentucky, a small city east of Louisville, Kentucky. It was built in 1906 or 1910 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
As with other nearby mansions such as Lincliff, Boxhill reflects a period of Louisville history around the turn of the 20th century where wealthy Louisvillians built showcase homes along the Ohio River above Downtown Louisville. The 29 remaining mansions constitute the largest such collection along the 981-mile long river, and are among the best-preserved collections of turn-of-the-century estates in the United States.
History.
William E. Chess, president of the Chess and Wymond Cooperage Company, built Boxhill on a tract on the Ohio River that he bought in 1906. The house, located on a bluff above the river, was completed by 1910. The Georgian revival house is reputed to have been designed by Boston architect Joseph E. Chandler. The landscaping, including elaborate gardens and a long tree-lined mall leading from the road to the house, is thought to have been planned by Bryant Fleming, a landscape architect from Buffalo, New York.
Chess' daughter, Mary Grace Chess Robinson, took over the property in 1917. She and her husband, Avery Robinson, vice-president of a cordage mill, lived on the estate until 1923, when they sold it to Henning Chambers, a brokerage firm executive. Portions of the original estate were sold off during the 1950s. In 1956 sidelights and a cast-iron balcony were added to the house's entry and a second story was added to a wing.
In the early 1970s Robert and Shirley Alexander from Chicago bought the property. In 1977 they were murdered in Boxhill by their stepson. He was diagnosed a schizophrenic and found incompetent to stand trial for the murder. As the mansion had been the site of a grisly double homicide, the bank which came to own it found no buyers despite offering it for sale for over three years. In 1980, Helen Combs, a veteran contractor who had restored dozens of older mansions in Louisville, purchased it for $355,000. She described the restoration process as unique, even for her, saying "The windows were out, plastic was over them, there was no furniture... We got to this one room and opened the door, and saw big red cabbage roses on the walls, red carpet, red bedspreads and red lamps that glowed."
Combs intended to live in the house but her husband, former Kentucky governor Bert T. Combs, balked at the idea, referring to it as the "murder house". She sold the house in 1982.

Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone

Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone or West Coast Economic Zone () is the proposed economic development zone for the economic region west of the Taiwan Straits by the Fujian government and the Chinese central government. This include the coastal cities of Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Fuzhou along Fujian province.
The proposed economic zone aims to integrate the economies, transport, infrastructure, policies from the coastal cities west of the Taiwan Straits for competitiveness, social development, increased and strengthened economic cooperation with Taiwan.
History.
The ideas of the economic zone has been around since 2001, when Fujian province was undergoing strong economic growth and the Fujian provincial government thought it needed to be competitive with other economic zones such as the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta economic zones. The proposal was also supported by the central government in order to facilitate political and economic relationships across the Taiwan Straits.
The economic zone will help Fujian catch up to Taiwan's economic development. The economic zone would "promote the better use of resources of the economic belt in East China and enhance its overall economic strength," Wang Xiaojing, the then executive vice-governor of Fujian in 2005.
In 2008, Mainland China through its Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan via Straits Exchange Foundation agreed on an Economic Pact which opened direct transport links for the first time since the end of the Chinese civil war. This allowed regular commercial flights, direct shipping between Taiwan and Chinese mainland ports and postal services.
Economy.
The proposed economic zone will accelerate economic development along the coastal cities in Fujian province. Fujian's economy is China's 11th largest provincial economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of 523.217 billion yuan (US$63.27 billion) in 2003
Fujian's current GDP is now 924.9 billion RMB as of 2007. The main economic engine in Fujian are Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Putian. The proposed economic zone will focus on electronic information, machinery building, petro-chemistry, construction material and clothes.
Taiwan's current GDP in 2007 was 388.1 billion US dollars.
In 2008, with the opening of direct transport links between Taiwan and Mainland China. It is expected this would increase economic activity in the economic zone as well as for Taiwan. This will mean reduced cost for aviation, shipping, postal services. It will accelerate trade, social and economic development in the Taiwan Straits region.
Fujian already has around 5,249 Taiwanese projects in 2008. This is expected to increase as cross-straits bilateral ties improves. This will increase exports such as mechanical & electrical products, automatic data processing equipment, clothing and accessories and footwear etc.
Fujian's major export destination includes Hong Kong, United States and Japan. As economic trade with Taiwan increases with direct transport links, Taiwan will become a major export destination.

Film

A film, also called a movie or motion picture, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to phi phenomenon. 
This optical illusion causes us to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. Contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences, that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.
The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen; more modern techniques may use wholly digital filming and storage, such as the Red One camera which records onto hard-disk or flash cards.
Films usually include an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence and its sexist treatment of women.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called beta movement.
The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including "picture", "picture show", "moving picture", "photoplay" and "flick". The most common term in the United States is "movie", while in Europe "film" is preferred. Terms for the field in general include "the big screen", "the silver screen", "the movies" and "cinema"; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word "sheet" was sometimes used instead of "screen".
History.
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early plays and dances had elements common to film: scripts, sets, costumes, production, direction, actors, audiences, storyboards, and scores. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as mise en scene (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.
In the mid-19th century, inventions such as the phenakistoscope and zoetrope demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of persistence of vision to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the praxinoscope, had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a magic lantern to project them onto a screen.
The use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses, because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each in turn capturing one image on a glass photographic plate, so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope.
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the Kinetoscope. Others were intended for a projector, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City on the 23rd of April 1896.
The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely visual art, but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a pianist or organist or, in large urban theaters, a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete film scores were composed for major productions.
The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood, typified most prominently by the innovative work of D. W. Griffith in The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.
In the 1920s, the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen. The resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies." The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."
Another major technological development was the introduction of "natural color," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance. While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually. The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the Technicolor process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action short films and isolated sequences in a few feature films, then for an entire feature film, Becky Sharp, in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.
The decades following the decline of the studio system in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the French New Wave, Indian New Wave, Japanese New Wave and New Hollywood) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.
Film theory.
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art. The concept of film as an art-form began with Ricciotto Canudo's "The Birth of the Sixth Art". Formalist film theory, led by Rudolf Arnheim, Béla Balázs, and Siegfried Kracauer, emphasized how film differed from reality, and thus could be considered a valid fine art. André Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytical film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory and others. On the other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life.
Language.
Film is considered to have its own language. James Monaco wrote a classic text on film theory titled "How to "Read" a Film". Director Ingmar Bergman famously said, "Andrei Tarkovsky for me is the greatest director, the one who invented a "new language", true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." Examples of the language are a sequence of back and forth images of one actor's left profile speaking, followed by another actor's right profile speaking, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. Another example is zooming in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection, then changing to a scene of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating the first actor is having a memory of their own past.
Montage.
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage.
Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with Eisenstein and the complex superimposition of images in his film "Battleship Potempkin". Incorporation of musical and visual counterpoint, and scene development through mise en scene, editing and effects, has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in Opera and ballet.
Criticism.
Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media.
Film critics working for newspapers, magazines, and broadcast media mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on films, especially those of certain genres. Mass marketed action, horror, and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film that makes up the majority of any film review can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most dramas, the influence of reviews is extremely important. Poor reviews will often doom a film to obscurity and financial loss.
The impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate. Some claim that movie marketing is now so intense and well financed that reviewers cannot make an impact against it. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted movies which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent movies indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Others note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result.
It is argued that journalist film critics should only be known as film reviewers, and true film critics are those who take a more academic approach to films. This line of work is more often known as film theory or film studies. These film critics attempt to come to understand how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their works published in newspapers or appear on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals, or sometimes in up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities.
Industry.
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumières quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 Charlie Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars.
From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders.
In the United States today, much of the film industry is centered around Hollywood, California. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as Mumbai-centered Bollywood, the Indian film industry's Hindi cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world. Though the expense involved in making movies has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of movie studios, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.
Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large cost overruns, a notorious example being Kevin Costner's Waterworld. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The Academy Awards (also known as "the Oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the United States, providing recognition each year to films, ostensibly based on their artistic merits.
There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts.
Associated fields.
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in film theory and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as film criticism, film history, divisions of film propaganda in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a movie review section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and movie-related toys (e.g., Star Wars figures). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as product placement and other advertising within films.
Terminology used.
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between British and American English. In British usage, the name of the medium is "film". The word "movie" is understood, but seldom used. Additionally, "the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be caledl "the movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or theatre.
By contrast, in the US "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film" and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when considering artistic, theoretical, or technical aspects, as studies in a university class and "movies" more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects, as where to go for fun on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Read a Film" would be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while "Lets Go to the Movies" would be about the history of entertaining movies.
Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media of film industry. "Motion pictures" or "Moving pictures" are films and movies, and "the motion picture" is frequently used in film productions specifically intended for cinematic release, such as for instance "". A "DVD" is a digital format which may be used to reproduce an analog film, while "videotape" ("video") was for many decades a solely analog medium onto which moving images could be recorded and electronically (rather than optically) reproduced. Strictly speaking, "Film" refers to the media onto which a visual image is shot, and to this end it may seem improper for work in other "moving image" media to be referred to as a "film" and the action of shooting as "filming", though these terms are still in general use. "Silent films" need not be silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, though they may have a musical soundtrack. "Talkies" refers to early movies or films having audible dialogue or analog sound, not just a musical accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or is roughly synonymous with "Film", both capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "silver screen" refers to classic black-and-white films before color, not to contemporary films without color. It is also used as a metonym for the entire film industry.
The expression "Sight and Sound", as in the film journal of the same name, means "film". The following icons mean film: a "candle and bell" as in the films of Tarkovsky; a segment of film stock; a reel of film; a two faced Janus image; a movie camera in profile.
"Widescreen" and "Cinemascope" refers to a larger width to height in the frame, compared to an earlier historic aspect ratios. A "feature length film", or "feature film", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening. A "short" is a film that is not as long as a feature length film, usually screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature length film. An "independent" is a film made outside of the conventional film industry.
In the US usage, one talks of a "screening" or "projection" of a movie or video on a screen at a public or private "theater". In British English, a "film showing" happens at a cinema (never a "theatre", which is a different medium and place altogether). When referring to the activity, one might propose "going to the cinema", or sometimes "to the pictures", in British English, whereas in the US the expression is "going to the movies". The cinema will usually but not always be showing an actual film, as a video or DVD might also be shown when of sufficient projection quality, and with the advent of digital film production and distribution, physical film might be absent entirely. A "double feature" is a screening of two independent, stand-alone, feature films. A "viewing" is a watching of a film. "Sales" refers to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A "release" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A "preview" is a screening in advance of the main release.
"Hollywood" may be used either as a pejorative adjective, shorthand for asserting an overly commercial rather than artistic intent or outcome, as in "too Hollywood", or as a descriptive adjective to refer to a film originating with people who ordinarily work near Los Angeles.
Expressions for Genres of film are sometimes used interchangeably for "film" in a specific context, such as a "porn" for a film with explicit sexual content, or "cheese" for films that are light, entertaining and not highbrow.
Any film may also have a "sequel", which portrays events following those in the film. "Bride of Frankenstein" is an early example. When there are a number of films with the same characters, we have a "series", such as the James Bond series. A film which portrays events that occur earlier than those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a "prequel", an example being "".
"Credits" is a list of the people involved in making the film. Before the 1970s, credits were usually at the beginning of a film. Since then, the credits roll at the end of most films.
A Post-credits scene is a scene shown after the end of the credits. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the movie is over and they should go home.
Preview.
A preview performance refers to a showing of a movie to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections (Audience response).
Trailer and Teaser.
Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only 1 or 2 screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Movie studios realized, that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the A movie in a double feature program) begins.
Movie trailers are now also common on DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some ten billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.
Teasers are a much shorter preview that would last only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers were used to get patrons excited about a movie coming out about 6 to 12 months away.
Film, or other art form?
Film may be combined with performance art and still be considered or referred to as a "film", for instance, when there is a live musical accompaniment to a silent film. Another example is audience participation films, as at a midnight movies screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", where the audience dresses up in costume from the film and loudly does a karaoke-like reenactment along with the film. Performance art where film is incorporated as a component is usually not called film, but a film, which could stand-alone but is accompanied by a performance may still be referred to as a film.
The act of making a film can, in and of itself, be considered a work of art, on a different level from the film itself, as in the films of Werner Herzog.
Similarly, the playing of a film can be considered to fall within the realm of political protest art, as in the subtleties within the films of Tarkovsky. A "road movie" can refer to a film put together from footage from a long road trip or vacation.
Education and propaganda.
Film is used for education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "educational film". Examples are recordings of lectures and experiments, or more marginally, a film based on a classic novel.
Film may be propaganda, in whole or in part, such as the films made by Leni Riefenstahl in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by Eisenstein. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of Wajda, or more subtly, the films of Andrei Tarkovsky.
The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others, such as the film by conservative non-profit Citizens United featuring voters disaffected with President Barack Obama.
Production.
At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the zoetrope merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can therefore take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in Stan Brakhage's 1963 film "Mothlight"), or thousands of actors, extras and crewmembers for a live-action, feature-length epic.
The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical production cycle of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as:
This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with "development". The second year comprises "preproduction" and "production". The third year, "post-production" and "distribution".
The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important financing becomes; most feature films are not only artistic works, but for-profit business entities.
Crew.
A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the "production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. "Crew" are distinguished from "cast", the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The "crew" interacts with but is also distinct from the "production staff," consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as writers and editors. Communication between "production" and "crew" generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. Caterers (known in the film industry as "craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew.
Technology.
Film stock consists of transparent celluloid, acetate, or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm prints.
Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (16⅔ frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown). When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second was chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras – allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design – allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.
As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for photography. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations, and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most movies on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of separation masters: three B&W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the Technicolor process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. Film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists, and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.
Some films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar to that used in television production. Modern digital video cameras and digital projectors are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some moviemakers, especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated and edited with non-linear editing systems (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. Yet the migration is gradual, and as of 2005 most major motion pictures are still shot on film.
Independent.
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major studio systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio. Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.
On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also leads to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by Warner Bros. in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987). A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.
Before the advent of digital alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film.
But the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution digital video in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to movie production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; today, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based personal computer. Technologies such as DVDs, FireWire connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade video editing software make movie-making relatively inexpensive.
Since the introduction of DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video outlets such as YouTube and Veoh has further changed the film making landscape in ways that are still to be determined.
Open content film.
An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a license which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan fiction or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major studio systems.
Fan film.
A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.
Distribution.
Film distribution is the process through which a movie is made available for viewing by an audience. This is normally the task of a professional film distributor, who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the release date and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a movie theater or television for personal home viewing (including DVD-Video or Blu-ray Disc, video-on-demand, download, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.).
Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as VHS or DVD, or Internet download.
Animation.
Animation is the technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see claymation and stop motion), and then photographing the result with a special animation camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the phi phenomenon). Generating such a film is very labor intensive and tedious, though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process.
Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for TV and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.
Limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by UPA and popularized by Hanna-Barbera in the United States, and by Osamu Tezuka in Japan, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television.
Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Cameraless animation, made famous by moviemakers like Norman McLaren, Len Lye and Stan Brakhage, is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.
Criticism.
The film industry has been criticized for glorifying and glamorizing violence, particularly gun violence, and for the sexist treatment of women in the industry, both in terms of the limited role of women in filmmaking and the allegedly sexist portrayal of women in film screenplays.
Violence.
Critics argue that "raphic violence in a film, when it is intended to produce an adrenaline rush in the audience, desensitizes the viewer not only to the victim's pain but also to the debasement of the perpetrator. In many instances, these films glorify violence and the persons who commit it." It has been alleged that graphic violence is mainly used to "...attract the audience of 18 to 35 year old males, the demographic group most likely to purchase theater tickets. It's often obvious that screenwriters or directors have had a failure of inspiration or craft and have decided to punch up their flagging effort with heavy doses of gore."
Actor Dustin Hoffman claimed in 2013 that "...movie directors... desensitizing audiences with a "fraudulent" depiction of real life violence and discriminating against actors who refuse to use firearms onscreen." Hoffman argues "...many moviemakers use shooting scenes to bolster the plot because "the script is lacking," and don't convey the true horror of real life violence because "a gun is rarely used in film in a way that it feels like in life. It's simplified into being a cartoon experience."
Prolific US producer Harvey Weinstein, who is known for making action movies with substantial gun violence, vowed in 2014 "to stop making films that glorify gun violence" US President Barack Obama asked Hollywood not to make films that "glorify gun violence".
Sexism.
In 2012, women made up only 18 percent of film directors, producers, writers, cinematographers and editors in the top 250 grossing films. No woman won a best Director Oscar until 2009, when Kathryn Bigelow won for "The Hurt Locker".
Critics have alleged that there is also sexism in the way screenplays depict women. Young women learn from films to focus on "laying down your strength and focusing on your sexual or physical worth..." and that "women are accessories to male adventure, which is the central and most important part of a narrative."
Another measure of sexism in screenplays is the "Bechdel Test, established in 1985 by the cartoonist Alison Bechdel and her friend Liz Wallace, is a way of examining movies for gender bias. The test composes three questions: Does a movie contain two or more female characters who have names? Do those characters talk to each other? And, if so, do they discuss something other than a man?….n astonishing number of lighter entertainments…fail, including “The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,” “The Proposal,” “The Hangover,” “The Truman Show,” “The Wedding Singer,” “The Princess Bride,” “The Big Lebowski,” and “Marley & Me.”"
Future state.
While motion picture films have been around for more than a century, film is still a relative newcomer in the pantheon of fine arts. In the 1950s, when television became widely available, industry analysts predicted the demise of local movie theaters. Despite competition from television's increasing technological sophistication over the 1960s and 1970s such as the development of color television and large screens, motion picture cinemas continued. In fact with the rise of television's predominance, film began to become more respected as an artistic medium by contrast due the low general opinion of the quality of average television content. In the 1980s, when the widespread availability of inexpensive videocassette recorders enabled people to select films for home viewing, industry analysts again wrongly predicted the death of the local cinemas.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the development of DVD players, home theater amplification systems with surround sound and subwoofers, and large LCD or plasma screens enabled people to select and view films at home with greatly improved audio and visual reproduction. These new technologies provided audio and visual that in the past only local cinemas had been able to provide: a large, clear widescreen presentation of a film with a full-range, high-quality multi-speaker sound system. Once again industry analysts predicted the demise of the local cinema. Local cinemas will be changing in the 21st century and moving towards digital screens, a new approach which will allow for easier and quicker distribution of films (via satellite or hard disks), a development which may give local theaters a reprieve from their predicted demise.
The cinema now faces a new challenge from home video by the likes of a new high definition (HD) format, Blu-ray, which can provide full HD 1080p video playback at near cinema quality. Video formats are gradually catching up with the resolutions and quality that film offers; 1080p in Blu-ray offers a pixel resolution of 1920×1080, a leap from the DVD offering of 720×480 and the 330×480 offered by the first home video standard, VHS. Ultra HD, a future digital video format, will offer a resolution of 7680×4320.
However, the nature and structure of film prevents an apples-to-apples comparison with regard to resolution. The resolving power of film, and its ability to capture an image which can later be scanned to a digital format, will ensure that film remains a viable medium for some time to come. Currently the super-16 format is seeing use as a capture medium, with digital scanning and post-production providing good results.
Despite the rise of all-new technologies, the development of the home video market and a surge of online copyright infringement, 2007 was a record year in film that showed the highest ever box-office grosses. Many expected film to suffer as a result of the effects listed above but it has flourished, strengthening film studio expectations for the future.

SEED Alternative School

SEED Alternative School is a small Toronto District School Board alternative high school now located in Toronto's east end.
Previous locations include Yonge and College, McCaul St, and Bloor and Spadina, in downtown Toronto. Originally, as a summer program, it was at Dundas St West and Bloor St W (where they cross in Toronto, not in then-Etobicoke).
The acronym 'SEED' originally stood for 'Summer of Experience Exploration and Discovery', and when it became year round semestered school it was changed to 'Shared Experience Exploration and Discovery'. Students interested in a particular subject, would gather other students, and together they would find a knowledgeable person to act as a teacher or catalyst, and meet regularly to learn. The groups met at various locations and times, including sometimes evenings and weekends. It was entirely up to the students how many and which subjects they studied, and when and where the groups would meet. A group studying Mass Media, for example, would meet in the evening in the Lowther Avenue home of CBC Radio Broadcasters Betty Tomlinson and Allan Anderson. The Vegan Lifestyles cooking course met and cooked in student homes with parents joining to eat the meals prepared by the students. A Japanese Studies group met at the University of Toronto. A few groups met at SEED's own facilities.
SEED was founded by the then Toronto Board of Education as a summer program for high school age students in 1968 during the Pierre Trudeau era, a period that also produced Rochdale College and Theatre Passe Muraille and fostered the growth of Coach House Books and a number of other experimental institutions in Toronto. (SEED was not connected with any of them.) The teachers, or co-ordinators as they were called, in the beginning were Les Birmingham and Murray Shukyn, both of whom came from the elementary school system.
While initially a summer only program, the students of the second summer wanted to keep SEED going throughout the year. That fall the students obtained recognition from the University of Toronto, and requested the Board establish it as a high school to obtain core funding (for staff and space) and so that students could obtain high school diplomas. During that fall and winter, students ran SEED without any coordinators, using an office made available free by St Thomas Anglican Church on Huron Street.
The Board of Education agreed to make SEED a high school, and in September it was a recognized high school, operating in rented space at what was then the YMHA (at Bloor St W and Spadina) in Toronto. Official enrolment was capped at 100 students, with those 100 eligible to earn high school credits/diplomas. Additional students could also attend but not earn high school credits/diplomas. Grades 9 to 13 were included. Students who had gone to SEED but who were officially under the jurisdiction of a nearby Boards of Education, were included as students. A budget of about $200,000 was approved. Murray Shukyn was the first coordinator. To meet the technical requirement of having a principal, and yet minimize costs, the Superintendent of Secondary Schools A. L. Milloy was appointed Principal, but he was not involved at the school. A small core group of four or five teachers was hired, most of whom were certified to teach in more than one high school subject so that students, if they wished, could still take traditional subjects taught by certified teachers that would qualify for a high school diploma.
The students ran the school, often dealing directly with the Board of Education where trustees such as long time trustees Fiona Nelson and Dr. Maurice Lister were supportive.
At the time all Ontario high schools, with one exception, followed part B of the Ministry of Education's regulation HS1. Part B outlined the traditional high school program. SEED was only the second school in the province set up under part A. Part A allowed tremendous flexibility.
It was now possible to get a high school diploma using many different subjects.
The school was influenced by the pedagogical philosophy of A.S. Neill's Summerhill School. It was also known for its catalyst system in which university students, professors, community members and experts-at-large on a variety of fields facilitated classes. Milton van der veen was the catalyst for the SEED newsletter (he is now a volunteer with the charity 'Sleeping Children Around the World'.) Noted late science fiction author Judith Merril ran a weekly science fiction seminar at SEED from 1972-1973. Other notable catalysts included noted social activist June Callwood, CBC Radio broadcaster Allan Anderson, then-architect Colin Vaughan, journalists John Gault and Maggie Siggins, advertising executive Billy Edwards (one of the subjects of Allan King's film "A Married Couple"), and notable Toronto City Alderman Ying Hope. Several U of T professors, such as Milt Wilson of Trinity College, also taught courses.
A notable achievement was a short film made by students Peter Belisis and Robi Blumenstein that was nominated for an Academy Award.
Notable alumni include blogger, journalist, activist and science fiction author Cory Doctorow; former head of the Ontario Securities Commission and V.P. of the Toronto Stock Exchange lawyer Edward Waitzer; musician and producer Efrim Menuck; Harvard physics professor and Chair of the Physics Department Melissa Franklin, a co-discover of one of the kinds of quark; visual artist Eli Langer; author Claudia Casper; gh3 principal and award winning landscape architect, Diana Gerrard; Intersex activist, researcher and professor of sociology at Wilfrid Laurier University Morgan Holmes; and Michael McLuhan, son of Marshall McLuhan is a photographer living and working in Owen Sound.

Maine School Administrative District 15

The Maine School Administrative District 15 is a public school district that operates three elementary schools (K–2 and 3–4), one middle school (5–8) and one high school (9–12) in Cumberland County in the U.S. state of Maine. The school system serves the towns of Gray, Maine and New Gloucester, Maine. The school system is run by a school board and superintendent system.
Gray-New Gloucester High School.
Gray-New Gloucester High School is the single high school in the Maine School Administrative District 15. The school's colors are red, white, and blue. The school mascot is called the Patriot but is actually a redcoat.
In June of 2000, Andy Rooney, the late commentator on the CBS News program "60 Minutes," addressed graduates at a ceremony in Portland. He agreed to be the class' commencement speaker after receiving a letter from students.
The school plays competitively in football, soccer, track, field hockey, basketball, and alpine skiing, among others. The school has a wide variety of academic and co-curricular activities. The school is known for its successful drama department, and plays as the "Gray-New Gloucester Patriot Players." In 2009, the school's Destination ImagiNation team placed first in their category at the state competition, moving them on to the global competition. The school's math team, Pi-Cone Math, is also highly acclaimed, holding the place for 27th in the state. 
The high school is currently a pilot school in Maine's effort to revolutionize its public school systems, and a national choice school for demonstrating the effectiveness of the RISC program.
After gaining membership with RISC, the school and the district as a whole have been advancing toward standards-based learning, where students have been more free to move at their own pace, and only advancing in areas of study after demonstrating proficiency and meeting an agreed-upon learning standard. The high school is also a participant in Advanced Placement learning programs, and may award either a diploma or International Baccalaureate diploma, if the student is capable of mastering the provided IB curricula.

Friedrich Minoux

Friedrich Minoux (March 21, 1877 in Mutterstadt – October 16, 1945 in Berlin) was a German industrialist and financier who is best known for being one of the owners of the Wannsee House, where the namesake conference that would decide the fate of millions at the hands of the Nazis during World War II was held in early 1942.
Early life.
Born in the Pfalz region to Michael and Margaretha ("née" Reffert) Minoux, Friedrich Minoux attended Gymnasien in Speyer and Mannheim as was customary for boys at the time. After fulfilling his military obligations in 1893, he married Maria Karoline Hente, and took a job at the Essen Gas and Water Works company, where he would rise to the position of Financial Vice President. In 1912, Minoux became an employee of Hugo Stinnes, a prominent German industrialist of the time.
Minoux achieved considerable financial success while working for Stinnes, at one point earning as much as 350,000 gold marks per year — a substantial sum at the time. In 1919 Minoux became a member of the board of the "United Citizens of Berlin Coal Dealers AG", and began to diversify his business interests to paper production, automobile manufacturing and coal and steel production. In 1923 Minoux left the Stinnes conglomerate to build his own industrial empire. In 1926 he acquired half of the shares of the "German-Romanian Petroleum Company AG" (Derupag). His main source of income at the time became "The Friedrich Minoux Society for Trade and Industry", which was a coal wholesale business. Minoux was also one of the founders of the "Citizens of Berlin Urban Power Stations AG", an electric company. By 1938, in his last major business deal, Minoux purchased the Jewish-owned "Offenheimer Cellulose and Paper Works" company for less than 1 million reichsmarks. The actual value was more than RM12 million, but by that time Nazi actions against Jewish businesses had intensified, and the owner of the mill was forced to sell to Minoux for a pittance. Throughout those years, Minoux and his wife became notable figures in German political and social circles.
Wansee House and political ambitions.
Minoux opposed the Weimar Republic and maintained contacts with right-wing extremists, military federations, and politicians. In 1931 he became a member of the Society for the Study of Fascism, and two years later he would be elected into the Academy for German Law. In 1921, Minoux purchased the Wannsee House (also called "Wannsee Villa"), which was originally built in the outskirts of Berlin by Ernst Marlier. In 1923, during the height of the economic crisis that would eventually cause the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Third Reich, Minoux offered his assistance to the German Army High Command in exchange for a cabinet-level position in the coming government. His ambitions would not come to fruition. That same year, the army abandoned plans for a putsch against the government, and talks between Minoux and the Nazis eventually collapsed.
On August 15, 1941, Minoux was convicted of defrauding the Berlin Gasworks. At the time this was considered the largest business swindle of the Nazi era. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and hefty fines. From his jail cell in Berlin, Minoux sold Wannsee House to the Stiftung Nordhav, a foundation controlled by Reinhard Heydrich. Subsequently, the property became an important center of operations for the SS Security Service and the Reich Security Main Office. It was there that the Wannsee Conference would eventually be held on January 20, 1942. Today the villa is a museum dedicated to the remembrance of the Holocaust.
Minoux died of starvation a few months after the Allies liberated him from Brandenburg prison in 1945. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Alter Friedhof on Lindenstraße in Wannsee.

Stanley Frederick Gibbs

Stanley Frederick Gibbs GC (2 January 1909 – 3 March 1991) was an Australian recipient of the Albert Medal, formerly the highest decoration for gallantry awarded to civilians or to military personnel for actions "not in the face of the enemy" in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. Gibbs was decorated with the Albert Medal for his rescue of a man during a shark attack in 1927. With the establishment of the George Cross, the Albert Medal was discontinued and, in 1971, living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; Gibbs took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross.
Early life.
Gibbs was born in Hunters Hill, New South Wales, on 2 January 1909. Leaving school, Gibbs later gained employment with the Gas Light Company, based in Sydney.
Albert Medal.
On 3 January 1927, Gibbs was out driving a launch at Port Hacking when he noticed Mervyn Allum struggling in the water. Thinking the youth was drowning, Gibbs made his way to the nose of the launch in order to give assistance to Allum. It was then that Gibbs realised Allum was being attacked by a shark, and he immediately dived into the water. By kicking and punching the shark, Gibbs managed to free Allum from its jaws. With the assistance of another man, Gibbs succeeded in lifting Allum out of the water and into a rowing boat. Due to his injuries, Allum died soon after.
For his actions during the incident, Gibbs was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal. The notification and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in the "London Gazette" on 8 February 1927, reading:
Later life.
In a ceremony at Sydney Town Hall on 28 March 1927, Gibbs was invested with his Albert Medal by the Duke of York. On 9 February 1942, Gibbs enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force at Paddington for service during the Second World War. Allocated to the 35th Battalion as a private, he served in the army until his discharge on 28 December 1944, at which time he returned to his job with the Gas Light Company. In 1948, Gibbs married Doris Mannix.
During 1971, the British Government announced that all living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would in future be treated as recipients of the George Cross, and were invited to exchange their medals for the latter award. As such, those who wished to exchange their insignia were invited to attend an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace to receive their George Crosses. On 12 July 1972, Gibbs was one of five Australian Albert Medal recipients presented with his George Cross by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1974, Gibbs retired from the Gas Light Company. He died in Sydney on 3 March 1991, aged 82.

St Joseph's School, Oamaru

St Joseph's School is a school in Oamaru, the largest town in North Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand. It was established by an order of Catholic nuns — Dominican Sisters — who started teaching in Oamaru in 1882.
History.
In 1884 the first classrooms were in the presbytery - up to five classes were taught there. The school was staffed by Dominican Nuns. Priests visited the school taking an interest both in examinations and in cultural activities such as musical events.
In 1928 the Christian Brothers took over the running of St Patrick's primary school for boys in Oamaru and two Christian Brothers commuted daily from St Kevin's College (founded in 1927). That school continued until a reorganisation in 1973 saw its closure. The younger boys went to St Joseph's while the older boys transferred to St Kevin's College. In 1984 there was a further reorganisation in which the St Joseph's became a full primary school for both boys and girls up to year 8. The red-brick building built for St Patrick's is now used for junior classes of St. Joseph's while the older pupils are taught in newer buildings, closer to St Patrick's Basilica in Reed Street. 
The school continues to maintain its Dominican connection especially with the starting of a "Dominican choir" in 2008. The school remains closely associated with St Kevin's College, and reports that 99% of its pupils go there after they leave St Joseph's.
Current status and activity.
Currently, the school's principal is Mrs. Jenny Jackson. The school lists student leadership as a major strength, reporting that pupils from years 3-8 sit on the school council. The teacher who manages the middle syndicate is Miss Melanie Sloan. She suffers from early onset rheumatoid arthritis and has had her knee and hip joints replaced to relieve the disabling pain which had confined her to a wheelchair. In 2010, she received a "Spirit of Attitude" award for being "an unsung hero who lives life with positivity while facing extreme adversity." She was presented with the supreme award for her positive attitude by minister Nick Smith in Auckland. 
There is a colony of Little Blue Penguins in Oamaru and the students studied these as a research project to develop their essential skills and fulfil level 4 learning objectives in English, Social Studies and Science. This was a "Living Heritage" project of the "2020 Communications Trust" to promote digital literacy and so the main goal of the project was to construct a web site about the penguins. This followed a similar project of bird monitoring performed as part of the Ministry of Education's "LEARNZ" programme.

Blubber Bay

Blubber Bay is an unincorporated settlement on the northern end of Texada Island at the bay of the same name in the northern Gulf of Georgia on the South Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Texada Island is one of the Northern Gulf Islands, and lies across Malaspina Strait from the town of Powell River, British Columbia; Georgia Strait lies along its western shores. It is served by Blubber Bay Airport (code XBB).
History.
Blubber Bay was a whale flensing station in the heyday of whaling on the British Columbia Coast, where whale blubber was sliced up from captured cetaceans. In 1970 there were 35 families living in a small company town owned by Domtar Chemical Company, quarrying limestone for concrete manufacture. Texada's other main community is Van Anda, on the island's east coast, which was an iron mining company town. Blubber Bay was also the site where Captain Cook first contacted the Tla' Amin people.

Norbert Blei

Norbert Blei (August 23, 1935 – April 23, 2013) was an American writer. He wrote 17 books of non-fiction, fiction, poetry and essays. In 1994, he established Cross+Roads Press, dedicated to the publication of first chapbooks by poets, short story writers, novelists and artists.
Biography.
Blei was born in an ethnic (primarily Czechoslovakian) neighborhood of western Chicago, Illinois known as Little Village, in the 26th & Pulaski area. An only child, Blei and his parents moved to the near-western Chicago suburb of Cicero when he was in grade school.
Blei attended Illinois State University, studying English, and graduated in 1956. He taught high school English and subsequently worked at City News Bureau as a reporter. In 1969, Blei left Chicago and moved to Door County, Wisconsin, a rural vacation destination for Midwesterners that sits at the top of the Door Peninsula in the middle of Lake Michigan, 50 miles north of Green Bay. For four decades, he has worked in a converted chicken coop in Ellison Bay, Wisconsin.
Blei's first book was "The Hour of the Sunshine Now: Short Stories by Norbert Blei", published in 1978.
Literary Themes.
A sense of community, and threats to community, are the twin themes of Blei's writing, whether he is writing about urban Chicago or rural Wisconsin:
"Norb specializes in the fleeting look at the little people of the city, the aged newsstand operators, the small restaurant owners, Greek, Bohemian, Slovak, who still provide, in out-of-the-way neighborhoods, national dishes and national atmosphere. And he is determined to get these glimpses of a disappearing Chicago on paper before they are ploughed under to make way for new high-rise apartments, or succumb to the creeping wave of debris, human and material, so characteristic of most large cities these days." (Henry Shea, 1970)
"Thus a profound feeling of loss permeates all of Blei's work. Perhaps Blei's own sense of himself as an isolated, alienated writer—a consistent self-portrait, across geographies and through years of economic and literary success and failure, prominence and reduced visibility—derives from his sense of doomed place, or, more properly, doomed community in place. Whether author imposes his vision on place (others in Cicero and Door County have found more to cheer about over the past thirty years), or place imposes itself on author, the result is an author celebrating the forgotten, the beat and defeated: others and himself." (David Pichaske, 2000)

Cross+Roads Press.
In the early 1990s, Blei started Cross+Roads Press to offer established and beginning writers an opportunity to be published in chapbook form. To date, works by almost 40 writers have been published, including Mariann Ritzer, Pedro Villarreal, DyAnne Korda, Donna Balfe, Emily Rose, Phil Bryant, Michael Koehler, Jackie Langetieg, Paul Schroeder, Tom Montag, Don Skiles, Albert DeGenova, Charles Rossiter and Dave Etter.
The Clearing.
For over 30 years, Blei was writer-in-residence at The Clearing, a folk arts school founded in 1935 by landscape architect Jens Jensen. The Clearing describes itself in this manner: "The Mission of The Clearing is to provide diverse educational experiences in the folk school tradition, in a setting of quiet forests, meadows and water...a place where adults who share an interest in nature, arts or humanities can learn, reflect and wonder...in keeping with the goals of Jens Jensen...who loved it as a special place where one could feel kinship with the earth and reassess one's life." Blei's annual June writing classes drew developing writers from across the country. Since 2007, Blei has independently conducted his annual writing classes.
Visual arts.
Blei has always had a close affinity with painting as a watercolor artist, but a trip to Berlin in the then-West Germany in the early 1980s provoked an especially fertile time, as he created an entire series of works based on the experience. The "Die Mauer" paintings focused on the Berlin Wall and were exhibited in Santa Fe, among other locations.
Controversy.
Reminiscent of Hunter S. Thompson's proposals for Aspen, Colorado during his candidacy for sheriff in 1970, Blei fomented local controversy, and even rage, when he outlined a new vision for Door County, Wisconsin in an article in the area's weekly newspaper, the Door Reminder (later reprinted in Chronicles of a Rural Journalist). Titled 'Shut the Damn Door,' and first published in 1992, the area's residents were sharply divided on the proposal, as recounted in an essay by Blei's publisher at Ellis Press, David Pichaske: "Blei outlined a Master Plan for the Future of Door County loosely based on the 'Industrial Tourism' chapter of Ed Abbey's Desert Solitaire. Blei suggests that county officials freeze all building, property sales, and residential, commercial and public planning in the County; turn the entire County over to Nature Conservancy; close the new bridge at Sturgeon Bay and make an outdoor walking mall of it, with artsy-craftsy shops, a Ferris wheel, and Chicago style food vendors; admit tourists freely across the old bridge May through October, subject to a tax of $50 per vehicle per week and $25 per person per day, but from November through April by visa only; tear up all highways and back roads and return them to their natural state of dirt, gravel, good Door County earth; place a moratorium on new road construction in the County; encourage vandalism of commercial signs while instituting a $3,000 fine for anyone caught erecting new advertisements or newspaper mail boxes; tear up 'ugly metal road signs' and either replace them with wooden ones or leave the roads nameless. 'Take any dirt road and get lost,' Blei concludes. 'You may discover the real value of this place. You may discover yourself.'"
Current Writing Projects.
As of March 2009, Blei was reportedly working on a number of writing projects for publication in late 2009, including the fourth book in his series of non-fiction Door County profiles, and a new novel, his first since 1982.
One of Blei's most eclectic, and yet global projects was his collaboration with the pseudonymous Monsieur K, located in France, who in the space of a half dozen years has created an assortment of web sites for posting of writings by those artists judged to abide by the spirit of 'free jazz.' Blei regularly provided Monsieur K with commentary on significant artistic events for the Metropolis site (http://www.m-etropolis.com/wordpress/en/, e.g. the death of Marcel Marceau), poetry and other material for the Basho's Road site (most recently a haiku translated into Russian and originally posted at http://www.wowwi.orc.ru/), and a wide variety of artistic profiles and critiques for Poetry Dispatch & Other Notes from the Underground (an April 2009 posting on the topic of "Wyeth & Peterson: some thoughts on the painter and his setting, in memory of Andrew Wyeth (1917-2009)—Maine & Pennsylvania, in praise of Charles Peterson—Door County, Wisconsin" (http://poetrydispatch.wordpress.com/). Cumulatively, his writings on these various sites have recently reached a total of almost 100,000 unique visits.

Sheriff of Cochise

Sheriff of Cochise (later renamed United States Marshal in the third and fourth seasons) is a Western-themed crime drama set in the U.S. state of Arizona. Starring John Bromfield, the series aired eighty-three episodes in syndication from September 1956 to January 1958, a large number of segments for such a short time frame. As "U.S. Marshal", another sixty episodes aired from October 1958 to April 1960.
Synopsis.
Bromfield portrays law enforcement officer Frank Morgan. In the first two seasons, Morgan is the sheriff of Cochise County in southern Arizona. In the third season, Desilu Studios boss Desi Arnaz, Sr., retitled the series so that Morgan would work throughout Arizona as a U.S. Marshal and be involved in a greater number of cases. The first season episodes were later released under the alternative title, "Man from Cochise". This program was produced by Desilu in association with National Telefilm Associates.
Stan Jones, author of the classic western song "Ghost Riders in the Sky", created the series and played Bromfield's top deputy, Harry Olson, in twenty-four episodes before he left the cast. In the first season, Frank Ferguson of the "My Friend Flicka" series appeared twice as Deputy Henry Murdock; also cast as deputies were Roy Engel, James Griffith, and Forrest Lewis.
"Sheriff of Cochise" has been loosely compared to another contemporary crime drama, "Highway Patrol", starring Broderick Crawford. It is also similar in theme and setting to Rod Cameron's syndicated "State Trooper".
"The Witnesses" (January 16, 1958) is the transitional episode leading to "U.S. Marshal". In the story line, Sheriff Morgan transfers federal witnesses from Cochise County to the U.S. Marshal's office in Tucson. The criminal element tries to gun down the witnesses, and the current marshal is mortally wounded. Morgan is then appointed as the new marshal. The episode features Joe De Santis, Chris Alcaide, and Roy Barcroft.
Production notes.
The series was filmed about Bisbee, the county seat of Cochise County in the southeastern corner of Arizona.

Runwell Hospital

Runwell Hospital was a hospital in Essex operated by South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust until its final closure on 23 April 2010. From February 2008 until its closure, Runwell Hospital provided solely forensic mental health services in line with the trust's reprovision programme. The closure has led to some services being reprovided at Rochford Hospital.
Runwell Hospital was approximately 30 miles (50 km) east of London and could be reached via the road network, or by train (taking about 40 minutes). Runwell Hospital fell within the District of Chelmsford along with Springfield and South Woodham Ferrers.
History.
Following the ending of contracts accommodating patients at the Essex County Council's Brentwood mental hospital, joint facilities were developed between East Ham and Southend-on-Sea boroughs. A site was chosen at Runwell Hall Farm, to the east of the town of Wickford and the firm of Elcock and Sutcliffe were chosen as architects to the site, the former having previously designed the new Bethlem Royal Hospital at Monks Orchard. Elcock and Sutcliffe were at the forefront of institutional design and when completed, Runwell was seen as being pioneering development in mental hospital compared to its contemporaries. The hospital opened in June 1937.
The hospital was divided into specific zones according to purpose and type of patient. Staff housing was located close to or outside of the main entrance, with the most senior residences and nurse's home located on the main drive. The chapel, dedicated to St. Luke was placed at the principal junction at the top of the drive - to its east lay admission, research, treatment convalescence and neurosis blocks. The main buildings were laid out to the west: villas for working patients, pavilions for the infirm, administrative buildings, recreation hall, kitchens, and stores blocks providing segregation of male and female blocks. Workshops were provided on either side for the employment of capable patients. To the rear a combined power house and water tower provided a central focal point, with the laundry constructed on the female side. Parole villas were built at the northernmost areas behind the main ranges, providing a degree of freedom to suitable occupants. A large sick hospital was provided directly opposite the administrative block, combining wards for physically sick patients, those with tuberculosis, an operating theatre and staff sick bay. Finally, farthest west, Boundary House, a large block for disruptive chronic patients was built, providing two male wards, four female wards and a separate dining hall. The former farm was relocated to the north of the main site.
Unlike others of its kind, Runwell utilised names for all villas and wards from the start, instead of numbers and letters used elsewhere until the 1960s and 70's, giving each structure a more homely identity. White with grey brick banding, rendering and variation between flat and pitched roofs were used to identify buildings and prevent a bland functional appearance overall by providing variety.
Following World War II, Runwell came under the control of the National Health Service, who continued pioneering research work at the hospital. New developments included the Strom Olsen ward, adjacent to the female admission unit, and named after a former superintendent, and a combined occupational therapy and research laboratory block. Investigations under Professor Corsellis led to the development of a 'brain bank', the largest of its kind and instrumental in researching changes to the brain in mental illness and subnormality.
Under sectorisation and realignment of catchment areas, Runwell's historical role in providing for East Ham diminished and services were became concentrated on the south east Essex area, resulting in strong links with mental health services at Southend Municipal Hospital, later Rochford Hospital. With the threat of closure and development of Care in the Community, services were streamlined between Runwell and Rochford sites, the laboratories and peripheral buildings closing.
Since Closure.
It was announced on Tuesday 27 April 2009 in Parliament by the Jack Straw, Ministry of Justice, that the Runwell Hospital site had been earmarked for a new 1,500-inmate male prison but the plan was formally withdrawn following a Ministry of Justice spending review in December 2010.
In February 2012, the Homes & Communities Agency (H.C.A.) announced plans to construct around 600 new homes on the site.
Demolition started in July 2012 and the only buildings to remain will be: the administration building (front part with clock tower), the water tower, and the Grade 2 Listed Chapel of Saint Luke.

Typhoon Olive (1952)

Typhoon Olive (international designation: 5213) was the strongest Pacific typhoon in 1952. The thirteenth tropical storm and the ninth typhoon of the season, it developed about 1,600 miles (1,580 km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii on September 13. The next day, the system attained tropical storm intensity. Beginning to rapidly intensify, Olive attained typhoon intensity on September 15. Olive reached Category 5 intensity on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale on September 16.
Olive produced significant damage on Wake Island, where wind gusts reached 142 mph (229 km/h). Significant flooding was reported, and the majority of the structures were completely destroyed. However, few injuries were reported, and the island's facilities were restored in 1953. Typhoon Olive remains one of the most intense tropical cyclones to affect the island.
Meteorological history.
On September 8, an area of disturbed weather, located near 12.0°N 169.0°W, was plotted as a tropical wave on surface weather maps. Operationally, however, the system was not classified as a tropical storm until September 15; however, postseason analysis determined that the system acquired tropical storm intensity on 0000 UTC on September 15. Tropical Storm Olive, moving west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), turned toward Wake Island on September 15. Around 1800 UTC Olive was upgraded into typhoon, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Continuing to intensify, Olive passed near Wake Island, where maximum sustained winds of 127 mph (204 km/h) were recorded. Around this time, reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum central pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.90 inHg). On September 16, Olive intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 typhoon, attained the equivalence of super typhoon intensity, and strengthened to a peak intensity of 185 mph (295 km/h) the following day far from land. On September 18, Olive weakened from a Category 5 to a Category 2 typhoon and recurved northeast. On September 19, the cyclone lost typhoon intensity. Tropical Storm Olive transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was last monitored on September 21.
Preparations and impact.
On Wake Island, 750 people sheltered in World War II bunkers. Olive, the second typhoon to affect the island since 1935, produced sustained wind speeds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and peak gusts of 142 mph (229 km/h) on the island. Significant flooding was also recorded. Damage was severe; it is estimated that 85% of the island's structures were demolished due to the storm. All of the homes and the island's hotel were destroyed. Additionally, the island's chapel and quonset huts were completely destroyed. The island's LORAN station, operated by the United States Coast Guard, was also destroyed. On September 18, water and power services were restored. The facilities on the island were fully restored in 1953. The total cost to repair damages caused by Olive amounted to $1.6 million (1952 USD; $13 million 2009 USD). No fatalities occurred on the island, and four injuries were reported. None of the 230 Pan American World Airways employees received injuries.

USS Mundelta (ID-1301)

USS "Mundelta" (ID-1301) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
"Mundelta" was built as the commercial cargo ship SS "Mundelta" in 1917 at Newport News, Virginia, by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for the Munson Steamship Company of New York City. She was delivered to the Munson Line on 18 April 1918, but the U.S. Navy acquired her for World War I service from Munson on 20 April 1918. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 1301, she was commissioned at New York City on 20 April 1918 or 27 April 1918 as USS "Mundelta" with Lieutenant Commander Nils A. Nilsen, USNRF, in command.
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, "Mundelta" departed New York City in convoy on 8 May 1918, docking at Le Havre, France, on 20 May 1918 to debark United States Army supplies. On 20 June 1918 she steamed for New York. At New York she loaded mixed cargo for the first of three transatlantic voyages to Bordeaux, France, the last of which she completed at New York on 26 December 1918. In January 1919 she took a load of coal from Norfolk, Virginia, to Havana, Cuba. She then moved to Mobile, Alabama, and finally to New Orleans, Louisiana.
At New Orleans on 11 February 1919, "Mundelta" simultaneously was decommissioned, transferred to the United States Shipping Board, and returned to the Munson Steamship Company.
Once again SS "Mundelta", she operated for the Munson Line in commercial service until 1937, when she was sold to a British firm at Shanghai, China, and renamed SS "Munlock". Seized by Japan in China at the beginning of World War II in December 1941, she was placed in Japanese service as "Rizan Maru". The U.S. Navy submarine USS "Searaven" (SS-196) torpedoed and sank "Rizan Maru" in the North Pacific Ocean on 21 September 1944.

Hollywood blacklist

The Hollywood blacklist—as the broader entertainment industry blacklist is generally known—was the mid-20th-century practice of denying employment to screenwriters, actors, directors, musicians, and other U.S. entertainment professionals because of their suspected political beliefs or associations. Artists were barred from work on the basis of their alleged membership in or sympathy with the American Communist Party, involvement in progressive political causes that enforcers of the blacklist associated with communism, and refusal to assist investigations into Communist Party activities. Even during the period of its strictest enforcement, the late 1940s through the late 1950s, the blacklist was rarely made explicit or verifiable, but it directly damaged the careers of scores of individuals working in the film industry.
The first systematic Hollywood blacklist was instituted on November 25, 1947, the day after ten writers and directors were cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to testify to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. A group of studio executives, acting under the aegis of the Motion Picture Association of America, fired the artists—the so-called Hollywood Ten—and made what has become known as the Waldorf Statement.
On June 22, 1950, a pamphlet entitled "Red Channels" was published. Focused on the field of broadcasting, it identified 151 entertainment industry professionals in the context of "Red Fascists and their sympathizers." Soon most of those named, along with a host of other artists, were barred from employment in most of the entertainment field.
The blacklist lasted until 1960, when Dalton Trumbo, an unrepentant communist and member of the Hollywood Ten, was publicly acknowledged by actor Kirk Douglas as the screenwriter of his highly successful film "Spartacus." A number of those blacklisted, however, were barred from work in their professions for years afterward.
Overview.
Historical background.
The Hollywood blacklist was rooted in events of the 1930s and the early 1940s, encompassing the height of the Great Depression and World War II. Two major film industry strikes during the 1930s increased tensions between the Hollywood producers and the unions, particularly the Screen Writers Guild.
The American Communist Party lost substantial support after the Moscow show trials of 1936–38 and the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of 1939. The U.S. government began turning its attention to the possible links between Hollywood and the party during this period. Under then chairman Martin Dies, Jr., the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) released a report in 1938 claiming that communism was pervasive in Hollywood. Two years later, Dies privately took testimony from a former Communist Party member, John L. Leech, who named forty-two movie industry professionals as Communists. After Leech repeated his charges in supposed confidence to a Los Angeles grand jury, many of the names were reported in the press, including those of stars Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Katharine Hepburn, Melvyn Douglas and Fredric March, among other well-known Hollywood figures. Dies said he would "clear" all those who cooperated by meeting with him in what he called "executive session". Within two weeks of the grand jury leak, all those on the list except for actress Jean Muir had met with the HUAC chairman. Dies "cleared" everyone except actor Lionel Stander, who was fired by the movie studio, Republic Pictures, where he was contracted.
In 1941, producer Walt Disney took out an ad in "Variety", the industry trade magazine, declaring his conviction that "Communist agitation" was behind a cartoonists and animators' strike. According to historians Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund, "In actuality, the strike had resulted from Disney's overbearing paternalism, high-handedness, and insensitivity." Inspired by Disney, California State Senator Jack Tenney, chairman of the state legislature's Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, launched an investigation of "Reds in movies". The probe fell flat, and was mocked in several "Variety" headlines.
The subsequent wartime alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the American Communist Party newfound credibility. During the war, membership in the party reached a peak of 50,000. As World War II drew to a close, perceptions changed again, with communism increasingly becoming a focus of American fears and hatred. In 1945, Gerald L. K. Smith, founder of the neofascist America First Party, began giving speeches in Los Angeles assailing the "alien minded Russian Jews in Hollywood". Mississippi congressman John E. Rankin, a member of HUAC, held a press conference to declare that "one of the most dangerous plots ever instigated for the overthrow of this Government has its headquarters in Hollywood ... the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States." Rankin promised, "We're on the trail of the tarantula now". Reports of Soviet repression in Eastern and Central Europe in the war's aftermath added more fuel to what became known as the "Second Red Scare". The growth of conservative political influence and the Republican triumph in the 1946 Congressional elections, which saw the party take control of both the House and Senate, led to a major revival of institutional anticommunist activity, publicly spearheaded by HUAC. The following year, the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA), a political action group cofounded by Walt Disney, issued a pamphlet advising producers on the avoidance of "subtle communistic touches" in their films. Its counsel revolved around a list of ideological prohibitions, such as "Don't smear the free-enterprise system ... Don't smear industrialists ... Don't smear wealth ... Don't smear the profit motive ... Don't deify the 'common man'... Don't glorify the collective".
The blacklist begins (1946–1947).
On July 29, 1946, William R. Wilkerson, publisher and founder of "The Hollywood Reporter", published a "TradeView" column entitled "A Vote For Joe Stalin". It named as Communist sympathizers Dalton Trumbo, Maurice Rapf, Lester Cole, Howard Koch, Harold Buchman, John Wexley, Ring Lardner Jr., Harold Salemson, Henry Meyers, Theodore Strauss, and John Howard Lawson. In August and September 1946, Wilkerson published other columns containing names of numerous purported Communists and sympathizers. They became known as "Billy's List" and "Billy's Blacklist."
In 2012, in a 65th anniversary article, Wilkerson's son apologized for the newspaper's role in the blacklist. He said that his father was motivated by revenge for his own thwarted ambition to own a studio.
In October 1947, drawing upon the list named in the "Hollywood Reporter", the House Committee on Un-American Activities subpoenaed a number of persons working in the Hollywood film industry to testify at hearings. It had declared its intention to investigate whether Communist agents and sympathizers had been planting propaganda in U.S. films.
The hearings opened with appearances by Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, then president of the Screen Actors Guild. Disney testified that the threat of Communists in the film industry was a serious one. In his testimony before the HUAC, Reagan named several members of his union as communist sympathizers. (Later his first wife, actress Jane Wyman stated in her biography with Joe Morella (1985) that Reagan's allegations against friends and colleagues led to tension in their marriage eventually resulting in their divorce.) Actor Adolphe Menjou declared, "I am a witch hunter if the witches are Communists. I am a Red-baiter. I would like to see them all back in Russia."
In contrast, several leading Hollywood figures, including director John Huston and actors Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Danny Kaye, organized the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the government's targeting of the film industry. The group came under attack as being naive or foolish. Under pressure from his studio, Warner Brothers, to distance himself from the Hollywood Ten, Bogart negotiated a statement that did not denounce the committee, but said that his trip was “ill-advised, even foolish.” At a Committee for the First Amendment meeting, Bogart shouted at Danny Kaye, “You fuckers sold me out.” Billy Wilder told the group that “we oughta fold.”
Many of the film industry professionals in whom HUAC had expressed interest—primarily screenwriters, but also actors, directors, producers, and others—were either known or alleged to have been members of the American Communist Party. Of the 43 people put on the witness list, 19 declared that they would not give evidence. Eleven of these nineteen were called before the committee. Members of the Committee for the First Amendment flew to Washington ahead of this climactic phase of the hearing, which commenced on Monday, October 27. Of the eleven "unfriendly witnesses", one, émigré playwright Bertolt Brecht ultimately chose to answer the committee's questions.
The other ten refused, citing their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The crucial question they refused to answer is now generally rendered as "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?" Each had at one time or another been a member, as many intellectuals during the Great Depression felt that the Party offered an alternative to capitalism. Some still were members, others had been active in the past and only briefly. The Committee formally accused these ten of contempt of Congress and began criminal proceedings against them in the full House of Representatives.
In light of the "Hollywood Ten"'s defiance of HUAC—in addition to refusing to testify, many had tried to read statements decrying the committee's investigation as unconstitutional—political pressure mounted on the film industry to demonstrate its "anti-subversive" bona fides. Late in the hearings, Eric Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), declared to the committee that he would never "employ any proven or admitted Communist because they are just a disruptive force and I don't want them around." On November 17, the Screen Actors Guild voted to make its officers swear a pledge asserting each was not a Communist.
The following week, on November 24, the House of Representatives voted 346 to 17 to approve citations against the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress. The next day, following a meeting of film industry executives at New York's Waldorf-Astoria hotel, MPAA president Johnston issued a press release that is today referred to as the Waldorf Statement. Their statement said that the ten would be fired or suspended without pay and not reemployed until they were cleared of contempt charges and had sworn that they were not Communists. The first Hollywood blacklist was in effect.
The list grows (1948–50).
The HUAC hearings had failed to turn up any evidence that Hollywood was secretly disseminating Communist propaganda, but the industry was nonetheless transformed. The fallout from the inquiry was a factor in the decision by Floyd Odlum, the primary owner of RKO Pictures, to get out of the business. As a result, the studio would pass into the hands of Howard Hughes. Within weeks of taking over in May 1948, Hughes fired most of RKO's employees and virtually shut the studio down for six months as he had the political sympathies of the rest investigated. Then, just as RKO swung back into production, Hughes made the decision to settle a long-standing federal antitrust suit against the industry's Big Five studios. This would be one of the crucial steps in the collapse of the studio system that had governed Hollywood, and ruled much of world cinema, for a quarter-century.
In early 1948, as well, all of the Hollywood Ten were convicted of contempt. Following a series of unsuccessful appeals, the cases arrived before the Supreme Court; among the submissions filed in defense of the ten was an amicus curiae brief signed by 204 Hollywood professionals. After the court denied review, the Hollywood Ten began serving one-year prison sentences in 1950. In September 1950, one of the ten, director Edward Dmytryk, publicly announced that he had once been a Communist and was prepared to give evidence against others who had been as well. He was released early from jail; following his 1951 HUAC appearance, in which he described his brief membership in the party and named names, his career recovered.
The others remained silent and most were unable to obtain work in the American film and television industry for many years. Adrian Scott, who had produced four of Dmytryk's films—"Murder, My Sweet"; "Cornered"; "So Well Remembered"; and "Crossfire"—was one of those named by his former friend. Scott's next screen credit would not come until 1972 and he would never produce another feature film. Some of those blacklisted continued to write for Hollywood or the broadcasting industry surreptitiously, using pseudonyms or the names of friends who posed as the actual writers (those who allowed their names to be used in this fashion were called "fronts"). Of the 204 who signed the amicus brief, 84 would be blacklisted themselves. There was a more general chilling effect: Humphrey Bogart, who had been one of the most prominent members of the Committee for the First Amendment, felt compelled to write an article for "Photoplay" magazine denying he was a Communist sympathizer. The Tenney Committee, which had continued its state-level investigations, summoned songwriter Ira Gershwin to testify about his participation in the committee.
A number of nongovernmental organizations participated in enforcing and expanding the blacklist; in particular, the American Legion, the conservative war veterans' group, was instrumental in pressuring the entertainment industry to exclude those of political sympathies it disagreed with. In 1949, the Americanism Division of the Legion issued its own blacklist—a roster of 128 people whom it claimed were participants in the "Communist Conspiracy." Among the names on the Legion's list was that of well-known playwright Lillian Hellman. Hellman had written or contributed to the screenplays of approximately ten motion pictures up to that point; she would not be employed again by a Hollywood studio until 1966.
Another influential group was American Business Consultants Inc., founded in 1947. In the subscription information for its weekly publication "Counterattack", "The Newsletter of Facts to Combat Communism", it declared that it was run by "a group of "former" FBI men. It has no affiliation whatsoever with any government agency." Notwithstanding that claim, it seems the editors of "Counterattack" had direct access to the files of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and HUAC; the results of that access became widely apparent with the June 1950 publication of "Red Channels". This "Counterattack" spinoff listed 151 people in entertainment and broadcast journalism, along with records of their involvement in what the pamphlet meant to be taken as Communist or pro-Communist activities. A few of those named, such as Hellman, were already being denied employment in the motion picture, TV, and radio fields; the publication of "Red Channels" meant that scores more would be placed on the blacklist. That year, CBS instituted a loyalty oath which it required of all its employees.
Jean Muir was the first performer to lose employment because of a listing in "Red Channels". In 1950 Muir was named as a Communist sympathizer in the pamphlet, and was immediately removed from the cast of the television sitcom "The Aldrich Family", in which she had been cast as Mrs. Aldrich. NBC had received between 20 and 30 phone calls protesting her being in the show. General Motors, the sponsor, said that it would not sponsor programs in which "controversial persons" were featured. Though the company later received thousands of calls protesting the decision, it was not reversed.
HUAC returns (1951–52).
In 1951, with the U.S. Congress now under Democratic control, HUAC launched a second investigation of Hollywood and Communism. As actor Larry Parks said when called before the panel,
Don't present me with the choice of either being in contempt of this committee and going to jail or forcing me to really crawl through the mud to be an informer. For what purpose? I don't think it is a choice at all. I don't think this is really sportsmanlike. I don't think this is American. I don't think this is American justice.
Parks ultimately testified, becoming however reluctantly, a "friendly witness", and found himself blacklisted, nonetheless.
In fact, the legal tactics of those refusing to testify had changed by this time; instead of relying on the First Amendment, they invoked the Fifth Amendment's shield against self-incrimination (though, as before, Communist Party membership was not illegal). While this usually allowed a witness to avoid "naming names" without being indicted for contempt of Congress, "taking the Fifth" before HUAC guaranteed that one would be added to the industry blacklist. Historians at times distinguish between the relatively official blacklist—the names of those who (a) were called by HUAC and, in whatever manner, refused to cooperate and/or (b) were identified as Communists in the hearings—and the so-called graylist—those others who were denied work because of their political or personal affiliations, real or imagined; the consequences, however, were largely the same. The graylist also refers more specifically to those who were denied work by the major studios but could still find jobs on Poverty Row: Composer Elmer Bernstein, for instance, was called by HUAC when it was discovered that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to name names, pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as "Cat Women of the Moon".
Like Parks and Dmytryk, others also cooperated with the committee. Some friendly witnesses gave broadly damaging testimony with less apparent reluctance, most prominently director Elia Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg. Their cooperation in describing the political leanings of their friends and professional associates effectively brought a halt to dozens of careers and compelled a number of artists to depart for Mexico or Europe. Others were also forced abroad in order to work. Director Jules Dassin was among the best known of these. Briefly a Communist, Dassin had left the party in 1939. He was immediately blacklisted after Edward Dmytryk and fellow filmmaker Frank Tuttle named him to HUAC in 1952. Dassin left for France, and spent much of his remaining career in Greece. Scholar Thomas Doherty describes how the HUAC hearings swept onto the blacklist those who had never even been particularly active politically, let alone suspected of being Communists:
n March 21, 1951, the name of the actor Lionel Stander was uttered by the actor Larry Parks during testimony before HUAC. "Do you know Lionel Stander?" committee counsel Frank S. Tavenner inquired. Parks replied he knew the man, but had no knowledge of his political affiliations. No more was said about Stander either by Parks or the committee—no accusation, no insinuation. Yet Stander's phone stopped ringing. Prior to Parks's testimony, Stander had worked on ten television shows in the previous 100 days. Afterwards, nothing.
When Stander was himself called before HUAC, he began by pledging his full support in the fight against "subversive" activities:
I know of a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States by depriving artists and others of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness without due process of law ... I can tell names and cite instances and I am one of the first victims of it ... is a group of ex-Fascists and America-Firsters and anti-Semites, people who hate everybody including Negroes, minority groups and most likely themselves ... hese people are engaged in a conspiracy outside all the legal processes to undermine the very fundamental American concepts upon which our entire system of democracy exists.
Stander was clearly speaking of the committee itself.
The hunt for subversives extended into every branch of the entertainment industry. In the field of animation, two studios in particularly were affected: United Productions of America (UPA) was purged of a large portion of its staff, while New York–based Tempo was entirely crushed. The HUAC investigation also effectively destroyed families. Screenwriter Richard Collins, after a brief period on the blacklist, became a friendly witness and dumped his wife, actress Dorothy Comingore, who refused to name names. Divorcing Comingore, Collins took the couple's young son, as well. The family's story was later dramatized in the film "Guilty by Suspicion" (1991), in which the character based on Comingore "commits suicide rather than endure a long mental collapse." In real life, Comingore succumbed to alcoholism and died of a pulmonary disease at the age of fifty-eight. In the description of historians Paul Buhle and David Wagner, "premature strokes and heart attacks were fairly common blacklistees, along with heavy drinking as a form of suicide on the installment plan."
For all that, evidence that Communists were actually using Hollywood films as vehicles for subversion remained hard to come by. Schulberg reported that the manuscript of his novel "What Makes Sammy Run?" (later a screenplay, as well) had been subject to an ideological critique by Hollywood Ten writer John Howard Lawson, whose comments he had solicited. The significance of such interactions was questionable. As historian Gerald Horne describes, many Hollywood screenwriters had joined or associated with the local Communist Party chapter because it "offered a collective to a profession that was enmeshed in tremendous isolation at the typewriter. Their 'Writers' Clinic' had 'an informal "board" of respected screenwriters'—including Lawson and Ring Lardner Jr.—'who read and commented upon any screenplay submitted to them. Although their criticism could be plentiful, stinging, and (sometimes) politically dogmatic, the author was entirely free to accept it or reject it as he or she pleased without incurring the slightest "consequence" or sanction.'" Much of the onscreen evidence of Communist influence uncovered by HUAC was feeble at best. One witness remembered Stander, while performing in a film, whistling the left-wing "Internationale" as his character waited for an elevator. "Another noted that screenwriter Lester Cole had inserted lines from a famous pro-Loyalist speech by La Pasionaria about it being 'better to die on your feet than to live on your knees' into a pep talk delivered by a football coach."
Hollywood communists may have blocked production of some films. The scholar Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley found that Trumbo wrote in "The Daily Worker" about films which he said communist influence in Hollywood had prevented from being made: among them were proposed adaptations of Arthur Koestler's anti-totalitarian works "Darkness at Noon" and "The Yogi and the Commissar", which described the rise of communism in Russia.
The blacklist at its height (1952–56).
In 1952, the Screen Writers Guild—which had been founded two decades before by three future members of the Hollywood Ten—authorized the movie studios to "omit from the screen" the names of any individuals who had failed to clear themselves before Congress. Writer Dalton Trumbo, for instance, one of the Hollywood Ten and still very much on the blacklist, had received screen credit in 1950 for writing, years earlier, the story on which the screenplay of Columbia Pictures' "Emergency Wedding" was based. There would be no more of that until the 1960s. The name of Albert Maltz, who had written the original screenplay for "The Robe" in the mid-1940s, was nowhere to be seen when the movie was released in 1953.
As William O'Neill describes, pressure was maintained even on those who had ostensibly "cleared" themselves:
On December 27, 1952, the American Legion announced that it disapproved of a new film, "Moulin Rouge", starring José Ferrer, who used to be no more progressive than hundreds of other actors and had already been grilled by HUAC. The picture itself was based on the life of Toulouse-Lautrec and was totally apolitical. Nine members of the Legion had picketed it anyway, giving rise to the controversy. By this time people were not taking any chances. Ferrer immediately wired the Legion's national commander that he would be glad to join the veterans in their "fight against communism."
The group's efforts dragged many others onto the blacklist: In 1954, "creenwriter Louis Pollock, a man without any known political views or associations, suddenly had his career yanked out from under him because the American Legion confused him with Louis Pollack, a California clothier, who had refused to cooperate with HUAC."
During this same period, a number of influential newspaper columnists covering the entertainment industry, including Walter Winchell, Hedda Hopper, Victor Riesel, Jack O'Brian, and George Sokolsky, regularly offered up names with the suggestion that they should be added to the blacklist. Actor John Ireland received an out-of-court settlement to end a 1954 lawsuit against the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, which had ordered him dropped from the lead role in a television series it sponsored. "Variety" described it as "the first industry admission of what has for some time been an open secret—that the threat of being labeled a political nonconformist, or worse, has been used against show business personalities and that a screening system is at work determining thesp [actors'] availabilities for roles."
The Hollywood blacklist had long gone hand in hand with the Red-baiting activities of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Adversaries of HUAC such as lawyer Bartley Crum, who defended some of the Hollywood Ten in front of the committee in 1947, were labeled as Communist sympathizers or subversives and targeted for investigation themselves. Throughout the 1950s, the FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and placed him under continuous surveillance. As a result, he lost most of his clients and, unable to cope with the stress of ceaseless harassment, committed suicide in 1959. Intimidating and dividing the left is now seen as a central purpose of the HUAC hearings. Fund-raising for once-popular humanitarian efforts became difficult, and despite the sympathies of many in the industry there was little open support in Hollywood for causes such as the African American Civil Rights Movement and opposition to nuclear weapons testing.
The struggles attending the blacklist were played out metaphorically on the big screen in various ways. As described by film historian James Chapman, "Carl Foreman, who had refused to testify before the committee, wrote the western "High Noon" (1952), in which a town marshal (ironically played by friendly witness Gary Cooper ...) finds himself deserted by the good citizens of Hadleyville (for which read Hollywood) when a gang of outlaws who had terrorized the town several years earlier (for which read HUAC) returns." Cooper's lawman cleaned up Hadleyville, but Foreman was forced to leave for Europe to find work. Even more famously, Kazan and Schulberg collaborated on a movie widely seen as justifying their decision to name names. "On the Waterfront" (1954) became one of the most honored films in Hollywood history, winning eight Academy Awards, including Oscars for Best Film, Kazan's direction, and Schulberg's screenplay. The film featured Lee J. Cobb, one of the best known actors to name names. "Time Out Film Guide" argues that the film is "undermined" by its "embarrassing special pleading on behalf of informers."
After his release from prison, Herbert Biberman of the Hollywood Ten directed "Salt of the Earth", working independently in New Mexico with fellow blacklisted Hollywood professionals—producer Paul Jarrico, writer Michael Wilson, and actors Rosaura Revueltas and Will Geer. The film, concerning a strike by Mexican-American mine workers, was denounced as Communist propaganda when it was completed in 1953. Distributors boycotted it, newspapers and radio stations rejected advertisements for it, and the projectionists' union refused to run it. Nationwide in 1954, only around a dozen theaters exhibited it.
Breaking the blacklist (1957–present).
A key figure in bringing an end to blacklisting was John Henry Faulk. Host of an afternoon comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of Communist sympathies and "disloyalty." Marked by the group as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost alone among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957. Though the case would drag through the courts for years, the suit itself was an important symbol of the building resistance to the blacklist.
The initial cracks in the entertainment industry blacklist were evident on television, specifically at CBS. In 1957, blacklisted actor Norman Lloyd was hired by Alfred Hitchcock as an associate producer for his anthology series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents", then entering its third season on the network. On November 30, 1958, a live CBS production of "Wonderful Town", based on short stories written by then-Communist Ruth McKenney, appeared with the proper writing credit of blacklisted Edward Chodorov, along with his literary partner, Joseph Fields. The following year, actress Betty Hutton insisted that blacklisted composer Jerry Fielding be hired as musical director for her new series, also on CBS. The first main break in the Hollywood blacklist followed soon after: on January 20, 1960, director Otto Preminger publicly announced that Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was the screenwriter of his forthcoming film "Exodus". Six-and-a-half months later, with "Exodus" still to debut, the "New York Times" announced that Universal Pictures would give Trumbo screen credit for his role as writer on "Spartacus", a decision star Kirk Douglas is now recognized as largely responsible for. On October 6, "Spartacus" premiered—the first movie to bear Trumbo's name since he had received story credit on "Emergency Wedding" in 1950. Since 1947, he had written or co-written approximately seventeen motion pictures without credit. "Exodus" followed in December, also bearing Trumbo's name. The blacklist was now clearly coming to an end, but its effects continue to reverberate even until the present.
John Henry Faulk finally won his lawsuit in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on notice that they were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. This helped to bring an end to publications such as "Counterattack." Like Adrian Scott and Lillian Hellman, however, a number of those on the blacklist remained there for an extended period—Lionel Stander, for instance, could not find work in Hollywood until 1965. Some of those who named names, like Kazan and Schulberg, argued for years after that they had made an ethically proper decision. Others, like actor Lee J. Cobb and director Michael Gordon, who gave friendly testimony to HUAC after suffering on the blacklist for a time, "concede with remorse that their plan was to name their way back to work." And there were those more gravely haunted by the choice they had made. In 1963, actor Sterling Hayden declared,
I was a rat, a stoolie, and the names I named of those close friends were blacklisted and deprived of their livelihood.
Scholars Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner state that Hayden "was widely believed to have drunk himself into a near-suicidal depression decades before his 1986 death."
Into the 21st century, the Writers Guild pursued the correction of screen credits from movies of the 1950s and early 1960s to properly reflect the work of blacklisted writers such as Carl Foreman and Hugo Butler. On December 19, 2011, the guild, acting on a request for an investigation made by his dying son Christopher Trumbo, announced that Dalton Trumbo would get full credit for his work on the screenplay for the 1953 romantic comedy "Roman Holiday", almost sixty years after the fact.

Tommy Thigpen

Tommy Thigpen (born March 17, 1971) is an American college football coach and former player. He is currently the linebackers coach at the University of Tennessee, a position he assumed in December 2012. Prior to that, he spent 14 years as an assistant coach in the collegiate ranks, including a stint at Auburn University where he was part of the 2010 National Championship team. Thigpen played as a linebacker at the University of North Carolina and thereafter was drafted by the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He also played for the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football (WLAF).
Playing career.
Thigpen was born and raised in El Dorado, Arkansas. He played prep school football at Potomac High School in Dumfries, Virginia, where he was honored as a Parade All-American and Virginia Defensive Player of the Year. Thigpen was recruited to play college football at the University of North Carolina for head coach Mack Brown. Thigpen was a three-time All-ACC linebacker for the Tar Heels. He was co-captain of the 1992 team that went 9–3 and were Peach Bowl champions. Upon graduation, Thigpen played professionally for the New York Giants and Barcelona Dragons.
Coaching career.
Thigpen began his coaching career as a UNC graduate assistant in 1998–1999 under Carl Torbush. He received his first full-time position the following season coaching linebackers at Tennessee State. In 2001–2002, he was hired by new head coach Urban Meyer as the cornerbacks coach and special team's coordinator at Bowling Green where he helped coach one of the Mid-American Conference's top defenses, leading the MAC in turnover margin in 2002. BGSU also finished second in the MAC in pass efficiency defense, while Thigpen's special teams also were impressive, blocking seven punts and one field goal.
When Meyer went to Utah in 2003, Thigpen was hired by Ron Turner as the cornerbacks coach at the University of Illinois. He spent the following season as the linebackers coach for the Fighting Illini and was one of two assistants to keep their job when Turner was fired. Although new coach Ron Zook asked him to stay on the staff, Thigpen decided to take the same position at his alma-mater, North Carolina, for the 2005 season. In each of his four seasons at Chapel Hill he tutored UNC's leading tacklers, including Durell Mapp who came to Carolina as a walk-on and finished with the second most tackles in the ACC and now plays with the Green Bay Packers. Thigpen was selected by the Atlantic Coast Conference to attend the 2008 Minority Coaches Forum.
On February 15, 2009, Gene Chizik announced Thigpen had been hired as the safeties coach at Auburn University. He will split responsibilities coaching the Tigers secondary with Phillip Lolley who was promoted to cornerbacks coach. After three season coaching the safeties, Thigpen took over as linebackers coach for the 2012 season.
After Chizik was fired by Auburn following the 2012 season and Thigpen was not retained by new coach Gus Malzahn (who had previously worked alongside Thigpen under Chizik), he was hired to coach linebackers at the University of Tennessee for new head coach Butch Jones.
Thigpen was a coach for Auburn when they won the 2011 BCS National Championship Game.
Thigpen was named one of the nation's top 25 recruiters in 2007 and 2009 by Rivals.com and in 2011 by 247Sports.com, ESPN and Rivals.com. He was awarded the 2011 Scout.com/FOXSports.com SEC Conference Recruiter of the Year. In 2014, he was named Rivals.com National Recruiter of the Year for his work on the University of Tennessee class of 2014.
Personal life.
Thigpen graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of North Carolina in 1993. He is married to the former Jacinda Webb and the couple has two daughters.

Drosera praefolia

Drosera praefolia is a perennial tuberous species in the genus "Drosera" that is endemic to South Australia. It grows in a rosette 4 to 6 cm in diameter with green or sometimes red leaves. It is native to south-east South Australia from the southern Fleurieu Peninsula south to Kangaroo Island. It grows in lateritic clay-sand, loam, or decomposed shale soils in open woodland. It flowers from April to May.
It was first formally described by Johann Gottlieb Otto Tepper in 1892 from specimens he collected on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Earlier in 1882, Tepper sent a description and specimens to Ferdinand von Mueller, who labeled the plants as "D. whittakeri" var. "aphylla", but never published the name. Its placement at the rank of species was controversial and several authors, including Raymond Hamet in 1907, John McConnell Black in 1924, and Allen Lowrie in 1989, have reorganized it below the species rank. Others have reduced it to synonymy with "Drosera whittakeri". In 1991, Robert J. Bates made the case for recognition at the species rank, authoring the illegitimate name "D. aphylla" in the process, a name not based on the first validly published description. Recently, several authors have recognized the taxon at the subspecies or species rank, but others have still only recognized it as a part of the very variable single species "D. whittakeri" "sensu lato". In a review of "D. whittakeri" and related species, Lowrie and John Godfrey Conran reestablished it at the species rank, arguing that the morphology is dissimilar enough from "D. whittakeri" that it requires its own species epithet. Lowrie and Conran note that "D. praefolia" is distinct from "D. whittakeri" (whose opposing characteristics presented in parentheses) by its white tubers (orange), leaves emerging after flowering (before flowering), and the ovate to obovate leaf shape (broadly spathulate), among other differences.

Cranberry, formerly Cranberry Lake, is a community and neighbourhood within Powell River, British Columbia, Canada. It was incorporated as the Village of Cranberry Lake in 1942 and was merged into Powell River in 1955 as that District Municipality was expanded. The settlement's original name derives from the lake of the same name, around which grew cranberries on the peat-rimmed shoreline. Because there was another Cranberry Post Office in British Columbia, the word "lake" was retained in the name of both post office and the village municipality although it has since been dropped since amalgamation into what is now the City of Powell River.

Det Norske Samlaget

Det Norske Samlaget is a Norwegian publishing house founded on 24 March 1868 with the aim to promote and publish books in Landsmål, now known as Nynorsk.
"Det Norske Samlaget" is now divided into two institutions: a literature organization, "Litteraturselskapet Det Norske Samlaget", which is a culturally focused political-interest organization, and the publishing portion, "Forlaget Det Norske Samlaget," which since 1978 has been a non-profit foundation and is responsible for publishing operations. 
As a political organization, "Litteraturselskapet Det Norske Samlaget" works to promote the use of Nynorsk and the preparation and publication of books in Nynorsk. It is also responsible for several grants and awards such as the Nynorsk Literature Prize, the Melsom Prize ("Melsom-prisen") established in 1922 through the endowment of shipowner Ferd. Melsom and the Blix Prize ("Blixprisen") established through the Emma and Elias Blix Endowment. 
Since 1978 the "Forlaget Det Norske Samlaget" has been an independent, separately operating nonprofit foundation. This publishing organization publishes the magazine "Syn og Segn", books, historical, biographical and literary works, youth and children's books, textbooks, dictionaries, scientific and popular scientific books in Nynorsk.
History.
A small group of determined men came together in Christiania in 1868 and formed the Norwegian Samlaget. One of the founders and first chairman was Hagbard Emanuel Berner; he remained chairman until 1877. The formation of Norwegian Samlaget was a natural extension of the efforts to promote Landsmål as the predominant literary and official language of Norway. In 1929, Landsmål was renamed Nynorsk. This promotion of indigenous languages was a common movement over much of the Europe of that period. Iceland sponsored a form of Iclandic in opposition to the official Danish, Finns promoted use of Finnish in opposition to the official Swedish, Flemish was promoted in the Netherlands, Provençal in the south of France and Slavic dialects proliferated to the east. The debate about a Norwegian language reformation had been in progress for years, and fifteen years earlier Ivar Aasen had put forward the idea of reconstituting the Norwegian folk language. Although efforts had previously been made toward organization in the 1860s, it had been heavy work, and they met a great deal of resistance.
Vision.
Det Norske Samlaget vision is to provide an independent, cultural impact. As a publisher they strive to develop and sell high quality Nynorsk books and other publishing products. Core Activities include identification and promotion of the good Nynorsk authors and ready availability of quality books.

USCS Belle (1848)

USCS "Belle" was a schooner that served as a survey ship in the United States Coast Survey from 1848 to 1857.
The Coast Survey acquired "Belle" from the United States Army Quartermaster Department in 1848 and placed her in service along the United States Gulf Coast, where she spent her entire Coast Survey career.
"Belle" sank in a gale at the end of the 1853 surveying season, but she was raised in 1854 and returned to service. She was lost on an uncharted shoal off St. Andrews Bay, Florida, in 1857.

Louis Kirby

Louis Kirby (30 November 1928–14 October 2006) was a British newspaper editor.
Kirby was born in Liverpool and grew up in Coalbrookdale. His first job was as a reporter on the "Wolverhampton Express and Star", then in 1949 he moved to Bermuda where he worked at "The Royal Gazette". In 1951 he returned to Britain to work as a freelance, then joined the "Daily Mail" in 1953. He became the "Mail"'s lobby correspondent, then in 1962 became Chief Reporter with the "Daily Sketch", and in 1969 was promoted to Executive Editor.
In 1971, the "Sketch" merged with the "Mail". "Sketch" editor David English was appointed as editor of the merged newspaper, leaving Kirby as acting editor of the last editions of the "Sketch". He then moved to join English, becoming Deputy Editor of the "Mail".
Kirby became editor of the London daily, the "Evening News" in 1974, and completed its transformation from broadsheet to tabloid. Negotiations to merge the "Evening News" with its competitor, the "Evening Standard" began in 1976, but failed to make progress due to a dispute over who should edit a merged paper. Circulation of the "Evening News" continued to fall under Kirby's editorship, and in 1979, the paper stopped publishing a Saturday edition.
The two papers finally merged in November 1980 to produce the "New Standard", soon named the "Evening Standard" once more. Kirby was appointed editor, and made more than 100 journalists redundant, most from the "Evening News". He stepped down in 1986, becoming Editorial Director of Mail Newspapers. From 1988 to 1993 he was political consultant to the "Daily Mail", then until 2003 he was editor of the "UK Mail", a weekly news digest.

Qigong

Qigong, chi kung, or chi gung () is a practice of aligning body, breath, and mind for health, meditation, and martial arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (chi) or what has been translated as "life energy".
According to Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian philosophy, respectively, qigong allows access to higher realms of awareness, awakens one's "true nature", and helps develop human potential.
Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind. Qigong is now practiced throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise and relaxation, preventive medicine and self-healing, complementary and alternative medicine, meditation and self-cultivation, and training for martial arts.
Over the centuries, a diverse spectrum of qigong forms developed in different segments of Chinese society. Traditionally, qigong training has been esoteric and secretive, with knowledge passed from adept master to student in lineages that maintain their own unique interpretations and methods. Although the practice of qigong was prohibited during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s; it was once again allowed after 1976; and disparate approaches were merged and popularized, with emphasis shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective. Since a 1999 crackdown, practice of qigong in China has been restricted. Over the same period, interest in qigong has spread, with millions of practitioners worldwide.
Research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including hypertension, pain, and cancer treatment. Most systematic reviews of clinical trials have not been conclusive, and all have been based on poor quality clinical studies, such that no firm conclusions about the health effects of qigong can be drawn at this stage.
Etymology.
Qigong (Pinyin), ch'i kung (Wade-Giles), and chi gung (Yale) are English words for two Chinese characters: qì (氣) and gōng (功).
"Qi" (or "chi") is often translated as life energy, referring to energy circulating through the body; though a more general definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or relationship between matter, energy, and spirit. Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. "Gong" (or "kung") is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and is often used to mean gongfu (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort. The two words are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health.
Although the term qigong (氣功) has been traced back to Daoist literature of the early Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the term "qigong" as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s to refer to a broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize health and scientific approaches, while de-emphasizing spiritual practices, mysticism, and elite lineages.
History and origins.
With roots in ancient Chinese culture dating back more than 4,000 years, a wide variety of qigong forms have developed within different segments of Chinese society: in traditional Chinese medicine for preventive and curative functions, in Confucianism to promote longevity and improve moral character, in Taoism and Buddhism as part of meditative practice, and in Chinese martial arts to enhance fighting abilities. Contemporary qigong blends diverse and sometimes disparate traditions, in particular the Daoist meditative practice of "internal alchemy" (Neidan 內丹术), the ancient meditative practices of "circulating qi" (Xing qi 行氣) and "standing meditation" (Zhan zhuang 站桩), and the slow gymnastic breathing exercise of "guiding and pulling" (Dao yin 導引). Traditionally, knowledge about qigong was passed from adept master to student in elite unbroken lineages, typically with secretive and esoteric traditions of training and oral transmission, and with an emphasis on meditative practice by scholars and gymnastic or dynamic practice by the working masses.
Starting in the late 1940s and the 1950s, the mainland Chinese government tried to integrate disparate qigong approaches into one coherent system, with the intention of establishing a firm scientific basis for qigong practice. In 1949, Liu Guizhen established the name "Qigong" to refer to the system of life preserving practices that he and his associates developed based on Dao yin and other philosophical traditions. This attempt is considered by some sinologists as the start of the modern or scientific interpretation of qigong. During the Great Leap Forward (1958–1963) and the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), qigong, along with other traditional Chinese medicine, was under tight control with limited access among the general public, but was encouraged in state-run rehabilitation centers and spread to universities and hospitals. After the Cultural Revolution, qigong, along with t'ai chi, was popularized as daily morning exercise practiced en masse throughout China.
Popularity of qigong grew rapidly during the Deng and Jiang eras after Mao Zedong's death in 1976 through the 1990s, with estimates of between 60 and 200 million practitioners throughout China. Along with popularity and state sanction came controversy and problems: claims of extraordinary abilities bordering on the supernatural, pseudoscience explanations to build credibility, a mental condition labeled qigong deviation, formation of cults, and exaggeration of claims by masters for personal benefit. In 1985, the state-run "National Qigong Science and Research Organization" was established to regulate the nation's qigong denominations. In 1999, in response to widespread revival of old traditions of spirituality, morality, and mysticism, and perceived challenges to State control, the Chinese government took measures to enforce control of public qigong practice, including shutting down qigong clinics and hospitals, and banning groups such as Zhong Gong and Falun Gong.
Since the 1999 crackdown, qigong research and practice have only been officially supported in the context of health and traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Health Qigong Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public qigong practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state-approved forms.
Through the forces of migration of the Chinese diaspora, tourism in China, and globalization, the practice of qigong spread from the Chinese community to the world. Today, millions of people around the world practice qigong and believe in the benefits of qigong to varying degrees. Similar to its historical origin, those interested in qigong come from diverse backgrounds and practice it for different reasons, including for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, complementary and alternative medicine, self-cultivation, meditation, spirituality, and martial arts training.
Practices, forms, and techniques.
Practices.
Qigong comprises a diverse set of practices that coordinate body (調身), breath (調息), and mind (調心) based on Chinese philosophy. Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, performed in a broad array of body postures. Qigong is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active qigong (dong gong), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive qigong (jing gong), with still positions and inner movement of the breath. From a therapeutic perspective, qigong can be classified into two systems: 1) internal qigong, which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and 2) external qigong, which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits qi. As moving meditation, qigong practice typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, and calm mental focus, with visualization of guiding qi through the body. While implementation details vary, generally qigong forms can be characterized as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids.
Forms.
There are numerous qigong forms. 75 ancient forms that can be found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary form have been described in a qigong compendium. The list is by no means exhaustive. Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after qigong practice.
In 2003, the Chinese Health Qigong Association officially recognized four health qigong forms:
In 2010, the Chinese Health Qigong Association officially recognized five additional health qigong forms:
Other commonly practiced qigong styles and forms include the following:
Techniques.
Whether viewed from the perspective of exercise, health, philosophy, or martial arts training, several main principles emerge concerning the practice of qigong:
Additional principles:
Advanced goals:
The most advanced practice is generally considered to be with little or no motion.
Traditional and classical theory.
Over time, five distinct traditions or schools of qigong developed in China, each with its own theories and characteristics: Chinese Medical Qigong, Daoist Qigong, Buddhist Qigong, Confucian Qigong, and Martial Arts Qigong. All of these qigong traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance qi.
Chinese Medical Qigong.
The theories of ancient Chinese Medical Qigong include the Yin-Yang and Five Phases Theory, Essence-Qi-Spirit Theory, Zang-Xiang Theory, and Meridians and Qi-Blood Theory, which have been synthesized as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM focuses on tracing and correcting underlying disharmony, in terms of deficiency and excess, using the complementary and opposing forces of yin and yang (陰陽), to create a balanced flow of qi. Qi is believed to be cultivated and stored in three main dantian energy centers and to travel through the body along twelve main meridians (Jīng Luò 經絡), with numerous smaller branches and tributaries. The main meridians correspond to twelve main organs (Zàng fǔ 臟腑)). Qi is balanced in terms of yin and yang in the context of the traditional system of Five Phases (Wu xing 五行). A person is believed to become ill or die when qi becomes diminished or unbalanced. Health is believed to be returned by rebuilding qi, eliminating qi blockages, and correcting qi imbalances. These TCM concepts do not translate readily to modern science and medicine.
Daoist Qigong.
In Daoism various practices now known as Daoist Qigong provide a way to achieve longevity and spiritual enlightenment, as well as a closer connection to the natural world.
Buddhist Qigong.
In Buddhism meditative practices now known as Buddhist Qigong are part of a spiritual path that leads to spiritual enlightenment or Buddhahood.
Confucian Qigong.
In Confucianism practices now known as Confucian Qigong provide a means to become a Junzi (君子) through awareness of morality.
Contemporary views.
In contemporary China, the emphasis of qigong practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective. Qigong is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional philosophical, medical, or martial arts perspectives, and even use the long history of qigong as evidence of its effectiveness.
Contemporary Chinese medical qigong.
Qigong has been recognized as a "standard medical technique" in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China. The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China defines CMQ as "the skill of body-mind exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one" and emphasizes that qigong is based on "adjustment" (tiao 調, also translated as “regulation”, “tuning”, or “alignment.”) of body, breath, and mind. As such, qigong is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because qigong combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being. While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also emphasize the importance of a strong scientific basis. According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of qigong are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, as well as possible beneficial effects on neurophysiology.
Conventional medicine.
Conventional or mainstream medicine includes specific practices and techniques based on the best available evidence demonstrating effectiveness and safety. Qigong is not generally considered to be part of mainstream medicine because clinical research concerning effectiveness of qigong for specific medical conditions is inconclusive at this stage, and because at present there is no medical consensus concerning effectiveness of qigong.
Integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine.
Integrative medicine (IM) refers to "the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole", whereas complementary generally refers to "using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine", and alternative refers to "using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine". Qigong is used by integrative medicine practitioners to complement conventional medical treatment, based on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interpretations of the effectiveness and safety of qigong.
Scientific basis.
Scientists interested in qigong have sought to describe or verify the effects of qigong, to explore mechanisms of effects, to form scientific theory with respect to Qigong, and to identify appropriate research methodology for further study. In terms of traditional theory, the existence of qi has not been independently verified in an experimental setting, and the scientific basis for much of TCM and CAM has not been demonstrated.
Health applications.
Recreation and popular use.
People practice qigong for many different reasons, including for recreation, exercise and relaxation, preventive medicine and self-healing, meditation and self-cultivation, and training for martial arts. In recent years a large number of books and videos have been published that focus primarily on qigong as exercise and associated health benefits. Practitioners range from athletes to the physically challenged. Because it is low impact and can be done lying, sitting, or standing, qigong is accessible for disabled persons, seniors, and people recovering from injuries.
Therapeutic use.
Therapeutic use of qigong is directed by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners. In China, where it is considered a "standard medical technique", qigong is commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of conditions, and clinical applications include hypertension, coronary artery disease, peptic ulcers, chronic liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, menopause syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, tumors and cancer, lower back and leg pain, cervical spondylosis, and myopia. Outside China qigong is used in integrative medicine to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for relaxation, fitness, rehabilitation, and treatment of specific conditions.
Effectiveness.
Based on systematic reviews of clinical research, it is not advisable to draw conclusions concerning effectiveness of qigong for specific medical conditions at this stage.
Safety and cost.
Qigong is generally viewed as safe. No adverse effects have been observed in clinical trials, such that qigong is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care. Typically the cautions associated with qigong are the same as those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.
Research.
Overview of clinical research.
Although clinical research examining health effects of qigong is increasing, there is little financial or medical incentive to support research, and still only a limited number of studies meet accepted medical and scientific standards of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Clinical research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including bone density, cardiopulmonary effects, physical function, falls and related risk factors, quality of life, immune function, inflammation, hypertension, pain, and cancer treatment. A 2011 overview of systematic reviews of clinical trials concluded that "the effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research" and "therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage". Although a 2010 comprehensive literature review found 77 peer-reviewed RCTs; systematic reviews for particular health conditions show that most clinical research is of poor quality, typically because of small sample size and lack of proper control groups, with lack of blinding associated with high risk of bias.
Systematic reviews of clinical research.
A systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on hypertension found that the available studies were encouraging for the exercises to lower systolic blood pressure. However, an analysis of the studies that found these results showed that they were of relatively poor quality, with the lack of blinding raising the possibility of bias in the results, so no definitive conclusions could be reached. Another systematic review found that qigong exercises improved blood pressure compared to doing nothing, but was not superior to standard treatment such as medications or conventional exercise.
A 2007 systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on diabetes mellitus management concluded that there may be beneficial effects, but that no firm conclusions could be drawn due to the methodological problems with the underlying clinical trials studies, especially the lack of a control group. A more recent 2009 systematic review found that due to the underlying methodological problems, "the evidence is insufficient to suggest that qigong is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes."
A systematic review on the effect of qigong exercises on reducing pain concluded that "the existing trial evidence is not convincing enough to suggest that internal qigong is an effective modality for pain management." Another systematic review which focused on external qigong and its effect on pain, concluded "that evidence for the effectiveness of external qigong is encouraging, though further studies are warranted" due to the small number of studies and participants involved which precluded any firm conclusions about the specific effects of qigong on pain.
A systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on cancer treatment concluded "the effectiveness of qigong in cancer care is not yet supported by the evidence from rigorous clinical trials." A separate systematic review that looked at the effects of qigong exercises on various physiological or psychological outcomes found that the available studies were poorly designed, with a high of bias in the results. Therefore, the authors concluded, "Due to limited number of RCTs in the field and methodological problems and high risk of bias in the included studies, it is still too early to reach a conclusion about the efficacy and the effectiveness of qigong exercise as a form of health practice adopted by the cancer patients during their curative, palliative, and rehabilitative phases of the cancer journey."
A systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on movement disorders found that the evidence was insufficient to recommend its use for this purpose.
Mental health research.
Many claims have been made that qigong can benefit or ameliorate mental health conditions, including improved mood, decreased stress reaction, and decreased anxiety and depression. Most medical studies have only examined psychological factors as secondary goals, however various studies have shown significant benefits such as decrease in cortisol levels, a chemical hormone produced by the body in response to stress.
Research in China.
Basic and clinical research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results were reported in peer-reviewed English-language journals. A 1996 review of selected Chinese research concluded that there are many potential medical applications of qigong. Qigong became known outside China in the 1990s, and clinical randomized controlled trials (RTCs) investigating the effectiveness of qigong on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.
Challenges for research.
The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Policy recognized challenges and complexities to rigorous research concerning effectiveness and safety of CAM modalities such as qigong; emphasized that research must adhere to the same standards as conventional research, including statistically significant sample sizes, adequate controls, definition of response specificity, and reproducibility of results; and recommended substantial increases in funding to address the lack of adequate funding for rigorous research. Most existing clinical trials have small sample sizes and many have inadequate controls. Of particular concern is the impracticality of double blinding using appropriate sham treatments, and the difficulty of placebo control, such that benefits often cannot be distinguished from the placebo effect. Also of concern is the choice of which qigong form to use and how to standardize the treatment or dose with respect to the skill of the practitioner leading or administering treatment, the tradition of individualization of treatments, and the treatment length, intensity, and frequency.
Meditation and self-cultivation applications.
Qigong is practiced for meditation and self-cultivation as part of various philosophical and spiritual traditions. As meditation, qigong is a means to still the mind and enter a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss. Many practitioners find qigong, with its gentle focused movement, to be more accessible than seated meditation.
Qigong for self-cultivation can be classified in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian.
Martial arts applications.
The practice of qigong is an important component in both internal and external style Chinese martial arts. Focus on qi is considered to be a source of power as well as the foundation of the internal style of martial arts (Neijia). T'ai chi ch'uan, Xing yi, and Baguazhang are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of qi as the foundation. Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes (Iron Shirt, 鐵衫) and the ability to break hard objects (Iron Palm, 铁掌) are abilities attributed to qigong training.
T'ai chi ch'uan and qigong.
"T'ai chi ch'uan" (Taijiquan) is a widely practiced Chinese internal martial style based on the theory of taiji ("grand ultimate"), closely associated with qigong, and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense. Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of qigong, traced back to an origin in the 17th century. In modern practice, qigong typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and plays an important role in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality ("life energy").

Henry Fitch Taylor

Henry Fitch Taylor (1853–1925) was an American painter who was to become the oldest among the generation of American artists who responded to and explored Cubism. Taylor served as the first president of the American Association of Artists and Painters (AAPS), the organization which mounted the 1913 Armory Show; he later stepped aside from that role in favor of Arthur B. Davies, but continued to serve as trustee and secretary of AAPS.
Biography.
He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1853. He studied at the Académie Julian, in Paris, and in 1885 went to Barbizon to paint. He returned to America in either 1888 or in 1889, and established his studio in New York City. 
Between 1898 and 1908 he resided in Cos Cob, Connecticut. He was part of the Cos Cob Art Colony, where did some painting but did not show his work. Among his visitors there were John Twachtman, Childe Hassam, Willa Cather, Arthur B. Davies, George Luks, and Walt Kuhn; many of these acquaintances would come to play an important role in Taylor's life as an artist. 
He married Clara Sidney Potter Davidge, the daughter of Bishop Henry Codman Potter, in 1912. They moved to her estate on Staten Island.
Henry Fitch Taylor And The Origins Of The Armory Show.
As reported by Jerome Myers in his autobiography "Artist In Manhattan" 
Elmer MacRae and I formed the "Pastelist's Society," for the showing of intimate drawings and pastels. Without our realizing it then, this society was to have important consequences for the subsequent course of American art. Some time afterwards in the Madison Gallery, of which Henry Fitch Taylor was the director, Walt Kuhn, Elmer MacRae and I were exhibiting our work. As passengers on a ship are thrown together and become friendly, so in our voyage through a two week exhibition, time was not lacking to talk shop. Walt Kuhn said to me, "Myers, you and MacRae have done so well with your 'Pastelist's Society,' why can't we get together on a scheme for a large exhibition?" So we agreed to talk it over at my studio nearby, at 7 West 42nd Street in the McHugh Building, across the street from the New York Public Library. (Date: December 14, 1911) There our first meeting was held (Kuhn, MacRae, Taylor, Myers) and a tentative list of members was made up which finally resulted in the organization of the "Association of American Painters and Sculptors." As Walt Kuhn says in his commemorative pamphlet, "The Story of the Armory Show": "The group of four men who first set the wheels in motion had no idea of the magnitude to which their early longings would lead."
In the 1913 Armory Show three of Taylor's paintings were shown: "Omen," "Prostitution," and "Dusk Of Morning."
A 1921 Tragedy.
In 1921 Taylor's wife drowned. The New York Times headline: "Bishop Potter's Daughter Drowns. Body of Mrs. Henry Fitch Taylor Discovered in Marsh Near Her Long Island Home. Had A Spinal Ailment. Belief Is That She Fell Into the Mud and Could Not Free Herself."
Legacy.
Taylor died on September 10, 1925, in Plainfield, New Hampshire.

How Much Do You Love Your Kid?

"How Much Do You Love Your Kid?" is the thirty-fourth episode of the science fiction television series 2002 revival of "The Twilight Zone", and one of the only two episodes in this incarnation to feature no supernatural elements, the other being "Evergreen". The episode was first broadcast on February 26, 2003, on UPN.
Plot.
A woman, Donna (Bonnie Somerville), is told her son Wylie (Nico McEown) has vanished and then finds herself in a licensed reality TV show "How Much Do You Love Your Kid?". The host, Nick Dark (Wayne Knight), informs her that she has to find her child in one hour by answering 'clue cards', but never tells her what will happen if she does not. When the authorities claim the show has all the required permits and that they cannot do anything about it, she is forced to play this twisted game show for her son's life. 
Nick and the camera crew follow her around town as she answers a series of tedious questions. Finally, they track down the 'kidnapper' and her son, chasing them in a car chase. The kidnapper's car, however, is driven off a hill and the car, with the son inside, crashes.
The crew and Nick are shocked by this unscripted event, and momentarily shut off the cameras as Donna has a moment with the injured Wylie who is now in a stretcher. Nick informs her that the kidnapper got away, and that she should take revenge upon him for what he did to her son. He even offers her more prize money, and a gun, in addition to getting her son back. She chases down the kidnapper back to her house and to only discover that the kidnapper is her husband (Steve Bacic), who did it for the money, the whole time. Donna expresses her anger at him because he risked their son's life, and shoots him. Donna later wins $1 million and, as Nick tells her, "the best defense money can buy", leading to the police arresting her for homicide. The events of Wylie were unknown after he was sent to the hospital, from the car crash.

Welkin Weasels

Welkin Weasels is a series of fantasy novels by British author Garry Kilworth. As of 2003, it consists of six books, all published by Random House's Corgi Juvenile imprint.
Series.
"Thunder Oak".
Years after all the humans mysteriously vanished from the island of Welkin, a group of outlaw weasels set out to find them in hopes of restoring the crumbling sea walls that surround the island.
"Castle Storm.
Following the clue found in "Thunder Oak", the weasels journey to a city inhabited by quarreling squirrels.
"Windjammer Run".
Sylver and his outlaws set sail for the Island of Dorma, where the humans are reputed to be in a perpetual sleep.
"Gaslight Geezers".
Years after the return of the humans, the weasel detective Montegu Sylver attempts to solve the disappearance of a foreign dignitary while preventing his cousin from setting off explosives in the city.
"Vampire Voles".
Monty and his friends battle the swarms of vampiric voles invading the capital city.
"Heastward Ho!".
Monty and friends travel to the eastern empire of Far Kathay to find the stolen jade shoes of the Green Idol of Ommm.
Universe.
Animals.
The animals featuring in the series are primarily species native to England, though more exotic species are occasionally mentioned. The first book explains that in the years following the disappearance of all humans, the animals of Welkin, both those wild and once domesticated, made their way into the abandoned castles and villages, using what the humans had left behind.
Gradually the animals learned to speak human language and, to an extent, use human tools. While some of the animals were content to live in the forest, the mustelids in particular adapted to a more civilized way of living.
The otters and mink took to the riverways; the badgers kept to the subterranean territories; the pine martens stayed in the trees; of the remaining weasels, stoats, and now-feral ferrets, the stoats were the most ambitious and aggressive, and took control of Welkin.
Living Statues.
The island of Welkin is populated not only by animals, but statues created by humans that have since come to life. The statues have the ability to talk, but most do so rather poorly and have only limited intelligence. All statues wander Welkin constantly in search of their "First and Last Resting Place," that being the quarry from which the stones they were sculpted from were cut, or the forest from which the trees used to carve them were grown.
Thematic Elements.
The comedic elements of the series rely heavily on the use of puns and literary references, including allusions to Shakespearean and Biblical stories.

Salvia oppositiflora

Salvia oppositiflora is a perennial native to Peru, growing at high elevations—7,000 to 12,000 feet. It was collected in 1798 by Hipólito Ruiz López and José Antonio Pavón Jiménez and later described in "Flora of Peru".
"Salvia oppositiflora" reaches 2-3 feet in height and width, with a floppy habit. The mid-green leaves are ovate, nearly triangular, reaching up to 1.5 inches long and wide, smooth or lightly covered with hairs, and with serrated edges. The 1 inch flowers are orange-red, appearing tube-like, with reddish stamens protruding from the lower lip. The inlforescences are short, with flowers growing in opposite pairs, giving the plant its name. The lime-green calyces, and the plant's stems, are covered with short hairs and glands.

2/7th Commando Squadron (Australia)

The 2/7th Commando Company was one of 12 independent companies or commando squadrons raised by the Australian Army during the Second World War. Raised in May 1942, as the 2/7th Independent Company, the 2/7th served in New Guinea in 1943 before being redesignated as the 2/7th Commando Squadron when it was amalgamated with two other commando squadrons to become part of the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment. Later at the end of 1944, it was sent to New Guinea again, where it took part in Aitape–Wewak campaign. Following the end of the war, the squadron was returned to Australia and disbanded early in 1946.
History.
Formation.
In late 1940 the Australian Army began considering the issue of raising independent companies or commando units for the conduct of irregular warfare. Based upon proposals and advice from the British Military Mission in Australia, in March 1941 the Army began training company-sized units that would act independently of higher command to carry out tasks such as raiding, sabotage, and subversion. As the war progressed the role that these independent companies would fulfill evolved towards guerrilla operations such as stay-behind, long range penetration and reconnaissance. In this regard between 1941 and 1942 eight independent companies were raised. The 2/7th Independent Company was one of these units, and was formed in May 1942, undertaking training at the Guerrilla Warfare School at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria.
New Guinea 1942–43.
Following the completion of its training, the company was deployed to New Guinea in late 1942, landing at Port Moresby. From there it was flown to Wau in January 1943, where it was used to reinforce elements of the 6th Division and units Kanga Force. Between January and April, the company operated in conjunction with 2/3rd and 2/5th Independent Companies, performing mainly a traditional infantry role. During this time they conducted a number of patrols and were involved in a very successful ambush on a large force of Japanese, resulting in a high number of enemy casualties. Later, they were directly involved with the defence of Wau, before helping to push the Japanese back to Mubo, where they conducted small scale harassment raids. The 2/7th's commanding officer, Major Thomas MacAdie, was awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his gallantry and leadership during this phase of the campaign.
In April they were relieved by the 2/7th Battalion. They had served in the Wau area for seven months and were in need of rest, however, as there were no other troops available, on 29 May 1943 the 2/7th Independent Company was flown to Bena Bena where they became part of Bena Force. Bena Force had originally been dispatched to the isolated airfield in January consisting of only a handful of men from the 2/7th Battalion, with the task of defending it against the advancing Japanese, harassing the enemy in the area and denying them freedom of movement, however, in May as Japanese air attacks on Bena increased it became necessary to reinforce the small garrison. As such the depleted 2/7th Independent Company was sent to Bena, under the command of Major MacAdie, bringing the garrison up to roughly four hundred men. During June and July, observation posts were established in the region, patrols were sent out and infrastructure was built with the help of labour supplied by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU). Later, during August and September, as attacks increased on the garrison and the 2/2nd Independent Company arrived to reinforce Bena Force, patrols were sent out through the Ramu Valley in order to observe the main approaches to Bena Bena.
In October, following a re-organisation of Australian forces in New Guinea in preparation for the coming offensive at Lae, the 2/7th was temporarily placed under the command of the 7th Division. Following this, the company began patrolling operations along the Faria, Iogi and Evapia rivers, until they were finally relieved by the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron in the second week of November. The 2/7th then returned to Dumpu, before embarking at Port Moresby for the return to Australia, having been deployed on active service for the best part of a year.
Reorganisation 1943–45.
While the 2/7th Independent Company had been involved in the campaign in New Guinea, there had been a significant re-organisation of the way in which the Independent Companies were administered and organised. This was due to an army-wide reorganisation as the Australian Army shifted its strategic focus away from the Middle East and began to concentrate on the Pacific. As a result of this reorganisation, the 2/7th Independent Company was renamed the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Squadron (later just commando squadron) and was absorbed into the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, along with the newly formed 2/9th and 2/10th Commando Squadrons. Together, these units were attached to the 6th Division, to conduct long range patrol and reconnaissance operations.
Following their return from New Guinea, the newly formed 2/7th Commando Squadron concentrated on the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, with the rest of the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment. Throughout the rest of 1943 and most of 1944, the 2/7th carried out garrison duties and participated in exercises and training with the rest of the 6th Division. The squadron's last contribution to the Second World War came during the Aitape-Wewak campaign.
Aitape–Wewak 1945.
Early in 1945, the 6th Division relieved the American garrison at Aitape, with a view to renewing offensive operations in the area. The 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment was the first Australian fighting unit to arrive at Aitape, and as it waited for the rest of the division to arrive, having left Brisbane on 22 October 1944, the regiment relieved the American outpost at Babiang and began to assist the ANGAU patrols in the area. Once they had concentrated fully by November, the 6th Division began its advance eastwards towards the Japanese base at Wewak, in order to destroy the remnants of the Japanese 18th Army. Prior to this, however, the 2/7th Commando Squadron conducted preliminary patrols in order to gather information on topography and enemy dispositions in the region.
The Australian advance began in December and by this time, the 2/7th had been moved to Tong, where it had been given the tasks of maintaining a base, control the surrounding area and conduct patrols to the south. Now under the command of Major Goode, the squadron operated in support of the 17th Brigade, and had men stationed at Yourang and Kumbun. During this time there were a number of clashes with the enemy, most notably on 11th and 13 December, as the squadron established its control over the area, resulting in a number of Japanese killed in action. Once it had been relieved by 17th Brigade, the squadron conducted a number of reconnaissance patrols south of the Torriccelli Ranges, around the Dandriwad and Danmap Rivers, and then later once it had moved to the Yasuar Mission, patrolling along the Muam River. Throughout February the 2/7th began to push into enemy territory, moving along the Atop River and establishing bases at Kaumala, and at House Copper.
Finally, at the end of March, the 2/7th was relieved and returned to Aitape. The following month, the 2/7th was transported by landing craft to But, where they were to act as reserve for the 16th Brigade's advance to the Hawain River. While here, they were based at Banak and conducted a number of patrols in the surrounding area. As the campaign progressed into May, the 2/7th was transferred to the command of the 19th Brigade, which at the time was advancing on Wewak, with its limit of exploitation being the Brandi River. As it became clear that the Japanese were attempting to abandon their positions, the 2/7th were ordered to advance in a wide circle and capture the Sauri villages, where it was believed that the Japanese had established a strong rearguard to act as a blocking force.
The 2/7th advanced up the Waringe River with a strength of 156 men, supported by mortar and artillery, and over the course of two days proceeded to clear the enemy from the high ground along which they would launch their assault on the villages. On 11 May, two troops from the 2/7th launched their assault, advancing along a spur that led to Walanter where they encountered a well-established enemy position. This position was assaulted and the objective taken over the course of two and a half hours, with the assistance of close support from artillery and flamethrowers to overcome the enemy resistance.
The 2/7th were then relieved by elements of the 2/8th Battalion at Sauri, before receiving orders to concentrate with the rest of the 2/6th Commando Regiment in the area around Brandi Plantation. By the start of June they began "mopping up" operations, firstly at Dove Bay and then at Karawop, before they were sent to Boiken in July, where they relieved the 2/10th Commando Squadron, which had been patrolling the area around the Dagua and Hawain Rivers in an attempt to deal with the Japanese raiding parties that were still operating in the area.
The 2/7th were still in Boiken when Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. They were disbanded approximately six months later, early in 1946, after the last members were returned to Australia and demobilised. During the course of its service, the squadron lost 30 men killed in action or died on active service.

<doc id="21556727" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21556727" title="Ancylostoma caninum">
Ancylostoma caninum

Ancylostoma caninum is a species of nematode which principally infects the small intestine of dogs. The result of "A. caninum" infection ranges from asymptomatic cases to death of the dog; better nourishment, increasing age, prior "A. caninum" exposure or vaccination are all linked to improved survival. Other hosts include carnivores such as wolves, foxes and cats with a small number of cases having been reported in humans.
Warm and moist conditions are important to allow survival of "A. caninum" during the free-living stages of its life cycle and for this reason it is largely restricted to temperate, tropical and sub-tropical regions. In parts of the world where these climatic requirements are met such as Sri Lanka, southeast Asia and Malaysia "A. caninum" is the main cause of hookworm disease in canines.
Morphology.
"A. caninum" females are typically long and wide, while the males are smaller at in length and in width. On males a copulatory bursa exists which, during copulation, attaches the female via ~0.9 mm long spine-like spicules positioned on three muscular rays. As with other nematodes, the sperm lack flagella. The copulatory bursa is a unique feature of Strongylida members, thus making it a useful means for identifying members of this suborder; it is also used to distinguish members within the suborder due to differences in bursa appearance between species. The vulva of "A. caninum" females is located at the boundary of the second and final thirds of the body.
The teeth of "A. caninum" are found in the buccal capsule and divided into three sets. Two ventral sets form a lower-jaw equivalent, while a further set projects from the dorsal side and loosely equates to an upper-jaw. Each ventral set has three points with those furthest to the sides being the largest. While the ventral sets are prominent, the dorsal set is hidden deeper in the buccal capsule. 
"A. caninum" bends its head end upward (dorsally) which has in the past been noted as a potential source confusion when determining how the hookworm is oriented. If it has recently ingested blood "A. caninum" is red in colour, if not it appears grey. "A. caninum" has an alimentary canal made up of an esophagus, intestine and rectum – the esophagus is highly muscular reflecting its role in pulling intestinal mucosa into the body when it feeds. Esophageal and anal rings of "A. caninum" are the source of nerve fibres that extend throughout the body to innervate sensory organs including amphids and phasmids. 
Eggs are laid by the females typically when at the 8-cell stage. Eggs are 38-43 μM in width with thin walls.
Distribution.
Freezing, heating above , drying or exposing "A. caninum" to sunlight all give reduced survival of the free-living stage with rates of infection rising with temperature provided 37 °C is not exceeded. "A. caninum" is therefore largely restricted to warm, moist climates though infections are seen in the USA and southern Canada where the temperature is sub-optimal. Specific niches are also able to satisfy the environmental requirements of "A. caninum" despite not necessarily being in the tropics, such as mines.
Life Cycle.
Transmission via the Environment.
Eggs are excreted from host in the feces and typically hatch within a day on moist, warm soil giving larvae with a non-living cuticle layer. By four or five days the larvae have moulted twice and are now able to infect a host. Migration occurs from the faeces into the surrounding soil. Two routes of infection from the environment exist. The first route involves penetration of skin at hair follicles or sweat glands, especially between the footpads where contact with soil is frequent and the skin is thinner than otherwise. Secretion of a protease by "A. caninum" is thought to aid this process. The larvae then migrate through the dermis of the skin, enter the circulatory system and are carried to the lungs. "A. caninum" larvae exit the blood at the lungs, move from the alveoli up through the trachea and are swallowed to end up in the intestine. 
The second and more common route to the small intestine is by direct ingestion of "A. caninum" by the host, but the subsequent process is identical in either case. It is during this third stage of the larva that male or female reproductive organs become established. Larvae of this stage have been shown to secrete a molecule (Ac-asp-2) related to venom allergens in response to host-specific signals; this is thought to have a possible role in helping with the infection process. A third and final moulting occurs to give the mature form of "A. caninum" which then feeds on mucosa and blood of the small intestine wall. The trigger of feeding is understood to be a receptor-mediated response, however the detail of this process has yet to be established. Sexual reproduction also occurs in the intestine to give a further round of eggs to complete the cycle. Females are thought to produce a pheromone which attracts males and are able to produce approximately 10,000 eggs per day.
Direct transmission.
It is also possible for direct transmission between hosts. Larvae having accessed through the skin may avoid exit via the lungs and remain in circulation for transport around the body. At the uterine artery of a pregnant female the larvae are able to cross the placenta to cause pre-natal infection of foetuses. Larvae of an infected foetus will move to the liver until birth at which point migration continues with movement to the intestine via the circulation and lungs as previously described. Alternatively "A. caninum" larvae evading exit from the circulation at the lungs may instead be carried to the mammary glands and transmitted from the mother in her colostrum or milk to her pups; infection then proceeds in an identical manner to infection by ingestion from the environment. Infected bitches have been found to only rarely give prenatal transmission to pups while the likelihood of nursing of pups causing transmission (via the lactational route) is much higher.
Pathogenesis.
Damage during migration to intestine.
"Ancylostomum caninum" larvae cause damage to the host at the point of entry through the skin leaving a wound vulnerable to secondary infections. As the larvae migrate through the skin an inflammatory response, dermatitis, is often stimulated which can be exacerbated in hosts which give hypersensitive responses. Further damage is caused when the larvae leave the circulation and enter the lung with the amount of damage dependent on the extent of the infection; pneumonia and coughing are common consequences.
Damage once in intestine.
Once in the gut "A. caninum" attaches to and ingests the mucosal lining along with some consumption of blood; up to 0.1mL in 24hrs. In a 24hr period "A. caninum" typically feeds from six sites. This damage to the mucosa compromises the body’s defences and can result in secondary infections by microbes. A group of anticoagulant proteins called AcAPs ("A. caninum" anticoagulant proteins) which inhibit a range of blood coagulation factors such as Xa are utilised by "A. caninum" to help in the feeding process by preventing clotting and increasing blood loss. These AcAPs are among the most powerful natural anticoagulants that exist and are a key reason for anemia being caused and blood being observed in the faeces of infected hosts. Blood losses peak just prior to egg production by the females because this is when their requirements for food are greatest; the amount that they are eating is also peaking and so maximal damage to the intestine is being caused.
Diagnosis.
Analysis of faeces is the definitive method by which a suspected "A. caninum" infection is confirmed. The faeces are sampled and the characteristic ovular, thin-shelled eggs of "A. caninum" looked for. Absence of eggs in faeces does not rule out infection; a significant delay of at least 5 weeks exists between initial infection and excretion of eggs in the faeces (larvae must fully mature and reproduce before eggs can be laid). In fact, pups frequently die before passing of eggs in the faeces begins. Using the number of eggs in stool samples as an indicator of the extent of infestation requires care to be taken because females have been shown to produce fewer eggs each when the overall number of worms increases.
Signs and symptoms expected to be observed together with "A. caninum" eggs in the faeces are lethargy, weight loss, weakness, roughness of the hair coat and pale mucous membranes indicative of anemia. Well-fed, older dogs with smaller infestations may present few or even none of these symptoms. Diarrhoea is rare but stools are typically black due to the blood-derived haemoglobin present in them.
The disease resulting from such "A. caninum" infection is referred to by the general term hookworm disease or the more specific ancylostomiasis and ancylostomosis diagnoses which recognise the genus of the causative nematode.
Prevention and Control.
A clean environment minimises the risk of "A. caninum" infection; this can include regularly washed concrete or gravel in kennels instead of soil. Bitches are typically checked prior to using them for breeding purposes for nematodes such as "A. caninum" and birth and suckling can be restricted to sanitised areas to lower the risk of health complications to the pups. When infection of a pregnant bitch is known or suspected fenbendazole or ivermectin can be administered to the bitch to help avoid transmission to the pups. 
Canines have been seen to develop significant resistance to "A. caninum" naturally with age; this protection develops faster in bitches than in dogs and fully mature bitches show substantially greater resistance than fully mature dogs. Specifically the age-related resistance means "A. caninum" takes longer to reach sexual maturity in older animals and fewer larvae fully develop.
Vaccination.
Numerous vaccines have been developed with varying success against "A. caninum". Use of an enzyme important in the worm’s feeding process is popular with one example being AcCP2, a protease, which when used to vaccinate dogs gives a strong antibody response, lowering of numbers of eggs found in stools and a decrease in intestinal worm size. These effects are attributed to reduced AcCP2 activity upon antibody binding. A similar approach has been taken using another "A. caninum" digestive enzyme, AcGST1, but it failed to give statistically significant results in dogs. 
An alternative approach has been to disrupt the migratory ability of "A. caninum", this was done so successfully using the AcASP1 protein of "A. caninum" which gives increases in antibody levels of all subclasses and a reduced worm burden. Other studies using the same vaccine have shown statistically significant 79% reductions in worm burden resulting from this approach.
Animals with prior exposure to "A. caninum" show enhanced resistance but careful removal of all worms from the previous infection results in loss of this improvement. Studies in mice show resistance due to past exposure can protect against otherwise lethal worm doses and that this is a general form of resistance - defence is offered against subsequent infections via either mouth "or" skin.
Medication.
Drugs used in treatment of "A. caninum" infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, and ivermectin.
In Humans.
In inappropriate hosts such as humans "A. caninum" is able to enter the skin but cannot proceed into the circulation and on to the intestine; instead the disease dermal larva migrans results, caused by movement of the nematode within the skin and which can persist for several months without intervention. 
While access to the intestine is not possible via this route, it can occur via ingestion; in a report of 93 enteritis cases in northern Queensland, Australia which were possibly caused by A. canium infection, all those interviewed described behaviour consistent with "A. caninum" exposure and a colonoscopy of one patient gave positive identification of an adult "A. caninum" worm. Since then work has shown "A. caninum" can easily go unnoticed or fail to be preserved in specimens making the true incidence of infection in humans likely to be higher than is officially recorded.
Economic Burden.
The animals affected by "A. caninum" infection are not used for food or labour purposes thus the economic burden from animal illness is low. Work showing that human "A. caninum" infections are likely underestimated and misdiagnosed indicates the economic impact of "A. caninum" through human work days lost may be underestimated and significant.

Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway

The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway was a standard gauge mineral railway that served an ironstone quarry near the village of Wroxton in Oxfordshire.
The line's History.
It linked the quarry with the Great Western Railway about to the east at a junction just north of Banbury. The OIR was opened between 1917 and 1919, was closed in 1967 and the line was 'lifted', that is the line was closed and removed, between 1967 and 1968. The quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War. A newer quarry close by is now served by road haulage only. The line was extended to the Balscote Quarry which was worked between 1956 and its closure in 1967.
The OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T and 0-6-0ST locomotives built by Hunslet and 0-4-0ST's built by Hudswell Clarke. They also purchased two diesel Rolls Royce Sentinel units in the 1960s.
The mine buildings and workers' halt are now a small set of new light industrial buildings, built circa 2006. The track works' permanent way hut (p-hut) still stood at Drayton in 2007 and Horley in 2002. A few old OIR fence posts/gates remain to this day along the route. Banbury's Ruscote and Hardwick estate are also built over a large part of its route, including most of the former Pin Hill farm grading works.
Many heavy clay and Ironstone deposits surround Banbury and Wroxton.
The Edge Hill Light Railway connection.
The firm behind the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway was one of the backers of the ill-fated 1920-1922 Edge Hill Light Railway.
There was talk of reopening the by then overgrown, but workable line early in to World War II but, it was decided that the Oxfordshire Ironstone line was to be considered adequate to serve the area's requirements.
