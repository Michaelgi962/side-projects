Little Laureate

Little Laureate is an American company that produces developmental, multimedia products for small children and their caregivers. It was founded in 2001 by Heather Maclean and Monica Gibson.
Premise.
Little Laureate's first products were DVD programs that promote world culture, conservation and creativity using great works of art, architecture and animals with fully scored classical music and world music. The series features animation, live footage, and a process the company has dubbed "Symphonic Art Animation," wherein onscreen visuals are animated in time to classical music. The series is hosted by an animated star named "Star."
Little Laureate products suggest they are meant to be watched with an adult, and provide adult-only special features to promote that concept. Every piece of art onscreen is identified by a caption, like music videos, that cite the name of the work and its artist. The DVD includes an onscreen written guide called "The Crawl" that resembles VH1's Pop-up Video, and is designed to give information, inspiration and humor to adult viewers. Special DVD and CD gift sets also include a 24-page parent booklet.
Baby Video Debate.
Little Laureate has largely avoided the babies-and-television debate encountered by competitors Baby Einstein and Classical Baby because it uses only art to teach instead of puppets or toys, and frequently cites a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report that early art exposure helps children learn academic and life skills.
Distribution.
Little Laureate products are distributed in the United States, Canada, Korea and Hong Kong.

Romeo (Petula Clark song)

Romeo was a 1961 hit single for Petula Clark peaking at #3 on the UK chart dated 26 August.
Despite peaking lower than her #1 UK comeback hit "Sailor", "Romeo" earned Clark her first Gold record by selling 400,000 units in the UK. In Ireland "Romeo" reached #1. Jean Broussolle who had translated Clark's precedent hit "Sailor" rendered "Romeo" as "Roméo" which became Clark's first #1 hit in France on 20 January 1962 - Clark's next two singles would also reach #1 in France where overall she'd top the charts five times.
Rina Pia (nl) recorded a Flemish rendering of "Roméo" which reached #3 on Belgium's Dutch chart in the autumn of 1962. A Czech rendering of "Romeo" was recorded in 1963 by Yvetta Simonová (cs).
An earlier English-language rendering of "Salome" by lyricist Bartley Costello entitled "Sal-o-may" had been published in 1920 but was evidently never recorded although instrumental versions of Stolz' piece were recorded under the title "Sal-o-may" by the Paul Biese Trio and also by the Joseph C Smith Orchestra in 1921.
A hit in Germany in the summer of 1961 via a recording by Lucas Quartett (de) (chart peak #20), the German-language original version of "Salome" has also been recorded by Medium-Terzett (de) (album "Weit ist die Welt"/ 1967), Harry Friedauer (de) (album ""Mit Musik Geht Alles Besser"/ 1969), Heino (album "La Montanara"/ 1973), and Extrabreit (album "Welch Ein Land! - Was Für Männer"é/ 1981), while a Finnish rendering was recorded in 1961 by Kukonpojat (fi).
An Italian version of Stolz's "Salome" entitled "Abat-jour", introduced in 1920 by Lino Ossani (it) and remade in 1958 by Aurelio Fierro, reached #4 on the Italian hit parade in September 1962 to rank as the year's #9 hit via a remake by Henry Wright (it) which bested a rival version by Milva. The success of Wright's "Abat-jour", which was perceived as a local cover version of Clark's "Romeo" prompted the decision to have Clark herself cut songs for the Italian market. 
Henry Wright's version of "Abat-jour" is prominently featured in the 1963 film "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow": Sophia Loren, playing the prostitute Mara, plays Wright's record as the background music for the strip tease she performs for a client played by Marcello Mastroianni. The 1994 film "Prêt-à-Porter" featured Loren and Mastroianni in what was in effect a remake of the strip tease scene from "Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow" with Wright's "Abat-jour" again played as background music.

When State Representative Bryan D. Holladay was elected Mayor of West Jordan in 2001, he recommended Mascaro as his replacement. Receiving the nomination from Republican Party of Utah, Mascaro ran unopposed and took office representing district 47 of the Utah House of Representatives on January 8, 2002. Facing contenders in future campaigns, he was reelected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. In 2010 he ran against Republican Ken Ivory for the Republican Party nomination, and was defeated at the county convention 77%-23%. Following his failed attempt at re-nomination he endorsed Democrat candidate John Rendell for his former seat. 
In 2008 Mascaro was one of five state representatives filing a bipartisan ethics complaint against a fellow Republican for allegedly bribing his opponent during a primary election. Shortly later, an unrelated report by a female intern about Mascaro was leaked, with the suggestion of improper conduct. Speaking to the media Mascaro dismissed the report, arguing the story was retaliation by House party leadership, who had already labeled Mascaro a "dissident Republican."

<doc id="21617148" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21617148" title="List of Philadelphia Phillies no-hitters">
List of Philadelphia Phillies no-hitters

The Philadelphia Phillies are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They play in the National League East division. Also known in their early years as the "Philadelphia Quakers", pitchers for the Phillies have thrown eleven separate no-hitters in franchise history. A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only "when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings". No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat.
Of the eleven no-hitters pitched by Phillies players, three have been won by a score of 6–0, and three by a score of 1–0, more common than any other results. The largest margin of victory in a Phillies no-hitter was ten runs, in a 10–0 win by Chick Fraser. Charlie Ferguson's no-hitter, the first in franchise history, was a 1–0 victory, as were the most recent regular season no-hitters, thrown by Kevin Millwood in 2003 and Roy Halladay in 2010. Two pitchers to throw no-hitters for the Phillies have been left-handed: Johnny Lush (in 1906) and Terry Mulholland (in 1990). The other eight pitchers were right-handed. Halladay is the only Phillies' pitcher to throw more than one no-hitter in a Phillies uniform, and others, including Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, have pitched more than one in their careers. The longest interval between Phillies no-hitters was between the games pitched by Lush and Bunning, encompassing 58 years, 1 month, and 20 days from May 1, 1906 to June 21, 1964. Conversely, the shortest interval between no-hitters was between Halladay's two 2010 no-hitters, with a total of merely four months and seven days from May 29 to October 6; the shortest gap between regular-season no-hitters was between Mulholland's and Tommy Greene's games (nine months and eight days from August 15, 1990 to May 23, 1991). Two opponents have been no-hit by the Phillies more than one time: the San Francisco Giants, who were defeated by Mulholland (in 1990) and Millwood (in 2003); and the Cincinnati Reds, who were no-hit by Rick Wise (in 1971) and Halladay (in 2010).
The umpire is also an integral part of any no-hitter. The task of the umpire in a baseball game is to make any decision "which involves judgment, such as, but not limited to, whether a batted ball is fair or foul, whether a pitch is a strike or a ball, or whether a runner is safe or out… umpire's judgment on such matters is final." Part of the duties of the umpire making calls at home plate includes defining the strike zone, which "is defined as that area over homeplate "(sic)" the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the kneecap." These calls define every baseball game and are therefore integral to the completion of any no-hitter. A different umpire presided over each of the Phillies' 11 no-hitters, including Wes Curry, who created Major League Baseball's catcher interference rule.
Two perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been pitched in Phillies history. This feat was achieved by Bunning in 1964, which was the first perfect game in the National League since 1880, and Halladay in 2010. As defined by Major League Baseball, "in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game."

Archeio-Marxism

Archeio-Marxism () was a radical left political movement that was active in interwar Greece. The main motto of its supporters was "first education and then action" and they were against mass demonstrations and unionism. They were named after the "Archive of Marxism" () magazine, that was published in 1921. 
From 1930 to 1934, the organization was a member of Trotsky's International Left Opposition, renaming itself officially as the Bolshevist-Leninist Organization of Greece. With some 2,000 members, it constituted the ILO's largest member group, and its leader, Dimitris Giotopoulos ("nom de guerre": "Witte") occupied an important position in its secretariat. 
Following Giotopoulos' quarrel with Trotsky in 1933-1934, the Archeio-Marxists left the ILO, and by the late 1930s, they became affiliated with the so-called "London Bureau". The organization survived the repression of the Metaxas Regime, but its members came under increasing attack from both right-wing groups and the KKE-led EAM-ELAS resistance front at the end of World War II and during the Greek Civil War.

<doc id="21617275" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21617275" title="Prehistory of the Philippines">
Prehistory of the Philippines

Philippine prehistory covers the events prior to the written history of what would become the Philippine archipelago. The current demarcation line between this period and the early history of the Philippines is 900 AD, which is the date of the first surviving written record to come from the Philippines, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription. This period saw the immense change that took hold of the archipelago from Stone Age cultures in the 4th century, continuing on with the gradual widening of trade until 900 and the first surviving written records.
Stone Age (c. 50,000 - c. 500 BC).
The first evidence of the systematic use of Stone-Age technologies in the Philippines is estimated to have dated back to about 50,000 BC, and this phase in the development of proto-Philippine societies is considered to end with the rise of metal tools in about 500 BC, although stone tools continued to be used past that date. Filipino Anthropologist F. Landa Jocano refers to the earliest noticeable stage in the development of proto-Philippine societies as the "Formative Phase". He also identified stone tool and ceramics making as the two core industries that defined the economic activity of the time, and which shaped the means by which early Filipinos adapted to their environment during this period.
About 30,000 BC, the Negritos, who became the ancestors of today's Aetas, or Aboriginal Filipinos, probably lived in the Philippines. No evidence has survived which would indicate details of Ancient Filipino life such as their crops, color, and architecture. Philippine historian William Henry Scott points out any theory which describes such details is therefore a pure hypothesis and should be honestly presented as such.
Callao Man (c. 41,000 BC).
The earliest human remains known in the Philippines are the fossilized remains discovered in 2007 by Armand Salvador Mijares in Callao Cave, Cagayan, Philippines. The find was of 67,000 year old remains that predate Tabon Man. Specifically, the find consisted of a single 61 millimeter metatarsal which, when dated using uranium series ablation, was found to be at least about 67,000 years old. If definitively proven to be remains of Homo sapiens, it would antedate the 47,000-year-old remains of Tabon Man to become the earliest human remains known in the Philippines, and one of the oldest human remains in the Asia Pacific.
Tabon Man (c. 24000 or 22,000 BC).
Fossilized fragments of a skull and jawbone of three individuals had been discovered on May 28, 1962 by Dr. Robert B. Fox, an American anthropologist of the National Museum. These fragments are collectively called "Tabon Man" after the place where they were found on the west coast of Palawan. Tabon Cave appears to be a kind of Stone Age factory, with both finished stone flake tools and waste core flakes having been found at four separate levels in the main chamber. Charcoal left from three assemblages of cooking fires there has been Carbon-14 dated to roughly 7,000, 20,000, and 22,000 BC. (In Mindanao, the existence and importance of these prehistoric tools was noted by famed José Rizal himself, because of his acquaintance with Spanish and German scientific archaeologists in the 1880s, while in Europe.)
Tabon Cave is named after the "Tabon Bird" (Tabon Scrubfowl, Megapodius Cumingii), which deposited thick hard layers of guano during periods when the cave was uninhabited so that succeeding groups of tool-makers settled on a cement-like floor of bird dung. That the inhabitants were actually engaged in tool manufacture is indicated that about half of the 3,000 recovered specimens examined are discarded cores of a material which had to be transported from some distance. The Tabon man fossils are considered to have come from a third group of inhabitants, who worked the cave between 22,000 and 20,000 BC. An earlier cave level lies so far below the level containing cooking fire assemblages that it must represent Upper Pleistocene dates like 45 or 50 thousand years ago.
Physical anthropologists who have examined the Tabon Man skullcap have agreed that it belonged to modern man, homo sapiens, as distinguished from the mid-Pleistocene Homo erectus species. This indicates that Tabon Man was "Pre-Mongoloid" ("Mongoloid" being the term anthropologists apply to the racial stock which entered Southeast Asia during the Holocene and absorbed earlier peoples to produce the modern Malay, Indonesian, Filipino, and "Pacific" peoples). Two experts have given the opinion that the mandible is "Australian" in physical type, and that the skullcap measurements are most nearly like the Ainus or Tasmanians. Nothing can be concluded about Tabon man's physical appearance from the recovered skull fragments except that he was not a Negrito.
The custom of Jar Burial, which ranges from Sri Lanka, to the Plain of Jars, in Laos, to Japan, also was practiced in the Tabon caves. A spectacular example of a secondary burial jar is owned by the National Museum, a "National Treasure", with a jar lid topped with two figures, one the deceased, arms crossed, hands touching the shoulders, the other a steersman, both seated in a "proa", with only the mast missing from the piece. Secondary burial was practiced across all the islands of the Philippines during this period, with the bones reburied, some in the burial jars. Seventy-eight earthenware vessels were recovered from the Manunggul cave, Palawan, specifically for burial.
Migration theories.
There have been several models of early human migration to the Philippines. Since H. Otley Beyer first proposed his wave migration theory, numerous scholars have approached the question of how, when and why humans first came to the Philippines. The question of whether the first humans arrived from the south (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei as suggested by Beyer) or from the north (via Taiwan as suggested by the Austronesian theory) has been a subject of heated debate for decades. As new discoveries come to light, past hypotheses are reevaluated and new theories constructed.
Beyer's wave migration theory.
The first, and most widely known theory of the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines is that of H. Otley Beyer, founder of the Anthropology Department of the University of the Philippines. According to Dr. Beyer, the ancestors of the Filipinos came to the islands first via land bridges which would occur during times when the sea level was low, and then later in seagoing vessels such as the balangay. Thus he differentiated these ancestors as arriving in different "waves of migration", as follows:
Beyer's theory, while still popular among lay Filipinos, has been generally been disputed by anthropologists and historians. Reasons for doubting it are founded on Beyer's use of 19th century scientific methods of progressive evolution and migratory diffusion as the basis for his hypothesis. These methods have since been proven to be too simple and unreliable to explain the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines.
Objections to the land bridges theory.
In February 1976, Fritjof Voss, a German scientist who studied the geology of the Philippines, questioned the validity of the theory of land bridges. He maintained that the Philippines was never part of mainland Asia. He claimed that it arose from the bottom of the sea and, as the thin Pacific crust moved below it, continued to rise. It continues to rise today. The country lies along great Earth faults that extend to deep submarine trenches. The resulting violent earthquakes caused what is now the land masses forming the Philippines to rise to the surface of the sea. Dr. Voss also pointed out that when scientific studies were done on the Earth's crust from 1964 to 1967, it was discovered that the 35-kilometer- thick crust underneath China does not reach the Philippines. Thus, the latter could not have been a land bridge to the Asian mainland. The matter of who the first settlers were has not been really resolved. This is being disputed by anthropologists, as well as Professor H. Otley Beyer, who claims that the first inhabitants of the Philippines came from the Malay Peninsula. The Malays now constitute the largest portion of the populace and what Filipinos now have is an Austronesian culture.
Philippine historian William Henry Scott has pointed out that Palawan and the Calamianes Islands are separated from Borneo by water nowhere deeper than 100 meters, that south of a line drawn between Saigon and Brunei does the depth of the South China Sea nowhere exceeds 100 meters, and that the Strait of Malacca reaches 50 meters only at one point. Scott also asserts that the Sulu Archipelago is not the peak of a submerged mountain range connecting Mindanao and Borneo, but the exposed edge of three small ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom in recent geologic times. According to Scott, it is clear that Palawan and the Calamianes do not stand on a submerged land bridge, but were once a hornlike protuberance on the shoulder of a continent whose southern shoreline used to be the present islands of Java and Borneo. Mindoro and the Calamianes are separated by a channel more than 500 meters deep
Bellwood's Austronesian diffusion theory.
This model suggests that between 4500 BC and 4000 BC, developments in agricultural technology in the Yunnan Plateau in China created pressures which drove certain peoples to migrate to Taiwan. These people either already had or began to develop a unique language of their own, now referred to as Proto-Austronesian.
By around 3000 BC, these groups started differentiating into three or four distinct subcultures, and by 2500 to 1500 BC, one of these groups began migrating southwards towards the Philippines and Indonesia, reaching as far as Borneo and the Moluccas by 1500 BC, forming new cultural groupings and developing unique languages.
By 1500 BC, some of these groups started migrating west, reaching as far as Madagascar around the 1st millennium. Others migrated east, settling as far as Easter Island by the mid-13th century, giving the Austronesian language group the distinction of being the most widely distributed language groups in the world at that time, in terms of the geographical span of the homelands of its languages.
According to this theory, the peoples of the Philippines are the descendants of those cultures who remained on the Philippine islands when others moved first southwards, then eastward and westward.
Solheim's Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network (NMTCN) or island origin theory.
Wilhelm Solheim's concept of the Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network (NMTCN), while not strictly a theory regarding the biological ancestors of modern Southeast Asians, does suggest that the patterns of cultural diffusion throughout the Asia-Pacific region are not what would be expected if such cultures were to be explained by simple migration. Where Bellwood based his analysis primarily on linguistic analysis, Solheim's approach was based on artifact findings. On the basis of a careful analysis of artifacts, he suggests the existence of a trade and communication network that first spread in the Asia-Pacific region during its Neolithic age (c.8,000 to 500 BC). According to Solheim's NMTCN theory, this trade network, consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian seafaring peoples, was responsible for the spread of cultural patterns throughout the Asia-Pacific region, not the simple migration proposed by the Out-of-Taiwan hypothesis. 
Solheim came up with four geographical divisions delineating the spread of the NMTCN over time, calling these geographical divisions "lobes." Specifically, these were the central, northern, eastern and western lobes.
The central lobe was further divided into two smaller lobes reflecting phases of cultural spread: the Early Central Lobe and the Late Central Lobe. Instead of Austronesian peoples originating from Taiwan, Solheim placed the origins of the early NMTCN peoples in the "Early Central Lobe," which was in eastern coastal Vietnam, at around 9000 BC.
He then suggests the spread of peoples around 5000 BC towards the "Late central lobe", including the Philippines, via island Southeast Asia, rather than from the north as the Taiwan theory suggests. Thus, from the Point of view of the Philippine peoples, the NMTCN is also referred to as the "Island Origin Theory".
This "late central lobe" included southern China and Taiwan, which became ""the area where Austronesian became the original language family and
Malayo-Polynesian developed."" In about 4000 to 3000 BC, these peoples continued spreading east through Northern Luzon to Micronesia to form the Early Eastern Lobe, carrying the Malayo-Polynesian languages with them. These languages would become part of the culture spread by the NMTCN in its expansions Malaysia and western towards Malaysia before 2000 BC, continuing along coastal India and Sri Lanka up to the western coast of Africa and
Madagascar; and over time, further eastward towards its easternmost borders at Easter Island. Thus, as in the case of Bellwood's theory, the Austronesian languages spread eastward and westward from the area around the Philippines. Aside from the matter of the origination of peoples, the difference between the two theories is that Bellwood's theory suggests a linear expansion, while Solheim's suggests something more akin to concentric circles, all overlapping in the geographical area of the late central lobe which includes the Philippines.
Jocano's local origins theory.
Another alternative model is that asserted by anthropologist F. Landa Jocano of the University of the Philippines, who in 2001 contended that the existing fossil evidence of ancient humans demonstrates that they not only migrated to the Philippines, but also to New Guinea, Borneo, and Australia. In reference to Beyer's wave model, he points out that there is no definitive way to determine the "race" of the human fossils; the only certain thing is that the discovery of Tabon Man proves that the Philippines was inhabited as early as 21,000 or 22,000 years ago. If this is true, the first inhabitants of the Philippines would not have come from the Malay Peninsula. Instead, Jocano postulates that the present Filipinos are products of the long process of evolution and movement of people. He also adds that this is also true of Indonesians and Malaysians, with none among the three peoples being the dominant carrier of culture. In fact, he suggests that the ancient humans who populated Southeast Asia cannot be categorized under any of these three groups. He thus further suggests that it is not correct to consider Filipino culture as being Malayan in orientation.
Genetic studies.
2001 Stanford University study.
A Stanford University study conducted during 2001 revealed that Haplogroup O3-M122 (labeled as "Haplogroup L" in this study) is the most common Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup found among Filipinos. This particular haplogroup is also predominant among Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese. Another haplogroup, Haplogroup O1a-M119 (labeled as "Haplogroup H" in this study), is also found among Filipinos. The rates of Haplogroup O1a are highest among the Taiwanese aborigines, and Chamic-speaking people. Genetic data found among a sampling of Filipinos may indicate some relation to the Ami tribe of Taiwan.
2008 Leeds University study.
A 2008 genetic study showed no evidence of a large-scale Taiwanese migration into the Philippine Islands. A study by Leeds University and published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, showed that mitochondrial DNA lineages have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) since modern humans arrived approximately 50,000 years ago. Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands into Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.
A 2002 China Medical University study indicated that some Filipinos shared genetic chromosome that is found among Asian people, such as Taiwanese aborigines, Indonesians, Thais, and Chinese.
A variety of research study by the University of the Philippines, genetic chromosome were found in Filipinos which are shared by people from different parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The predominant genotype detected was SC, the Southeast Asian genotype. However, only about 50 urine samples were collected for the study, far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results.
These indigenous elements in the Filipino's genetic makeup serve as clues to the patterns of migration throughout Philippine prehistory. After the 16th century, of course, the colonial period saw the influx of genetic influence from Europeans. During the above mentioned study conducted by Stanford University Asia-Pacific Research Center, it was stated that 3.6% of the Philippine population has varying degrees of European ancestry from Spanish, and American colonization. 
However, only 28 individuals from the Philippines were genotyped for this study, again a sample size far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results in a population of over 90 million individuals.
Proto-Austronesians.
Before the expansion out of Taiwan, recent archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence has linked Austronesian speakers in Insular Southeast Asia to cultures such as the Hemudu and Dapenkeng in Neolithic China. 
5000-2000 BC—Austronesian speakers arrive.
Historian William Henry Scott has observed that, based on lexicostatistical analysis involving seven million word pairs, linguist Isidore Dyen offered in 1962 two alternative scenarios explaining the origin and spread of Austronesian languages: (a) that they originated in some Pacific island and spread westward to Asia, or (b) that they originated in Taiwan and spread southward. Based on subsequent study of the second alternative, Scott concludes that the Philippine language tree could have been introduced by Austronesian speakers as long ago as 5000 BC, probably from the north, with their descendants expanding throughout the Philippine archipelago and beyond in succeeding millennia, absorbing or replacing sparse populations already present, and their language diversifying into dozens of mutually unintelligible languages which replaced earlier ones. During those millennia, other Austronesian speakers entered the Philippines in large enough numbers to leave a linguistic mark but not to replace established languages. Scott suggested that if this scenario is correct all present Philippine languages (except for Sama–Bajaw languages, which probably have more speakers outside the Philippines than within) were produced within the archipelago, none of them being introduced by separate migration, and all of them having more in common with each other than with languages outside of the Philippines.
Early Metal Age (c. 500 BC - c. 1 AD).
The earliest metal tools in the Philippines were said to have first been used somewhere around 500 BC, and this new technology coincided with considerable changes in the lifestyle of early Filipinos. The new tools brought about a more stable way of life, and created more opportunities for communities to grow, both in terms of size and cultural development.
Where communities once consisted of small bands of kinsmen living in campsites, larger villages came about- usually based near water, which made traveling and trading easier. The resulting ease of contact between communities meant that they began to share similar cultural traits, something which had not previously been possible when the communities consisted only of small kinship groups.
Jocano refers to the period between 500 BC and 1 AD as the "incipient phase," which for the first time in the artifact record, sees the presence of artifacts that are similar in design from site to site throughout the archipelago. Along with the use of metal tools, this era also saw significant improvement in pottery technology.
100 BC onward.
Iron age finds in Philippines also point to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C.
Ptolemy locates the islands of Chryse east of the "Khruses Kersonenson", the "Golden Peninsula," i.e. the Malaya Peninsula. North of Chryse in the "Periplus" was "Thin", which some consider the first European reference to China. Scholars however know that Thin or Gin as in Gintu - "Suvarnadvipa" originates from Chinese word for gold "jin") Chinese have traded with and settled in Philippines thousands of years before West even knew of this area. In about the 200 BC, there arose a practice of using gold eye covers, and then, gold facial orifice covers to adorn the dead resulting in an increase of ancient gold finds.
During the Qin dynasty and the Tang dynasty, China was well aware of the golden lands far to the south. The Buddhist pilgrim "I-Tsing" mentions "Chin-Chou", "Isle of Gold" in the archipelago south of China on his way back from India. Medieval Muslims refer to the islands as the Kingdoms of Zabag and Wakwak as rich in gold, referring to the eastern islands of the Malay archipelago, the location of present-day Philippines and Eastern Indonesia.
Thalassocracies and international trade (200 AD onwards).
The emergence of "Barangay" city-states and trade (200-500).
Since at least the 3rd century, the indigenous peoples were in contact with other Southeast Asian and East Asian nations.
Fragmented ethnic groups established numerous city-states formed by the assimilation of several small political units known as "barangay" each headed by a "Datu" or headman (still in use among non-Hispanic Filipino ethnic groups) and answerable to a king, titled Rajah. Even scattered barangays, through the development of inter-island and international trade, became more culturally homogeneous by the 4th century. Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion flourished among the noblemen in this era. Many of the "barangay" were, to varying extents, under the "de jure" jurisprudence of one of several neighboring empires, among them the Malay Sri Vijaya, Javanese Majapahit, Brunei, Melaka empires, although "de facto" had established their own independent system of rule. Trading links with Sumatra, Borneo, Thailand, Java, China, India, Arabia, Japan and the Ryukyu Kingdom flourished during this era. A thalassocracy had thus emerged based on international trade.
Each barangay consisted of about 100 families. Some barangays were big, such as "Zubu" (Cebu), Butuan, "Maktan" (Mactan),"Mandani" (Mandaue), "Lalan" (Liloan), "Irong-Irong" (Iloilo), "Bigan" (Vigan), and "Selurong" (Manila). Each of these big barangays had a population of more than 2,000.
In the earliest times, the items which were prized by the peoples included jars, which were a symbol of wealth throughout South Asia, and later metal, salt and tobacco. In exchange, the peoples would trade feathers, rhino horn, hornbill beaks, beeswax, birds nests, resin, rattan.2
In the period between the 7th century to the beginning of the 15th century, numerous prosperous centers of trade had emerged, including the Kingdom of Namayan which flourished alongside Manila Bay,
^ .</ref> Cebu, Iloilo, Butuan, the Kingdom of Sanfotsi situated in Pangasinan, the Kingdoms of Zabag and Wak-Wak situated in Pampanga and Aparri (which specialized in trade with Japan and the Kingdom of Ryukyu in Okinawa).
Introduction of metal.
The introduction of metal into the Philippines and the resulting changes did not follow the typical pattern. Robert Fox notes, ""There is, for example, no real evidence of a "Bronze Age" or "Copper-Bronze Age" in the archipelago, a development which occurred in many areas of the world. The transition, as shown by recent excavation, was from stone tools to iron tools.""
The earliest use of metal in the Philippines was the use of copper for ornamentation, not tools. Even when copper and bronze tools became common, they were often used side by side with stone tools. Metal only became the dominant material for tools late in this era, leading to a new phase in cultural development.
Bronze tools from the Philippines' early metal age have been encountered in various sites, but they were not widespread. This has been attributed to the lack of a local source of tin, which when combined with copper produces bronze. This lack has led most anthropologists to conclude that bronze items were imported and that those bronze smelting sites which have been found in the Philippines, in Palawan, were for re-smelting and remolding.
Introduction of iron.
Iron age finds in Philippines also point to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C. When iron was introduced to the Philippines, it became the preferred material for tools and largely ended the use of stone tools. Whether the iron was imported or mined locally is still debated by scholars. Beyer thought that it was mined locally, but others point to the lack of iron smelting artifacts and conclude that the iron tools were probably imported.
Metalsmiths from this era had already developed a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through carburization.
Archeological sources.
Until very recently, Philippine historians and anthropologists have been limited to the rare artifact discovered since the 19th century. During the Spanish colonial era, which began in 1521, many artifacts were destroyed or re-used. A good example is the Spanish walled city of Intramuros in Manila, whose stone bricks were taken from the original city wall of pre-Hispanic "Maynila". As new evidence is discovered, old theories are adapted or new ones developed, which has led to numerous and sometimes conflicting theories about the prehistory of the Philippines. In short, the lack of artifacts and other evidence has led to a lack of consensus among prehistory historians.

Burma Bazaar

Burma Bazaar is a market run by Burmese refugees in Chennai, India. It is located at Parrys Corner. The bazaar was set up in 1969 by the Government of Tamil Nadu. It is located just outside the Chennai Beach railway station, in the old financial district of the city at George Town. It is a row of about 200 shops that line either side of the road for about a kilometre.
History.
Burma Bazaar was established by Burmese immigrants, who were Tamil refugees who fled Myanmar during the early 1960s. The government set aside land for the Tamil refugees returning from Burma during the 1960s. The bazaar is run by the Burma Tamizhar Marumalarchi Sangam, an association that has been set up to look after the interests of the traders since 1966.
The bazaar.
The bazaar extends to about a kilometre along the Chennai Beach railway station. There are an estimated 200 shops in the bazaar. With several passengers coming out of the station every few minutes, the market appears busy all the time. It is estimated that over 100,000 people pass through this corridor every week.

Salvia repens

Salvia repens is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern South Africa, growing at elevations between 1,500-8,000 feet in open country and amongst shrubs. It has also adapted to grassland, grassy slopes, and shale banks. It was described and named by botanist George Bentham in 1833, with "repens" referring to the creeping rootstock. 
"Salvia repens" is small and upright, reaching 2 feet, high with branched erect stems. The slender oblong leaves appear torn on the edges. The 1 foot inflorescence has spaced whorls of 6-8 flowers, which vary in color from purple or deep blue to white. The calyx and leaves have oil glands the give off an herblike fragrance when brushed. In cultivation it can spread rapidly and take over a large area.

<doc id="21617375" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21617375" title="Kallar (caste)">
Kallar (caste)

The Kallar (or Kallan, formerly spelled as Colleries) are one of the three related castes of southern India which constitute the Mukkulathor confederacy. The Kallar, along with the Maravar and Akamudayar, constitute a united social caste on the basis of parallel professions, though their locations and heritages are wholly separate from one another.
Etymology.
"Kallar" is a Tamil language word meaning "thief". Their history has included periods of banditry. Other proposed etymological origins include "black skinned", "hero", and "toddy-tappers".
The anthropologist Susan Bayly notes that the name, as with that of Maravar, was a title bestowed by Tamil poligars (warrior-chiefs) on pastoral peasants who acted as their armed retainers. The majority of those poligars, who during the late 17th- and 18th-centuries controlled much of the Telugu region as well as the Tamil area, had themselves come from the Kallar, Maravar and Vaduga communities. "Kallar" is synonymous with the western Indian term, "Koli", having connotations of thievery but also of upland pastoralism. According to Bayly, "Kallar" should be considered a "title of rural groups in Tamil Nadu with warrior-pastoralist ancestral traditions."
Caste origins.
Bayly notes that the Kallar and Maravar identities as a caste, rather than as a title, "... were clearly not ancient facts of life in the Tamil Nadu region. Insofar as these people of the turbulent poligar country really did become castes, their bonds of affinity were shaped in the relatively recent past." Prior to the late 18th-century, their exposure to Brahmanic Hinduism, the concept of varna and practices such as endogamy that define the Indian caste system was minimal. Thereafter, the evolution as a caste developed as a result of various influences, including increased interaction with other groups as a consequence of jungle clearances, state-building and ideological shifts.
Culture.
Among the traditional customs of the Kallar noted by colonial officials was the use of the "collery stick" (), a bent throwing stick or "false boomerang" which could be thrown up to 100 yards. Though described as a "false" boomerang, other writers indicate that it was capable of returning to its thrower, and also noted the weapon was used in deer-hunting. Writing in 1957, Louis Dumont noted that despite the weapon's frequent mention in literature, it had disappeared amongst the Pramalai Kallar.
Diet.
The Kallar were traditionally a non-vegetarian people, though a 1970s survey of Tamil Nadu indicated that 30% of Kallar surveyed, though non-vegetarian, refrained from eating fish after puberty. Meat, though present in the Kallar diet, was not frequently eaten but restricted to Saturday nights and festival days. Even so, this small amount of meat was sufficient to affect perceptions of Kallar social status.

Drosera tubaestylis

Drosera tubaestylis is a perennial tuberous species in the genus "Drosera" that is endemic to Western Australia. It grows in a rosette about 2 to 3 cm in diameter. It is native to an area near Perth. It grows in fine sandy clay soils at the margins of swamps. It is considered to be related to "D. bulbosa". The species is named for the trumpet-shaped style apices. It was first formally described by Allen Lowrie and N. G. Marchant in 1992.

Baladine Klossowska

Baladine Klossowska or Kłossowska (born in 1886 as Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro, died in 1969) was a European painter. She was the mother of the artist Balthus and the writer Pierre Klossowski, and the last lover of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke.
She was born Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) to a Jewish family; her father, Abraham Beer Spiro, was a cantor, who moved his family from Korelichi in Novogrudok district of Minsk Governorate to Breslau in 1873. In Breslau, he was appointed a Chief cantor of the White Stork synagogue (Synagoga pod Białym Bocianem) — one of the two main synagogues of the city.
She married the painter and art historian Erich Klossowski; the couple moved to Paris, where their sons were born — Pierre in 1905 and Balthasar in 1908. Elisabeth Spiro Klossowski pursued her own artistic career under the name Baladine Klossowska; she preferred life in France and lived there through much of her later life.
The Klossowskis were forced to leave France in 1914, at the start of World War I, due to their German passports. The couple separated permanently in 1917; Klossowska took her sons to Switzerland. They moved to Berlin in 1921 due to financial pressures. Mother and sons returned to Paris in 1924, where the three lived a materially marginal existence, often dependent upon help from friends and relations.
Klossowska met Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) in 1919. At the time, Rilke was emerging from a severe depression that had kept him from writing for several years during and after World War I. The two pursued an intense but episodic romance that lasted until Rilke's death from leukemia in 1926. During this time, Rilke had written in what he called "a savage creative storm" his two most important collections of poetry, the "Duino Elegies" and "Sonnets to Orpheus", both published in 1923. During their romance, Rilke called Klossowska by the pet name "Merline" in their correspondence—first published in 1954.

Idionymon

The term idionymon (, "special illegal act", "delictum sui generis") was defined by a Greek law, voted in 1929 (Law 4229), after being introduced by the Eleftherios Venizelos government. It was a law "concerning safety measures for the social establishment and protection of the freedom". It was aiming to penalize the "insurrectional" ideas and in particular to fire prosecution against communists, anarchists and enforce repression against the unionist mobilizations. 
The law prescribed a penalty for more than six months imprisonment for everyone "who tries to apply ideas that have as an obvious target the violent overthrow of the current social system, or who acts in propagandizing their application...". It was the first legal measure against the Communist Party of Greece and initiated a series of urgent legislation acts, established by the Greek state against the left wing. The "idionymon" accusation was enough for the government to ban and dissolve most of the workers organizations at the end of 1930. According to the law, the strike was no more a means for promoting political requests, but a disturbance of the social peace and unionism was an illegal act. 
The establishment of the "idionymon" resulted from the perceived need to defend the gains of the (partially completed) reformation towards a bourgeois democracy in Greece, mainly led by Venizelos' Liberal party. The Second Hellenic Republic was inherently unstable, and furthermore, by the late 1920s, the old political dualism between Venizelists and Royalists was beginning to be threatened by agitation in the emerging working class. The defeat of the Asia Minor Campaign in 1922, which resulted in the arrival of over 1.5 million refugees, mostly impoverished and living in atrocious conditions, resulted in the emergence, for the first time, of a large urban working class, to whom the radical/communist ideas of the Russian Revolution might appeal.
Two of the leaders of the liberal opposition in Parliament, Alexandros Papanastasiou and Georgios Kafantaris, had expressed strong disagreement during the vote. It is remarkable that Eleftherios Venizelos rejected Papanastasiou's proposal to use "idionymon" not only against communists, but also against fascists, although it is perhaps understandable in light of their low political presence in Greece (relative to socialists) and Venizelos' ongoing diplomatic rapprochement with Fascist Italy. 
Following the establishment of the dictatorial "4th of August Regime" in 1936, the "idionymon" formed the basis for Compulsory Law 117/1936, which featured harsher provisions, including five-year jail terms and internal exile.

Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty

Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty (born 1969) is an award-winning Assiniboine Sioux bead worker and porcupine quill worker, who creates traditional Northern Plains regalia.
Background.
Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty was born in Castro Valley, California in 1969; however, her family comes from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, where Juanita spent much of her childhood. 
Her mother, Joyce Growing Thunder Fogarty, is also an acclaimed bead and quill artist and the only artist to have won best of show three times at the Santa Fe Indian Market. Both artists come from a long line of Plains Indians bead workers. Juanita learned skills from her mother and has been beading since the age of three.
Artwork.
Fogarty creates traditional Plains clothing and accessories, such as purses, pipe bags, dolls, cradle boards, rifle scabbards, and knife cases – all adorned with beadwork or porcupine quill embroidery.
Her quillwork is labor-intensive. She gathers her own quills from freshly killed porcupines, then washes and dyes them. She uses both synthetic and natural dyes, such as bloodroot, blackberries, and wolf moss. Sorting the quills by color and size is the lengthiest step in the process. The quills are then softened in a bath of warm water, and Fogarty flattens them with her own teeth. She then appliqués or wraps the quills to moose or deer hide to create intricate patterns.
The designs of her artwork can are both abstract and realistic and are based on nature, daily life, and the mythology of her tribes. She says that traditional designs of her tribe would, "reflect what the people saw, and what they had going on in their lives at the time ... maybe somebody in their family had gone to war or battle."
Fogarty has won best of class four times at the Santa Fe Indian Market. She also dances at powwows in regalia created by her family over the course of seven years. Today she lives in North San Juan, California.

Kohi Safi District

Kohi Safi or "Sapi Ghar" is now one major historical district located in South-eastern Parwan province, Kohi Safi district is one of the most single districts where almost all of the region is populated by Safi tribe. Although in 1930s Kohi Safi was said to be one of the 2nd most populous district of Parwan after Charakar, but during 1930s-40s the region was depopulated due to Governments pressure to evacuation of area due to Saf's War on the King. Majority of its population were displaced or escaped further in the north away from borders of capital Kabul, few escaped to west in modern Herat and many into it India (After 1947 came to be Pakistan). The root of the conflict seems to be started due to King Amanuallah Khan's proposal of modernization, Safi and with few other Afghan tribes armed against the ruling family of Durrani. Although some annalists assume the other factor behind the conflict and rise of Safi was mainly due to Safi's not being of ruling Durrani tribe, but rather Shinwari. Although Majority of Shinwari's enjoyed presence of Durrani and many were often involved into Government compare to those of Ghilzai, however Safis are always known to have history of conflict with many ruling governments and empires.
History and Population.
The Kohi Safi district is mainly a mountain area, considered to be a small region of the greater Kohistan region. The name of the district was known to have been mentioned going back as far as the 15th century, it was Sikandar Lodi's personal physician Qulam Adam Mohammad Shahid Mirza mentioning that someone should be sent to Kabul in the land of Saphystan to bring Herbal medicine. Perhaps the Indian medician's Islamic name "Laooq Sapistan" derived its name from Saphystan of greater Kabul also known as Kabulistan. Kohi Safi along with most of Eastern regions of Parwan region which was part of greater Kohistan region was also well known during Moghal era as the Saphystan land of Safi. Although the modern Kohi Safi district is smaller both in size and population, but prior to Safi war it carried a much larger population.
Rebuilding.
Prior to the rule of Mohammed Nadir Shah majority of Safi and including high class ruling tribal leaders used to settle in Kohi Safi, during the invasion of the Soviets, Kohi Safi was further depopulated, and many infrastructures were destroyed. During the Taliban, Kohi Safi along with Khan Tota was where the Taliban have concentrated their resources, both districts came under heavy bombing during the US air offensives in 2001. From 2001-2003 the roads from Kabul to Kohi-Safi were known to be heaven for robbers, gangsters, and anti-US militants, ever since 2004 with many elected members of Safi Clan in the government, many projects were proposed, to make Safi district the next Kardi-see of Kabul. Although major developments are on the way, so far major roads, clean water, and part-time electricity, has been provided to the people of Kohi Safi.

Cyber defamation law

Cyber defamation is not a specific criminal offense, misdemeanor or tort, but rather defamation or slander conducted via digital media, usually through the Internet. 
Penalties for 'Cyber defamation' vary from country to country, but the fundamental rights covered in the UN Declaration of Human Rights and European Union Fundamental Human Rights.
Stopping or addressing defamation can be difficult. If the person has no serious grudge, then a cease and desist letter may stop the behavior and get the statements removed from the Internet. On the other hand, if the person is acting out of spite, it may be necessary to file a report with the police depending on local law.
South Korea.
The cyber defamation law that the Korean government pursues allows police to crack down on hateful comments without any reports from victims. The only country where such cyber defamation law is being implemented is China. South Korea is the first democratic country in the process of introducing the law.
The Korea Communications Commission (KCC), South Korea's telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, has been considering revising the current Telecommunications Law and put more regulations and deeper scrutiny on major Internet portals.
Controversies.
There have been talks about introducing the stricter laws in cyberspace. A famous celebrity's suicide in South Korea, triggered the controversies once again as to whether such law is necessary. The law supported by the governing Grand National Party (GNP), if implemented, will allow police to investigate the cyber defamation cases without any complaints of the victims. The opposition Democratic Party has been against the introduction of such law.
Survey.
A Research & Research survey of 800 Korean people conducted on Jan. 14, 2009 showed that 60% supported the GNP-led bill dealing with cyber defamation, and 32.1% opposed it.
Celebrities' suicide.
Some Korean celebrities have suffered from severe depression, caused in part by malicious online comments, before committing suicide.

<doc id="21617886" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21617886" title="SM UB-10">
SM UB-10

SM "UB-10" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I.
"UB-10" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-10" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-10" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched in February 1915 and commissioned as SM "UB-10" in March. The U-boat was the first of her class to commence operations when she entered service on 27 March 1915.
"UB-10" was the first boat assigned to the Flanders Flotilla, the unit in which she spent her entire career. Her first two commanders were Otto Steinbrinck and Reinhold Saltzwedel, fifth and eleventh, respectively, among the top-scoring German submarine commanders of the war. "UB-10" was credited with sinking 37 ships, about two-thirds of them British fishing vessels. The first ship sunk, the neutral Dutch steamer , provoked outrage in the Netherlands and helped turn Dutch public opinion against Germany. That sinking was also the impetus behind a renewed effort to avoid attacking neutral ships by U-boats. In a 13-day span in July and August 1915, "UB-10" sank 23 ships, and by herself accounted for nearly all of the tonnage sunk by the Flanders Flotilla in the latter month. She was also responsible for sinking the British destroyer in August 1916. "UB-10" had two close calls with British submarines near the Schouwen Bank off Zeebrugge in 1916 and 1917, but survived both.
By 1918, "UB-10" had been converted into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. "UB-10" was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when the bases in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-10" was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began. "UB-10" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November. As built, "UB-10" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-10" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-10" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-10"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-10" was complete at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of "UB-10" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-10" was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-10" on 15 March 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See (Oblt.) Otto Steinbrinck the 26-year-old former skipper of . On 27 March, "UB-10" became the first UB I boat to begin operations, and the first U-boat attached to the Flanders Flotilla () when it was organized on 29 March. When "UB-10" began operations, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom, were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
The UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla were initially limited to patrols in the Hoofden, the southern portion of the North Sea between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. made the first sortie of the flotilla on 9 April, and "UB-10" departed on her first patrol soon after. On 14 April, Steinbrinck and "UB-10" sank their first ship, the 2,040-ton Dutch steamer , west of the North Hinder Lightship. Although no one was killed in the attack, the attack on a neutral ship sailing between neutral ports—"Katwijk" was sailing from Rotterdam to Baltimore—provoked outrage among the Dutch population. The sinking of "Katwijk" and other Dutch ships sharply turned public opinion in the Netherlands against Germany. As a direct result of "UB-10"s sinking of "Katwijk", and to avoid further provoking the Dutch or other neutrals (primarily the United States), the German government issued an order on 18 April that no neutral vessels were to be attacked. The German government later paid compensation for the sinking of "Katwijk".
It was early June before "UB-10" sank her next ship. The Belgian ship "Menapier", carrying a load of iron ore from Algiers for Middlesbrough, was torpedoed and sunk off North Foreland by Steinbrinck on the 7th. Of the 23 persons on board the 1,886-ton ship, only 6 were saved. "Menapier"s master, his wife, and six-year-old daughter; the first mate; the pilot; and 12 other crewmen perished in the attack.
After "UB-10"s sister boat pioneered a route through British anti-submarine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover on 21 and 22 June, boats of the flotilla began to patrol into the English Channel. , , and "UB-10" soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but were hampered by fog and bad weather. Even though none of the boats sank any ships, by successfully completing their voyages, they helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.
On 30 June, Steinbrinck and the crew of "UB-10", which was back patrolling in the North Sea, had a busy day when they sank eight British fishing vessels ranging from 43 to while patrolling between east of Lowestoft. All eight of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-10", and sunk with explosives.
August 1915.
"UB-10" began August 1915 by capturing and burning "Alert"—another British fishing smack—off Lowestoft on the 1st. The same day, "Fulgens", a 2,512-ton collier, was torpedoed one nautical mile (1.8 km) from Palling; the crew of the ship—"UB-10"s largest victim to-date—were all saved.
On 8 August, "UB-10" captured and sank two more smacks—"Arbor Vitae" and "Xmas Rose"—off Lowestoft, and followed that up by sinking the largest ship of her career two days later. The "Rosalie", headed from Shields for San Francisco, was torpedoed from the Blankeney Buoy. A contemporary news account reported that "Rosalie" had been beached, but was apparently irreparably damaged; all her crew, however, was saved.
On 11 August, one day after sinking "Rosalie", Steinbrinck and the crew of "UB-10" bettered their 30 June activities by sinking ten fishing smacks off Cromer. All ten ships, which ranged in size from 41 to 62 tons, were boarded and sunk by explosives. With these ten ships, the August tally for Steinbrinck and "UB-10" was 7,309 tons, which accounted for nearly all of the 7,709 tons sunk by Flanders Flotilla boats that month. In addition, counting the ships sunk at the end of July, "UB-10" sank 23 ships in a 13-day span, nearly half the 55 ships sunk by the flotilla in both July and August.
End of the first submarine offensive.
On 18 August, the chief of the "Admiralstab", Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, issued orders suspending the first offensive. The suspension was in response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915, along with other high profile sinkings in August and September. Holtzendorff's directive ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. "UB-10" did not sink another ship for the next four months.
On 20 December, "UB-10" sank the last two ships under Steinbrinck's command. The 512-ton "Belford" and the 1,153-ton "Huntly" were both torpedoed off Boulogne; there were no casualties on "Belford", but two men on "Huntly" died in the attack. The "Huntly" was former German hospital ship "Ophelia" which was seized by English naval forces and renamed the previous year.
On 13 January 1916, Steinbrinck was succeeded by "Oblt." Reinhold Saltzwedel in command of "UB-10". Steinbrinck, who went on to command three more U-boats throughout the rest of the war—, , and —continued the successes he had in command of "UB-10". At war's end he was fifth among the top-scoring German submarine commanders of the war, with a tally of 210,000 tons of shipping to his credit. Saltzwedel, Steinbrinck's 26-year-old replacement, was an eight-year veteran of the "Kaiserliche Marine" and a first-time U-boat commander.
Second submarine offensive.
By early 1916, the British blockade of Germany was beginning to have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German "Admiralstab" were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.
"UB-10"s first victim in the new offensive (and Saltzwedel's first as a commander), came on 19 March when the U-boat torpedoed "Port Dalhousie", a 1,744-ton Canadian steamer, from the Kentish Knock Lightvessel. Nineteen men on the ship—headed from Middlesbrough to Nantes with a cargo of steel billets—were lost in the attack; the mate, a pilot, and five crewmen were rescued. About two weeks later, "UB-10" torpedoed and sank the Norwegian steamer "Peter Hanre" in nearly the same location; fourteen men on the 1,081-ton cargo ship were lost. Near the end of April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there. "Port Dalhousie" and "Peter Hanre" were the only ships sunk by "UB-10" during the six-week offensive.
Grand Fleet ambush attempts.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across nests' of submarines and mine-fields". In support of the operation, "UB-10" and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30/31 May to form a line east of Lowestoft. This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich, should they sortie north to join the battle. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German High Seas Fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of several of the U-boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". "UB-10" sighted the Harwich forces, but they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
In mid-June, Saltzwedel was transferred to , and—as was the case with Steinbrinck—went on become one of the top-scoring U-boat commanders of the war, placing eleventh on the list with 150,000 tons to his credit. After Saltzwedel, "UB-10" was assigned a new commander about every two to three months through the end of the war. Saltzwedel's immediate replacement on "UB-10" was Kapitänleutnant ("Kplt.") Gustav Buch, who led the boat in sinking her only warship, the British destroyer on 13 August; "Lassoo" was torpedoed off the Maas Lightvessel and sank with the loss of six men. Later in August, "UB-10" was fortunate enough to avoid attack by a British submarine when departing Zeebrugge. On the morning of 21 August, the outbound "UB-10" had a rendezvous with the homeward-bound "UC-10" off the North Hinder Lightship and exchanged information. "UC-10" parted company with "UB-10" at about 13:30 and resumed her course for Zeebrugge, but was torpedoed and sunk by , which had been lurking about the Schouwen Bank off Zeebrugge.
Unrestricted submarine warfare.
Since the early stages of the war, the Royal Navy had blockaded Germany, preventing neutral shipping from reaching German ports. By the time of the so-called "turnip winter" of 1916–17, the blockade had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany. Among the results were an increase in infant mortality and as many as 700,000 deaths attributed to starvation or hypothermia during the war. With the blockade having such dire consequences, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat.
Under these new rules of engagement, "UB-10", now under the command of "Kplt." Erich von Rohrscheidt, first sank the Dutch steamer "Amstelstromm" on 27 March. When encountered by "UB-10", "Amstelstromm" was found "derelict and badly damaged" after shelling by German destroyers , , and ; von Rohrscheidt launched a "coup de grâce" at the stricken ship and sent it down east-northeast of the North Hinder Lightvessel.
As "UB-10" was returning to Zeebrugge in early April, she was attacked by a British submarine near the area where she had escaped from the previous August. , which had been waiting off the Schouwen gas buoy, launched a torpedo at a U-boat at 03:30 on 5 April. Although authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast report that "C7" sank with that torpedo, "C7" had in fact fired upon "UB-10", and the explosion noted by "C7" was her own torpedo prematurely exploding; "UB-10" was able to continue on and make port in Zeebrugge. Later in the month, von Rohrscheidt sank two Dutch ships on the 24th and 25th: "Minister Tak Van Poortvliet", a 1,106-ton steamer headed for Harlingen was sent down off Ymuiden; the sailing ship "Elizabeth" was sunk between Lowestoft and Zeebrugge the following day.
On 20 August, "UB-10"—with "Oblt." Fritz Gregor at the helm—sank "Edernian", a British vessel, from Southwold. The 3,588-ton ship, sent down with her cargo of steel and 14 of her crew, was the second largest sunk by "UB-10". Early the next month, Gregor led the boat in sinking three more fishing vessels: the Belgian "Jeannot" and the British "Unity" on the 5th; and the British "Rosary" on the 6th. These were the last ships sunk by "UB-10".
Conversion to minelayer.
"UB-10" and three sister boats, "UB-12", "UB-16", and "UB-17", were all converted to minelaying submarines by 1918. The conversion involved removing the bow section containing the pair of torpedo tubes from each U-boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each. In the process, the boats were lengthened to , and the displacement increased to on the surface, and below the surface. Exactly when this conversion was performed on "UB-10" is not reported, but "UB-12" was converted in late 1916.
From late February to mid-May 1918, "UB-10" was commanded by "Oblt." Hans Joachim Emsmann. The 25-year-old Emmsman would later be notable as the commander of , the last U-boat sunk during the war, and as the namesake of the 5th U-boat Flotilla () of the "Kriegsmarine" in World War II.
On 2 July, "UB-10" and were both seriously damaged during a heavy British air raid on German-held bases in Flanders. During other raids, considerable damage to harbor facilities delayed repairs and impaired the flotilla's ability to operate at full strength. Although sources do not indicate whether the damage to "UB-10"s was repaired after this attack or not, by early September the boat was considered unfit for service and was decommissioned on the 12th.
After the Meuse-Argonne Offensive started on 26 September and the Allies began to drive back the German lines, plans were made to evacuate Flanders and dismantle the naval facilities at Bruges, Zeebrugge, and Ostende. All the vessels that were seaworthy were ordered to depart Flanders for Germany on 1 October; those unable to make the journey under their own power were to be destroyed. "UB-10" was one of four U-boats left behind. On 5 October, a maintenance crew scuttled "UB-10" off the Zeebrugge Mole at position .

Psappha (Xenakis)

Psappha (Edition: Salabert, 1975) is a musical composition for multi-percussion solo by Greek modernist composer Iannis Xenakis. The work does not include specific instrumentation, although the composer calls for three groups of wood and/or skins and three groups of metal instruments. The actual printed performance score is written in a unique graph notation and consists of 2,396 segments and presents a greater demand on the performer due to this unique style.
Background.
"Psappha" is an archaic form of "Sappho", a great Greek poetess from the Island of Lesbos, born in the 6th century BC. Her style was sensual and melodic, and she was one of the first poets to write from the first person, describing love and loss as it affected her personally. The target of her affections was most commonly female, and today both her name and place of residence have become synonymous with woman-love.
Written for six groups of instruments, three of wood and/or skins and three of metal, "Psappha" is sharp, brittle, and even violent at times. This intensely masculine work seems almost in contradiction to its title. The inspiration here, however, manifests not as aesthetic, but as structure. The work's rhythmic structures are derived from small rhythmic cells characteristic of Sappho's poetry. These rhythms pervade the entire work and make both local and large scale appearances. Much of the specifics of instrument choice is left up to the performer: Xenakis writes, "timbre serves only to clarify the rhythmic structures," suggesting the "words" of this poem are only a secondary color to the structures that contain them.
Commission.
"Psappha" was commissioned by the English Bach Festival with financial assistance from the Gulbenkian Foundation and is dedicated to percussionist Sylvio Gualda. The work was premiered by the dedicatee at Round House, London, on 2 May 1976.

SM UB-11

SM "UB-11" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. "UB-11" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-11" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-11" in March 1915.
"UB-11"s commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. "UB-11" was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, "UB-11" was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-11" was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began. "UB-11" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November. As built, "UB-11" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-11" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-11" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-11"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men. After work on "UB-11" was complete at the Weser yard, she was launched on 2 March.
Career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-11" on 4 March 1915 under the command of Kapitänleutnant (Kapt.) Ralph Wenninger, a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Wenninger was only in command of "UB-11" for a week. Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of "UB-11", or if "UB-11" remained in commission.
According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, "UB-11" had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915. Uboat.net reports that "UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.
At the end of the war, the Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. "UB-11" was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany. "UB-11" was broken up by Stinnes on 3 February 1920.

Pave the Way Foundation

Pave the Way Foundation (PTWF) is a non-sectarian organization whose mission is to identify and eliminate non-theological obstacles between religions, headed by Gary Krupp. It has done considerable research on the papacy of Pius XII and has sought to deconstruct negative stereotypes such as "Hitler's Pope". In his Pius XII related work Krupp has criticized historians who have private agendas and who let down the general public by failing to do proper research Krupp, a non-historian, has been subject to criticism from historians for spreading misinformation relating to Pius XII.
Work.
In September 2000, in recognition of his sale of medical equipment, at substantial savings to Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy, Italy, Gary Krupp was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II, only the seventh Jew to be so honored. Mr. Krupp also assisted the Hospital in 2006 by a sale of MRI equipment to the hospital by General Electric.
Receiving the honor from the Pope inspired Krupp, a developer of medical facilities from Long Beach (NY), to follow the example of his fellow Jewish Knight Commanders in dedicating himself to the work of reconciliation between the Catholic and Jewish religions, In 2003 he founded the Pave the Way Foundation.
The foundation promotes the philosophy, "Embrace the Similarities - Savor the Differences," through Catholic-Jewish cultural exchanges, talks, pilgrimages and youth projects. PTWF has developed a Palestinian-Israeli Prosperity Plan that is designed to help provide meaningful jobs and thereby reduce one of the fundamental factors that contributes to hostilities and violence. In an effort to bring people closer together, it has coordinated the purchase of baby formula and diapers by Americans for impoverished families in the Holy Land, but the purchases are made by and for people of different faiths (e.g., Jewish Americans buying for Palestinians). Similarly, PTWF has provided blankets to Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem. PTWF also developed a manual of etiquette to help to train Israeli security personnel in response to Christian criticisms.
PTWF has commended Islamic clerics who condemn violence in the name of their religion, explaining that such statements are important “in bringing an end to the chain of violent events that now endanger every human being on the planet.” PTWF also calls upon all world religions to speak out against violence and deaths perpetrated in the name of their religion and shun any persons who pervert the name of their religion to support violent and destructive goals.
The Foundation also works to foster a strong partnership between the Vatican and the State of Israel. Krupp has lobbied the Israeli government to address the concerns of the Vatican on matters including the legal status of Catholic entities in Israel, issue of visa for Church employees and access of pilgrims to major shrines.
The Foundation's accomplishments include initiating the largest Jewish audience in history to meet with a sitting Pope. On January 18, 2005 168 Jewish leaders met with Pope John Paul II. It initiated the first ever loan of the manuscripts of Maimonides from the Vatican Library to the State of Israel in September 2005. It identified the availability and a donor to acquire the Bodmer papyrus for the Vatican Library January 18, 2007.
It arranged the digitizing of the manuscripts of the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land for permanent archiving and protection. It negotiated the acquisition of high tech medical equipment for Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza the hospital of St. Padre Pio in Italy. It sponsored the exhibit “Pope John Paul II and the Jewish People - A Blessing to one another in New York." It is also working to help bring peace to the Middle East promoting the Wasatia Forum with Palestinian children.
Krupp and the Foundation have played a role in diplomatic/political mediation between the Vatican and the State of Israel. When Israeli representatives withdrew from negotiations between the Catholic Church and Israel over proposed legislation relating to the Fundamental Agreement of 1993, Krupp acted as lead mediator between the two sides. Pave the Way lobbied Israeli diplomats, Jewish philanthropic organizations, Jewish congress-members and influential Jewish leaders to contact the Israeli Prime Minister's office and emphasize the importance of cementing the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Israeli state. The Israelis resumed negotiations.
Another instance where the Foundation's intervention in Church-Israeli State affairs was important was after the election of a new Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilus III. The newly elected Patriarch was unable to discharge his duties when the Israel Government delayed recognition, Pave the Way Foundation, acting "in the interest of inter-religious harmony and positive, improved relations," made representations to the Prime Minister of Israel and the King of Jordan, urging them to give the problem their attention. Theophilus III acknowledged the role of Krupp's intervention in helping move the Patriarchate's affairs forward.
Pave the Way's 2008 Internal Revenue Service reports state that Krupp and his wife were the organization's only two employees, with Gary Krupp earning $112,500, and his wife $35,000. Pave the Way is largely funded by around twenty members of the board of directors. During 2008 income amounted to $470,000. Travel was the second highest expenditure after the wages paid to the Krupp's."
Praise for Pius XII related activities.
Pave the Way’s historical work regarding Pope Pius XII has been recognized for serving the common good by Archbishop Fernando Filoni, Substitute Vatican Secretary of State. One of Pave the Way Foundation’s most important projects was helping the Vatican digitize and post its Actes et Documents collection of World War II documents on the Internet so that scholars from all over the world could review them. PTWF has also posted other documents, interview videos, and contemporary reports on its web page, making primary sources available at no cost to researchers from around the world.
In September 2008, PTWF sponsored an international conference on Pope Pius XII in Rome. Eighty participants, including Jewish and Christian clergy, historians, journalists, and authors – took part. Pope Benedict XVI addressed the group and paid tribute to "the tireless pastoral and humanitarian work of Pius XII, Pastor Angelicus." The New York Times reported that "several historians called to ask him to cancel his three-day conference in Rome, which ultimately drew many Vatican-friendly scholars but few with independent credentials".
One Catholic historian, Paul O’Shea, tried to warn Krupp that proponents of canonization might be trying to use him. He urged Mr. Krupp to wait for the Vatican to open its files, and for scholars to complete their work, before reaching conclusions.
Rabbi Eric Silver of Temple Beth David in Cheshire, Connecticut, who took part in the event, said: “We studied the documents in the Vatican’s archives and had eye-witness interviews, and what we learned was truly world-shaking. There is nobody who did more to rescue Jews than Pius.” Later, many of the presentations and numerous documents were compiled in book format. 
Pope Benedict XVI has offered his thanks "to the Pave the Way Foundation for its ongoing activity in promoting relationships and dialogue between religions, as witnesses of peace, charity and reconciliation." Rabbi Carlos C. Huerta, Chaplain (Major) United States Military Academy at West Point said of PTWF: "without organizations like yours our world would be far worse than it is and religious intolerance would be so rampant. I only pray that G-d gives you the strength to continue this important work." H.E. Ambassador Alon Pinkas, former Consul General to New York for the State of Israel, has called Gary Krupp “a committed individual with a kind heart has utilized his unique position within the Catholic Church and commitment to his own heritage, Judaism, as a springboard for dialogue between the two faiths.” Ambassador Oded Ben-Hur-Israeli Ambassador to the Holy See Rome called Krupp "a soldier of peace."
Criticism of Pius XII related activities.
The methodology of Pave the Way Foundation relating to the historical record of Pope Pius XII has been subject to harsh criticism from scholars and long-established Jewish organizations. Professor Dwork, Rose Professor of Holocaust History and Director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University, said Mr. Krupp’s research was “amateurish, worse than amateurish — risible.” and that "He may be well-meaning, but his lack of experience in international affairs and historical research makes Mr. Krupp highly vulnerable to being manipulated by factions inside the Vatican John T. Pawlikowski, Catholic priest and founding member of the board of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and a professor of social ethics at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, said the Vatican was “discrediting itself by associating itself with this kind of questionable scholarship.”
Eric Greenberg, director of Interfaith Policy at the New York-based Anti-Defamation League asserted "Whether he Krupp understands it or not, he is waging a campaign of misinformation...He's been given out-of-context documents and is coming to overblown conclusions about Pius XII's personal involvement and that is a disservice to historians and to the historical truth." Rabbi Joseph Potasnik of the New York Board of Rabbis, who was once a supporter, resigned from the board of directors of Pave the Way and commented "Many of us are very troubled by the stance Mr. Krupp has taken...Thus far there's only been a superficial examination (of Pius XII). Given the seriousness of the subject, we need to be much more deliberate and have as much historical factual information." Pave the Ways claims of finding new documents that exonerate Pius XII are by disputed John Pawlikowski, professor of ethics at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, who argues that Krupp's evidence has already been studied by experts and that "We know that Pius did some things that were good, but they tended to come rather late, they were mostly behind the scenes and were relatively minor gestures." The Anti-Defamation League asked Holocaust historian Paul O'Shea to examine other material published by Pave the Way and ADL concluded that "materials presented by Pave the Way Foundation are part of a campaign of misinformation by some Pius apologists who use selective church documents and issue unsubstantiated conclusions about Pius XII. O'Shea commented on the claims made by Pave the Way "To use the Campagna files to suggest that Pope Pius XII was active in attempting to rescue Jews is to demand something that historical record cannot sustain,"
In 2011 Pave the way published claims that a new document they had recently uncovered showed that Pius XII had been pressurised by the allies not to make a radio broadcast that would save the lives of Hungarian Jews. Eric J. Greenberg points out that contrary to the claims made by Pave the Way "the 1944 cable is an old, well-known document, and by itself does not make the case for Pope Pius" and that “You can’t distribute or release an out-of-context letter or document and make a global claim for it. This is an example of Pave the Way’s campaign of misinformation that makes a disservice to Catholic and Jewish scholars,”
O'Shea, of the Australian Institute of Holocaust and Genocide Studies also asserts that “Pave the Way" are masters at creating a media flurry. They are not trained historians. They believe that by creating a deluge of paper with information that is favorable to their perception of Pius XII, they can create a new reality about the wartime pope,” Gabriel Wilensky asserts that the Pave the Way expert Michael Hesemann presents "findings of documents in a misleading way" by implying that the Catholic Church had always been opposed to the Nazi Party." and evidences this with reference to the Concordat signed by the Vatican and Nazi Germany in 1933

SM "UB-12" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine disappeared in August 1918.
"UB-12" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-12" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-12" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-12" in March 1915.
"UB-12" spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 22 merchant ships, about half of them British fishing vessels. The U-boat was also responsible for sinking the British destroyer in 1917. By early 1917, "UB-12" had been converted into a minelayer with the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. "UB-12" disappeared after 19 August 1918.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders.

She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-12" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-12" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-12"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-12" was complete at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In February 1915, the sections of "UB-12" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-12" was assembled and launched on 2 March, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-12" on 29 March 1915 under the command of Kapitänleutnant (Kapt.) Hans Nieland, a 29-year-old first-time U-boat commander. On 18 April, "UB-12" joined the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When "UB-12" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom, were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
On 24 July, Nieland and "UB-12" sank four British fishing vessels while patrolling between east-northeast of Lowestoft. All four of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-12", and sunk with explosives. "UB-12" similarly sank a pair of smacks off Lowestoft on 4 August, and another trio from 23 to 25 August.
On 21 November, Nieland was succeeded by Oberleutnant zur See (Oblt.) Wilhelm Kiel in command of "UB-12". Under Kiel's command, "UB-12" sank three ships on 21 February 1916: the 100-ton Belgian fishing ship "La Petite Henriette", the largest sunk to-date by "UB-12", and another pair of British smacks, "Oleander" and "W.E. Brown".
"UB-12" sank her largest ship, "Silksworth Hall" of , on 10 April. The British-registered ship was en route from Hull to Philadelphia in ballast when Kiel torpedoed her without warning a little more than one nautical mile (two kilometers) from the Corton Lightvessel. Other ships picked up 31 survivors from "Silksworth Hall", but 3 men were lost. Later in the month, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.
Grand Fleet ambush attempts.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across nests' of submarines and mine-fields". In support of the operation, "UB-12" and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30/31 May to form a line east of Lowestoft. This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich, should they sortie north to join the battle. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German High Seas Fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of several of the U-boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". In "UB-12"s group, only "UB-10" sighted the Harwich forces, and they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
Kapitänleutnant Georg Gerth took command of "UB-12" on 26 June, after "Oblt." Kiel was assigned to command the new minelaying submarine . Two months later, Admiral Scheer set up another ambush for the British fleet with plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as had been the original intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, "UB-12" was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, "UB-12" was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, "UB-12" and her group played no part in the action.
In September, Gerth led "UB-12" in sinking two more ships and capturing a third ship as a prize. The 313-ton Norwegian steamer "Rilda" was sunk on 6 September, while the 55-ton "Marjorie" was sunk on the 28th. In between the Dutch ship "Niobe" was seized as a prize on the 7th.
Conversion to minelayer.
"UB-12" and three sister boats—"UB-10", "UB-16", and "UB-17"—were all converted to minelaying submarines. "UB-12" was at the dockyard from November 1916 to January 1917, and it is likely the boat was converted during this timeframe. The conversion involved removing the bow section containing the pair of torpedo tubes from each U-boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each. In the process, the boats were lengthened to , and the displacement increased to on the surface, and below the surface.
During this same time, "Kapt." Gerth was transferred to , and replaced on "UB-12" by "Oblt." Friedrich Moecke in early November. Moecke was, in turn, replaced by "Oblt." Ernst Steindorff in January 1917.
By March, the newly converted submarine had begun laying mines off the French coast. The French Navy trawler "Elisabeth" struck one of "UB-12"s mines off Calais on 13 March and sank. Five days later, the British auxiliary minesweeper "Duchess of Montrose" sank with a loss of 12 men after detonating a mine laid by "UB-12" off Gravelines.
On 23 March, , a destroyer with the Dover Patrol, struck one of "UB-12"s mines off Cape Gris-Nez and went down with the loss of 59 men.
In May, "UB-12" was on a patrol with in the English Channel. On the night of 14/15 May while "UB-12" was on the surface, Steindorff noted a large underwater explosion some miles away in a British minefield, and when "UB-39" failed to return to Zeebrugge, one of the bases for the Flanders Flotilla, reported what was likely the demise of "UB-39" at the hands of a British mine.
April found two more victims added to "UB-12"s tally. On the 20th, "Nepaulin", another British auxiliary minesweeper was lost on one of "UB-12"s mines near the Dyck Lightvessel. Six days later, the British steamer "Alhama" was mined while loaded with pit props destined for Dunkirk. The 1,744-ton cargo ship was the largest ship sunk by "UB-12" since the "Silksworth Hall", sunk the previous April. "UB-12" sank another two ships under Steindorff's command, one each in June and July. The steamer "Dulwich"—carrying coal from Seaham for London—was mined and sunk with the loss of five men on 10 June. One month later, the French patrol vessel "Jupiter I" was mined off Calais. These were the last two ships credited to mines from "UB-12" for the next fourteen months.
Fate.
"UB-12"s activities over the next year are not well documented, and no specific record of her can be found in English-language sources. However, it is known that during this period, she was helmed by four different commanders, with the final officer, "Oblt." Ernst Schöller, assuming command in May 1918. Under Schöller's command, "UB-12" departed Zeebrugge on 19 August to lay mines in the Downs off the Kentish coast, but never returned. According to one British source, "UB-12" was herself mined off Helgoland sometime in August. Author Dwight Messimer considers this unlikely given that Helgoland is nowhere near the route that "UB-12" could have taken to get to the Downs. A postwar German study concluded the two most likely fates for "UB-12" were that she either struck a British mine or was destroyed by one of her own mines that malfunctioned during deployment. Messimer also considers it possible that "UB-12" may have had a diving accident related to her conversion to a minelayer.
Some two months after "UB-12"s presumed loss, she was credited with the sinking of her final ship. On 27 October, two weeks before the end of the war, the 92-ton British ship "Calceolaria" struck one of "UB-12"s mines near the Elbow Lightvessel and sank.

Thika River

The Thika River flows through central Kenya and is a tributary of Tana River. The Thika River is a significant source of hydroelectric power in Kenya and provides most of the water supply for Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city.
The name "Thika" originates either from the Kikuyu language or from the Maasai language. It may relate to the Kikuyu word "guthika", which means "to bury". It also resembles the Maasai word "sika", which means "to rub something away from an edge".
Course.
The Thika River originates in the Aberdare Range. It flows to the Tana River, which empties into the Indian Ocean.
A landmark along the river's course is Thika Falls, near the town of Thika. Thika Falls has a drop of about 25 meters in a wilderness area within walking distance of the Blue Post Hotel, which is one of the oldest hotels in Kenya.
Ecology.
During the early twentieth century colonial big game hunters noted hippopotamus and crocodiles along the deeper sections of the river. Baboons and leopards inhabited the forest near Thika Falls. Antelopes and zebras lived in the open country upriver from the falls. Rhinoceros, lions, and hyenas also resided in the area. Most of the game today relocated either upriver to the Aberdares forest or downriver due to pressure from increased human settlement along the river.
Water source.
Eighty percent of the water supply for Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, comes from the Thika River.
Deforestation and overgrazing along the river's heavily populated course have caused soil erosion problems. Sediments have reduced river flow, reservoir size, and water quality. Water quality has also deteriorated due to pesticide runoff.
Hydroelectricity.
The Thika is part of the Tana basin, which is the most extensively engineered of Kenya's major arid watersheds. Hydroelectric power from the Thika River supplies a significant portion of Kenya's electricity. The first proposal for exploiting the Thika River's hydroelectric potential was put forward shortly after World War I by Guglielmo Marconi as a means for supplying power for a planned radio communications station in Nairobi. Marconi's plan was not implemented, but in 1994 the Thika River Dam was constructed with a resulting water reservoir of 70 million cubic meters. The Thika River also contributes to the Masinga Reservoir, which serves the Seven Forks Dams. Taken together, three-quarters of Kenya's electrical supply derives from these dams.

SM UB-13

SM "UB-13" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine was probably sunk by a British mine net in April 1916.
"UB-13" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-13" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-13" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched in March 1915 and commissioned as SM "UB-13" in April.
"UB-13" spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 11 merchant ships, about half of them British fishing vessels. In March 1916, "UB-13" was responsible for sinking the Dutch ocean liner , raising the ire of the Dutch public. "Tubantia" was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the war and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats. On 24 April 1916, "UB-13" was sunk with all hands.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-13" was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began. "UB-13" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November. As built, "UB-13" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-13" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-13" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-13"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-13" was complete at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In February 1915, the sections of "UB-13" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-13" was assembled and launched on 8 March, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-13" on 6 April 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Walter Gustav Becker, a 29-year-old first-time U-boat commander. On 26 April, "UB-13" joined the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When "UB-13" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom, were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
Submarines of the Flanders Flotilla sank over 14,000 tons of merchant vessels in June 1915, and "UB-13"s first ship sunk, "Dulcie", contributed almost one-seventh of that total. The British steamer "Dulcie", listed at , was headed from Dunston for Le Havre with a load of coal when Becker torpedoed her east of Aldeburgh. One man on "Dulcie" lost his life in the attack. "Dulcie" was the only ship sunk by "UB-13" in June.
On 27 and 28 July, Becker and "UB-13" sank three British fishing vessels while patrolling between off Lowestoft. All three of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-16", and sunk with explosives.
In response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September, the chief of the "Admiralstab", Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, issued orders suspending the first offensive on 18 September. His directive ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. On 20 February 1916, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Karl Neumann, who replaced Becker in December 1915, "UB-13" captured a Belgian ship named "Z10 David Marie" and retained her as a prize. There are no further details about where "Z10 David Marie" was taken or her final disposition, but other ships captured as prizes by Flanders boats were sailed into Zeebrugge by prize crews.
Second submarine offensive.
By early 1916, the British blockade of Germany was beginning to have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German "Admiralstab" were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not. The day after the beginning of the second offensive, Neumann and "UB-13" sank four more fishing smacks northeast of Lowestoft. All four ships were boarded and sunk in the same manner as the three sunk the previous July. Shortly after, Neumann was transferred to command in early March, and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Arthur Metz, who had been in command of for the preceding month.
SS "Tubantia".
Shortly after 02:30 on 16 March, a torpedo from "UB-13" struck the starboard side of the neutral Dutch ocean liner , which was at anchor near the North Hinder Lightship, about off the Dutch coast. The Royal Holland Lloyd () ship had been fully illuminated, with her name spelled out in electric lights between the twin funnels. Distress calls from "Tubantia" were heeded and all 80 passengers and 294 crew were rescued by three nearby ships before the ship foundered. "Tubantia" was the largest neutral ship sunk during the war, and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats.
Germany initially tried to implicate British mines or torpedoes, but relented when confronted with evidence that it was one of their own torpedoes—which had been assigned to "UB-13"—that had sunk "Tubantia". The Germans, however, presented a forged log from "UB-13" that showed her nowhere near "Tubantia" at the time of the attack. Further, they reported, "UB-13" had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March—ten days before "Tubantia" was sunk—which would have been under her previous commander, Kapitänleutnant Neumann. The U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, Henry van Dyke, writing in "Fighting for Peace" in 1917, called this explanation "amazing" and derided it:This certain U-boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war-vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the "Tubantia" was sunk. The shot missed its mark. But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to kill somebody. Then the "Tubantia" came along and the wandering-Willy torpedo promptly, obstinately, ran into the ship and sank her. This was the explanation. Germany was not to blame.
The Dutch public was furious at what they believed a hostile German act, which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands to divert the unwanted attention.
Amidst all of the denials and diplomatic wrangling over "Tubantia"s sinking, "UB-13" continued to sink ships. On 31 March, off Lowestoft, Metz and "UB-13" sank the Norwegian steamer "Memento". The ship was carrying a load of coke destined for Porsgrunn when she went down with one crewman. Twelve days later, in the Kentish Knock area, "UB-13" sank the Danish ship "Proeven". The 276-ton sailing vessel was the last ship sunk by "UB-13".
Sinking.
On the evening of 23 April 1916, "UB-13" departed Zeebrugge for a patrol off the mouth of the Thames and was never heard from again. Author Dwight Messimer, in his book "Verschollen: World War I U-boat Losses", reports that the British had deployed a new explosive anti-submarine net at position in the early morning hours of 24 April. He suggests that it was possible "UB-13" had set off some of the contact mines on the net, or possible that the submarine had struck a mine in one of the many British minefields off the Flemish coast. However, according to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, in their book "The German Submarine War, 1914–1918", "UB-13" fouled the anchor cable of the British naval drifter "Gleaner of the Sea" on 24 April, and was depth charged by "E.E.S.". Then for good measure, the British destroyer deployed explosive sweeps against the submarine. Whatever the specific cause of her demise, all seventeen crewmen on board the submarine were killed.

Early life of Joseph Stalin

Early life of Joseph Stalin (Russian: Дореволюционная биография Сталина), Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union in the mid-20th century, was born on 18 December 1878 to a Georgian cobbler in Gori, Georgia. After leaving school, he embraced Marxism and became an avid follower of Vladimir Lenin. After being marked by Russian secret police for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and outlaw. He became one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus, organizing paramilitaries, spreading propaganda, raising money through bank robberies, and kidnappings and extortion. He was captured and exiled to Siberia numerous times, but often escaped. He became one of Lenin's closest associates, which helped him rise to the heights of power after the Russian Revolution.
Childhood.
Birth.
Stalin was born as Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili () in Gori in the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire, to Besarion Jughashvili, a Georgian cobbler who owned his own workshop, and Ketevan Geladze, a Georgian who was born a serf. He was their third child; their two previous sons died in infancy. The second and third toes of his left foot were webbed.
Early life.
Initially, the Jughashvili family prospered, but Ioseb's father became an alcoholic, which gradually led to his business failing and him becoming violently abusive to his wife and child. As their financial situation grew worse, Stalin's family moved homes at least nine times in Stalin's first ten years of life.
The town where Ioseb grew up was a violent and lawless place. It had only a small police force and a culture of violence that included gang warfare, organized street brawls and wrestling tournaments. Ioseb was frequently involved in brawls with other children.
At the age of seven, Ioseb fell ill with smallpox and his face was badly scarred by the disease. He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent. Ioseb's native tongue was Georgian; he did not start learning Russian until he was eight or nine years old, and he never lost his strong Georgian accent.
Education.
At the age of ten, Ioseb received a scholarship to the Gori Theological School (Горийское Духовное Училище). His peers were mostly the sons of affluent priests, officials, and merchants. He and most of his classmates at Gori were Georgians and spoke mostly Georgian. However, at school they were forced to speak Russian. Ioseb proved one of the best students in the class, earning top marks across the board. He became a very good choir-singer and was often hired to sing at weddings. He also began to write poetry, something he would develop in later years.
Ioseb's father had always wanted his son to train as a cobbler rather than become educated. He was infuriated when the boy was accepted into the school. In a drunken rage he smashed the windows of the local tavern, and later attacked the town police chief. Out of compassion for Ioseb's mother, the police chief did not arrest Besarion, but told him to leave town. He moved to Tiflis where he found work in a shoe factory and left his family behind in Gori.
About the time Ioseb began school, he was struck by a horse-drawn carriage. The accident permanently damaged his left arm. This injury would later exempt him from military service in World War I. At the age of 12, Ioseb was struck again by a horse-drawn carriage and injured much more severely. He was taken to a hospital in Tiflis where he spent months in care. After he recovered, his father seized the boy and enrolled him as an apprentice cobbler at the shoe factory where he worked. When his motherthrough the aid of contacts in the clergy and school staffrecovered the boy, his father cut off all financial support to his wife and son, leaving them to fend for themselves. Ioseb returned to his school in Gori where he continued to excel. He graduated first in his class.
In 1894, at the age of 15, he enrolled at the Orthodox Seminary of Tiflis, to which he had been awarded a scholarship. The teachers at Tiflis Seminary were also determined to impose Russian language and culture on the Georgian students. Like many of his comrades, young Ioseb reacted by being drawn to Georgian patriotism. For a time, he wrote Georgian poetry, for which he gained some fame.
During his time at the seminary, Ioseb and numerous other students read forbidden literature that included Victor Hugo novels and revolutionary, including Marxist, material. He was caught and punished numerous times for this. He became an atheist in his first year. He insisted his peers call him "Koba", after the Robin Hood-like protagonist of the novel "The Patricide" by Alexander Kazbegi; he continued to use this pseudonym as a revolutionary. In August 1898, he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, a Marxist organization from which the Bolsheviks would later form.
Shortly before the final exams, the Seminary abruptly raised school fees. Unable to pay, Ioseb quit the seminary in 1899 and missed his exams, for which he was officially expelled. Shortly after leaving school, Ioseb discovered the writings of Vladimir Lenin and decided to become a revolutionary.
Beginnings as a Marxist revolutionary.
Early adulthood in Tiflis.
After abandoning his priestly education, Stalin took a job as a clerk at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory. Although the pay was relatively low (20 roubles a month), his workload was light, giving him plenty of time for revolutionary activities. He would organize strikes, lead demonstrations and give speeches. He soon caught the attention of the Tsar's secret police, the Okhranka.
On the night of 3 April 1901, the Okhranka arrested a number of SD Party leaders in Tiflis. Stalin was riding the tram to work when he spotted their agents waiting to ambush him outside the Observatory. He stayed on the tram and avoided capture. He went underground, becoming a full-time revolutionary, living off donations from friends, sympathizers and his party. He began writing revolutionary articles for the Baku-based radical newspaper "Brdzola" ("Struggle").
Political organization beginnings.
In October, he fled to Batumi and got work at an oil refinery owned by the Rothschilds. In 1902, a fire broke out at the refinery, and it is strongly suspected Stalin was involved. The workers were entitled to a bonus for putting out the fire, but the manager suspected arson and refused to pay. In response, Stalin organized a series of strikes, which in turn led to arrests and street clashes with Cossacks. In one attempt to break their comrades out of prison, 13 strikers were killed when Cossacks intervened. Stalin distributed pamphlets portraying the dead as martyrs. On 18 April 1902, the authorities finally arrested Stalin at a secret meeting. At his trial, Stalin was acquitted of leading the riots due to lack of evidence, but was kept in custody whilst the authorities investigated his activities in Tiflis.
Joining the Bolsheviks.
Stalin ended up in the Siberian village of Novaya Uda on 9 December 1903. During this time, he heard that two rival factions within the Social-Democrats had formed: the Bolsheviks under Lenin and the Mensheviks under Julius Martov. Stalin, already an admirer, decided to join Lenin's group. He managed to obtain false papers and, on 17 January 1904, escaped Siberia by train, arriving back in Tiflis ten days later.
With no income, Stalin lived off his circle of friends. One of them introduced him to Lev Kamenev (then known as Lev Rosenfeld), his future co-ruler of the USSR after Lenin's death. At this time, Stalin favored a Georgian Social-Democratic party, which caused a rift with the majority who favored international Marxism. Threatened with expulsion, he was forced to write "Credo", a paper renouncing his views (because this paper distanced himself from Lenin, when Stalin became ruler of the USSR, he tried to destroy all copies of this "Credo", and many of those who had read it were shot).
The following month, the Russo-Japanese War broke out between Japan and Russia. The war, which would eventually end in Russia's defeat, severely strained the Russian economy and caused a great deal of restlessness in Georgia. Stalin travelled across Georgia conducting political activity for his party. He also worked to undermine the Mensheviks through a campaign of slander and intrigue. These efforts brought him to Lenin's attention.
On 22 January 1905, Stalin was in Baku when Cossacks attacked a mass demonstration of workers, killing 200. This was part of a series of events which sparked off the Russian Revolution of 1905. Riots, peasant uprisings and ethnic massacres swept the Russian Empire. In February, ethnic Azeris and Armenians were slaughtering each other in the streets of Baku. Commanding a squad of armed Bolsheviks, Stalin ran protection rackets to raise party funds and stole printing equipment. Afterward, he headed west, where he continued to campaign against the Mensheviks, who enjoyed overwhelming support in Georgia. In the mining town of Chiatura, both Stalin and the Mensheviks competed for the support of the miners. They chose Stalin, preferring his plain and concise manner of speaking to the flamboyant oratory of the Menshevik speaker. From Chiatura, Stalin organized and armed Bolshevik militias across Georgia. With them, he ran protection rackets among the wealthy and waged guerrilla warfare on Cossacks, policemen and the Okhranka. Later that year, in the townhouse in which he had moved in Tiflis, he met Ekaterina Svanidze, who would become his first wife.
Meeting Lenin and early politics.
In December 1905, Stalin and two other activists were elected to represent the Caucasus at the next Bolshevik conference, which took place in Tampere, Finland. There, on 7 January 1906, Stalin met Lenin in person for the first time. Although Stalin was impressed by Lenin's personality and intellect, he was not afraid to contradict him. He objected to Lenin's proposal that they take part in elections to the recently formed Russian parliament, the Duma. At the conference he also met Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, his future propaganda chief, and Solomon Lozovsky, his future Deputy Foreign Commissar. After the conference, Stalin returned to Georgia, where Cossack troops were brutally trying to reconquer the rebellious region for the Tsar. In Tiflis, Stalin and the Mensheviks plotted the assassination of Major General Fyodor Gryaznov, which was carried out at the end of January 1906. Stalin continued to raise money for the Bolsheviks through extortion, bank robberies and hold-ups.
In April 1906, Stalin attended the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. At the conference, he met Kliment Voroshilov, his future Defence Commissar and First Marshal; Felix Dzerzhinsky, future founder of the Cheka; and Grigory Zinoviev, with whom he would share power after Lenin's death. The Congress, in which the Bolsheviks were outnumbered, voted to ban bank robberies. This upset Lenin, who needed the bank robberies to raise money.
Stalin married Ekaterina Svanidze on 28 July 1906. On 31 March 1907, she gave birth to Stalin's first child, Yakov. Stalin and Lenin both attended the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in London in 1907. This Congress consolidated the supremacy of Lenin's Bolshevik faction and debated strategy for communist revolution in Russia. Here, Stalin first met Leon Trotsky in person. Stalin disliked him from the start, calling him "pretty, but useless." After the conference, Stalin would begin to switch his focus away from Georgia, which was rife with feuding and dominated by the Mensheviks, to Russia, and he began writing in Russian.
1907 Tiflis bank robbery.
After returning to Tiflis, Stalin organized the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank on 26 June 1907. Stalin's gang ambushed the armed convoy in Yerevan Square with gunfire and homemade bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of Stalin's gang managed to escape alive with up to 341,000 rubles (about US$3.4 million in modern terms). Stalin and his family fled Tiflis two days later. A henchman delivered the money to Lenin in Finland, who then fled with it to Geneva. The Mensheviks, who had banned bank robberies (and did not get to share in the loot), were outraged. Stalin escaped expulsion, though the affair would cause him trouble for years to come.
Return to Baku.
Stalin's family moved to Baku. Whilst Stalin continued his revolutionary activities, his wife fell ill from Baku's pollution, heat, stress and malnutrition. She contracted typhus and died on 5 December 1907. Stalin was overcome with grief and retreated into mourning for several months. The loss also hardened him; he told a friend: "with her died my last warm feelings for humanity". He abandoned his son, Yakov, who was raised by his deceased wife's family.
When Stalin resumed his activities, he organized more strikes and agitation, this time focusing on the Muslim Azeri and Persian workers in Baku. He helped found a Muslim Bolshevik group called Hummet, and also supported the Persian Constitutional Revolution with manpower and weapons, and even visited Persia to organize partisans. Stalin ordered the murders of many Black Hundreds (radical supporters of the Tsar) and conducted protection rackets and ransom kidnappings against the oil tycoons of Baku. He also conducted counterfeiting operations and robberies. He befriended criminal gangs, and used them to obstruct the Mensheviks. Stalin's gangsterism upset the Bolshevik intelligentsia, but he was too influential and indispensable to oppose.
The Okhranka tracked down and arrested Stalin on 7 April 1908. After seven months in prison, he was sentenced to two years' exile. He arrived in the village of Solvychegodsk in early March 1909. After seven months in exile, he disguised himself as a woman and escaped on a train to St Petersburg. He returned to Baku in late July.
Bolshevik politics and exiles.
Spy hunting and exile.
The Bolsheviks were on the verge of collapse due to Okhranka activity within the Empire and infighting among the intelligentsia abroad. In desperation, he advocated a reconciliation with the Mensheviks (which Lenin opposed). He demanded the creation of a Russian Bureau to run the Social-Democratic Party from within the Empire, to which he was appointed. Stalin soon realized the Bolsheviks had been heavily infiltrated by Tsarist spies. He initiated a hunt for the traitors, but failed to root out any real spies - as revealed by Okhranka records - and caused much disarray in the Party.
On 5 April 1910 Stalin was yet again arrested by the Okhranka. He was banned from the Caucasus for five years and sentenced to complete his previous exile in Solvychegodsk. He was deported back there in September. In early 1911, Stalin's friends tried to sneak him some money to help his escape, but the fellow exile who was supposed to deliver the money instead kept it for himself (Stalin had the man shot in 1937), and he was forced to return to Solvychegodsk. During his exile, he had an affair with his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, with whom he fathered a son, Constantine. Stalin was released on 1 July 1911, while Maria was still pregnant. Stalin moved to Vologda in late July, where he had been ordered to reside for two months.
In January 1912, at the Prague Party Conference, Lenin led his Bolshevik faction out of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, founding the separate Bolshevik Party. A Central Committee was elected, but when some of its members returned to Russia, they were arrested by the Okhranka, having been secretly betrayed by fellow CC member Roman Malinovsky, an Okhranka spy. To fill the void, Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev coopted Stalin as a member of the Central Committee. When Stalin was informed of this, he left Vologda in late February.
Creating "Pravda" and further exile.
Stalin moved to Saint Petersburg in March 1912, lodging with Kavtaradze, maths tutor to the Alliluyev sisters. He took control of the Bolshevik weekly newspaper "Zvezda". Stalin had been assigned to convert "Zvezda" into a daily and rename it "Pravda". Initially, Stalin ran Zvezda from the home of Bolshevik Duma deputy Poletaev who was also a poet and was immune from arrest. The first issue of Pravda was published in 3 rooms on 5 May. It was legal at first even though its editor-in-chief, Stalin, was not. Another founder Vyacheslav Molotov whose old friend, Victor Tikhomirnov, was the son of a Kazan capitalist and funded Pravda with his inheritance.
Shortly afterwards, the Okhranka caught up with him again. On July 2, 1912 he was again exiled to Siberia for three years, this time to the small village of Narym. He escaped just thirty-eight days after arriving; this was his shortest exile. He returned to Saint Petersburg in September.
Stalin renewed his efforts to reconcile the Bolsheviks with the Mensheviks in the hope of salvaging the then struggling Marxist movement. He published editorials in Pravda advocating reconciliation, and secretly met with Menshevik leaders Jordania and Jibladze on several occasions. He turned down 47 of Lenin's articles, reaffirming his willingness to disagree with Lenin. This angered Lenin, who twice summoned Stalin to Kraków to argue policy. On the second visit at the end of 1912, Stalin was replaced by Sverdlov as editor-in-chief of Pravda, but was made senior leader of the Russian Bureau of the Bolshevik Party, and paid 2 roubles a day. Lenin also asked Stalin to write an essay laying out the Bolshevik position on national minorities.
After Kraków, Stalin spent several weeks in Vienna with a wealthy Bolshevik couple he met with Lenin in Kraków. While there he met for the first time Nikolai Bukharin, who would become a leading politician in the future Soviet government. They continued to discuss the issue of nationalities. Stalin completed his essay on the topic, entitled "Marxism and the National Question", which was published in March 1913.
Return and another exile.
Stalin returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1913. During this time, many Bolsheviks, including almost the entire Central Committee, had been arrested by the Okhranka, having been betrayed by Roman Malinovsky, a high-ranking Bolshevik who for years had been an Okhranka spy and agent provocateur. That month, an article had been published that outed Malinovsky as a spy, but the Bolsheviks dismissed it as Menshevik libel (ironically, Lenin and Stalin were his strongest defenders). On 8 March Malinovsky persuaded Stalin to attend a Bolshevik fundraising ball, which was raided by the Okhranka.
Stalin was condemned to four years in the remote Siberian province of Turukhansk. He was eventually joined by Kamenev and several other Bolshevik exiles. He spent six months in the small hamlet of Kostino on the Yenisei River. After learning that Stalin was planning an escape (he had received money and supplies from his comrades), the authorities moved him north to Kureika, a hamlet on the edge of the Arctic Circle. There, he lived the life of a hunter-gatherer, having learned fishing and hunting from local Siberian tribesmen. While there he began a 2-year affair with Lidia Pereprygina, then aged 13, with whom he fathered two children. The first died in infancy; the second, named Alexander, was born in April 1917.
In late 1916, Stalin was conscripted into the army. He was taken to Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, but the medical examiner there found him unfit for service due to his damaged left arm (a childhood injury). He spent his last four months of exile in the village of Achinsk.
Name and aliases.
Stalin's first name is also transliterated as "". His original surname, , is transliterated as "" or . The Russian transliteration is "", which is in turn transliterated into English as "" and ""; ("") is a Georgian suffix meaning "child" or "son".
There are several etymologies of the () root. In one version, the name derives from the village of Jugaani in Kakhetia, eastern Georgia.
Neo-Nazi and other anti-Semitic sources have claimed that "Dzhuga" or "Jugha" means "Jew" in Georgian and hence "Dzhugashvili" literally means "Jew-son" or son of a Jew. This, however, is incorrect as the word for "Jew" in Georgian is "" ().
An article in the newspaper "Pravda" in 1988 claimed the word derives from the Old Georgian for "steel" which might be the reason for his adoption of the name Stalin. ("") is derived from combining the Russian (""), "steel", with the possessive suffix (""), a formula used by many other Bolsheviks, including Lenin.
According to theories Mihail Vayskopf version, it is the Ossetian for "herd of sheep"; the surname "Jugayev" is common among Ossetians, and before the revolution the names in South Ossetia were traditionally written with the Georgian suffix, especially among Christianized Ossetians. Allusions to the hypothesis of Ossetian ethnicity of Stalin are present in the important Stalin Epigram by Osip Mandelstam:
Like other Bolsheviks, he became commonly known by one of his revolutionary "noms de guerre", of which "Stalin" was only the last. During his education in Tiflis, he picked up the nickname "Koba", the Robin Hood-like protagonist from the 1883 novel "The Patricide" by Alexander Kazbegi. This became his favorite nickname throughout his revolutionary life. Stalin continued to use Koba as his Party name in the underground world of the RSDLP. During conversations, Vladimir Lenin called Stalin "Koba". Among his friends he was sometimes known by his childhood nickname "Soso" – a Georgian diminutive form of the name Iosif (Ioseb).
Stalin is also reported to have used at least a dozen other nicknames, pseudonyms and aliases such as "Josef Besoshvili"; "Ivanov"; "A. Ivanovich"; "Soselo" (a youthful nickname), "K. Kato"; "G. Nizheradze"; "Chizhikov" or "Chizhnikov"; "Petrov"; "Vissarionovich"; "Vassilyi". Directly following World War II, as the Soviets were negotiating with the Allies, Stalin often sent directions to Molotov as "Druzhkov".
Date of birth.
For a long time, the date of birth of Stalin was falsified. Although there is an inconsistency among published sources about Stalin's year and date of birth, Iosif Dzhugashvili is found in the records of the Uspensky Church in Gori, Georgia as born on 18 December (Old Style: 6 December) 1878. This birth date is maintained in his School Leaving Certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, a police arrest record from 18 April 1902 which gave his age as 23 years, and all other surviving pre-Revolution documents. As late as 1921, Stalin himself listed his birthday as 18 December 1878 in a curriculum vitae in his own handwriting. However, after his coming to power in 1922, Stalin changed the date to . That became the day his birthday was celebrated in the Soviet Union.
Rumours of being an Okhranka agent.
Stalin's apparent ease in escaping from Tsarist persecution and very light sentences bore rumours of him being an Okhranka agent. His efforts in 1909 to root out traitors caused much strife within the party; some accused him of doing this deliberately on the orders of the Okhranka. The Menshevik Razhden Arsenidze accused Stalin of betraying comrades he didn't like to the Okhranka. The prominent Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan directly accused Stalin of being an Okhrana agent in 1916. According to his personal secretary Olga Shatunovskaya, these opinions were shared by Stanislav Kosior, Iona Yakir and other prominent Bolsheviks. The rumours were reinforced by being published in the Soviet Union memoirs of Domenty Vadachkory who wrote Stalin used an Okhranka badge (supposedly stolen) to help him escape exile. It also appears suspicious that Stalin played down the number of his escapes from prisons and exiles. Still there was no hard evidence of Stalin collaboration with the Okhranka were found and a few alleged reports from Stalin to the Okhranka published by media appear to be forgeries.
Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, found that in all surviving Okhranka records Stalin is described as a revolutionary and never a spy. Montefiore argues Stalin escaped from his exiles so frequently because the exile system was not secure: an exile only needed money and false papers to escape the village where he was settled, and thousands did. Stalin also had spies of his own in the Okhranka, warning him of their actions. In 1956, the magazine Life published a letter by Colonel Ermin, head of the Tiflis Okhranka, that said Stalin was an agent, but it has since been shown to be a forgery. In his 1967 biography of Stalin, Edward Ellis Smith argued that Stalin was an Okhranka agent by citing his suspicious ability to escape from Okhranka dragnets, travel unimpeded, and rabble-rouse full-time with no apparent source of income. One such example was the raid that occurred on the night of April 3, 1901, when nearly everyone of importance in the Socialist-Democratic movement in Tiflis was arrested, except for Stalin, who was apparently "enjoying the balmy spring air, and in one of his to-hell-with-the-revolution moods, is too impossible for serious consideration." Montefiore, however, wrote that Stalin spotted Okhranka agents waiting for him outside his place of employment whilst he was riding a tram; he stayed on the tram and immediately went into hiding.
A speculation exists, that some Bolshevisks were in fact double agents. Since there was no practical way for the revolutionaries to avoid eventual infiltration of their ranks by the Okhranka provocateurs, the leaders secretly allowed some to become agents in order to gain more benefits for their cause than they had to trade in. A possible example of this was Roman Malinovsky, who was exposed beyond any doubt to have been a provocateur, yet he returned to Russia from abroad after the October Revolution in hopes of being acquitted. And Lenin was very reluctant at believing the evidence, saying the release of it might have been intended by the Okhranka to play the Bolsheviks against one another (which it indeed might have been, if they had figured out Malinovsky's real loyalties). However, faced with the consequences of admitting such a shady practice and the possibility of exposing other such double agents who remained valuable to the party, Lenin had to give up and Malinovsky was shot.

Type 80 (pistol)

The Type 80 is a Chinese 7.62 mm machine pistol.
History.
The Type 80 was built in the late 1970s as a personal defense weapon for vehicle crews and other military personnel of the People's Liberation Army of China. It was accepted into service in 1980.
Construction.
The " 'Type 80 was created by refining and upgrading the design of the various Chinese copies of the imported German selective-fire M712 "Schnellfeuer" version of the Mauser C96 Broomhandle automatic pistol that were produced and used in China in the 1930s. 
The internal design derives from the basic Mauser action with a slight recoil of the barrel enabling the locking piece under the lightweight bolt to drop out of engagement and borrows from the later Westinger (rather than the Nickl) selector mechanism. There is an obvious family resemblance in outline with the Broomhandles having the magazine well in front of the trigger, slender barrel and exposed hammer. The pistol has a permanent unregulated sight set at a distance of 50 m (the maximum effective distance when firing in bursts). The selector permitted either single shots or bursts up to the limit of the 20 round box magazine. The cyclic rate is believed to be around 850 rounds per minute. When firing bursts it is expected that the holster/stock or alternative metal shoulder stock would be attached to the slot at the back of the grip. The pistol grip itself has a more ergonomic shape than the traditional Mauser C96's "broomhandle". Another slight difference is the slight forward slope to the magazine, intended to give greater reliability in feeding.
The Type 80 was developed in the 1970s and introduced into service in 1980. It was intended to give service personnel such as tank crews an individual weapon compact enough to be carried as standard equipment. Whilst not having the range or power of an assault rifle it would have been more accurate in carbine form than a simple pistol whilst also having the potential of automatic fire. During the 1930s the Broomhandle pistols were highly prized in China, to the extent of becoming a status symbol.
Disadvantages.
The Type 80 was designed as a machine pistol for use in close combat situations. The pistol proved to unsuitable for sustained fully automatic fire. After cycling approximately ten cartridges, the chamber would overheat and risk accidental discharge.

Medical amnesty policy

Medical Amnesty Policies are laws or acts enacted protecting from liability those who seek medical attention as a result of illegal actions. Such policies have been developing most notably in colleges in the United States regarding alcohol use by students. Schools such as Cornell University have implemented such policies to protect students seeking medical attention from illegal action for underage drinking and possession of alcohol and/or drugs. The purpose of such policies is to reduce the hesitation caused by fear of legal action to seek medical attention.
Similar policies are applicable at many levels: Colleges and universities, local communities, as well as state governments. In 2012, The Medical Amnesty Initiative was started with the specific purpose of advocating for the introduction, passage, and education of Medical Amnesty legislation throughout the United States.
Development.
Medical amnesty policies were first present in the University setting. Although failure to seek medical assistance in cases of alcohol poisoning can lead to fatal outcomes, evidence suggests that the threat of judicial consequences resulting from enforcement of the minimum drinking age or other law or policy violations leads some students to refrain from calling for emergency medical services. A study was initiated in 2002 at Cornell University to investigate if implementation of a Medical amnesty policy increase the likelihood that students will call for help in alcohol-related medical emergencies; and increase the likelihood that students treated for alcohol-related medical emergencies will receive a brief psycho-educational intervention at the university health center as a follow-up to their medical treatment.
In April 2009, more than 100 college and university presidents signed the Amethyst Initiative. The Amethyst Initiative seeks to spark discussion about the current drinking age, problems related to underage drinking, and to develop new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol. One preventative component of this that many campuses have adopted is requiring an online alcohol education course before registering for classes. Another option to better handle underage drinking is the introduction of medical amnesty policies.
Levels of protection.
Medical amnesty policies can extend legal protection to varying degrees.
Individual amnesty.
Individual amnesty is the most limited level of protection. This level protects individuals who are seeking medical attention for themselves as a result of an illegal action. Individual amnesty does not extend to organizations that person may be a part of or peers also present with the individual at that time.
Victim Amnesty.
Amnesty for victims offers more protection than individual amnesty, as it protects individuals requiring medical attention regardless of whether it was the victim or another party who sought help. Victim amnesty does not address the sanctions possible for violating parties besides the victim.
Caller amnesty.
These policies, also known as Good Samaritan policies, protects individuals who call for another person seeking medical attention as a result of an illegal action. Liability protection in medical amnesty policies can often extend to those seeking help regardless if they are the one who is given medical assistance. This policy builds on individual amnesty but does not guarantee protection from legal prosecution for an organization the persons are a part of or attending. See also Good Samaritan law.
Organizational amnesty.
Protects an organization that is related to the event at which medical attention is sought as a result of an illegal action. Organizational amnesty would extend liability protection to fraternities, sororities, clubs and other social venues that may have people at their location who are under the influence of certain intoxicants. This level of amnesty allows for the largest level of protection and is subsequently the most controversial as well. Various institutions provide medical amnesty to individuals and callers but do not extend amnesty to organizations that may be involved.
Levels of implementation.
Colleges and Universities.
Many Colleges and Universities hold some level of a Medical amnesty policy. Medical amnesty at the university level most often pertains to exemption from punishment for an intoxicated or impaired underage student if medical assistance is called to help him or her in an emergency situation. Instead of a harsher penalty for underage drinking or drug use, a student usually receives some sort of counseling by a professional following an incident to help identify if the student has a more serious alcohol or drug problem and to provide the student with suggestions on how to stay safe in the future.
Ultimately universities seek to encourage students to call for help, valuing the student's well being as the primary concern and foregoing punishment for the student's mistake, instead referring students involved to education, community service, and rehabilitation services. Richmond University compiled a list in February 2010 of colleges and universities that have a medical amnesty policy in place as of that time. The organization, Students for Sensible Drug Policy, is an extremely strong advocate for expanding medical amnesty policies on college campuses. The organization provides a list of schools who currently have a medical amnesty policy and a description of what the policy includes as well as a brief description of the school.
States.
The specifics of Medical Amnesty Acts, or sometimes titled 911 Good Samaritan or 911 Lifeline, vary from state to state. The laws are also in varying stages of development and implementation. The following states have a Medical Amnesty law: California, Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Texas, Vermont, Washington. Washington, D.C. also provides Medical Amnesty protection. Several states also have a Medical Amnesty bill moving through the legislative process.
Michigan’s Medical Amnesty Legislation, House Bill 4393, was signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on May 8, 2012, and took effect on June 1, 2012. The bill was sponsored by Representative Anthony G. Forlini at the request of Steve Marino, Aaron Letzeiser, and the Associated Students of Michigan State University.
Federal.
No federal legislation has been introduced to date concerning medical amnesty.
The Medical Amnesty Initiative.
Following the successful passage of Michigan's Medical Amnesty law, advocate Aaron Letzeiser created The Medical Amnesty Initiative; a non-profit organization dedicated to the introduction, passage, and education of Medical Amnesty legislation throughout the United States.
Effectiveness.
Cornell University completed one of the most extensive studies on Medical Amnesty Policies to date. The study found that within two years of implementing a Medical Amnesty (MAP)/Good Samaritan Policy, “students were less likely to report fear of getting an intoxicated person in trouble as a barrier to calling for help. Furthermore, the percentage of students seen by health centre staff for a brief psycho-educational intervention after an alcohol-related emergency more than doubled (from 22% to 52%) by the end of the second year.”
“This finding, combined with the survey data indicating a slight decrease in students’ barriers to calling for help, suggests that the increase in calls for help in an alcohol-related emergency was a function of the MAP and related educational efforts rather than changes in drinking practices.” 
“While well-intended, policies and practices at institutions of higher education that are designed to enforce minimum legal drinking age laws and restrict other aspects of alcohol possession and consumption may have negative consequences. For example, such policies may actually deter some students from calling for emergency medical services in dangerous circumstances caused by heavy alcohol use (Colby, Raymond, & Colby, 2000). When alcohol is present, students may be reluctant to seek help in these emergencies because of potential judicial consequences for themselves, the person in need of assistance, or the hosting organization (Meilman, 1992).Often the decision whether to call for help happens late at night and becomes the responsibility of student bystanders whose judgment may be impaired because of their own alcohol consumption.” 
“Research suggests that when individuals who are treated for alcohol-related emergencies receive, as part of their follow-up care after the emergency, a brief psycho-educational intervention examining their alcohol use, the likelihood of recurrence is reduced (Longabaughet al.,2001). At Cornell, students are unlikely to avail themselves of such services on a voluntary basis, even when they receive written requests to do so from the director of health services. In contrast, students who are required to participate in such education as a result of judicial action do so consistently. Since September 2001, the standard requirement for students with a first-time judicial violation has been participation in the Cornell BASICS (Brief Alcohol and Screening Intervention for College Students) program. The Cornell BASICS program was modeled on research that found a two session screening and feedback process, with elements of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training, to be effective in reducing drinking and the harm associated with high-risk alcohol consumption in the college environment (Baer, Kivlahan, Blume, McKnight, & Marlatt, 2001; Barnett et al., 2004; Borsari & Carey, 2000; Dimeff, Baer, Kivlahan, & Marlatt, 1999; Marlatt et al., 1998).”
"A random sample survey of Cornell undergraduates conducted in the spring of 2000 found that 19% of respondents reported thinking about calling for help because they were concerned about some-one who was severely intoxicated, though only 4% actually called for help. The most frequently cited reason for not calling for help was that the respondent was not sure if the person was sick enough (9.3%). The next highest reason given was because the respondent did not want to get the distressed individual in trouble (3.8%).”
Criticisms.
Many people have criticized medical amnesty policies as policies that perpetuate underage drinking. Critics note that the goal of ameliorating the issue of youth alcohol consumption and drug abuse should focus more on preventing such activities rather than simply providing a more open course of action once choices have been made. An alternative explanation could be that the increase in calls for help reflects an increase in heavy drinking among the student population resulting in a larger percentage of students in need of emergency assistance.

SM UB-16

SM "UB-16" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine was sunk by a British submarine in May 1918.
"UB-16" was ordered in November 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in February 1915. "UB-16" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-16" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched in April 1915 and commissioned as SM "UB-16" in May.
"UB-16" spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 23 merchant ships, about half of them British fishing vessels. The U-boat was also responsible for sinking the new British destroyer in 1917. In 1918, "UB-16" was converted into a minelayer with the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. On 10 May 1918, "UB-16" was torpedoed by the British submarine off the British east coast. Of the 16 men on board, only "UB-16"s commander survived the attack.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-16" and sister boat comprised an order of two submarines placed on 25 November from AG Weser of Bremen, a little more than three months after planning for the class began. "UB-16" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 21 February 1915. As built, "UB-16" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-16" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-16" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-16"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-16" was complete at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of "UB-16" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-16" was assembled and launched on 26 April, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-16" on 12 May 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See (Oblt.) Hans Valentiner, a 26-year-old first-time U-boat commander. On 1 June, "UB-16" joined the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When "UB-16" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom, were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
On 3 June, two days after joining the flotilla, Valentiner and "UB-16" sank three British fishing vessels while patrolling between off Lowestoft. All three of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-16", and sunk with explosives. On 12 June, "UB-16" torpedoed and sank the 3,027-ton British cargo ship "Leuctra" from the Shipwash Lightship. Nine days later, the U-boat torpedoed the British steamer "Tunisiana" off Lowestoft. After being hit, the 4,220-ton ship's master beached her on Barnard Sands to save the cargo of wheat shipped from Montreal, but the ship was a complete loss. "Tunisiana " was the largest ship sunk by "UB-16". In her first month of action, "UB-16"s totals were five ships sunk of 7,432 tons, more than half of the flotilla's June total of 14,080 tons. No lives were lost on any of "UB-16"s June victims.
"UB-16"s next two successes came on consecutive days in late July. On the 27th, "Westward Ho!", a 57-ton smack was boarded and sunk by "UB-16"s crew southeast of Lowestoft. The following day, the 1,821-ton "Mangara" was torpedoed without warning one-quarter nautical mile (500 m) from the Sizewell Buoy at Aldeburgh. Eleven men died when the ship and her cargo of iron ore were sent to the bottom.
Although the Flanders Flotilla sank 31 ships in August, "UB-16" did not add to that total. In a four-day span in September, however, she accounted for three of the eight ships sunk by the flotilla during the month. On the 7th, she sank two more fishing smacks, "Emblem" and "Victorious", from Lowestoft. On 10 September, "UB-16" sank the 51-ton "Nimrod" in the same vicinity.
Germany's submarine offensive was suspended on 18 September by the chief of the "Admiralstab", Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, in response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September. Holtzendorff's directive from ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. "UB-16" did not sink any vessels over the next four months, but resumed attacks on 18 January 1916, sinking three more smacks—"Evelyn", "Foam Crest", and "Sunshine"—between from Lowestoft.
Second submarine offensive.
By early 1916, the British blockade of Germany was beginning to have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German "Admiralstab" were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.
"UB-16"s first successes in the new offensive came on 6 March when she sank the smacks "Springflower" and "Young Harry" about east of Lowestoft. Valentiner and "UB-16" attacked another pair of ships in early April. The 653-ton British ship "Perth" was torpedoed and sunk near Yarmouth on the 1st, while the Dutch sailing vessel "Elziena Helena" was damaged in an attack two days later east of Southwold.
On 5 April, Valentiner was succeeded by Kapitänleutnant Paul Hundius, a 27-year-old, first-time U-boat skipper. In the first two weeks under Hundius' command, "UB-16" sank two British steamers: the 2,978-ton "Robert Adamson" on the 10th, and the 3,091-ton "Tregantle" on the 22nd. "Robert Adamson" was sunk from the Shipwash Lightship while en route from Dundee to Le Havre with a cargo of props. "Tregantle" had sailed from Galveston, Texas, via Norfolk, Virginia, with a load of wheat for Hull, but was sunk off Lowestoft.
Near the end of April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there. "UB-16" did not sink any more ships for the next eight months.
Grand Fleet ambush attempts.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across nests' of submarines and mine-fields". In support of the operation, "UB-16" and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30/31 May to form a line east of Lowestoft. This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich, should they sortie north to join the battle. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German High Seas Fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of several of the U-boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". In "UB-16"s group, only "UB-10" sighted the Harwich forces, and they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
"UB-16"s activities over the next two months are not reported, but on 2 August the submarine was patrolling off the Mass Lightship and torpedoed the Norwegian steamer "John Wilson", sending her cargo of food destined for London to the bottom. Later in August, Scheer set up another ambush for the British fleet, when he drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as had been the original intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, "UB-16" was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, "UB-16" was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, "UB-16" and her group played no part in the action.
Later, on 24 August, "UB-16" was again patrolling off the Mass Lightship when Hundius stopped "Velox", another Norwegian steamer headed for London. Crewmen from "UB-16" boarded the 312-ton cargo ship, planted explosives, and sank the vessel and her general cargo. "Velox" was the last ship sunk by the "UB-16" for nearly eight months, and the last sunk by Hundius before he was replaced by "Oblt." Ernst Müller-Schwarz late in the month. Neither Müller-Schwartz, nor his January 1917 replacement, "Oblt." Hans Ewald Niemer, sank any ships while in command of "UB-16".
Unrestricted submarine warfare.
By the time of the so-called "turnip winter" of 1916–17, the Royal Navy blockade of Germany had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany. Among the results were an increase in infant mortality and as many as 700,000 deaths attributed to starvation or hypothermia during the war. With the blockade having such dire consequences, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat.
With the new campaign already underway, Niemer was replaced as "UB-16"s commander by "Oblt." Hugo Thielmann on 18 March. Although only in command of "UB-16" for little more than a month, Thielmann sank one ship on "UB-16". The 107-ton Dutch motor vessel "Arie" was sunk in the Hoofden area on 20 April; there were no reports of casualties.
Kapitänleutnant Wilhelm Rhein was assigned to "UB-16" on 23 April, and under his command, "UB-16" may have been responsible for damaging the Norwegian cargo ship "Kongsli" on 26 April. On 9 August, "UB-16" torpedoed and sank the British destroyer from the North Hinder Lightship. "Recruit", commissioned four months earlier, sank with 54 of her complement. Rhein was succeeded by "Oblt." Günther Bachmann on 26 August, and he, in turn, was succeeded by "Oblt." Alfred Krameyer on 25 December.
Conversion to minelayer.
"UB-16" and three sister boats, "UB-10", "UB-12", and "UB-17", had all been converted to minelaying submarines by 1918. The conversion involved removing the bow section containing the pair of torpedo tubes from each U-boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each. In the process, the boats were lengthened to , and the displacement increased to on the surface, and below the surface. Exactly when this conversion was performed on "UB-16" is not reported, but "UB-12" was at the dockyard from November 1916 to January 1917. The lack of reported successes by "UB-16" during this same span makes it a possibility that her conversion was accomplished in a similar timeframe.
On 13 March, "UB-16", now under the command of Oblt. Rudolf Stier, was responsible for sinking the 895-ton steamer "Lisette" near the Shipwash Lightship. One month later, on 13 April, the fishing smack "Ruth" was boarded and sunk by "UB-16"; "Ruth" was the final ship sunk by "UB-16".
On 28 April, British forces attempted to block the canal at Zeebrugge and bottle up the vessels of the Flanders Flotilla in the Zeebrugge Raid. In the raid, the British succeeded in sinking two obsolete cruisers, and , in the narrowest part of the canal. British admiral Roger Keyes, who had planned the raid, believed that the Flanders Flotilla ships were bottled up for a long period of time. However, the following day, after the Germans had removed two piers, "UB-16"—under "Oblt." Vicco von der Lühe, her newest commander—made the first sortie from Zeebrugge after the raid.
Sinking.
"UB-16" departed Zeebrugge for what would be the final time on 6 May 1918 for a patrol off Harwich. At 18:50 on 10 May, the British submarine spotted "UB-16" on the surface near Harwich. Although "E34"s commanding officer Lieutenant Pulleyne initially believed that "UB-16" was a British submarine, he submerged out of caution because of "UB-16"s proximity to Harwich. After identifying the submarine as a German boat, Pulleyne maneuvered to attack. At 19:15, "E34" launched two torpedoes at "UB-16" from a distance of . The first hit "UB-16"s bow and failed to detonate, but the second hit below the conning tower and exploded, sinking "UB-16" at position in less than five minutes. After a further five minutes, "E34" surfaced near where "UB-16" had gone down, and rescued von der Lühe from the oily water; he was the only survivor. Von der Lühe was imprisoned in a British prisoner of war camp, where he died of influenza on 1 March 1919. British divers dispatched to the site of "UB-16"s demise a week later could only find some plating and a few pipes and concluded that "UB-16" had disintegrated after the torpedo hit.

Joseph Stalin in the Russian Revolution, Russian Civil War, and Polish–Soviet War

Joseph Stalin was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. In the years following Lenin's death in 1924, he rose to become the authoritarian leader of the Soviet Union.
After growing up in Georgia, Stalin conducted activities for the Bolshevik party for twelve years before the Russian Revolution of 1917. After being elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee in April 1917, Stalin helped Lenin to evade capture by authorities and ordered the besieged Bolsheviks to surrender to avoid a bloodbath. The Bolsheviks then seized Petrograd and Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs.
In the civil war that followed between Lenin's Red Army against the White Army, Stalin formed alliances with Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny while leading troops in the Caucasus. There, he ordered the killings of former Tsarist officers and counter-revolutionaries and burned villages to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage food bandit raids. After their Civil War victory, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Ukraine. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine, Stalin's actions in the war were later criticized, including by Leon Trotsky.
Background.
Stalin was born on December 18, 1878 in Gori, Georgia to a family of limited financial means. He was the fourth child born to the family of Ekaterina Gheladze and Vissarion Djugashvili. However, the prior three children of the couple had died at an early age. Stalin later became politically active and, during the Russian Revolution of 1905, organized and armed Bolshevik militias across Georgia, running protection rackets and waging guerrilla warfare. After meeting Lenin at a Bolshevik conference in 1906 and marrying Ekaterina Svanidze, with whom he had a son Yakov, Stalin temporarily resigned from the party over its ban on bank robberies. Embarking on an effort to organize Muslim Azeri and Persian partisans in the Caucasus, Stalin conducted protection rackets, ransom kidnappings, counterfeiting operations and robberies, until arrest and exile in 1908.
Between 1908 and 1917, Stalin was arrested seven times and escaped five times, enjoying less than two years of liberty in the nine-year period.
Role during the Russian Revolution of 1917.
Supporting revolution and saving Lenin.
In the wake of the February Revolution of 1917 (the first phase of the Russian Revolution of 1917), Stalin was released from exile. On March 25 he returned to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) with just a typewriter and a wicker suitcase, wearing a suit he had on in 1913 when he was arrested. On March 28, together with Lev Kamenev and Matvei Muranov Stalin ousted Vyacheslav Molotov and Alexander Shlyapnikov as editors of "Pravda", the official Bolshevik newspaper, while Lenin and much of the Bolshevik leadership were still in exile. Stalin and the new editorial board took a position in favor of the Provisional Government (Molotov and Shlyapnikov had wanted to overthrow it) and went to the extent of declining to publish Lenin's 'letters from afar' arguing for the provisional government to be overthrown. He described them as "Unsatisfactory...a sketch with no facts."
For a week from March 31, Stalin stopped writing articles, this may have been when he switched to Lenin's position. However, after Lenin prevailed at the April Party conference, Stalin and the rest of the "Pravda" staff came on board with Lenin's view and called for overthrowing the provisional government. At this April 1917 Party conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee with 97 votes in the party, the third highest after Zinoviev and Lenin. These three plus Kamenev formed the Central Committee's Bureau. Stalin would share a flat with Molotov where he apologised: "You were the nearest of all to Lenin in the initial stage in April."
On June 24, Stalin threatened to resign when Lenin turned against the idea of an armed demonstration when the Soviet refused to support it. It went ahead anyway on July 1 and was a Bolshevik triumph.
In mid-July, armed mobs led by Bolshevik militants took to the streets of Petrograd, killing army officers and bourgeois civilians. Sailors from Kronstadt phoned Stalin asking if an armed uprising was feasible. He said: "Rifles? You comrades know best." This was enough encouragement for them. They demanded the overthrow of the government, but neither the Bolshevik leadership nor the Petrograd Soviet was willing to take power, having been totally surprised by this unplanned revolt. After the disappointed mobs dispersed, Kerensky's government struck back at the Bolsheviks. Loyalist troops raided "Pravda" on July 18 and surrounded the Bolshevik headquarters. Stalin helped Lenin evade capture minutes before and, to avoid a bloodbath, ordered the besieged Bolsheviks in the Peter and Paul Fortress to surrender.
Stalin put Lenin in five different hiding places, the last being the Alliluyev family apartment. Convinced Lenin would be killed if caught, Stalin persuaded him not to surrender and smuggled him to Finland. He shaved off Lenin's beard and moustache, took him to Primorsky station then to a shack north of Petrograd, then to a barn in Finland. In Lenin's absence, Stalin assumed leadership of the Bolsheviks. At the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party, held secretly in Petrograd, Stalin gave the main report, was chosen to be the chief editor of the Party press and a member of the Constituent Assembly, and was re-elected to the Central Committee.
The coup of general Lavr Kornilov.
In September 1917, Kerensky suspected his newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, General Lavr Kornilov, of planning a coup and dismissed him. Believing Kerensky was being controlled by the Bolsheviks, Kornilov decided to march his army on Petrograd. In desperation, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help and released the Bolsheviks, who raised a small army to defend the capital. In the end, Kerensky convinced Kornilov's army to stand down and disband without violence. However, the Bolsheviks were now free, rearmed, swelling with new recruits and under Stalin's firm control, whilst Kerensky had few troops loyal to him in the capital. Lenin decided the time for a coup had arrived. Kamenev and Zinoviev proposed a coalition with the Mensheviks, but Stalin and Trotsky backed Lenin's wish for an exclusively Bolshevik government. Lenin returned to Petrograd in October. On October 23, the Central Committee voted 10-2 in favor of an insurrection; Kamenev and Zinoviev voted in opposition.
On the morning of November 6, Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press headquarters and smashed his printing presses. While he worked to restore his presses, he missed a Central Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from Lenin, who was in hiding.
Early the next day, Stalin went to the Smolny Institute from where he, Lenin and the rest of the Central Committee coordinated the coup. Kerensky left the capital to rally the Imperial troops at the German front. By November 8, the Winter Palace had been stormed and Kerensky's Cabinet had been arrested.
Role in the Russian Civil War, 1917–1919.
Upon seizing Petrograd, the Bolsheviks formed the new revolutionary authority, the Council of People's Commissars. Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs; his job was to establish an institution to win over non-Russian citizens of the former Russian Empire. He was relieved of his post as editor of "Pravda" so that he could devote himself fully to his new role.
In March 1918, the Menshevik leader Julius Martov published an article exposing Bolshevik crimes committed before the revolution. Martov wrote that Stalin had organized bank robberies and had been expelled from his own party for doing so (the latter part is untrue). Stalin sued Martov for libel and won.
After seizing Petrograd, civil war broke out in Russia, pitting Lenin's Red Army against the White Army, a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed an eight-member Politburo which included Stalin and Trotsky. During this time, only Stalin and Trotsky were allowed to see Lenin without an appointment.
In May 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of Tsaritsyn (later known as Stalingrad, now Volgograd). Situated on the Lower Volga, it was a key supply route to the oil and grain of the North Caucasus. There was a critical shortage of food in Russia, and Stalin was assigned to procure any he could find according to Prodrazvyorstka policy. The city was also in danger of falling to the White Army. He opposed the “military specialists”— former Tsarist professional military officers— and formed the "Tsaritsyn group," a loose group of like-minded Bolshevik military leaders and party members personally loyal to Stalin. In doing so, he first met and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, both of whom would become two of Stalin's key supporters in the military. Through his new allies, he imposed his influence on the military; in July Lenin granted his request for official control over military operations in the region to fight the Battle for Tsaritsyn.
Stalin challenged many of the decisions of Trotsky, who at this time was Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and thus his military superior. He ordered the killings of many former Tsarist officers in the Red Army; Trotsky, in agreement with the Central Committee, had hired them for their expertise, but Stalin distrusted them. This created friction between Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin even wrote to Lenin asking that Trotsky be relieved of his post.
Stalin ordered the executions of any suspected counter-revolutionaries. In the countryside, he burned villages to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage bandit raids on food shipments.
Stalin returned to Moscow in early 1919 and married his longtime companion, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, on March 24. At the Eighth Party Congress in March, Lenin criticised Stalin for using tactics that led to excessive casualties.
In May 1919, Stalin was dispatched to the Western Front, near Petrograd. To stem mass desertions and defections of Red Army soldiers, Stalin had deserters and renegades rounded up and publicly executed as traitors.
Role in the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–1920.
After the Bolsheviks turned the tide and were winning the civil war in late 1919, Lenin and many others wanted to expand the revolution westwards into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Stalin, in Ukraine at the time, argued these ambitions were unrealistic, but lost. He was briefly transferred to the Caucasus in February 1920, but managed to get transferred back to Ukraine in May where he accepted the position of the Comissar of the South-West Front (commander Alexander Yegorov).
In late July 1920, Yegorov moved against the then-Polish city of Lwów, which conflicted with the general strategy set by Lenin and Trotsky by drawing his troops further away from the forces advancing on Warsaw. In mid-August the Commander-in-Chief Sergei Kamenev ordered the transfer of troops (1st Cavalry Army, commanded by Semyon Budyonny and Kliment Voroshilov) from Yegorov's forces to reinforce the attack on Warsaw led by Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Stalin refused to counter-sign the order because it did not have the requisite two signatures on it, a reasonable response. In the end, the battles for both Lwów and Warsaw were lost, and Stalin's actions were held partly to blame.
Richard Pipes suggested Lenin was more to blame, for ordering Soviet troops south to spread revolution to Romania, and north to secure the Polish corridor for Germany (this would win over German nationalists). Both these diversions weakened the Soviet assault. Much blame must be laid on the overall commander, Kamenev, for permitting insubordination from both front commanders and conflicting and ever changing strategic orders during the critical phase in the attack on Warsaw.
Stalin returned to Moscow in August 1920, where he defended himself before the Politburo by attacking the whole campaign strategy. Although this tactic worked, he nonetheless resigned his military commission, something he had repeatedly threatened to do when he didn't get his way. At the Ninth Party Conference on September 22, Trotsky openly criticized Stalin's war record. Stalin was accused of insubordination, personal ambition, military incompetence and seeking to build his own reputation by victories on his own front at the expense of operations elsewhere. Neither he nor anybody else challenged these attacks; he only briefly reaffirmed his position that the war itself was a mistake, something which everybody agreed on by this point.

SM UB-17

SM "UB-17" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine disappeared during a patrol in March 1918.
"UB-17" was ordered in November 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in February 1915. "UB-17" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-17" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched in April 1915 and commissioned as SM "UB-17" in May.
"UB-17" spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 13 ships, most of them British fishing vessels. She also captured two ships as prizes and damaged one tanker. On 11 March 1918, "UB-17" departed for a patrol in the Hoofden but was never seen again. There have been several suggestions as to "UB-17"s fate, but none match the U-boat's operation details.
In July 2013, "UB-17" was found off England's east coast, near the county of Suffolk by archaeologists.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.
"UB-17" and sister boat comprised an order of two submarines ordered on 25 November from AG Weser of Bremen, a little more than three months after planning for the class began. "UB-17" was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 21 February 1915. As built, "UB-17" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Körting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-17" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-17" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-17"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-17" was complete at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of "UB-17" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-17" was assembled and launched on 21 April, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-17" on 4 May 1915 under the command of Kapitänleutnant ("Kapt.") Ralph Wenninger, a 25-year-old former skipper of . On 10 May, "UB-17" joined the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When "UB-17" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom, were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
On 18 July, Wenninger torpedoed the British tanker "Batoum" just off the Southwold lighthouse. Despite the loss of six men, "Batoum"s crew was able to beach the ship, listed as . Early the next month, on 6 August, Wenninger and "UB-17" sank four British fishing vessels while patrolling in the Yarmouth–Lowestoft area. All four of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-17", and sunk with explosives.
On 18 August, the chief of the "Admiralstab", Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, issued orders suspending the first offensive in response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September. Holtzendorff's directive ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. Six days later, "UB-17" seized the Belgian sailing vessel "Leon Mathilde" as a prize off Ostende.
Enemy naval targets were not subject to the prize regulations, so on 23 September, Wenninger torpedoed and sank the , a trawler of the French Navy off the Dyck lightship. There was only one survivor from the 303-ton ship's eighteen-man crew. Three months later, Wenninger misidentified the 74-ton French fishing ship "Jesus Maria" as a destroyer. "UB-17" launched a torpedo which struck the ship and killed all six men of "Jesus Maria"s crew.
On 31 January 1916, in the Lowestoft–Aldeburgh area, "UB-17" sank an additional four fishing ships: three British, and one Belgian. The next day, "UB-17"s war journal () records the torpedoing of the 957-ton British steamer "Franz Fischer" off the Kentish Knock. British records list the cargo ship as being sunk by bombs from a zeppelin. "Franz Fischer" was the last ship sunk with Wenninger in command. On 7 February, he was relieved by Oberleutnant zur See ("Oblt.") Arthur Metz for a month, "Kapt." Werner Fürbringer for a week, and "Oblt." Friedrich Moecke for another month. Wenninger resumed command on 16 April.
In the meantime, Germany had begun its second submarine offensive against merchant shipping at the end of February in reaction to the British blockade of Germany. By early 1916, the British blockade was having an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. "UB-17" sank no ships during this offensive, which was called off near the end of April by Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet.
Grand Fleet ambush attempts.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across nests' of submarines and mine-fields". In support of the operation, "UB-17" and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30/31 May to form a line east of Lowestoft. This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich, should they sortie north to join the battle. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German High Seas Fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of several of the U-boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". In "UB-16"s group, only "UB-10" sighted the Harwich forces, and they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
Wenninger left "UB-17" for good on 27 June and was succeeded by "Kapt." Günther Suadicani, who commanded the boat for just under two weeks. He was followed by "Oblt." Hans Degetau, who commanded the boat from July to December. Under Degetau's leadership, "UB-17" added another ship to her tally when she captured and sank the Dutch ship "Zeearend" on 1 September. The 462-ton steamer was en route to London from Rotterdam with a cargo of piece goods when she was sunk from the Mass Lightship. "UB-17"s next success was the capture of the Norwegian steamer "Birgit" in the Hoofden area under the command of "Kapt." Ulrich Meier, who had taken command on 4 December. "Birgit" was the last success for "UB-17" for the next twelve months.
Conversion to minelayer.
"UB-17" and three sister boats, "UB-10", "UB-12", and "UB-16", were all converted to minelaying submarines by 1918. The conversion involved removing the bow section containing the pair of torpedo tubes from each U-boat and replacing it with a new bow containing four mine chutes capable of carrying two mines each. In the process, the boats were lengthened to , and the displacement increased to on the surface, and below the surface. Exactly when this conversion was performed on "UB-17" is not reported, but "UB-17" was at the dockyard from November 1916 to January 1917, and it is possible "UB-17" was converted during this same timeframe.
While Meier remained in command of "UB-17", Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace. Although the new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat, "UB-17" did not contribute to the effort until December 1917, when she captured and sank a single fishing smack off Aldeburgh under the direction of "Oblt." Johannes Ries. In January 1918, Ries was replaced by "Oblt." Albert Branscheid.
Sinking.
On 11 March 1918, Branscheid led "UB-17" out from Zeebrugge for a patrol in the Hoofden and the U-boat was never seen again. One postwar account tells of two British seaplanes that bombed a U-boat in the North Sea on 12 March, but, according to author Dwight Messimer, the account provides no details to support the claim. Messimer also discounts an account that attributes "UB-17"s sinking to British destroyer on 25 February south of Portland by pointing out that "UB-17" was in port in Zeebrugge on that date. A German postwar study also rejected a British claim that destroyers , , and sank "UB-17" at 21:25 on 11 March at position because "UB-17" didn't depart Zeebrugge until 30 minutes after the attack took place. Whatever the specific cause of "UB-17"s demise, all eighteen crewmen on board the submarine were killed.
Discovery.
In July 2013, archaeologists found the remains of 44 submarines, including UB-17, off the United Kingdom's southern and east coasts, near the county of Suffolk. The find was made up mostly of vessels from the German Imperial Navy dating to World War I. "Der Spiegel" reported divers located 41 German U-boats, and three of English submarines, found at depths of up to 50 feet, off England's southern and eastern coasts.

S-550 (spacecraft)

The S-550 was a proposed manned space capsule, designed in 2005-06 at Venturer Aerospace, in response to the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to provide commercial resupply and logistics support for the International Space Station after the retirement of the Space Shuttle.
It was an outgrowth of earlier Venturer Aerospace manned capsule research and development projects.
NASA did not select the design for further funded development, and the company has not to date proceeded to develop the vehicle with private funding. Venturer Aerospace did not participate in the second COTS program round in 2007.
Description.
The S-550 capsule was intended to carry up to six people (normally 2 or 3) and significant internal and external cargo on resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Unlike the other COTS competitors, the S-550 capsule was explicitly a human-operated vehicle - while it had automated flight functions, it was intended to be flown with crews for any space station mission, using manned control for all rendezvous and dockings with ISS.
Design.
The overall vehicle was design was for a -diameter ballistic capsule, weighing including payloads. The capsule was projected to weigh "wet" (with 2 crew and consumables, but not cargo), the service module "wet" including rocket propellants, and of internal cargo or passengers within the capsule. Additional mass in external unpressurized cargo could be obtained with increased launch vehicle capacity beyond or by trading off internal cargo for external cargo.
Capsule shape.
The S-550 capsule is a sphere-cone type lifting ballistic space capsule, similar to the shape of the film capsule reentry modules in the Corona spy satellite, but much larger. The general shape was also used by COTS competitor T/Space's CXV capsule. The capsule design shape had a spherical nose section diameter of 0.8 of the base diameter and 10 degree conical half-angle (see Atmospheric reentry).
Capsule layout.
The capsule consisted of two structures - an outer aeroshell, which supported the ablative heatshield (thermal protection system), and an inner pressurized cylinder containing the crew, systems, and cargo space. 
Most of the spacecraft systems were at the front of the cylinder, up against the front bulkhead. The crew were seated in one row near the rear bulkhead and access hatch, with 2 "crew" seats on the sides with flight controls on the rear bulkhead and one passenger in the middle. Cargo was carried in the middle of the capsule, at the capsule's center of gravity, to simplify loading effects on reentry angles and lift.
Descent and landing.
The S-550 capsule was intended to descend under a parachute system and touch down on land, using an inert aluminum foam crush structure in the nose of the capsule to attenuate the roughly 7 meter per second touchdown velocity. The landing did not require any active controls or systems to operate safely. Emergency landings in the water were handled by capsule flotation systems.
Service module.
The service module was intended to provide rocket thrusters to control spacecraft attitude and provide orbital maneuvering capability to rendezvous with the International Space Station and then reenter the Earth's atmosphere. It included some structure, propellant tanks, and rocket motor systems.

Sentimental Street

"Sentimental Street" is a song by American hard rock band Night Ranger. It was released in 1985 as the lead single from their album, "Seven Wishes". It reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the U.S.
Music video.
The music video for "Sentimental Street" starts with a news anchor starting the topic of the band gone missing after they took off from a desert. The plane was a vintage B-25 Mitchell bomber used as the background of their new album. We later see the band, still in their fighter pilot clothing standing in the desert stranded, waiting for help. While Fitzgerald, Keagy, and Watson stand waiting, Gillis looks over the horizon trying to spot any aircraft, but to no avail. Blades, on the other hand, is seen sleeping with a magic lamp in his hands. One of the waiting men - we cannot tell which one - kicks it out of his grasp, waking him up. All the members, except Gillis, gather around the lamp and stare at it in awe. We then see band members leave their homes to get ready for the band's tour. Watson and Keagy leave for the tour by car, Gillis and Fitzgerald leave by train, and Blades hitches a ride on the interstate. They all end up in a large, urban city and meet in an apartment to practice. During the practice, Watson and Gillis start arguing about something and soon the band starts fighting. We next see the band performing at dance clubs for the rest of the video, with some transitions of the band stranded in the desert. When Gillis does his solo, he is wearing exactly the same shirt that Watson wore in the "Don't Tell Me You Love Me" music video. At the end of the video, Keagy hands the magic lamp to Gillis while we hear the news anchor finishing off the story.

Rise of Joseph Stalin

Joseph Stalin was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. In the years following Lenin's death in 1924, he rose to become the leader of the Soviet Union.
After growing up in Georgia, Stalin conducted activities for the Bolshevik party for twelve years before the Russian Revolution of 1917. After participating, Stalin took military leadership positions in the Russian Civil War and Soviet-Polish War. Stalin was one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus and grew very close to Lenin, who saw him as a capable and loyal follower. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia, adopting a particularly hardline approach to opposition. His connections helped him attain high positions in the new Soviet government, eventually becoming General Secretary in 1922. Lenin grew critical of Stalin, and many other Bolsheviks at this time, but in 1922 a stroke forced Lenin into semi-retirement. Lenin recommended Stalin's dismissal. However, after Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin suppressed documentation of Lenin's recommendation. Thereafter, Stalin politically isolated his major enemies, such as arch-rival Leon Trotsky, and had them dismissed from government altogether. This eventually led him to be the sole uncontested leader of the Party and the Soviet Union.
Background.
For over a decade before the Russian Revolution of 1917, Stalin was one of the chief Bolshevik operatives in the Caucasus, organising cells, spreading propaganda, and raising money through criminal activities. He eventually earned a place in Lenin's inner circle and the highest echelons of the Bolshevik hierarchy. In 1917, he participated in the Bolshevik uprising in the Russian capital of Petrograd. His pseudonym, Stalin, means "man of steel".
In the civil war that followed, Stalin forged connections with various Red Army generals and eventually acquired military powers of his own. He brutally suppressed counter-revolutionaries and bandits. After winning the civil war, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Ukraine. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine, Stalin's actions in the war were later criticized by many, including Leon Trotsky.
General Secretary and invasion of Georgia.
In late 1920, Trotsky argued for a ban on trade unions and a formal imposition of Party dictatorship over the industrial sectors. Fearing a backlash from the unions, Lenin asked Stalin to build a support base for him against Trotsky. Lenin's faction eventually prevailed at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921. Frustrated by the squabbling factions within the Party during what he saw as a time of crisis, Lenin convinced the Tenth Congress to pass a ban on any opposition to official Central Committee policy (the Ban on Factions, a law which Stalin would later exploit to expel his enemies). Lenin still, however, encountered difficulties pushing his policies through and decided to give his reliable ally, Stalin, more power. With the help of Kamenev, Lenin successfully had Stalin appointed to the post of General Secretary on April 3, 1922. Stalin still held his posts in the Orgburo, the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate and the Commassariat for Nationalities Affairs, though he agreed to delegate his workload to subordinates. With this power, he would steadily place his supporters in positions of authority.
Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia following which he adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards Soviet Georgia, which included severe repression of all opposition within the local Communist party (e.g., the Georgian Affair of 1922), not to mention any manifestations of anti-Sovietism (the August Uprising of 1924). It was in the Georgian affairs that Stalin first began to play his own hand. Lenin, however, disliked Stalin's policy towards Georgia, as he believed all the Soviet states should be on equal standing with Russia rather than be absorbed and subordinated to it.
Lenin's retirement and death.
On May 25, 1922, Lenin suffered a stroke while recovering from surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck since a failed assassination attempt in August 1918. Severely debilitated, he went into semi-retirement and moved to his dacha in Gorki. After this, Trotsky and Stalin were concerned about who was going to be the next successor. Trotsky and Lenin had more of a personal relationship and Lenin and Stalin had more of a political relationship. Yet, Stalin visited him often, acting as his intermediary with the outside world. During this time, the two quarrelled over economic policy and how to consolidate the Soviet republics. Lenin and Stalin were agreeing on more political ideas than disagreeing, which was creating a closer relationship. One day, Stalin verbally swore at Lenin's wife for breaching Politburo orders by helping Lenin communicate with Trotsky and others about politics; this greatly offended Lenin. As their relationship deteriorated, Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin in what would become his testament. Trotsky criticised Stalin's rude manners, excessive power, ambition and politics, and suggested that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary to Lenin. One of Lenin's secretaries showed Stalin the notes, whose contents shocked him. Before Stalin could mend any bridges, Lenin suffered a heart attack on March 10, 1923 which left him completely incapacitated.
During Lenin's semi-retirement, Stalin forged an alliance with Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev against Trotsky. These allies prevented Lenin's Testament from being revealed to the Twelfth Party Congress in April 1923. Although they too were disconcerted by Stalin's power and some of his policies, they needed his help in opposing Trotsky's faction and his possible succession to Lenin.
Lenin died of a stroke on January 21, 1924. Stalin was given the honour of organising his funeral. Against Lenin's wishes, he was given a lavish funeral and his body was embalmed and put on display. Thanks to Kamenev and Zinoviev's influence, the Central Committee decided that Lenin's Testament should not be made public. At the Thirteenth Party Congress in May, it was read out only to the heads of the provincial delegations. Trotsky did not want to appear divisive so soon after Lenin's death and did not seize the opportunity to demand Stalin's removal.
Downfall of Trotsky.
In the months following Lenin's death, Stalin's disputes with Kamenev and Zinoviev intensified. These two Bolsheviks did not regard Stalin highly, and often disparaged him in private even as they had aided him publicly. Stalin allied himself now with Nikolai Bukharin, whom he had promoted to the Politburo at the Thirteenth Party Congress. At the Fourteenth Party Congress in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Party.
Stalin began advocating "Socialism in One Country," which says that the Bolsheviks should focus building communism in the countries they already controlled rather than spreading the revolution. This drew to him many like-minded Party members but put him in ideological opposition to Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev. Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev formed a United Opposition against Stalin, demanding greater freedom of expression and a repeal of Lenin's 1921 Ban on Factions. Stalin eventually defeated this opposition, and forced Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev to sign a letter of submission to him.
Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev grew increasingly isolated and were ejected from the Central Committee in October 1927. On November 14, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Party itself, followed by Kamenev at the Fifteenth Party Congress in December. Kamenev and Zinoviev were readmitted some six months later after writing open letters of apology, however Trotsky didn't. Trotsky lived in exile in Alma-ata for a while, and was finally exiled from the Soviet Union itself in January 1929.
Dominating the Politburo.
Stalin began pushing for more rapid industrialisation and central control of the economy, a position which resonated with many Party members who disliked Lenin's New Economic Policy. At the end of 1927, a critical shortfall in grain supplies prompted Stalin to push for collectivisation of agriculture. In January 1928, he personally travelled to Siberia where he oversaw the seizure of grain hoards from kulak farmers. Many in the Party supported the seizures, but Bukharin and Premier Rykov were outraged. Bukharin criticized Stalin's plans for rapid industrialization financed by kulak wealth, and advocated a return to Lenin's NEP. However, he was unable to rally sufficient support from the higher levels of the Party to oppose Stalin. Stalin accused Bukharin of factionalism (banned by Lenin since 1921) and capitalist tendencies. The other Politburo members sided with Stalin, and labelled Bukharin a "Right Deviationist" from Marxist-Leninist principles. Bukharin was ejected from the Politburo in November 1929. 
Stalin's agricultural policies were also criticized by fellow Politburo member Mikhail Kalinin. In the summer of 1930, Stalin exposed Kalinin's embezzlement of state funds, which he spent on a mistress. Kalinin begged forgiveness and effectively submitted himself to Stalin. In September 1930, Stalin proposed dismissing Premier Rykov, who was Bukharin's fellow oppositionist. The other Politburo members agreed with Stalin, and supported his nomination of Vyacheslav Molotov. On December 19, the Central Committee dismissed Rykov and replaced him with Molotov.
By the 1930s, open criticism of Stalin within the Party was virtually non-existent, though Stalin continued to hunt for discreet dissenters. Stalin dominated the Politburo (the executive branch of the Soviet government) through staunch allies such as Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Lazar Kaganovich, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Kliment Voroshilov.
Death of his wife.
On the night of November 9, 1932, Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, shot herself in her bedroom. Stalin was sleeping in another room that night, so her death was not discovered until the next morning. To prevent a scandal, Pravda reported the cause of death as appendicitis. Stalin did not tell his own children the truth to prevent them from spreading the truth accidentally.
The Great Terror.
On December 1, 1934, Sergei Kirov was murdered by Leonid Nikolaev. The death of this popular, high-profile politician shocked Russia, and Stalin used this murder to begin The Great Terror. Within hours of Kirov's death, Stalin declared Grigory Zinoviev and his supporters to be responsible for Kirov's murder. Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev were arrested and, to escape long prison sentences, confessed to political and moral responsibility for Kirov's murder. They were sentenced to five and ten years respectively. Stalin sanctioned the formation of troikas for the purpose of extrajudicial punishment. Hundreds of oppositionists linked to Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested and exiled to Siberia. In late 1935, Stalin reopened the case. Kamenev and Zinoviev were interrogated again, and Trotsky was now implicated in Kirov's murder. In July 1936, Stalin personally promised to Kamenev and Zinoviev that there would be no executions or persecution of their families if they confessed to conspiring with Trotsky. This promise was broken. After a show trial, Kamenev and Zinoviev were executed that August.
Spearheading Stalin's campaign was a Commissar called Nikolai Yezhov, a fervent Stalinist and a believer in violent repression. Nikolai Yezhov continued to expand the lists of suspects to include all the old oppositionists as well as entire nationalities, such as the Poles.
Stalin distrusted the Soviet secret police - the NKVD - which was filled with Old Bolsheviks and ethnicities he distrusted, such as Poles, Jews and Latvians. In September 1936, Stalin fired the head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda, and replaced him with the more aggressive and zealous Yezhov.
Since his falling out with Stalin in the late 1920s, Bukharin wrote an endless stream of letters of repentance and admiration to Stalin. However, Stalin knew Bukharin's repentance was insincere, as in private Bukharin continued to court Stalin's opponents (the NKVD wiretapped Bukharin's telephone). Kamenev and Zinoviev had denounced him as a traitor during their trial. At the December 1936 plenum of the Central Committee, Yezhov accused Bukharin and Alexey Rykov of treachery. In March 1938, Bukharin was coerced into confessing to conspiring against Stalin, and later executed.
Stalin eventually turned on Yezhov. He appointed Yezhov Commissar of Water Transport in April 1938 (a similar thing had happened to Yezhov's predecessor shortly before he was fired). Stalin began ordering the executions of Yezhov's protégés in the NKVD. Politburo members also started to openly condemn the excesses of the NKVD. Yezhov eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and resigned as NKVD chief on November 23. He was replaced by Lavrentiy Beria.

Keystone Ore

Keystone Ore was an American standardbred horse, who was the son of Bye Bye Bird. He was trained and driven by Stanley Dancer, and was honored as Harness Horse of the Year in 1976. 
In 1976, Keystone Ore won the $200,000 Cane Pace held on August 21 at Yonkers Raceway, in front of a crowd of 24,458 fans, with his time of 1:57.2 in the mile distance setting the record for a 3-year-old pacer at that distance. Raven Hanover, driven by George Sholty ¾ of a length behind the lead, with Windshield Wiper 1¼ lengths behind second. 
Keystone Ore won the Little Brown Jug, the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers, with a time of 1:57.4 in a raceoff against Armbro Ranger, who had won the first division of the race at the half-mile track at the Delaware County Fairgrounds in front of a crowd of 39,709, the second-largest attendance at the event. Keystone Ore had won the second division in a time of 1:57 for the mile, and the combined time of 3:54.4 broke a record for age, sex and gait on a half-mile track that had been set by Bret Hanover in 1965.
Heavily favored to win the Messenger Stakes and sweep the Triple Crown, Keystone Ore fell to Windshield Wiper, who finished three-quarters of a length ahead of Keystone Ore. Both Keystone Ore and Windshield Wiper had started in the second tier of the 11-horse race and were hemmed in on the rail. On the backstretch for the second time, both horses found room to the outside around the stretch turn with Windshield Wiper pulling away in the last 50 yards. Keystone Ore had beaten Windshield Wiper in 13 of their races, but lost when the two competed against each other at Freehold Raceway in a race held two weeks before the Messenger Stakes. Keystone Ore finished the season with earnings of $469,302, and a win in the Messenger would not only have earned the Triple Crown but would have put the horse just short of the single-season harness horse earnings record of $558,009 set by Albatross in 1971.

<doc id="21618389" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21618389" title="Trademark troll">
Trademark troll

Trademark troll is a pejorative term for any entity that attempts to register a trademark without intending to use it and who then threatens to sue others who use that mark.
As a traditional troll is said to collect a toll from those trying to cross a bridge, a trademark troll "magically appears when an unsuspecting producer adopts the same or similar mark and poses upon them two choices: pay to get a license to use my mark or litigate".
The existence of trademark trolls exemplifies a common misunderstanding about trademark rights: the mere registration of a mark does not give the trademark owner a monopoly over that mark but must be used in commerce. As a consequence, while Leo Stoller, who has been labelled a "prototypical trademark troll" by intellectual property attorney Anna B. Folgers, had brought 47 trademark infringement suits as of 2007, no court had found any infringement and the Northern District of Illinois had enjoined him from filing new actions without the court’s permission. In a similar manner, the business practices of Tim Langdell of Edge Games were referred to as trolling by the US District Court after it was found that there was no evidence of commercial use of the asserted marks but that there was instead evidence that Langdell had fraudulently obtained and/or maintained many of his registrations.
Another more targeted example in 2008 involved Never Give Up Limited claiming that they owned the brands of two fruit juice chains, Juiceling in Glasgow and Juiced Up in Edinburgh. According to undercover reporting by the BBC, Never Give Up's representative, John Blanchard, sought tens of thousands of pounds to buy the trademarks back.

WGEN-FM

WGEN-FM is a Christian contemporary radio station in Monee, Illinois, broadcasting on 88.9 MHz FM. It is owned by Life On The Way Communications.
History.
From its launch in 1992 until 2007, the station was an affiliate of Moody Radio, under the ownership of The Moody Bible Institute of Chicago, and held call letters WGNR, WMBY and WJCG during this period.
In January 2007, WJCG was acquired by Life On The Way Communications and became a part of the KTLW Radio Network. Three months later, WJCG's call letters were changed to WOTW, and the network was renamed "The Worship On The Way Radio Network".
In 2013, Life On The Way Communications relocated two of its translators in the Los Angeles, California area, one was on 91.1 FM and the other was on 88.9 FM. WOTW was then broken off from the simulcast of KTLW along with the two translators, as well as another translator on 91.1 FM in Arcadia, California. WOTW's callsign was changed to WGEN and the new station "My Gen Radio 88.9 & 91.1 FM" was formed, which targets a younger listening audience than sister network "Worship On The Way Radio Network".
Despite WGEN being located in a southern suburb of Chicago, Illinois, the station is primarily used to feed the 3 translators in Southern California, which is where the station's primary target listening audience is located.

Richard Ong

Richard Ong (born 1965) is a Malaysian investment banker and businessman. He is the founder and former chief executive officer of the Hopu Fund, a China-based private equity fund. Hopu is now the largest private equity fund in China. Ong is now the Chairman and CEO of RRJ Capital, a US$2.3bn private equity fund focusing on China and Asia.
Career.
Early career.
Ong started his finance career at Chase Manhattan Bank, where he worked for three years as a mergers banker; he also spent a year at Prudential Bache International.
Goldman Sachs.
Ong joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a partner of the firm seven years later. He was later named to the position of co-president of Goldman's Singapore office.
In 2006, Ong was promoted to the position of co-head of Asia investment banking, replacing Bill Wicker, who moved to New York. GS moved Ong from Singapore to Beijing with the intention that he would also become CEO of their Beijing joint venture Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, Co. However, Ong's weak knowledge of written Chinese led him to fail a language ability examination required to take up his new position. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had required since 2004 that CEOs, deputy CEOs, and heads of supervisory boards at locally incorporated securities firms all pass the examination; however many CEOs and deputy CEOs of other securities companies were not able to pass the CSRC examination as well, but were given waivers. Goldman elevated the joint venture's deputy CEO Zha Xiangyang to the CEO post in Ong's place.
One industry observer criticised the decision by CSRC to deny Ong his new position as "short sighted and xenophobic", also noting that it served as a wake-up call to overseas Chinese that shared ethnicity was not a guarantee of success in the mainland China market. A "China Economic Review" editorial speculated that the language proficiency issue was merely a pretext, and that the true reason that CSRC denied Goldman permission to name Ong to his new position was due to his family ties to Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and his own role in the money-losing sale of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Shin Corporation to Temasek.
Hopu Fund.
In January 2008, Ong resigned from his position at GS, ending a fifteen-year tenure there; his departure was seen as a major blow to the firm. He stated that he planned to return to Malaysia to spend time with his family and work in his family business. It soon emerged that he would be joining fellow former GS executive Fang Fenglei at the Hopu Fund, a new China private equity fund established by Fang. Goldman planned to invest roughly US$300 million of their own money in the new fund, while Temasek would provide another US$1 billion. The total size of the fund was planned at US$2 billion; interest from potential investors far exceeded that amount, according to unnamed sources.
Personal.
Ong is Malaysian Chinese and was born in Malaysia. He received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1986 and then an MBA from the University of Chicago in 1989. He has three children. His brother Charles Ong is the chief strategist of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings.

<doc id="21618475" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21618475" title="Kōmyō-ji (Kamakura)">
Kōmyō-ji (Kamakura)

Kōmyō-ji has always enjoyed the patronage of Japan's powerful and is the only Buddhist temple in Kamakura to have had the privilege of being a daimyo's funeral temple. It was chosen for that role by the Naitō clan, feudal lords from today's Miyazaki Prefecture whose tombs are part of the temple's compound.
The temple, besides the usual Buddhist cemetery, maintains a special crypt for the ashes of house pets and other animals, and twice a year holds in the Main Hall ceremonies in their memory. The crypt was created and is maintained by a group of veterinarian volunteers.
The temple holds occasional music concerts in its main hall, concerts that are announced in its Web site. For 3500 yen, visitors who make a reservation can try at Kōmyō-ji the vegetarian food the resident priests themselves eat. Entrance is free, with the exception of the "sanmon", which can be visited only telephoning the temple, explaining the motives for the planned visit, making a reservation and paying a small fee.
History.
Kōmyō-ji's precise origins are unclear. According to the temple itself, it was founded by Kamakura's fourth regent and "de facto" ruler of Japan Hōjō Tsunetoki. According to this version of events, it was originally built in 1240 in the Sasukegayatsu Valley near Jufuku-ji for famous Buddhist priest Nenna :ja:Ryōchū (also known by his posthumous name Kishu Zenji). It was then called Renge-ji, or "Temple of Lotuses", a name which is still part of its official full name. Tradition says Tsunetoki received in a dream the divine order to rename the temple Kōmyō-ji, or "Temple of the Shining Light", and soon thereafter decided to move it to its present location near the sea. The usual date given by the temple itself for the transfer and the name change is 1243, however it isn't clearly supported by any historical record. It would be therefore more precise to say that the date of foundation is unclear.
According to a variant of the theory, Renge-ji was originally opened for Ryōchū by Hōjō Tomonao (a.k.a. :ja:Osaragi Tomonao) with the name .
Kōmyō-ji was later sponsored by Hōjō Tokiyori and other Kamakura regents, acquiring a and becoming a center of Amidist devotion in the Kantō region. Ryōchū presided over the temple for more than forty years, dying there in 1287.
During the following years, the temple enjoyed the continuous religious and financial support of emperors, shoguns and daimyos, among them Ashikaga Takauji and several other Muromachi period shoguns, "taikō" Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and their generosity is well attested by the temple's archives. Three different emperors, Go-Hanazono, Go-Tsuchimikado and Go-Uda, donated it their own calligraphy.
During the Muromachi period it was restored by Yūshō Shōnin and in 1495 Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado made it his praying temple. When Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1547 created the group of temples, he dedicated it to the training of priests and scholarship, and put Kōmyō-ji at its top.
The buildings presently part of its compound belong to different eras, the "sōmon" (first gate) being the oldest (it was built in the first half of the 17th century) and the "Kaisandō" (Founder's Hall) the newest (having been built in 1924).
Features.
The temple's gates are a few hundred meters from the ruins of Wakaejima, an artificial island built in 1232 which, in spite of its state of disrepair, has been declared a national Historic Site because it's the sole surviving example of artificial harbor of the Kamakura Period. Wakaejima used to be the point of entry of most of the cargo needed to support the city and it's likely that at least part of Kōmyō-ji's own timber came from there.
The Zen style main gate (the was first erected in 1495, then restored in 1624-28, and it is believed that part of the old timber was reused for the reconstruction.
The huge Hon-dō (Main Hall) is an Important Cultural Property. To its left lie the "Kaisandō" and the "Shoin" drawing room. Between them is the temple's lotus pond, designed in the early 17th century.
The "sanmon".
The temple's huge "sanmon" (the second gate, see photo) is an 1847 reconstruction of an older original. The 16 meter wide structure has two stories, the first in traditional Japanese style, the second in Zen (Chinese) style. The characters on the gable under the "Sanmon" were written by Emperor Go-Hanazono himself in 1436 and sent to the temple as a present.
The "Sanmon"'s second floor contains several statues, the most important of which are the so-called , or Shakyamuni Trinity, three statues which represent Shaka, Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu. (The statue of Fugen Bosatsu has however been lost). The so-called Shi Tennō, or Four Heavenly Kings (Deva Kings) are statues of four protector gods. These are accompanied by the . All the statues were built during the late Edo period.
The "Sanmon" is usually closed to the public, but it's occasionally opened for ceremonies or festivities, and can be visited at any time telephoning the temple, explaining the motives for the visit and paying a small fee.
The rock garden.
The remaining five stones represent Shakyamuni and four priests who contributed to the diffusion of Buddhism: Zendō, Hōnen, Benchō, and the temple's own Ryōchū. Rock gardens are often called Zen gardens because they normally are a feature of Zen temples of the Rinzai sect like Kamakura's own Kenchō-ji, Engaku-ji and Zuisen-ji, which all have one. It is therefore rare to find one in a Jōdo temple. The rock garden is a popular gathering spot among the numerous stray cats that live on the premises.
The pet cemetery.
Immediately after the "sanmon", next to the cemetery lies the , an animal mortuary maintained by the Shōnan Jūishikai Dōbutsu Reidō Hōsankai, a group of volunteers affiliated with a local association of veterinarians, the Shōnan Jūishikai.
The veterinarians of the association had originally created the crypt at Kōmyō-ji to inter the ashes of cats, dogs, birds and other animals who had died in their care but, after many other pet owners expressed the wish to bury their animals there too, the association decided to grant the wish to all who apply after the payment of a small fee. The ashes are laid to rest on the 10th day of every month after the chanting of sūtras, and are often accompanied by a (a wooden stupa), carrying the pet's name (see photo).
Twice a year, in spring and autumn, a memorial service is held in the temple's main hall for the souls of the dead animals.
Kōmyō-ji's Ten Nights of Prayer.
Every year, from 12 to 25 October, Kōmyō-ji holds the , a celebration which started in 1495 and consists of three days and three nights of uninterrupted sūtra chanting in the main hall.
The festival was born by order of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, who invited the temple's ninth abbot Yushu Shōnin to Kyoto, where he was given permission to hold a rite consisting of ten days and ten nights of continuous prayer. Nowadays the rites last only three days, but are performed in Jōdo temples all over the country.
Because the event attracts so many people, during those days the temple's compound is full of stands, selling mostly potted plants, but also food and drinks.

<doc id="21618487" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21618487" title="Roth-Steyr M1907">
Roth-Steyr M1907

The Roth-Steyr M1907, or, more accurately Roth-Krnka M.7 was a semi-automatic pistol issued to the Austro-Hungarian "Kaiserliche und Koenigliche Armee" cavalry during World War I. It was the first adoption of semi-automatic service pistol by the land army of a major power.
Mechanism.
The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from an unusual style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, except for a sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The interior of the bolt has cam grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.
The Roth-Steyr is a locked-breech pistol, which allows the barrel and bolt to recoil together within a hollow receiver. It is chambered for a cartridge specific to this model. The Roth-Steyr does not have a detachable magazine, but features a fixed magazine loaded from the top with stripper clips. The sights are fixed, the grips are wooden and terminate in a lanyard ring. Rifling is four grooves with right-hand twist.
Production and distribution.
The pistol was developed by the Czech designer Karel Krnka, working for an ammunition company of Georg Roth, from an earlier design of Roth-Theodorovic pistol. After development and tests of several prototypes, the final version of the Roth-Krnka won a contest for an Army pistol in 1906, and was adapted as a standard gun of Austro-Hungarian Army as: Repetierpistole M.7. (self-loading pistol M1907). Since Roth had no weapon production capabilities, the government bought all the rights and ordered production in the "Österreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft" (OEWG) in Steyr and FEG in Budapest. From 1908 to 1914, approximately 99,000 weapons were manufactured (the Army received 59,334 from Steyr and 38,213 from FEG, plus several hundred were sold on the civilian market). Despite common name for the pistol Roth-Steyr, Steyr works did not participate in its design, apart from minor improvements. Following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Roth-Steyr was fielded by Yugoslavia, with limited use during World War II by the Austrians and Hungarians. Italy received a number of pistols as World War I reparations from Austria-Hungary, and these pistols were used by Italian troops during World War II. They were used also in Czechoslovakia and Poland.

<doc id="21618503" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21618503" title="Bodeo Model 1889">
Bodeo Model 1889

The Bodeo Model 1889 revolver () was named after the head Italian firearm commission Carlo Bodeo. It was produced by a wide variety of manufacturers between 1889 and 1931 in both Spain and Italy. It was employed by the Royal Italian Army in World War I, the Interwar Italian colonial wars, and World War II. The Bodeo comes in two distinct varieties with only superficial weapons differences.
History.
Made by a large variety of Italian gunmakers, the Bodeo became the service revolver of the Italian Army in 1891. The revolver was named after the head of the Italian commission that recommended its adoption Carl Bodeo. It remained the principle handgun of the Italian Army until it was increasingly supplanted by the Glisenti Model 1910. The revolver was never declared obsolete and remained as a reserve weapon until the end of World War II. Among the Italian manufacturers identified with the production of the Bodeo include, Societa Siderurgica Glisenti,Castelli of Brescia, Metallurgica Bresciana, and Vincenzo Bernardelli of Gardone Val Trompia. During World War I, Spanish manufacturers, Errasti and Arrostegui of Eibar produced the Bodeo for the Italian government. The Italians nicknamed this revolver "coscia d’agnello" ("leg of lamb"). During World War II the Wehrmacht designated the Bodeo "Revolver 680(i)" when utilized as an alternative firearm.
Design Details.
Alternates.
The Bodeo Model 1889 is a solid framed, six shot revolver. The revolver was designed in two distinct versions. A round-barreled version designed with a trigger guard and octagonal-barreled version with a folding trigger. The octagonal-barreled revolver was produced for rank and file Italian soldiers while the round-barreled was produced for non-commissioned officers and field officers. The folding trigger version was produced in greater number.
Mechanics.
The Bodeo was considered simple and robust. Because the revolver was made by a wide variety of manufacturers, the quality of the weapon varied greatly with frames being made from a wide variety of materials ranging from brass to brazed copper plates. The gate was connected to the hammer and the barrel was screwed into the frame. Ejection was achieved by the rod normally housed in the hollow axis pin. The hammer block was designed to prevent firing unless the trigger was pulled fully back.

Kill Cruise

Kill Cruise (German title "Der Skipper") is a 1990 film directed by Peter Keglevic and starring Jürgen Prochnow, Patsy Kensit and Elizabeth Hurley.
Plot summary.
The story begins at sea when the unnamed Skipper (Prochnow) of the sailboat Bella Donna reports a man overboard. The victim, Paul Pelikan, drowns before he can be rescued. People in the Bella Donna's home port of Gibraltar suspect that the Skipper deliberately pushed Paul overboard because he'd had an affair with the Skipper's wife Mona (Grażyna Szapołowska). Though nothing is proven, Mona believes the Skipper did in fact throw Paul overboard and leaves him. Heartbroken, the Skipper spends most of his time at the local bars getting drunk and swearing he will sail again, though the townspeople don't take his claim seriously. 
Meanwhile, two English girls Su (Kensit) and Lou (Hurley) are barely making a living singing at local clubs. Though fast friends, there seems to be tension between the two. They put on a show at the California Bar that night, singing an English language version of Porque te vas (translated as "You're Leaving Me"). The Skipper is present for the performance and falls hard for the two, especially after Lou performs an impromptu striptease at the end. After spending the night with the two girls, the Skipper agrees to their request to sail them to Barbados. 
Though the voyage will take four weeks, all seems to be well at the start. The Skipper does express some concern in his ship's log about how close the two girls are, then injects himself with a syringe. As time passes, Su flirts with the Skipper, but becomes upset when her advances are ignored, revealing a somewhat unbalanced personality. As tensions further mount, Su snoops through the Skipper's quarters and finds his serum bottles, syringes and his log book. She tells Lou that she thinks the Skipper is a murderer and a drug addict. When he discovers the missing serum, which turns out to be insulin, he throws Su overboard with a line, in an attempt to get her to reveal where she hid it. He pulls her back in and gives her an ultimatum, "I'll give you one hour". He soon becomes very ill and incapacitated. A desperate Lou eventually finds the insulin and injects the Skipper, saving his life. A grateful Skipper later confesses his love for Lou. Lou responds "What about Su?" The Skipper replies "What "about" Su?" Su then walks in on them having sex. Su is heartbroken and starts crying. Lou, feeling guilty, tries to comfort Su.
Things seem to have smoothed over at the end, when the girls reprise their act, singing "You're Leaving Me" again. Without warning, Lou shoots the Skipper with a spear gun, killing him almost instantly. In terror, Su flees below deck. Lou takes a moment to draw a heart and arrow in the Skipper's pooling blood before going to the galley to make a cup of tea. She seems oddly calm while Su is quaking in terror over what's happened. Lou tries to calm Su down but ends up smothering her with a pillow. 
An end title states that, three weeks later, the Bella Donna had drifted to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, with no one aboard.

1872 Swiss revolver

The Model 1872 revolver ("Ordonnanzrevolver 1872" or "revolver d'ordonnance modèle 1872") was the service sidearm of the Swiss Army. It was later refined to the Model 1872/78 revolver. Approximately 600 were manufactured in Belgium by Pirlot Frères.
Model 1872.
The Model 1872 and 1872/78 revolvers operated in both single action and double action, with empty cartridges individually ejected by an ejector rod. They were very similar in design to the French military MAS 1873 Chamelot-Delvigne revolver. The 1872 revolver used 10.4mm (.41 Swiss) rimfire cartridges.
The Model 1872/78.
In 1878 the Swiss adopted the 10.4mm centerfire for their new Model 1878 revolver and most of their 1872 revolvers were adapted to this cartridge and named the 1872/78 model. 
The Model 1878.
The Model 1878 was chambered specifically for a centerfire cartridge. Its mechanism is the Warnant system with a rebounding hammer modified by Lieutenant-Colonel Rudolf Schmidt. In contrast with the Model 1872, it has no loading gate but is designed to index the chambers of the cylinder with an ejector rod. They were manufactured in Switzerland by Waffenfabrik Bern. After 1882, they were replaced by the Schmidt M1882 service revolver.

Open security

Open security is the use of open source philosophies and methodologies to approach computer security and other information security challenges. Traditional application security is based on the premise that any application or service (whether it is malware or desirable) relies on security through obscurity.
Open source approaches have created technology such as Linux (and to some extent, the Android operating system). Additionally, open source approaches applied to documents have inspired wikis and their largest example, Wikipedia. Open security suggests that security breaches and vulnerabilities can be better prevented or ameliorated when users facing these problems collaborate using open source philosophies.
This approach requires that users be legally allowed to collaborate, so relevant software would need to be released under a license that is widely accepted to be open source; examples include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license, the Apache 2.0 license, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU General Public License (GPL). Relevant documents would need to be under a generally accepted "open content" license; these include Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) and Attribution Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) licenses, but not Creative Commons "non-commercial" licenses or "no-derivative" licenses.
On the developer side, legitimate software and service providers can have independent verification and testing of their source code. On the information technology side, companies can aggregate common threats, patterns, and security solutions to a variety of security issues.

Modèle 1892 revolver

The Model 1892 Revolver (also known as the Lebel Revolver or St. Etienne 8mm) was a French service revolver produced by Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Étienne as a replacement for the MAS 1873 revolver. It was the standard issue sidearm for officers in the French military during the First World War. 
The Modèle 1892 Revolver is a solid frame revolver with the cylinder on a separate frame swinging right for manual reloading. The Modèle 1892 was first fielded in 1893 and was prominent among French Military Officers during First World War and later French Police until the mid-1960s
A mechanically tight and very well finished handgun , the Modèle 1892 fires 8-milimetre rounds with a striking power equivalent to that of a .32 ACP round. It also features a smaller calibre than many other military revolvers of that time period, including the Webley Revolver or its predecessor the MAS 1873 revolver.
History.
Though it was originally designed to serve as a commissioned officer's personal sidearm, over 350,000 Modèle 1892 revolvers had been manufactured between 1892 and 1924 . It was issued in the French Army, Navy, and National Gendarmerie, amongst others. It is commonly but mistakenly called "Lebel Revolver" after the name of colonel Nicolas Lebel, although there is no evidence whatsoever that colonel Lebel had any involvement in the creation of the gun or its ammunition. Non-commissioned officers continued to carry the older Mle 1873 service revolver, but were also frequently issued .32 ACP automatic pistols (the Ruby pistol) during World War I. The Mle 1892 was later officially replaced by semi-automatic pistols in 1935 but many saw service during World War II and brought to the United States as souvenirs.
Mechanics.
Originally chambered for an 8mm black-powder cartridge closely resembling the .32-20 WCF round, later models issued during World War I and thereafter fired the same 8mm cartridge loaded with smokeless powder. The Mle 1892 revolver was a double-action solid-frame design, with chambers being accessed by swinging out the cylinder to the right. The fired cases could then be pushed out of the cylinder at the same time. After reloading, the cylinder was swung back into the frame and locked into place with the case-hardened loading gate located on the right side of the frame. In addition, the left sideplate of the frame could be swung back on a hinge to give access to the gun's internal parts for oiling or cleaning. These parts were individually numbered to indicate the order in which they can be disassembled. The year of manufacture of each revolver was engraved on the right side of the barrel, for instance "" S 1895" ". The inscription " "Mle 1892" " is hand engraved on top of the barrel. It was carried in a large closed leather holster, which held an additional 12 rounds of ammunition hidden below the flap.
Legacy.
The Mle 1892 was a mechanically tight, accurate and very well finished revolver. It was fired single action by cocking the hammer first or else double action by a full trigger pull. Its downside was the relative weakness, for a military handgun, of its 8x27mm ammunition . In terms of striking power, it just barely reached the level of the .32 ACP.

MAS 1873 revolver

The service revolver model 1873 Chamelot-Delvigne was the first double action revolver used by the French Army. It was produced by Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Étienne from 1873 to 1887 in about 337,000 copies. Although soon replaced by the Modele 1892 revolver, it was nevertheless widely used during the First World War, and issued to reserve units in 1940. The Resistance made widespread use of it during the Occupation.
The model 1874, of which 35,000 were made, was an officer version. It differs from model 1873 by a lighter structure and a darker finish. Many civilians copies were made in France and Belgium.
Both the 1873 and the 1874 use a 11mm cartridge which proved to have an insufficient velocity. The weapons themselves were very reliable and resistant.
A Navy version was also produced. A more powerful cartridge was produced for this version, but production ceased and they turned to the regular ammunition when the stocks were depleted.
Overview.
The Franco-Prussian War in 1870 clearly demonstrated the need for up-to-date equipment in war time. A great military tradition and esprit de corps can be defeated by superior training, small arms, and in the case of that war, artillery. After the war, both Germany and France continued to improve their military technology. However, neither side was convinced of the importance of pistols for field officers. The sword continued to be the symbol of authority for an officer on the battlefield all the way into World War I. European general staffs at that time were extremely conservative and pistols were sometimes grudgingly adopted as personal defense weapons with no practical offensive use. Even as pistols became more of a symbol of the officer, most preferred to privately purchase a smaller and more comfortable handgun instead of using a large standard issue revolver.
The Chamelot-Delvigne 11mm Modele 1873 was adopted by the French army as a service revolver for non-commissioned officers. The Modele 1874 Revolver d'Officier was the version issued to officers. The differences between the two models included the following: the 1873 was finished in the white, whereas the 1874 had a fluted cylinder and a blued finish. The 1873 and 1874 were the first center-fire cartridge revolvers adopted by the French army. They had solid-frame, side-ejection, double-action mechanisms. The pistols were manufactured by the St. Etienne armoury, which still continues to manufacture fine sporting arms. The design of these pistols became so popular that versions were adopted by the Belgian, Dutch, Italian, and Swiss armies.
The caliber of these French pistols was 11x17.8mmR. The French round was actually 0.47 mm larger than its German counterpart. The German round could be loaded and used in the French pistol, but French rounds would not chamber in the German pistol. The cartridge had a pointed lead bullet weighing 11 grams. The case length was 17.8 mm, which was rather on the short side. Reloading this cartridge could take some patience due to the shortness of the case. Military specifications called for black powder loads, replaced by a mild smokeless powder in the early twentieth century. Standard muzzle velocity was around 550 feet per second.
The cylinder had a side-loading gate which pulled straight to the rear. The sight picture was a ball and v type and is easy to align. It could be difficult to stay on target double-action due to the stiffness of the action. There was certainly no danger of accidentally pulling the trigger double-action. Cleaning and disassembly were easy as the cylinder pin doubled as a screwdriver and all-purpose tool. Internal parts were finely machined and finished. The trigger, hammer, and several of the internal springs were straw-finished, a type of case-hardening hot oil finish.
The French pistols began their service with the French army in the late 19th Century and saw service all over the globe in French colonies. Many saw service in World War I when European armies finally realized how important pistols were in the trenches. The Chamelot-Delvigne finally ended its venerable service as a police sidearm in World War II.
Usage.
Model 1873 was issued to the French Army, the French Navy, the National Gendarmerie, and the French National Police until 1962. It was also in use with Banque de France, the French Forces of the Interior, and the National Forests Office. The MAS 1873 served from the early days of the French Third Republic, and the conquest of its empire, up to the Great War and the Second World War.

Rast-Gasser M1898

The Rast & Gasser Model 1898 was a service revolver used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I and various armies in World War II
Operation.
The Rast-Gassers featured some new elements of revolver design, as well as older elements already obsolete at the time of its manufacture. A solid-frame double-action revolver, it had a loading-gate through which individual cartridges are loaded, and extracted individually by an extractor rod. The firing pin was located on a transfer piece on the frame of the revolver rather than the hammer, an advancement at the time. Its ammunition is similar to but not interchangeable with that of the 8 mm French Ord. 
The cylinder could be removed by pulling down on the trigger guard and withdrawing the axis pin/ejector rod.
Loading.
To load the M1898, the hammer is rotated back slightly until it is in the half-cock position. This will safeguard against the hammer accidentally striking a cartridge while the user is loading the weapon. The loading-gate is then rotated back, exposing the rear of the cylinder. Doing this will disengage the hammer from the trigger, but the cylinder will still rotate if the trigger is squeezed. This feature makes loading much easier and faster. Cartridges are then inserted into the cylinder and the trigger squeezed to rotate the cylinder for the next empty slot. After all the slots have been loaded, close the loading-gate by pushing it forward. The hammer is then rotated all the way back to the full-cocked position ready for firing.
To unload the M1898, the hammer is rotated back slightly until it is in the half-cock position. The loading-gate is opened and the ejector rod is pulled back to eject either spent casings or unused cartridges.
To remove the cylinder, the trigger guard is pulled down and the ejector rod/cylinder axis can then be withdrawn and the cylinder removed.
History.
180,000 copies were produced by the firm Leopold Gasser Waffenfabrik in Vienna from 1898 to 1912. The M1898 was planned to be replaced in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry by the Roth-Steyr M1907, and in the infantry by the Steyr M1912, prior to the outbreak of the First World War. However production of newer pistols was not sufficient and the weapon continued in service, especially issued to NCOs and officers. In some armies it was used up through Second World War, including Italy and Yugoslavia. The quality manufacture and the strength of the solid-frame design make it a reliable and consistent military weapon.
The M1898 was copied in Belgium by Manufacture d'Armes Liégeoise in 7.62mm Nagant caliber.

Erma EMP

The German sub-machine gun EMP ("Erma Maschinenpistole") also known as MPE (Maschinenpistole Erma) was produced by Erma factory was based on designs acquired from Heinrich Vollmer. The gun was produced from 1931 to 1938 in roughly 10,000 exemplars (in three main variants) and exported to Spain, Mexico, China and Yugoslavia, but also used domestically by the SS. It was produced under license in Spain by the arsenal of A Coruña under the designation M41/44.
History.
In the early 1920s, Vollmer started to develop his own sub-machineguns. His early models, named VPG, VPGa, VPF and VMP1925 were fairly similar to the MP18. The VMP1925 had a wooden handgrip and was fed by a small 25-round drum magazine, connected directly to the gun. The VMP1925 was secretly tested by the Reichswehr, along with competing designs from Schmeisser and Rheinmetall. (The Reichswehr was prohibited by the Versailles Treaty from having sub-machine guns in service, although the German police was allowed to carry a small number.) Secret funding was given to Vollmer to continue development, and this resulted in the VMP1926, which mostly differed from its predecessor by the removal of the cooling jacket. A subsequent development was the VMP1928, which introduced a 32-round box magazine sticking from the left side. The final development of this series was the VMP1930. (It can also be seen at the WTS.) This model introduced a substantive innovation—a telescoping main spring assembly, which made the gun more reliable and easier to assemble and disassemble in the field. Vollemer applied for a patent for his innovation in 1930 and it was granted in 1933 as DRP# 580620. His company, Vollmer Werke, produced however only about 400 of these, and most were sold to Bulgaria. In late 1930, the Reichswehr stopped supporting Vollmer financially; consequently he sold the rights to all his designs to the company known as Erma Werke (which is an abbreviation for Erfurter Machinenfabrik, Berthold Geipel GmbH).
The sumbachine guns that Erma started to sell in 1932 under the names EMP (Erma Machinenpistole) or MPE (Machinenpistole Erma) was basically just the VMP1930 with the cooling jacket restored. Although there were several variants with varying barrel lengths and sights made to customers' specifications, roughly three main variants were produced: one with a 30 cm barrel, tangent rear sight and bayonet lug was apparently sold to Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. The second model, sometimes called the MP34, or the "standard model", had a 25 cm barrel and no provision for a bayonet; the rear sight on these varies—some had a tangent sight, others a simplified flip-up "L" sight. A third variant was basically similar in the metallic parts, but replaced the foregrip with a MP18-style stock with finger-grooves. Overall, at least 10,000 of these Vollmer-based designs were made by Erma. They were adopted by the SS in 1936, but also sold to South-American countries and to Spain, were it was subsequently manufactured locally under the designation M41/44.
In the Spring of 1939, a large number of defeated Spanish Republicans fled to France, where they were disarmed. Some 3,250 EMPs formerly in the possession of these fighters ended up in a French warehouse at Clermont-Ferrand. The EMPs were usually referred to as the "Erma–Vollmer" in French documents. The French tested the weapons and decided to adopt them for their own service. A provisional manual was printed in French as "Provisoire sur le pistolet-mitrailleur Erma – Vollmer de 9mm", issued on December 26, 1939 and updated in January 6, 1940. However, the French had obtained only some 1,540 suitable magazines for these guns, so only 700-800 EMPs were actually distributed to the French forces, mostly to the Mobile Gendarmerie. After the Nazi conquered France, some EMPs armed the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, which eventually became part of the SS Charlemagne division. This division was practically destroyed in February 1945 in Eastern Prussia, now part of Poland. Numerous EMPs have been found in the last-stand battlefields of the SS Charlemagne division; most of these guns lack any German military stamps or marks. The EMPs which arrived in German hands via the French route were given the (fremden Geräts) designation 740(f).
In Francoist Spain, the EMP was produced chambered in the 9mm Largo cartridge. It was informally known as "subfusil Coruña".
Design.
Its arming lever is on the right. The magazine housing, which is on the left, is slightly canted forwards to assist in feeding ammunition. The weapon could be fired either in semi-automatic or fully automatic modes.
Influence.
The final development at Erma is known as the EMP 36. This can be considered an intermediate model between the EMP and the MP38. Although many details of the mechanism were changed from the EMP, it retained Vollmer's telescoping main operating spring basically unchanged. On the exterior, the most obvious differences are that the magazine housing was now almost vertical, although still canted slightly to the left and forward. The solid wood stock was replaced with a wood frame and a folding metal butt. It is not entirely clearly who designed the EMP 36, although Berthold Geipel himself is usually credited. Apparently, the features of the new design were the result of another secret contract with the German army. The EMP's telescopic cylinder return spring guide was retained for the Maschinenpistole 38.

Sugarloaf Mountain (Cleburne County, Arkansas)

Sugar Loaf Mountain, rising above the fertile valley formed by Little Red River (Arkansas) in the center of Cleburne County, Arkansas, is an erosional remnant. It stands as a monument to the eons of time when the river was patiently carving out the valley from the surrounding hills. Why the sandstone formation has held firm on top of the long familiar landmark is a question that geologists can explain. Because the huge rocks at the top of the formation lie in flat layers and were not folded by continental drift, they cap the mountain on which they lie. Through the centuries less resistant units of sandstone, silt stone and shale eroded away, leaving the atoka formation which the white man called Sugar Loaf.
Exactly where the mountain first got its name is a question nobody can answer today. The Indians called it Tonawanda or Ton-Wan-Dah. And from the top of Ton-Wan-Dah with its sparse growth of wind-stunted cedars and gnarled scrub oak they could see for miles in every direction. The Indian name, as tradition has it, was that of a family of renowned arrow makers. An abundance of flint chips and imperfect arrow heads remained on the mountaintop long after the white man arrived to attest to this storied past.
The earliest white settlers who pushed through the dense forest must have called it Sugar Loaf because of the resemblance in shape to the loaves of unrefined sugar in use at that time. The survey party that was surveying the Louisiana Purchase in 1819 took note of the feature “encountered Sugar Lofe (sic), a well-known landmark”. Presumably Indians and early day travelers on the nearby Little Red River had used it as a landmark. The name of the landmark became the name of the springs to the west and the community that developed there. The community name was later changed to Heber Springs.
Sugar Loaf Mountain is located on a section line, and consequently land transactions have always been conducted in two parcels. For several years, beginning in 1901, the Lucas brothers, Creighton and Richard, maintained a mining claim on the north side of Sugar Loaf Mountain, but apparently no ore or oil was discovered. In 1922 Dr. L.E. Robbins of Heber Springs bought the on the south of the mountain along with other land from Richard R. Lucas. In 1951 he acquired a clear title to the on the north side by patent from the U.S. government.
In the same year of the patent, Dr. Robbins and his wife Dotte dedicated the to the town of Heber Springs in a 99 year lease. The lease specified that the land was to be used as a public park and picnic ground, the town should have the right to build barbecue grills, tables and benches and no lumber should be cut except as prescribed by the Arkansas Forestry Commission and then only by the grantors or their heirs. So the central picnic spot of Cleburne County, long treated as public property, was given to the people to use and enjoy.
"Climbing Sugar Loaf' has been a very popular pastime for generations of residents of Heber Springs and surrounding areas. It was an easy day trip for young people before the advent of the automobile. The increase of tourism due to the Greers Ferry Dam and lake has spread the popularity of the Sugar Loaf adventure far beyond the local area. There have even been weddings performed on the top level.
The land parcel containing Sugar Loaf was obtained by Arkansas State University Beebe for the ASU-Heber Springs campus in 2005. The first phase of construction of the campus was completed in 2007.

SM UB-2

SM "UB-2" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. She sank eleven ships during her career and was broken up in Germany in 1920.
"UB-2" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November. "UB-2" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-2" in February 1915.
When "UB-2" sailed to join the Flanders Flotilla in May 1915, she became the only member of her class to not be shipped by rail to Antwerp to join the unit. While in the flotilla, "UB-2" sank eleven British ships of under the command of Kptlt. Werner Fürbringer. The U-boat was assigned to the Baltic Flotilla in March 1916 relegated to a training role from December that same year. At the end of the war, "UB-2" was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes. "UB-2" was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.
"UB-2" was laid down by Germaniawerft on 1 November, one the first two boats of the class started. She was launched at Kiel on 13 February 1915. As built, "UB-2" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged.
At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-2" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-2" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-2"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
Service career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-2" on 20 February under the command of Kapitänleutnant Werner Fürbringer, a 26-year-old native of Braunschweig, and underwent trials in German home waters.
"UB-2" sailed from Germany to Flanders to join the Flanders Flotilla () on 10 May 1915, and was the only UB I or UC I boat in the flotilla to not be shipped to Antwerp by rail. When "UB-2" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom (including the English Channel), were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
The UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla were initially limited to patrols in the Hoofden, the southern portion of the North Sea between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. On 9 and 10 June, while patrolling in this area southeast of Lowestoft, "UB-2" sank six British fishing smacks with a combined tonnage of just under , the largest being "Intrepid" of 59 tons. All six of the smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-2", and sunk with explosives.
After "UB-2"s sister boat pioneered a route around past British anti-submarine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June, boats of the flotilla began to patrol the western English Channel. "UB-2", , and soon followed with patrols in the Channel. Even though none of the boats sank any ships, by successfully completing their voyages they helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.
On 28 August, "UB-2" was patrolling in the Corton–Yarmouth area when she sank the British trawler "Miura". At 297 tons, "Miura" bested "Intrepid" as the largest vessel sunk by "UB-2" to-date. Early the following month, "UB-2" sank another two fishing smacks east-southeast of Lowestoft: the 57-ton "Constance", and the 44-ton "Emanuel". Three days later, "UB-2" sank 47-ton smack "Boy Ernie" about east of Cromer. As with the six vessels sunk in June, all three were stopped by "UB-2" and sunk with explosives.
Germany's submarine offensive was suspended on 18 September by the chief of the Admiralstab, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, In response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September. Holtzendorff's directive from ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. "UB-2" did not sink any vessels over the next four months.
The German Imperial Navy began its second submarine offensive in February 1916, declaring, among other provisions, that all enemy vessels in the war zone were to be destroyed without warning. On 26 February 1916, "UB-2" torpedoed and sank the cargo ship "Arbonne", in what was ultimately her last wartime success. The British steamer—at , the largest ship sunk by "UB-2"—went down with a loss of all fourteen of her crew.
In early March, Kapitänleutnant Fürbringer was succeeded by the former commander of , Kptlt. Karl Neumann, who had been in the same cadet class as Fürbringer. Fürbringer went on to command six other U-boats, and was responsible for sinking nearly 100,000 tons of shipping. In 1933 he published a memoir of his World War I U-boat service, "Alarm! Tauchen!!: U-boot in kampf und sturm", which included an overview of his career, including his time on "UB-2".
By early February, the Flanders Flotilla was beginning to receive the newer, larger Type UB II boats. "UB-2" was transferred into the Baltic Flotilla () about a week after Neumann took command. Boats of the Baltic flotilla were based at either Kiel, Danzig, or Libau, but where "UB-2" was stationed during this time is not reported in sources. While "UB-2" was in the Baltic Flotilla, Neumann was succeeded by Oberleutnant zur See (Oblt.z.S.) Thomas Bieber in April, who was in turn succeeded by Oblt.z.S. Harald von Keyserlingk in July. In early December, Keyserlingk was reassigned from "UB-2" to , and "UB-2" was transferred to training duties. According to authors R.H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, submarines assigned to training duties were "war-worn craft" unfit for service.
At the end of the war, the Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. "UB-2" was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany. "UB-2" was broken up by Stinnes on 3 February 1920.

Friends Stand United

Friends Stand United (FSU) is a national organization in the United States which is classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a street gang, a classification that FSU members deny. It is an anti-racist group which includes members of various ethnicities, but is predominantly white. Some members share the same Straight Edge lifestyle. The numbers "378" is the numerical symbol, which correspond to the letters FSU on the telephone keypad.
Elgin James founded FSU, which originally stood for "Fuck Shit Up", in the late 1980s in Boston, Massachusetts. He formed FSU to attack, beat and purge drug dealers and violent White supremacist, Neo-nazi and other various racist gangs from punk rock concerts.
FSU has established chapters in many major cities in the United States, Canada and North East England. The group has splintered several times since its initial incarnation, with different chapters holding different values. Universally, the group espouses violence as a valid means to accomplish their goals.
The founding core of FSU eventually splintered, with a large section moving on to motorcycle gangs like the Outlaws. The split was amicable, but James and other founding members decided to leave a more positive legacy and steer FSU away from the criminal world. They established the Foundation Fund, which set up scholarships at local universities (Berklee College of Music and Suffolk University Law School) in the names of FSU members who had died. The fund also holds yearly benefit concerts to raise money for charities that reflect "hardcore punk culture" (teen homelessness, anti-gun violence, suicide prevention and local orphanages). James currently denies involvement with FSU, however he was arrested on July 14, 2009 on extortion charges relating to his affiliation with the group five years prior.
James and FSU were mentioned on "National Geographic" TV, the History Channel's "Gangland" series, and were also covered in "Rolling Stone" magazine.

SM UB-3

SM "UB-3" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. She disappeared on her first patrol in May 1915, and was the first of her class to be lost.
"UB-3" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November. "UB-3" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-3" in March 1915.
"UB-3" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to the Austro-Hungarian port of Pola in April for reassembly. She officially joined the Pola Flotilla on 1 May and departed on her first patrol for temporary duty in Turkey on 23 May, and was never seen again. A postwar German study concluded that "UB-3" was likely the victim of an unexplained technical problem in the absence of any minefields or enemy action.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders.

Like all boats of the class, "UB-3" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-3" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-3"s complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
Service career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-3" on 14 March under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Siegfried Schmidt, a 27-year-old, first-time U-boat skipper, and underwent trials in German home waters.
As one of the UB I boats selected for Mediterranean duty, "UB-3" was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. "UB-3" was shipped to the port of Pola, site of ally Austria–Hungary's main naval base, on 15 April. After "UB-3"s parts arrived at Pola, it took about two weeks to assemble them. "UB-3" joined the Pola Flotilla () on 1 May.
By late May, "UB-3" had made her way down the Adriatic to the Austro–Hungarian port of Cattaro, the base from which most boats of the Pola Flotilla actually operated. For her first patrol, "UB-3" was loaded with ammunition for Turkish forces at İzmir, Turkey. Because of her limited range, "UB-3" was towed by an Austro-Hungarian Navy destroyer through the Straits of Otranto and cast off near the island of Kérkira. "UB-3"s planned route was south of the Ionian Islands, around the Peloponnese, through the Cyclades, north around Khios and Karaburun, and into the Gulf of İzmir. If all went well, "UB-3" would have arrived at İzmir on 28 or 29 May with about half her fuel left. The Germans received a garbled radio message from "UB-3" when she was about from İzmir, but were unable to completely understand it. No trace of "UB-3" has ever been found. "UB-3" was the first of the UB I boats to be lost during the war.
A postwar German study concluded that "UB-3"s loss was probably the result of some unexplained technical problem, because there were no minefields along "UB-3"s route and no record of any attacks against U-boats in the area. British records, and some sources based on them, give the particulars of "UB-3"s demise as being in the North Sea on 24 April 1916, which authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast assert was actually the fate of . They also point out that "UB-3" had gone missing nearly a year before "UB-3"s supposed sinking in the North Sea.

Samuel Feltman

Samuel Feltman (1899 - September 6, 1951) was, at the time of his death, Associate Chief of the Research and Materials Branch and Chief of the Ballistic Section of the U.S. Army Ordnance Research and Development Division. He was centrally involved in the development of the first electronic computer, ENIAC, of the hypersonic wind tunnel, and of "Atomic Annie", the first nuclear artillery shell. Feltman proposed the ballistic characteristics of such weapons as the 90mm and 120mm antiaircraft guns, the 8‑inch gun, the 240mm howitzer, and many other weapons. In 1944, he was awarded the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service, the highest award given by the Army to a civilian. In honor of his service and contributions,the Picatinny Arsenal dedicated a building in his name, "The Samuel Feltman Ammunition Laboratory," Picatinny Arsenal, Dover, New Jersey.
Feltman was born and raised in Long Branch, New Jersey. He joined the Army Ordnance Corps at the Sandy Hook Proving Ground in 1918, and served at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. He also spent time serving as "what amounted to the permanent under-chief of the ballistics work in Washington" (D.C.). Feltman was killed at the age of 52 in an auto accident, along with his wife and father-in-law.
Development of the Computer.
In 1946, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert developed the first electronic computer at the University of Pennsylvania. The funding for this computer, called ENIAC (Electrical Numerical Integrator And Calculator), was provided by the Ballistics and Ordnance Division of the U.S. Army. Lieutenant Herman Goldstine was the Army Officer most directly involved in the development of ENIAC. In his memoir/history of the development of the computer, Goldstine quotes his superior officer, Colonel Paul Gillon, who attributes a crucial role for Feltman in securing the funding for the ENIAC project. Feltman also served as a liaison between the Ballistics Division and Mauchly.
M65 Atomic Cannon.
Feltman also played an important role in the development of the M65 Atomic Cannon—nicknamed "Atomic Annie". Robert Schwartz began the design of a small tactical nuclear weapon at the Pentagon in 1949. Eventually, his project was transferred to the Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, N.J. Schwartz finished his design, and Feltman took on the important role of selling the project to the Pentagon.
In July 1954, the Technical Division Laboratory at the Picatinny Arsenal was renamed the Samuel Feltman Laboratories.

James Clay Rice

James Clay Rice (December 27, 1828 – May 10, 1864) was a lawyer from Massachusetts, who became a brigadier general of volunteers in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Early life.
Rice was born in Worthington, Massachusetts on December 27, 1828 to William Rice and Welthea (Cottrell) Rice. He was self-educated for most of his early life and eventually graduated from Yale University. He became a teacher in Natchez, Mississippi, and worked for a newspaper. During this time he began studying law and was admitted to the bar in New York City where he began his practice.
Civil War.
When the Civil War began Rice enlisted on 28 May 1861 in the 39th New York Infantry Regiment quickly becoming a captain of Company B and engaging at the First Battle of Bull Run. Rice was mustered out of the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment on 12 Sep 1861. The next day Rice became lieutenant colonel of the newly formed 44th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (also known as People's Ellsworth Regiment). He fought in the Peninsula Campaign and on July 4, 1862, became the colonel of the regiment. At the Second Battle of Bull Run, Colonel Rice took command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps when its commander, Daniel Butterfield took command of the consolidated 1st and 2nd Brigades and other ranking officers were wounded on the second day of battle. Rice returned to command of the 44th New York and led it at the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. At the Battle of Gettysburg Rice and his regiment were sent to the defense of Little Round Top. During the fighting, brigade commander Colonel Strong Vincent was mortally wounded and Rice once again assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps and led it for the remainder of the battle.

SS Antoine Saugrain

SS "Antoine Saugrain" was a Liberty ship of the United States that served in World War II. The ship was built at the Permanente Metals Corporation Yard No. 2 in Richmond, California under Maritime Commission Contract 1728. Laid down on 26 July 1943, the ship was launched on 15 August, and delivered on 28 August. She was torpedoed off Leyte on 5 December 1944, and sank the next day.
Sinking.
"Antoine Saugrain" fought off 12 kamikaze torpedo planes on 5 December 1944. Twelve gunners were wounded and merchant seamen took over the machine guns to fight off the attack. Two days later she was sunk by a torpedo plane while in tow in the Surigao Strait near Leyte Gulf. Some of the 450 survivors had to swim a long time before being rescued. 
The Coast Guard frigate's role of escorting convoys from the staging areas to the invasion sites likewise was crucial. In late November, the "Coronado" and "San Pedro" left Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, to steam the 1,250 miles to escort a convoy of ships bringing supplies and men to Leyte. The voyage proceeded without incident until 5 December when enemy planes attacked the convoy. One Japanese torpedo plane attacked the SS "Antoine Saugrain" from the port beam. The torpedo struck the freighter at the stern, exploded, and carried away its rudder. Fifteen minutes later another torpedo bomber approached the "Saugrain" and despite heavy gunfire, put a torpedo in the ship at the number two hold. This torpedo fatally wounded the vessel. The "Saugrain" had on board nearly 450 crew and Army troops. The "Coronado" and "San Pedro" steamed to the assistance of the freighter and saved all hands.
History.
The entire campaign for Leyte was that made on a convoy that was north-east of Mindanao and just one day out of Leyte on December 5. The Armed Guard voyage reports of 15 merchant ships tell the story of the action which resulted in the loss of one merchant ship, "Antoine Saugrain", and damage to two other ships, "Marcus Daly" and "John Evans". Japanese plane losses probably amounted to ten planes destroyed. The action opened with a bombing attack at about 0840, which did no damage. At 1220, "Antoine Saugrain" claimed hits on a torpedo plane that was strafing the convoy. A little later a torpedo hit the ship. At 1231 she claimed hits on another torpedo plane and almost immediately was hit by a second torpedo in her No. 2 hold. At 1247 the order was given to abandon ship. She finally went down while being towed to Leyte on December 6.
"John Evans" was more fortunate. She accounted for two planes during the afternoon of December 5, but the second plane crashed into her. A bomb exploded as the plane crashed. The "Evans" was able to make Leyte on December 6. Two Armed Guards and two members of her crew were wounded.
The "Marcus Daly", already a veteran of the worst attacks in the Leyte campaign in October, brought down two planes before a third hit her at about 1530 and made a hole “large enough to drive a train through”. The resulting fire was not brought under control until midnight. A torpedo missed the ship. Some 200 Army personnel were killed, missing, or wounded. One Armed Guard was killed and seven were wounded. Two members of the merchant crew were also killed. This proud ship made Leyte, and on December 10 assisted in shooting down a plane that managed to crash into her. The Armed Guard officer and seven other Armed Guards were wounded in this attack, but the "Daly" remained afloat.
Other merchant ships in the convoy gave a good account of themselves both on December 5 and in later attacks at Leyte. "Cape Gaspe" destroyed one plane on December 5 and received credit for an assist on December 10. Army personnel set up and manned additional machine guns. She reported 63 alerts between December 6 and 18. "Lew Wallace" was credited with the destruction of one plane and assistance in destroying two others on December 5. A bomb missed by only 40 yards. On December 10 she downed another plane and assisted in shooting down yet another. These planes were reported to have crashed into "William C. Ladd" and "Marcus Daly". "Conrad Kohrs" was credited with one assist on December 5. "H. H. Raymond" claimed a plane destroyed on December 5 and was credited with a plane on December 20. The latter plane dropped a bomb and then apparently tried to crash into the ship. It fell into the water 200 yards from the "Raymond". The "James H. Breasted" was credited with one plane downed, one assist, and one plane probably destroyed on December 5. At 1450 a bomb barely missed her 3”/50 gun tub. The plane that torpedoed "Saugrain" on December 5 also strafed "John Hart". The "Hart" was credited with the destruction of one plane on December 6. "Peter Lassen" was credited with the destruction of one plane on December 20. "William S. Colley" was credited with the destruction of the plane that crashed into a ship on December 5. "Richard Yates" received no credit for planes destroyed on December 5 but claimed hits on one plane. "James H. Lane" was credited with an assist on December 5 and destroyed another plane on December 25. Her Armed Guard officer reported that a torpedo passed the stern of the ship and missed by only 50 feet. The "Lane" was in the Leyte-Samar area from December 6 to April 8. Earlier, she had participated in the Morotai campaign and had assisted in destroying an enemy plane on October 31, 1944. "Morton M. McCarver" was in the December 5 attack but did not destroy any Japanese planes.
The only other merchant ship to be sunk in the Leyte operation was "William S. Ladd". Before she went down in Leyte Gulf she established the proud record of four planes destroyed. She accounted for one plane on the afternoon of December 5 and knocked down three on December 10. One of these planes crashed into her and set 500 drums of gasoline afire. A number of explosions in No. 4 and No. 5 holds followed at 1830 and the ship began to settle by the stern. At 1750 the after guns had been secured and the men manning them were ordered to abandon ship. At 1840 guns No. 1 to 5 were ordered secured and the Armed Guards were ordered to abandon ship. Not until 1930 did the last Navy personnel and ship’s officers abandon the doomed vessel. Eight Armed Guards were wounded when the plane crashed into "Ladd".
"On 5 December 1944, the was escorting a convoy from Hollandia, New Guinea, to Leyte when attacking Japanese aircraft sank SS "Antoine Saugrain", a cargo ship laden with valuable radar material, and severely damaged SS "Marcus Daly". She brought the rest of the convoy safely into Leyte the next day.

SM UB-6

SM "UB-6" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The submarine was interned after running aground in neutral Dutch waters, and was scuttled by her crew at Hellevoetsluis.
"UB-6" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November. "UB-6" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-6" was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched in March 1915 and commissioned as SM "UB-6" in April.
"UB-6" spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank , the first warship credited to the flotilla in May 1915. Through September 1916, the U-boat accounted for fourteen additional ships sunk, two ships damaged, and one ship seized as a prize. On 12 March 1917, "UB-6" ran aground near the Maas River in the Netherlands due to a navigational error by her commander; the submarine and crew were interned by the neutral country and taken to Hellevoetsluis. Six days later, "UB-6" was scuttled by her crew, which remained interned for the rest of the war. The wreck of "UB-6" was ceded to France in 1919 and broken up at Brest in July 1921.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes. "UB-6" was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.
"UB-6" was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 22 November. As built, "UB-6" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-6" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-6" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single Deck gun. "UB-6"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
After work on "UB-6" was complete at the Germaniwerft yard, "UB-6" was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of "UB-6" were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After "UB-6" was assembled and launched sometime in March, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.
Early career.
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-6" on 8 April under the command of Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Erich Haecker, a 29-year-old first-time U-boat commander. On 19 April, "UB-6" joined the other UB I boats then comprising the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When "UB-6" joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.
The UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla were initially limited to patrols in the Hoofden, the southern portion of the North Sea between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Although had made both the first sortie and sunk the first ship of the flotilla in April, "UB-6" sank the first warship credited to the flotilla. On 1 May, Haecker spotted two old Royal Navy destroyers, and , about southwest of the Galloper light vessel. Just before noon, Haecker launched a torpedo that hit "Recruit" and split the displacement ship in half, killing 34 men; 26 men were rescued. One month later, on 1 June, "UB-6" sank what would be her largest ship, the British cargo ship "Saidieh", of . "Saidieh" was en route to Hull from Alexandria with a load of onions and cottonseed when "UB-6" sank her at the mouth of the Thames; eight crewmen lost their lives in the attack.
In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, head of the Flanders Flotilla, used "UB-6" to test a theory that British defenses in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, "UB-6" departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. "UB-6" sailed past Dunkirk on the surface and made Boulogne in the early morning of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. "UB-6" immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I boats, , , and , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather and fog hampered the boats and none had any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these forays into the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.
On 12 July, while patrolling between off Lowestoft, "UB-6" attacked five British fishing vessels, sinking four of them. All four of the sunken ships were smacks—sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails—which were stopped, boarded by crewmen from "UB-6", and sunk with explosives. Two weeks later, "UB-6" torpedoed and sank the 406-ton "Firth" from the Aldborough Napes Buoy. "UB-6" sank the 57-ton "Leander", another smack, on 11 August.
Germany's submarine offensive was suspended on 18 September by the chief of the Admiralstab, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, in response to American demands after the sinking of the Cunard Line steamer in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September. Holtzendorff's directive ordered all U-boats out of the English Channel and the South-Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations. It would be five months before "UB-6" would sink another ship.
In mid-November, Oberleutnant zur See (Oblt.z.S.) Ernst Voigt succeeded Haecker as commander of "UB-6"; it was the first U-boat command for the 25-year-old Voigt. Under his command, "UB-6" sank her next vessel in January 1916. The 57-ton smack "Crystal" was boarded and sunk by explosives southeast of Southwold on the 27th.
Second submarine offensive.
By early 1916, the British blockade of Germany was beginning to have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.
"UB-6"s first attack in the new offensive came on 17 March, when the U-boat torpedoed the Swedish ship "Ask" near the North Hinder lightship. The 1,041-ton ship was en route to London from Westervik with a load of timber, but did not sink; there were no reports of casualties on the damaged ship. The attack on "Ask" was followed up two weeks later by the sinking of another Swedish ship. The 1,115-ton "Hollandia" was at anchor from the Galloper lightship when "UB-4" torpedoed her on the last day of March. "Hollandia" was in ballast and in the process of sailing from Rouen to Rotterdam when sent under without loss of life.
In March, "UB-6"s commander, Voigt, was assigned to the newly commissioned , and replaced on "UB-6" by Kapitänleutnant Karl Neumann, the former commander of two of the submarine's sister ships, and . In his U-boat career, Neumann sank over 100,000 tons of shipping, but none at the helm of "UB-6". In July, Neumann was succeeded by "Oberleutnant zur See" Karsten von Heydebreck, a 26-year-old, first-time U-boat captain, who was Voigt's classmate in April 1908 cadet class.
Near the end of April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there. As with the end of the first offensive in August 1915, "UB-6" would not sink any more ships for the next five months.
Grand Fleet ambush attempts.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across nests' of submarines and mine-fields". In support of the operation, "UB-6" and five other Flanders boats set out at midnight 30/31 May to form a line east of Lowestoft. This group was to intercept and attack the British light forces from Harwich, should they sortie north to join the battle. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of several of the U-boats stationed to the north to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". In "UB-6"s group, only "UB-10" sighted the Harwich forces, and they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
Later in August, the Germans set up another ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as had been the original intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart late in the day on 18 August and shell military targets the next morning. As in May, "UB-6" was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, "UB-6" was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, "UB-6" and her group played no part in the action.
On 10 September, "UB-6" was patrolling off the Maas lightship and torpedoed the 400-ton Norwegian steamer "Lindborg", with a general cargo for London; there were no casualties. While patrolling in the same area on the 23rd, "UB-6" sank four Belgian lighters. The following day, the Dutch ship was seized as a prize and sailed into Zeebrugge by a prize crew from "UB-6". "Batavier II" was the last success for Heydebreck in command of "UB-6"; he was assigned to command the newly commissioned minelaying submarine in January 1917. "Oberleutnant zur See" Oskar Steckelberg, another member of the April 1908 cadet class, replaced Heydebreck on "UB-6".
Unrestricted submarine warfare.
The British blockade of Germany, which prevented neutral shipping from reaching German ports, had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany. Among the results were an increase in infant mortality and as many as 700,000 deaths attributed to starvation or hypothermia during the war. With the blockade having such dire consequences, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat.
On 10 March, "UB-6" departed Zeebrugge to patrol off the Mass lightship. Two days later, "UB-6" entered Dutch territorial waters after Steckelberg made a navigational error, and ran aground at the mouth of the Maas River. Because the Netherlands was neutral during the war, and "UB-6" did not leave Dutch territorial waters within 24 hours as required by international law, the submarine and her crew were interned by the Dutch. The Germans protested, but because "UB-6"s grounding was merely the result of an error and not because of distress, the Dutch could not release the submarine. "UB-6" was taken to the port of Hellevoetsluis for internment, where, on 18 March, "UB-6"s crew scuttled her. The crew of "UB-6" was interned for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, "UB-6"s wreck was surrendered to France, taken to Brest, and broken up in July 1921.

Berthier carbine

The Berthier carbine (French: "Mousqueton Berthier") was a French service rifle adopted in 1892, which was widely used during the First and Second World War. 
After the adoption of the new Lebel Model 1886 rifle in 8 x 50R caliber, French military authorities attempted to develop a carbine version of the rifle for mounted troops. A prototype carbine was created by simply shortening the existing barrel, forearm, and magazine tube of the Mle 1886 rifle. However, this design was soon rejected for insufficient accuracy, as well as being too slow and cumbersome to reload with single cartridges while on horseback.
In response, the French Army held a series of rifle trials in 1887 to select a suitable carbine. One of the prototypes submitted was designed by Émile Berthier, a mechanical engineer in La Compagnie Bône-Guelma (one of the five subsidiary companies of the Algerian Railway System). Berthier's design was adopted in 1890. The search for a suitable small arm for mounted troops was given greater urgency by the Germans' development of the Karabiner Modell 1888, a carbine variant of the Gewehr 1888. It was issued to essentially all French artillery and cavalry troops. 
The Berthier carbines (and later the rifles) used a lighter, streamlined receiver and a one-piece stock that departed from the Lebel Mle 1886/M93 rifle system. For instance, the locking lugs present on the bolt of Berthier weapons do lock into the receiver vertically, instead of horizontally as in the Lebel rifle. Like the Mle 1886/M93, the Berthier carbine was designed for the 8mm Lebel cartridge, but it was loaded by a three round en-bloc Mannlicher-style clip. However, in a departure from the usual Mannlicher magazine design, designers included a large opening at the bottom of the magazine well, in part to verify if the carbine was loaded with a charger of cartridges. During World War I, after complaints from combat troops regarding the limited capacity of the 3-round charger and mud ingress into the well opening, the Berthier's magazine was increased to hold a 5 round "en bloc" charger. Furthermore, a hinged metal plate covering the bottom opening of the magazine well was added. The final result was the Mle 1892 M16 5-shot carbine which was well received, but did not appear on the front lines until the summer of 1918. Though inferior overall to Mauser's double-column box magazines, the Berthier weapons had to retain the Mannlicher "en bloc" system, as the rimmed and tapered 8mm Lebel cartridge could not feed properly from a Mauser-style box magazine. The Berthier Mle 1892 M16 carbine, with a 5-round charger, had a deserved reputation of solidity and reliability that kept it in service until the early 1960s.

SM UB-7

SM "UB-7" was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. She disappeared in the Black Sea in September 1916.
"UB-7" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-7" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-7" was originally one of a pair of UB I boats sent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy to replace an Austrian pair to be sent to the Dardanelles, and was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Pola in March 1915 for reassembly. She was launched in April and commissioned as SM "UB-7" in the German Imperial Navy in May when the Austrians opted out of the agreement.
Although briefly a part of the Pola Flotilla at commissioning, "UB-7" spent the majority of her career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople Flotilla. The U-boat sank one ship of in September 1915. In October, she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria. She was considered for transfer to the Bulgarian Navy, but disappeared in late September 1916 before a transfer could take place. Her fate is officially unknown, but sources report that may have struck a mine or been sunk by a Russian airplane.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes. "UB-7" was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.
"UB-7" was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 30 November. As built, "UB-7" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-7" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-7" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-7"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
While "UB-7"s construction neared completion in early March 1915, Enver Pasha and other Turkish leaders were pleading with their German and Austro-Hungarian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions. The Germans induced the Austro-Hungarian Navy () to send two boats—its own Germaniawerft-built boats and —with the promise of "UB-7" and "UB-8" as replacements.
When work on "UB-7" and "UB-8" was complete at the Germaniwerft yard, they were both readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. The boats were ready for shipment to the main Austrian naval base at Pola on 15 March, despite the fact that the Austrian pair was still not ready. German engineers and technicians that accompanied the German boats to Pola worked under the supervision of Kapitänleutnant Hans Adam, head of the newly created U-boat special command (). Typically, the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks, and, accordingly, "UB-7" was launched at Pola sometime in April.
Career.
During her trials, "UB-7" developed a leak which took some time to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of "U-7" and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for "UB-7" to be transferred to the "K.u.K. Kriegsmarine"—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian "U-3" and "U-4" were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.
With the change of heart from the Austrians, Germany resolved to retain "UB-7" and send her to the aid of the Turks. So, upon completion of her leak repairs, the boat was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-7" on 6 May under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Werner, a 26-year-old native of Apola. At commissioning, the boat temporarily joined the Pola Flotilla ().
Because of her limited range, "UB-7" would not have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on the night on 15/16 May, she was towed by the Austrian destroyer through the Straits of Otranto and into the Ionian Sea. By June, "UB-7" had reached Smyrna—not having any success on her journey there—and joined and "UB-8" in the Constantinople Flotilla (). Once there, "UB-7" was ineffective because she was hampered by her limited torpedo supply and her weak engines, which made negotiating the strong Dardanelles currents nearly impossible. Because of this, "UB-7" was sent to patrol in the Black Sea in July, cruising without success from the 5th to the 22nd.
In September 1915, "UB-7" and "UB-8" were sent to Varna, Bulgaria, and from there, to patrol off the Russian Black Sea coast. On 18 September, "UB-7" torpedoed and sank the British steamer "Patagonia" about from Odessa. The cargo ship, of , was the only ship credited to "UB-7", and the only one sunk by any of the Constantinople Flotilla in the month.
Because Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers, battleships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and aircraft from the seaplane carriers and began attacks on Varna and the Bulgarian coast on 25 October. "UB-7" and "UB-8", both based out of Varna by this time, sortied to disrupt the bombardment. Off Varna on the 27th, "UB-7" got in position to fire a torpedo at the (most well-known under her former name of "Potemkin"). Although "UB-7"s crew heard what they thought was the torpedo explode, it did not hit "Panteleimon". Despite the lack of success, the attempt did cause the Russians to break off their attacks and withdraw.
In early 1916, "UB-7" and "UB-8" were still cruising in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans did not have good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw the value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase "UB-7" and "UB-8". Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of "UB-8" to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, "UB-7" remained under the German flag.
In July 1916, the Germans sent to mine off Novorossisk. To attempt to neutralize any Russian response, "UB-7"—under the command of Hans Lütjohann, who had taken over for Werner when he returned to Germany to command the new —was stationed off Sevastopol to attack any ships that sailed in response to the mission. Unfortunately, Russian seaplanes spotted "UB-7" and bombed the U-boat, preventing her from accomplishing her goal. With the submarine out of the way, Rear Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak sortied with dreadnought , cruiser , and five destroyers. The Russian fleet engaged "Breslau", which was forced to abort her mission and retire. Sources are quiet on damage, if any, suffered by "UB-7".
Fate.
On 27 September 1916, "UB-7" departed Varna for operations off Sevastopol and was never heard from again. According to some sources, "UB-7" was mined somewhere in the Black Sea. In June 1917, a Russian pilot captured by the Germans reported that a Russian airplane bombed and sank "UB-7" on 1 October at position , near the Chersones Lighthouse. Authors Dwight Messimer and Robert Grant are each dubious of this claim, and the fate of "UB-7" is still officially unknown. Among the fifteen men lost on "UB-7" were the Constantinople Flotilla's senior radio officer, and the first Bulgarian submariner lost during the war, a trainee from Vidin.

Barah Aana

Barah Aana is a 2009 Indian comedy-drama film written and directed by Raja Menon. The title refers to 12 Barah in Hindustani aanas (or "annas"), which was a unit of Indian currency before decimalisation. "Barah Aana" stars Naseeruddin Shah, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Vijay Raaz and Arjun Mathur. The film depicts the lives of working class Indians in a globalized milieu, and how events spiral out of control when the characters try their hand at crime.
Plot.
Set in today’s Mumbai, Barah Aana revolves around three friends: Shukla, a driver, Yadav, a watchman, and Aman, a waiter. Shukla is an older man, stoic and steady. Yadav, in his 30s, is meek and something of a pushover at work, but exhibits an underlying mischievous nature. Aman, on the other hand, is young, dynamic, and ambitious. In typical Mumbai fashion, the three are roommates, and the clash of their personalities regularly results in humorous, tongue-in-cheek banter.
Things take a turn when the watchman becomes prey to misfortune; a series of chance events results in him stumbling on to a crime. The discovery changes his perspective, boosting his self-confidence enough to make him think that he had a found a new, low-risk way to make money. He then tries to sell the idea to his roommates, to get them to join him in executing a series of such crimes.
As they get more and more mired in the spiral of events that follow, the three characters go through several changes as they are pushed more and more against the wall.

Holy See–Spain relations

Holy See–Spain relations are foreign relations between the Holy See and Spain. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1530. The Holy See has a nunciature in Madrid. Spain has an embassy in Rome.
History.
The Spanish Inquisition was an ecclesiastical tribunal started in 1478 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms, and to replace the medieval inquisition which was under Vatican control. The new body was under the direct control of the Spanish monarchy. It was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of Isabella II.
Relations with the Zapatero government have been strained because of government legislation allowing for same-sex marriage, liberalisation of abortion, end of religious education in public schools and general political support for secularism.
The government values the heritage of the Spanish Republicans of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of which had been strongly anticlerical, especially during the Spanish Civil War. It has also questioned the role of the Spanish monarchy in national politics.
This contrasts with previous Spanish administrations, many of which had been keen of promoting Spain's historic Catholic identity, such as under Francisco Franco for example. Relations were also good under Jose Maria Aznar.

Dave Lewis (musician)

David Eugene "Dave" Lewis (1938 – March 13, 1998) was an African American rock and rhythm & blues (R&B) keyboardist, organist, and vocalist based in Seattle, Washington, US. Peter Blecha accounts his Dave Lewis Combo as "Seattle's first significant African American 1950s rock and roll band" and Lewis himself as "the singularly most significant figure on the Pacific Northwest's nascent rhythm & blues scene in the 1950s and 1960s."
Life and early career.
The Texas-born Lewis came to the Pacific Northwest with his family during World War II. There was music in his background: his father, David Lewis, Sr., was an accomplished amateur guitarist, and his mother Bertha Lewis was similarly talented on piano. The family moved first to seek work in the navy town of Bremerton, Washington, across Puget Sound from Seattle, where they settled in the segregated Sinclair Heights housing projects. One of their neighbors was the young Quincy Jones, who took some music lessons from David Sr.
The Lewis and Jones families both eventually moved to Seattle, where they lived about five blocks apart from one another in the Central District, the center of African American life in Seattle at the time. His father worked as a fabricator at Boeing and also pulled shifts in a barber shop. Lewis tried both guitar and piano, but definitely gravitated toward the latter, especially after hearing Ray Charles, who was launching his performing career in Seattle in the late 1940s.
Lewis's first performing group was a doo-wop vocal group called the Five Checks, formed to enter a talent show held at Edmond Meany Jr. High School (now Edmond S. Meany Middle School). They went on to perform at schools around Seattle, often for audiences who had never heard anything of the sort, at least not in live performance.
As a student at Seattle's Garfield High School Lewis formed the combo that would bring him to local prominence. George Griffin from his doo-wop group played drums; Barney Hilliard and J. B. Allen both played saxophone; Jack Grey played upright bass, and Al Aquino rounded out the group on guitar. Starting off at teenage sock hops and house parties, they soon graduated to being an opening act for touring R&B acts when they played Seattle's downtown Palomar Theater (then at the corner of Third and University, now replaced by a multi-story parking garage). The Dave Lewis Combo opened for, among others Sugar Pie DeSanto, Sugar Chile Robinson, Nellie Lutcher, and Wild Bill Davis.
In the summer of 1956, Lewis still had one more year to complete at Seattle's Franklin High School, but his combo was the hottest item in the region. They toured the Pacific Northwest as the opening act for a leg of a Bill Haley & His Comets tour. This led to similar opportunities with Ray Charles, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Platters, Ike and Tina Turner, the Drifters, Roy Orbison, and Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps.
In summer 1957, Lewis and his combo settled in for a long tenure as the house band at the leading Seattle R&B club, Birdland (22nd and Madison), where they popularized the song Louie Louie, which would become strongly associated with the region. By this time, Al Aquino and Jack Grey had left the band, replaced by Bud Brown on guitar and Chuck Whittaker on electric bass (replacing Grey's upright acoustic). On several occasions the teenaged Jimi Hendrix—then "Jimmy" Hendrix—sat in on jam sessions there, but Lewis's audience found him undanceable. 
Later members of the Combo were Jerry Allen (guitar) and Carlos Ward (saxophone).
Role in desegregation.
Lewis's broad popularity played a significant role in the desegregation of the Seattle music scene. At the time Lewis began his professional career, Seattle still had two musician's union locals, AFM No. 76 for whites and AFM No. 493 for blacks. Lewis's combo became the first African American band to play frequently on traditionally white turf, including downtown clubs, University of Washington fraternities, and even suburban venues. When Local 76 complained about Lewis getting a gig at the popular Parker's Ballroom on Aurora Avenue, owner Dick Parker told them that if they made him choose between booking Lewis's combo and being able to book Local 76 bands, he'd choose Lewis. On January 14, 1958 the two Seattle locals merged.
1960s success.
In 1962, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the Century 21 Exposition (the Seattle world's fair), Lewis put together a new band. J. B. Allen remained from the old group; the new band members were guitarist Jim Manolides and drummer Don "Candido" Mallory. The new group took over from Manolides' old group the Frantics as the house band at Dave's Fifth Avenue near the fairgrounds.
Shortly after the end of the fair, Lewis switched from piano to Hammond B-3 organ, and formed a new trio with guitarist Joe Johansen and drummer Dickey Ensign (who would be replaced in 1966 by Dean Hodges).His new trio scored minor hits with "David's Mood (Part 2)" (1963) and "Little Green Thing" (1964), both of which were heavily covered by other Pacific Northwest bands. By the mid-1960s, though, Lewis pretty much gave up touring, settling instead into a long series of local club gigs that lasted into the early 1970s.
Declining years.
Although Lewis in his years of success was not known to be a drug user "beyond an occasional reefer," he was busted for drug possession in 1975, receiving probation. He attempted a comeback in the 1980s with the Paramount Orchestra, an attempt at a house band for Seattle's landmark Paramount Theatre, where his brother Ulysses Lewis was one of the partners in the management firm at the time. The "grandiose" project was not notably successful. Furthermore, Lewis got into increasingly serious drug problems, leading him to get involved with a drugstore robbery, for which he was convicted and served two years in prison.
Lewis did some performing in his later years, including playing in a 1987 Northwest Rock reunion concert at the Seattle Center Coliseum, and was inducted into the Northwest Area Music Association's Hall of Fame in 1989. Lewis died of cancer March 13, 1998. Some of his recordings were finally reissued in CD form in 2006.

Pennsylvania School for the Deaf

The Pennsylvania School for the Deaf is the third-oldest school of its kind in the United States. Its founder, David G. Seixas (1788–1864), was a Philadelphia crockery maker-dealer who became concerned with the plight of impoverished deaf children that he observed on the city's streets. The current school building is listed by the National Register of Historic Places, and two former campuses are similarly recognized.
History.
In 1819, Seixas began bringing deaf youngsters into his home to provide them with food, clothing and instruction, all at his expense. 
More space became needed to accommodate additional children as Seixas' humanitarian efforts became known, so he rented an office at the southeast corner of Eleventh and High (later Market) Streets to serve as a school. In 1821, prominent Philadelphia citizens decided to help Seixas by incorporating a charitable society: the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. The organization was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as "an asylum and school in the city of Philadelphia, where the children of the rich, for a moderate compensation, and of the poor, gratuitously, laboring under the privation of the faculty of speech, are maintained and educated." (Act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, February 8, 1821) The state also provided financial assistance. Episcopal Bishop William White served as the school's president until his death in 1836.
The number of deaf children needing special education increased so much that a much larger school—more accurately, an asylum—was soon needed. This became the stately Greek Revival structure that still stands at the northwest corner Broad and Pine Streets. Completed in 1826 and later incorporating two additions, this building is an excellent example of major works by three of America's most important 19th-century architects: John Haviland, William Strickland and Frank Furness. When the Pennsylvania School moved to a campus in Philadelphia's Mount Airy neighborhood in 1892-1893, the Broad and Pine building was purchased by the predecessor of Philadelphia's University of the Arts. The structure, now known as Dorrance Hamilton Hall, is the oldest extant edifice on Broad Street.
Since 1984, the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf has been located in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, occupying several buildings of the Old Germantown Academy site at 100 West School House Lane. Spring Garden College bought the Mt. Airy campus in 1985 and then closed in the early 1990s. The institution presently serves students aged 3 to 18 in preschool through high school classes. As one of four private state-chartered schools, along with the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, which recently took over the Scranton School for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children (formerly known as Scranton State School for the Deaf), the Pennsylvania School is reimbursed for most of its operating expenses by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and eligible youngsters attend tuition-free. The school also depends on charitable contributions. A resource and service center for deaf and hard of hearing adults called the Center for Community and Professional Services also operates on the school's campus.
Under the title Pennsylvania Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, the former campus at 7500 Germantown Avenue was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 9, 1985. The 1826 Broad Street building is a contributing building in the Broad Street Historic District added to the NRHP in 1984. The current buildings are part of the Old Germantown Academy, added to the NRHP in 1972.
Notable students.
Artist Albert Newsam attended the school, starting in 1920.

Finance Tower

The Finance Tower (French: "Tour des Finances," Dutch: "Financietoren") is a skyscraper in the Northern Quarter central business district of Brussels, Belgium, designed by the architects Hugo Van Kuyck, Marcel Lambrichs and Léon Stynen. It is the second tallest building in Belgium, and has the most office space of any building in Belgium.
Height classification.
At the time of its construction, this skyscraper was the second tallest building in Belgium after the South Tower. The height of the building is 145 meters, and it has 36 floors.
Location.
The Finance Tower is situated to the crossroads of the boulevard of the botanical Garden ("Boulevard du Jardin Botanique" / "Kruidtuinlaan") and the Royal Street ("Rue Royale" / "Koningsstraat"). It is served by many public transit systems, including the Botanique/Kruidtuin metro station and Brussels-Central and Brussels-North railway stations.
Art.
Right in front of the Finance Tower one finds this sculpture of two females embracing. In individualistic Belgian fashion, this is rather an evocative and erotically-themed sculpture.
Of the two women is more classically feminine in appearance, the other looks more like a man, though one quickly sees she also female. The pose is enigmatic, with the shorter-haired woman firmly grasping the wrist of the longer-haired woman behind her back, almost wrestling her into submission, while both look away from each other despite being nude and intimate.
History.
Purpose.
The Finance Tower is part of a wider body: the Administrative City of the State. One objective was to group together the administrations of the State in order to increase productivity and to reduce the functioning wastes. The site is preferred because of its ease of access, most notably with the proximity of central train station. On top of this, the works of the North-South connection made the neighbourhood lifeless, and it was necessary to recreate a liaison between the upper and lower city.
Construction.
The tower is located on a site with a 13 metre difference between the highest and lowest altitudes. Producing the preliminary documents took nearly four years, from 1968 to 1972. Searches were performed down to a depth of 26 metres. The building of the foundations was made difficult by the presence of a water-logged clay terrain as well as by the tunnel of the North-South connection. 
Budget restrictions slowed down the construction; work was practically paralysed from 1974 to 1978. The works resumed in 1978. Major work was finally finished in February 1981 but it was the end of 1983 before the tower at last opened its doors. Its external elevator core was intended to have had a marble facade, but this was scrapped because of the high cost.
Renovation.
The Finance Tower was involved in a large-scale renovation between January 1, 2005 and 2008. The plan comes about it back to the office of architects of Maurice Mottle, It involved replacing the old facade with a light blue and white curtain wall, removal of all asbestos, the dismantling of the external elevator core and the building of new elevators inside the building. The office space lost by this move is compensated for by a new 11-storey building constructed to the east of the tower. The renovated building provides office space for 4,600 workers, an increase from the 3,200 prior to renovation.
The antenna, which is mounted on top of the tower, serves the two Belgian national television stations and is used only for digital broadcast.

Gonzalo Salvadórez

Gonzalo Salvadórez (or Salvadores) (died 6 January 1083), "called Cuatro Manos (‘four hands’) on account of his great valour", was one of the most powerful Castilian noblemen of his era, a kinsman of the Lara family, and by tradition, descendant of the Counts of Castile. He was a son of Salvador González and brother of Álvaro Salvadórez, with whom he often figures in contemporary documentation. His family's area of influence was Bureba. 
I Count Gonzalo, in readiness for battle against the Moors with my lord, grant and concede to God and to the monastery of Oña where my forebears rest, in order that I may be remembered there for evermore . . . list of properties and churches . . . If I should meet with death among the Moors, may my soul be with Christ; and let my body be borne to Oña and buried there with my kinsfolk, together with gifts of 1600 gold pieces ["metcales"], and three of my noble horses and two mules, and from my wardrobe two silken robes and three of shot-silk taffeta, and two vessels of silver . . . And if my vassals and retainers do not so bear me Oña in the event of my death, they are nothing worth, like the traitor who kills his lord, because I made them rich and powerful.
Gonzalo is first recorded as an adult when he witnessed a charter with his father and uncle, Munio (Muño) González, in 1056, at the court of Ferdinand I. In the next reign, he was a frequent subscriber to the charters of—and attendee at the court of—Sancho II. He was ruling Lara in 1072/3, when Sancho granted the citizens of Lara the right to pilgrimage to San Millán de Cogolla. He witnessed donations to San Millán in 1070 and 1082 (twice). He and his uncle Munio were one of the first Castilian magnates to support Alfonso VI after the death of Sancho (1072), and Gonzalo attained the rank of count ("comes") in 1074. Gonzalo, Munio, and Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (El Cid) were the only Castilian magnates to figure prominently in royal actions outside of Castile. In total, Gonzalo confirmed some nine charters of Sancho II and eleven by Alfonso. 
In December 1082 Albofalac, the governor of Rueda de Jalón, made a "pronunciamiento" in a favour of Yusuf al-Muzaffar, the imprisoned brother of al-Muqtadir, recently deceased ruler of Zaragoza, and rebelled against al-Mu'tamin, al-Muqtadir's son and successor. At the same time Ibn al-Royolo, who had brought Denia to al-Muqtadir in 1076, was now suspected of intriguing with Alfonso VI against al-Mu'tamin. Further, a recently failed embassy led by Sisnando Davidiz to the court of Zaragoza may have warmed Alfonso to the invitation of Albofalac to take part in his revolt, which he eventually requested. Alfonso sent an army under Gonzalo and Ramiro Garcés, the younger brother of Sancho IV of Navarre. Gonzalo and Ramiro held talks with Yusuf, now free (Albofalac had been his jailer), who may have urged them to request the king's presence. Alfonso did appear, but only for a short while. 
After his departure, Yusuf suddenly died. Albofalac then invited Alfonso to take possession of his castle of Rueda, and the king sent Gonzalo and Ramiro under a safe conduct. When they and their men entered the castle, they were massacred by the garrison, who pelted them with stones. The "Annales Compostellani" place the death of "Gundisalvus comes … apud Rodam" (Count Gonzalo … by Rueda) in 1084. The disaster is also placed in 1084 by the "Chronicon Iriense", "Chronicon Burgense", and "Annales Complutenses". The date of the "Historia Roderici", however is confirmed by the "Chronica Naierensis" and has the support of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Antonio Ubieto Arteta, R. A. Fletcher, and B. F. Reilly. Gonzalo was buried at Oña as he had requested, and where his ancestors continued to be buried. 
Gonzalo's first wife was Elvira Díaz, daughter of Diego Álvarez and sister of Ticlo, wife of Íñigo López, who bore him six children: Goto, Toda, Munia, Dueña, García, and Gustio. His second wife, Sancha Sánchez, daughter of Sancho Macerátiz, bore him two: count Gómez González, Gonzalo's eventual heir and the premier noble and one-time suitor of queen Urraca of León, and Fernando. Goto married Fernando Díaz and was dead by July 1087, when, as the executor of her will, he made a donation to San Salvador de Oña of some land in Hermosilla that she had inherited from her father and uncle Álvaro Salvadórez.

The Academy of Christian Humanism University (UAHC) () is a Chilean non-profit private university, founded in 1988 but whose origins date back to 1975 when establishing the Academy of Christian Humanism, led by Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez (SDB), whose purpose was to bring together a group of intellectuals to discuss the politics, society, economy and culture of Chile.
This university, also known simply as "La Academia" (The Academy) is accredited in the areas of Institutional Management and Undergraduate Studies by the National Commission on Accreditation, an organization that ensures the quality of higher education in Chile, for a period of 3 years from December 2008 and December 2011. It, along with the Andrés Bello and Diego Portales University was awarded research funds from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) program's regular contest of 2009.
The University now offers 21 courses leading to diploma and degree graduates, special programs and 9 master's programs in the areas of Social Sciences, Education, Arts and Culture, State, Economy and Management, and also a Ph.D. in Education with twenty years of experience.
History.
The history of this university begans in 1975 when Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez(SDB) prompted the establishment of the Academy of Christian Humanism, a center for studies in a framework of freedom and pluralism. This institution has enabled a large group of intellectuals in Chile, especially in the field of social sciences, an area for creating and disseminating knowledge on the political, economic, social and cultural of Chile under the Pinochet's military dictatorship.
The Academy of Christian Humanism University was founded in 1988 as a university within the framework of human values from various strands of social thought, with a decisive role in the formation of new generations of professionals in Chile. This has been setting up work areas, which integrates the teaching, research, extension and interdisciplinary studies of the phenomena characteristic of contemporary society.
This University has been defined as university of academic excellence, that definition is supported by the high quality of its teachers and researchers, and as an open space for discussion and reflection. This position is reflected in the promotion of critical thinking and divergent, through constructive dialogue.
This University acquires full autonomy in 1999, awarded by the Higher Education Council of Chile, consolidating a secular and pluralistic university, consistent with the values of humanism that gave origin.

Cuthbert Dukes

Cuthbert Dukes OBE (1890–1977) was an English physician and pathologist and author, for whom the Dukes classification for colorectal cancer is named.
Born in Bridgwater, Somerset, Dukes was educated at Caterham School and graduated with an M.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1914. His field of choice was pathology and he would make many great contributions to the world of medicine over the course of his career. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps that was attached to the Rifle Brigade during World War I and was awarded the OBE for his services. After the war's end he became a demonstrator in bacteriology at University College in London, and in 1922, was the first pathologist to join the staff of St. Mark's Hospital. It was there that he began his recognized studies on the pathology of colon cancer. He wrote several books based on his findings.
A meticulous researcher who took personal pleasure in the many cases in which his findings helped patients with colon cancer, Dukes, apparently in accordance to his humble Quaker faith, refused all honours despite the wishes of his former colleagues and lived quietly at his home in Wimbledon until his death at the age of 86.
He was the younger brother of British playwright Ashley Dukes and MI6 agent Sir Paul Dukes.

Models of migration to the Philippines

There have been several models of early human migration to the Philippines. Since H. Otley Beyer first proposed his wave migration theory, numerous scholars have approached the question of how, when and why humans first came to the Philippines. The question of whether the first humans arrived from the south (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei as suggested by Beyer) or from the north (Yunnan via Taiwan as suggested by the Austronesian theory) has been a subject of heated debate for decades. As new discoveries have come to light, past hypotheses have been reevaluated and new theories constructed.
Beyer's Wave Migration Theory.
The most widely known theory of the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines is that of H. Otley Beyer, founder of the Anthropology Department of the University of the Philippines. Heading that department for 40 years, Professor Beyer became the unquestioned expert on Philippine prehistory, exerting early leadership in the field and influencing the first generation of Filipino historians and anthropologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, geologists, and students the world over. According to Dr. Beyer, the ancestors of the Filipinos came in different "waves of migration", as follows:
Unfortunately, there is no definite evidence, archaeological or historical, to support this "migration theory". On the contrary, there are sufficient reasons for doubting it, including the following:
Objections to the Land Bridge Theory.
In February 1976, Fritjof Voss, a German scientist who studied the geology of the Philippines, questioned the validity of the theory of land bridges. He maintained that the Philippines was never part of mainland Asia. He claimed that it arose from the bottom of the sea and, as the thin Pacific crust moved below it, continued to rise. It continues to rise today. The country lies along great Earth faults that extend to deep submarine trenches. The resulting violent earthquakes caused what is now the land masses forming the Philippines to rise to the surface of the sea. Dr. Voss also pointed out that when scientific studies were done on the Earth's crust from 1964 to 1967, it was discovered that the 35-kilometer- thick crust underneath China does not reach the Philippines. Thus, the latter could not have been a land bridge to the Asian mainland. The matter of who the first settlers were has not been really resolved.
Philippine historian William Henry Scott has pointed out that Palawan and the Calamian Islands are separated from Borneo by water nowhere deeper than 100 meters, that south of a line drawn between Saigon and Brunei does the depth of the South China Sea nowhere exceeds 100 meters, and that the Strait of Malacca reaches 50 meters only at one point. Scott also asserts that the Sulu Archipelago is not the peak of a submerged mountain range connecting Mindanao and Borneo, but the exposed edge of three small ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom in recent geologic times. According to Scott, it is clear that Palawan and the Calamianes do not stand on a submerged land bridge, but were once a hornlike protuberance on the shoulder of a continent whose southern shoreline used to be the present islands of Java and Borneo. Mindoro and the Calamianes are separated by a channel more than 500 meters deep. Writing later in 1994, Scott would conclude that "It is probably safe to say that no anthropologist accepts the Beyer Wave Migration Theory today." 
Core Population Theory.
A less rigid version of the earlier wave migration theory is the Core Population Theory first proposed by anthropologist Felipe Landa Jocano of the University of the Philippines. This theory holds that there weren't clear discrete waves of migration. Instead it suggests early inhabitants of Southeast Asia were of the same ethnic group with similar culture, but through a gradual process over time driven by environmental factors, differentiated themselves from one another.
Jocano contends that what fossil evidence of ancient men show is that they not only migrated to the Philippines, but also to New Guinea, Borneo, and Australia. He says that there is no way of determining if they were Negritos at all. However, what is sure is that there is evidence the Philippines was inhabited as early as 21,000 or 22,000 years ago. In 1962, a skull cap and a portion of a jaw, presumed to be those of a human being, were found in a Tabon Cave in Palawan. The discovery may show that humans reached the Philippines earlier than the Malay Peninsula. If this is true, the first inhabitants of the Philippines did not come from the Malay Peninsula. Jocano further believes that the present Filipinos are products of the long process of cultural evolution and movement of people. This not only holds true for Filipinos, but for the Indonesians and the Malays of Malaysia, as well. No group among the three is culturally or genetically dominant. Hence, Jocano says that it is not correct to attribute the Filipino culture as being Malayan in orientation. According to Jocano's findings, the people of the prehistoric islands of Southeast Asia were of the same population as the combination of human evolution that occurred in the islands of Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago. The claimed evidence for this is fossil material found in different parts of the region and the movements of other people from the Asian mainland during historic times. He states that these ancient men cannot be categorized under any of the historically identified ethnic groups (Malays, Indonesians, and Filipinos) of today.
Other prominent anthropologists like Robert Bradford Fox, Alfredo E. Evangelista, Jesus Peralta, Zeus A. Salazar, and Ponciano L. Bennagen agreed with Jocano. However some still preferred Beyer's theory as the more acceptable model, including anthropologist E. Arsenio Manuel.
Diffusion of Austronesian languages.
Another, more contemporary theory based on the study of the evolution of languages suggests that starting 4000–2000 BC,
Austronesian groups descended from Yunnan Plateau in China and settled in what is now the Philippines by sailing using "balangays" or by traversing land bridges coming from Taiwan. Many of these Austronesians settled on the Philippine islands and became the ancestors of the present-day Filipinos and later colonizing most of the Pacific islands and Indonesia to the south. The Cagayan valley of northern Luzon contains large stone tools as evidence for the hunters of the big game of the time: the elephant-like stegodon, rhinoceros, crocodile, tortoise, pig and deer. The Austronesians pushed the Negritos to the mountains, while they occupied the fertile coastal plains.
Solheim's hypothesis.
Anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim II posited an alternative model based on maritime movement of people over different directions and routes. It suggests that people with distant origins from 50,000 years ago in the area of present day coastal eastern Vietnam and Southern China had moved to the area of the Bismarck Islands south and east of Mindanao and developed Pre-Austronesian. Proto-Austranesian then later developed and spread among seafarers from the area to the rest of Island Southeast Asia and areas along the South China Sea. In support of this idea Solheim notes there is little or no indication that Pre- or Proto Malayo-Polynesian was present in Taiwan. According to Solheim, "The one thing I feel confident in saying is that all native Southeast Asians are closely related culturally, genetically and to a lesser degree linguistically."
New developments.
The "out of Taiwan" model based on Austronesian linguistic evidence that had become the mainstream explanation is in turn being challenged by newer findings. Studies based on mitochondrial DNA show greater genetic diversity in southern regions than in northern ones suggesting that a significant migration wave was in a south-to-north direction. Older populations entered Southeast Asia first following the coastal regions from Africa then slowly spread north to populate East Asia.

Soviet Union in World War II

Germany began World War II with a Non-Aggression Pact with the USSR, after signing of which it quickly invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. 
The Soviet troops entered Poland on 17 September and also fought a peripheral war with Finland from November 1939 to March 1940. The bulk of Soviet fighting took place on the Eastern Front—including a continued war with Finland—but it also invaded Iran (August 1941) in cooperation with the British and late in the war attacked Japan (August 1945).
Joseph Stalin was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. In the years following Lenin's death in 1924, he rose to become the leader of the Soviet Union.
In August 1939, at Stalin's direction, the Soviet Union entered into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, containing a secret protocol, dividing the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Thereafter, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded their apportioned sections of Poland. The Soviet Union later invaded Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and part of Romania, along with an attempted invasion of Finland. Stalin and Hitler later traded proposals for a Soviet entry into the Axis Pact.
In June 1941, Germany began an invasion of the Soviet Union, before which Stalin had ignored reports of a German invasion. Stalin was confident that the total Allied war machine would eventually stop Germany, and the Soviets stopped the Wehrmacht some 30 kilometers from Moscow. Over the next four years, the Soviet Union repulsed German offensives, such as at the Battle of Stalingrad and Battle of Kursk, and pressed forward to victory in large Soviet offensives such as the Vistula-Oder Offensive. Stalin began to listen to his generals more after Kursk.
Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran Conference and began to discuss a two-front war against Germany and future of Europe after the war. Berlin finally fell in April 1945, but Stalin was never fully convinced his nemesis Hitler had committed suicide. Fending off the German invasion and pressing to victory in the East required a tremendous sacrifice by the Soviet Union, which suffered the highest military casualties in the war, losing approximately 20 million men.
Stalin became personally involved with questionable tactics employed during the war, including the Katyn massacre, Order No. 270, Order No. 227 and NKVD prisoner massacres. Controversy also surrounds rapes and looting in Soviet-held territory, along with large numbers of deaths of POWs held by the Soviets, and the Soviets' abusive treatment of their own soldiers who had been held in German POW camps.
Pact with Adolf Hitler.
In August 1939, Stalin accepted Adolf Hitler's proposal to enter into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, negotiated by the foreign ministers Vyacheslav Molotov for the Soviets and Joachim von Ribbentrop for the Germans. Officially a non-aggression treaty only, an appended secret protocol, also reached on August 23, 1939, divided the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The USSR was promised an eastern part of Poland, then primarily populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians, in case of its dissolution, and Germany recognized Latvia, Estonia and Finland as parts of the Soviet sphere of influence, with Lithuania added in a second secret protocol in September 1939. Another clause of the treaty was that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan ASSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow.
The Pact was reached two days after the breakdown of Soviet military talks with British and French representatives in August 1939 over a potential Franco-Anglo-Soviet alliance. Political discussions had been suspended on August 2 when Molotov stated they could not be restarted until progress was made in military talks late in August, after the talks had stalled over guarantees of the Baltic states, while the military talks upon which Molotov insisted started on 11 August. At the same time, Germany—with whom the Soviets had started secret discussions since July 29 -- argued that it could offer the Soviets better terms than Britain and France, with Ribbentrop insisting, "there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us." German officials stated that, unlike Britain, Germany could permit the Soviets to continue their developments unmolested, and that "there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies of the West." By that time, Molotov obtained information regarding Anglo-German negotiations and a pessimistic report from the Soviet ambassador in France. After disagreement regarding Stalin's demand to move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on August 21, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the excuse that the absence of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on August 23. Regarding the larger issue of collective security, some historians state that one reason that Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France and Britain by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Stalin also viewed the Pact as gaining time in an inevitable war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.
Stalin and Ribbentrop spent most of the night of the Pact's signing trading friendly stories about world affairs and cracking jokes (a rarity for Ribbentrop) about England's weakness, and the pair even joked about how the Anti-Comintern Pact principally scared "British shopkeepers." They further traded toasts, with Stalin proposing a toast to Hitler's health and Ribbentrop proposing a toast to Stalin.
Implementing the division of Eastern Europe and other invasions.
On September 1, 1939, the German invasion of its agreed upon portion of Poland started World War II. On September 17 the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. Eleven days later, the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was modified, allotting Germany a larger part of Poland, while ceding most of Lithuania to the Soviet Union. The Soviet portions lay east of the so-called Curzon Line, an ethnographic frontier between Russia and Poland drawn up by a commission of the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In early 1940, the Soviets executed over 25,000 Polish POWs and political prisoners in the Katyn Forrest.
In August 1939, Stalin declared that he was going to "solve the Baltic problem, and thereafter, forced Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to sign treaties for "mutual assistance."
After unsuccessfully attempting to install a communist puppet government in Finland, in November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland. The Finnish defense defied Soviet expectations, and after stiff losses, Stalin settled for an interim peace granting the Soviet Union less than total domination by annexing only the eastern region of Karelia (10% of Finnish territory). Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million. After this campaign, Stalin took actions to bolster the Soviet military, modify training and improve propaganda efforts in the Soviet military.
In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Stalin claimed that the mutual assistance treaties had been violated, and gave six hour ultimatums for new governments to be formed in each country, including lists of persons for cabinet posts provided by the Kremlin. Thereafter, state administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, followed by mass repression in which 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed. Elections for parliament and other offices were held with single candidates listed, the official results of which showed pro-Soviet candidates approval by 92.8 percent of the voters of Estonia, 97.6 percent of the voters in Latvia and 99.2 percent of the voters in Lithuania. The resulting peoples assemblies immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union.
In late June 1940, Stalin directed the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, proclaiming this formerly Romanian territory part of the
Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. But in annexing northern Bukovina, Stalin had gone beyond the agreed limits of the secret protocol.
After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Germany, Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Stalin personally wrote to Ribbentrop about entering an agreement regarding a "permanent basis" for their "mutual interests." Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact. At Stalin's direction, Molotov insisted on Soviet interest in Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece, though Stalin had earlier unsuccessfully personally lobbied Turkish leaders to not sign a mutual assistance pact with Britain and France. Ribbentrop asked Molotov to sign another secret protocol with the statement: "The focal point of the territorial aspirations of the Soviet Union would presumably be centered south of the territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean." Molotov took the position that he could not take a "definite stand" on this without Stalin's agreement. Stalin did not agree with the suggested protocol, and negotiations broke down. In response to a later German proposal, Stalin's stated that the Soviets would join the Axis if Germany foreclosed acting in the Soviet's sphere of influence. Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret internal directive related to his plan to invade the Soviet Union.
In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on April 13, 1941, Stalin oversaw the signing of a neutrality pact with the Axis power Japan. While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union.
Hitler breaks the pact.
During the early morning of June 22, 1941, Hitler broke the pact by starting Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Soviet-held territories and the Soviet Union that began the war on the Eastern Front. Before the invasion, Stalin thought that Germany would not attack the Soviet Union until Germany had defeated Britain. At the same time, Soviet generals warned Stalin that Germany had concentrated forces on its borders. Two highly placed Soviet spies in Germany, "Starshina" and "Korsikanets", had sent dozens of reports to Moscow containing evidence of preparation for a German attack. Further warnings came from Richard Sorge, a Soviet spy in Tokyo working undercover as a German journalist.
Seven days before the invasion, a Soviet spy in Berlin warned Stalin that the movement of German divisions to the borders was to wage war on the Soviet Union. Five days before the attack, Stalin received a report from a spy in the German Air Ministry that "all preparations by Germany for an armed attack on the Soviet Union have been completed, and the blow can be expected at any time." In the margin, Stalin wrote to the people's commissar for state security, "you can send your 'source' from the headquarters of German aviation to his mother. This is not a 'source' but a "dezinformator."" Although Stalin increased Soviet western border forces to 2.7 million men and ordered them to expect a possible German invasion, he did not order a full-scale mobilization of forces to prepare for an attack. Stalin felt that a mobilization might provoke Hitler to prematurely begin to wage war against the Soviet Union, which Stalin wanted to delay until 1942 in order to strengthen Soviet forces.
Viktor Suvorov suggested that Stalin had made aggressive preparations beginning in the late 1930s and was preparing to invade Germany in the summer 1941. He believes that Hitler forestalled Stalin and the German invasion was in essence a pre-emptive strike, precisely as Hitler claimed. This theory was supported by Igor Bunich, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov (see "Stalin's Missed Chance") and Edvard Radzinsky (see "Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives"). Other historians, especially Gabriel Gorodetsky and David Glantz, reject this thesis. General Fedor von Boch's diary says that the Abwehr fully expected a Soviet attack against German forces in Poland no later than 1942.
In the initial hours after the German attack began, Stalin hesitated, wanting to ensure that the German attack was sanctioned by Hitler, rather than the unauthorized action of a rogue general. Accounts by Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan claim that, after the invasion, Stalin retreated to his dacha in despair for several days and did not participate in leadership decisions. But, some documentary evidence of orders given by Stalin contradicts these accounts, leading historians such as Roberts to speculate that Khrushchev's account is inaccurate.
In the first three weeks of the invasion, as the Soviet Union tried to defend against large German advances,it suffered 750,000 casualties, and lost 10,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft. In July 1940, Stalin completely reorganized the Soviet military, placing himself directly in charge of several military organizations. This gave him complete control of his country's entire war effort; more control than any other leader in World War II.
A pattern soon emerged where Stalin embraced the Red Army's strategy of conducting multiple offensives, while the Germans overran each of the resulting small, newly gained grounds, dealing the Soviets severe casualties. The most notable example of this was the Battle of Kiev, where over 600,000 Soviet troops were quickly killed, captured or missing.
By the end of 1941, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured 3.0 million Soviet prisoners, 2.0 million of whom died in German captivity by February 1942. German forces had advanced c. 1,700 kilometers, and maintained a linearly-measured front of 3,000 kilometers. The Red Army put up fierce resistance during the war's early stages. Even so, according to Glantz, they were plagued by an ineffective defense doctrine against well-trained and experienced German forces, despite possessing some modern Soviet equipment, such as the KV-1 and T-34 tanks.
Soviets stop the Germans.
While the Germans made huge advances in 1941, killing millions of Soviet soldiers, at Stalin's direction, the Red Army directed sizable resources to prevent the Germans from achieving one of their key strategic goals, the attempted capture of Leningrad. They held the city at the cost of more than a million Soviet soldiers in the region and more than a million civilians, many who died from starvation.
While the Germans pressed forward, Stalin was confident of an eventual Allied victory over Germany. In September 1941, Stalin told British diplomats that he wanted two agreements: 
(1) a mutual assistance/aid pact and (2) a recognition that, after the war, the Soviet Union would gain the territories in countries that it had taken pursuant to its division of Eastern Europe with Hitler in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The British agreed to assistance but refused to agree to the territorial gains, which Stalin accepted months later as the military situation had deteriorated somewhat by mid-1942. In November 1941, Stalin rallied his generals in a speech given underground in Moscow, telling them that the German "blitzkrieg" would fail because of weaknesses in the German rear in Nazi-occupied Europe and the underestimation of the strength of the Red Army, and that the German war effort would crumble against the British-American-Soviet "war engine". On November 6, 1941, Stalin addressed the Soviet Union for the second time (the first was on July 2, 1941).
Correctly calculating that Hitler would direct efforts to capture Moscow, Stalin concentrated his forces to defend the city, including numerous divisions transferred from Soviet eastern sectors after he determined that Japan would not attempt an attack in those areas. By December, Hitler's troops had advanced to within 25 km of the Kremlin in Moscow. On December 5, the Soviets launched a counteroffensive, pushing German troops back c. 80 km from Moscow in what was the first major defeat of the Wehrmacht in the war.
In early 1942, the Soviets began a series of offensives labeled "Stalin's First Strategic Offensives", although there is no evidence that Stalin developed the offensives. The counteroffensive bogged down, in part due to mud from rain in the Spring of 1942. Stalin's attempt to retake Kharkov in the Ukraine ended in the disastrous encirclement of Soviet forces, with over 200,000 Soviet casualties suffered. Stalin attacked the competence of the generals involved. General Georgy Zhukov and others subsequently revealed that some of those generals had wished to remain in a defensive posture in the region, but Stalin and others had pushed for the offensive. Some historians have doubted Zhukov's account.
At the same time, Hitler was worried about American support after their entry into the war following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and a potential Anglo-American invasion on the Western Front in 1942 (which did not occur until the summer of 1944). He changed his primary goal from an immediate victory in the East, to the more long-term goal of securing the southern Soviet Union to protect oil fields vital to the long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals correctly judged the evidence that Hitler would shift his efforts south, Stalin thought it a flanking move in the German attempt to take Moscow. 
The German southern campaign began with a push to capture the Crimea, which ended in disaster for the Red Army. Stalin publicly criticized his generals' leadership. In their southern campaigns, the Germans took 625,000 Red Army prisoners in July and August 1942 alone. At the same time, in a meeting in Moscow, Churchill privately told Stalin that the British and Americans were not yet prepared to make an amphibious landing against a fortified Nazi-held French coast in 1942, and would direct their efforts to invading German-held North Africa. He pledged a campaign of massive strategic bombing, to include German civilian targets.
Estimating that the Russians were "finished," the Germans began another southern operation in the fall of 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad. Hitler insisted upon splitting German southern forces in a simultaneous siege of Stalingrad and an offensive against Baku on the Caspian Sea. Stalin directed his generals to spare no effort to defend Stalingrad. Although the Soviets suffered in excess of 1.1 million casualties at Stalingrad, their victory over German forces, including the encirclement of 290,000 Axis troops, marked a turning point in the war.
Within a year after Barbarossa, Stalin reopened the churches in the Soviet Union. He may have wanted to motivate the majority of the population who had Christian beliefs. By changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, he could engage the Church and its clergy in mobilizing the war effort. On September 4, 1943, Stalin invited the metropolitans Sergius, Alexy and Nikolay to the Kremlin. He proposed to reestablish the Moscow Patriarchate, which had been suspended since 1925, and elect the Patriarch. On September 8, 1943, Metropolitan Sergius was elected Patriarch. One account said that Stalin's reversal followed a sign that he supposedly received from heaven. he wrote that Ilya, Metropolitan of the Lebanon Mountains, claimed to receive a sign from heaven that 
"The churches and monasteries must be reopened throughout the country. Priests must be brought back from imprisonment, Leningrad must not be surrendered, but the sacred icon of Our Lady of Kazan should be carried around the city boundary, taken on to Moscow, where a service should be held, and thence to Stalingrad Tsaritsyn." 
Shortly thereafter, Stalin's attitude changed. Radzinsky wrote: 
"Whatever the reason, after his mysterious retreat, he began making his peace with God. Something happened which no historian has yet written about. On his orders many priests were brought back to the camps. In Leningrad, besieged by the Germans and gradually dying of hunger, the inhabitants were astounded, and uplifted, to see wonder-working icon Our Lady of Kazan brought out into the streets and borne in procession." Radzinsky asked, "Had he seen the light? Had fear made him run to his Father? Had the Marxist God-Man simply decided to exploit belief in God? Or was it all of these things at once?."
Soviet push to Germany.
The Soviets repulsed the important German strategic southern campaign and, although 2.5 million Soviet casualties were suffered in that effort, it permitted to Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front.
In 1943, Stalin ceded to his generals' call for the Soviet Union to take a defensive stance because of disappointing losses after Stalingrad, a lack of reserves for offensive measures and a prediction that the German's would likely next attack a bulge in the Soviet front at Kursk such that defensive preparations there would more efficiently use resources. The Germans did attempt an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets after Hitler canceled the offensive, in part, because of the Allied invasion of Sicily, though the Soviets suffered over 800,000 casualties. Kursk also marked the beginning of a period where Stalin became more willing to listen to the advice of his generals.
By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941-1942. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the East of the front, safe from German invasion and air attack. The strategy paid off, as such industrial increases were able to occur even while the Germans in late 1942 occupied over half of European Russia, including 40% (80 million) of its population, and c. 2,500,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. The Soviets had also prepared for war for over a decade, including preparing 14 million civilians with some military training. Accordingly, while almost all of the original 5 million men of the Soviet army had been wiped out by the end of 1941, the Soviet military had swelled to 8 million members by the end of that year. Despite substantial losses in 1942 far in excess of German losses, Red Army size grew even further, to 11 million. While there is substantial debate whether Stalin helped or hindered these industrial and manpower efforts, Stalin left most economic wartime management decisions in the hands of his economic experts. While some scholars claim that evidence suggests that Stalin considered, and even attempted, negotiating peace with Germany in 1941 and 1942, others find this evidence unconvincing and even fabricated.
In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran. Roosevelt told Stalin that he hoped that Britain and America opening a second front against Germany could initially draw 30-40 German division from the Eastern Front. Stalin and Roosevelt, in effect, ganged up on Churchill by emphasizing the importance of a cross-channel invasion of German-held northern France, while Churchill had always felt that Germany was more vulnerable in the "soft underbelly" of Italy (which the Allies had already invaded) and the Balkans. The parties later agreed that Britain and America would launch a cross-channel invasion of France in May 1944, along with a separate invasion of southern France. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill tabled.
In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in Belorussia against the German Army Group Centre. Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill closely coordinated, such that Bagration occurred at roughly the same time as American and British forces initiation of the invasion of German held Western Europe on France's northern coast. The operation resulted in the Soviets retaking Belorussia and the western Ukraine, along with the successful effective destruction of the Army Group Centre and 300,000 German casualties, though at the cost of over 750,000 Soviet casualties.
Successes at Operation Bagration and in the year that followed were, in large part, due to a weakened Wehrmacht that lacked the fuel and armament they needed to operate effectively, growing Soviet advantages in manpower and materials, and the attacks of Allies on the Western Front. In his 1944 May Day speech, Stalin praised the Western allies for diverting German resources in the Italian Campaign, Tass published detailed lists of the large numbers of supplies coming from Western allies, and Stalin made a speech in November 1944 stating that Allied efforts in the West had already quickly drawn 75 German divisions to defend that region, without which, the Red Army could not yet have driven the Wehrmacht from Soviet territories. The weakened Wehrmacht also helped Soviet offensives because no effective German counter-offensive could be launched,
Beginning in the summer of 1944, a reinforced German Army Centre Group did prevent the Soviets from advancing in around Warsaw for nearly half a year. Some historians claim that the Soviets' failure to advance was a purposeful Soviet stall to allow the Wehrmacht to slaughter members of a Warsaw Uprising by the Polish home army in August 1944 that occurred as the Red Army approached, though others dispute the claim and cite sizable unsuccessful Red Army efforts to attempt to defeat the Wehrmacht in that region. Earlier in 1944, Stalin had insisted that the Soviets would annex the portions of Poland it divided with Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, while the Polish government in exile, which the British insisted must be involved in postwar Poland, demanded that the Polish border be restored to prewar locations. The rift further highlighted Stalin's blatant hostility toward the anti-communist Polish government in exile and their Polish home army, which Stalin felt threatened his plans to create a post-war Poland friendly to the Soviet Union. Further exacerbating the rift was Stalin's refusal to resupply the Polish home army, and his refusal to allow American supply planes to use the necessary Soviet air bases to ferry supplies to the Polish home army, which Stalin referred to in a letter to Roosevelt and Churchill as "power-seeking criminals." Worried about the possible repercussions of those actions, Stalin later began a Soviet supply airdrop to Polish rebels, though most of the supplies ended up in the hands of the Germans. The uprising ended in disaster with 20,000 Polish rebels and up to 200,000 civilians killed by Wehrmacht forces, with Soviet forces entering the city in January 1945.
Other important advances occurred in late 1944, such as the invasion of Romania in August and Bulgaria. The Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria in September 1944 and invaded the country, installing a communist government. Following the invasion of these Balkan countries, Stalin and Churchill met in the fall of 1944, where they agreed upon various percentages for "spheres of influence" in several Balkan states, though the diplomats for neither leader knew what the term actually meant. The Red Army also expelled German forces from Lithuania and Estonia in late 1944 at the cost of 260,000 Soviet casualties.
In late 1944, Soviet forces battled fiercely to capture Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, but could not take it, which became a topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belorussia and the Western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of which resulted in the Red Army advancing from the Vistula river in Poland to the German Oder river in Eastern Germany.
Stalin's shortcomings as strategist are frequently noted regarding massive Soviet loss of life and early Soviet defeats. An example of it is the summer offensive of 1942, which led to even more losses by the Red Army and recapture of initiative by the Germans. Stalin eventually recognized his lack of know-how and relied on his professional generals to conduct the war.
Additionally, Stalin was well aware that other European armies had utterly disintegrated when faced with Nazi military efficacy and responded effectively by subjecting his army to galvanizing terror and nationalist appeals to patriotism. He also appealed to the Russian Orthodox church and images of national Russian people.
Final Victory.
By April 1945, Germany faced its last days with 1.9 million German soldiers in the East fighting 6.4 million Red Army soldiers while 1 million German soldiers in the West battled 4 million Western Allied soldiers. While initial talk existed of a race to Berlin by the Allies, after Stalin successfully lobbied for Eastern Germany to fall within the Soviet "sphere of influence" at Yalta, no plans were made by the Western Allies to seize the city by a ground operation. Stalin still remained suspicious that western Allied forces holding at the Elbe river might move on the capital and, even in the last days, that the Americans might employ their two airborne divisions to capture the city.
Stalin directed the Red Army to move rapidly in a broad front into Germany because he did not believe the Western Allies would hand over territory they occupied, while he made the overriding objective capturing Berlin. After successfully capturing Eastern Prussia, three Red Army fronts converged on the heart of Eastern Germany, with one of the last pitched battles of the war putting the Soviets at the virtual gates of Berlin. By April 24, Berlin was encircled by elements of two Soviet fronts, one of which had begun a massive shelling of the city on April 20 that would not end until the city's surrender. On April 30, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide, after which Soviet forces found their remains, which had been burned at Hitler's directive. German forces surrendered a few days later. Some historians argue that Stalin delayed the last final push for Berlin by two months in order to capture other areas for political reasons, which they argue gave the Wehrmacht time to prepare and increased Soviet casualties (which exceeded 400,000), though this is contested by other historians. Despite the Soviets' possession of Hitler's remains, Stalin did not believe that his old nemesis was actually dead, a belief that remained for years after the war. Stalin also later directed aides to spend years researching and writing a secret book about Hitler's life for his own private reading that reflected Stalin's prejudices, including an absence of criticism of Hitler for his treatment of Jews.
Fending off the German invasion and pressing to victory over Nazi Germany in the World War II required a tremendous sacrifice by the Soviet Union (more than any other country in human history). Soviet military casualties totaled approximately 35 million (official figures 28.2 million) with approximately 14.7 million killed, missing or captured (official figures 11.285 million). Although figures vary, the Soviet civilian death toll probably reached 20 million. Millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians disappeared into German detention camps and slave labor factories, while millions more suffered permanent physical and mental damage. Economic losses, including losses in resources and manufacturing capacity in western Russia and Ukraine, were also catastrophic. The war resulted in the destruction of approximately 70,000 Soviet cities, towns and villages. Destroyed in that process were 6 million houses, 98,000 farms, 32,000 factories, 82,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 6,000 hospitals and thousands of kilometers of roads and railway track.
Questionable tactics.
After taking around 300,000 Polish prisoners in 1939 and early 1940, NKVD officers conducted lengthy interrogations of the prisoners in camps that were, in effect, a selection process to determine who would be killed. On March 5, 1940, pursuant to a note to Stalin from Lavrenty Beria, the members of the Soviet Politburo (including Stalin) signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish POWs, labeled "nationalists and counterrevolutionaries", kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus. This became known as the Katyn massacre. Major-General Vasili M. Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD, personally shot 6,000 of the captured Polish officers in 28 consecutive nights, which remains one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record During his 29 year career Blokhin shot an estimated 50,000 people, making him ostensibly the most prolific official executioner in recorded world history.
Stalin personally told a Polish general requesting information about missing officers that all of the Poles were freed, and that not all could be accounted because the Soviets "lost track" of them in Manchuria. After Polish railroad workers found the mass grave, the Nazis used the massacre to attempt to drive a wedge between Stalin and the other Allies, including bringing in a European commission of investigators from twelve countries to examine the graves. In 1943, as the Soviets prepared to retake Poland, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels correctly guessed that Stalin would attempt to falsely claim that the Germans massacred the victims. As Goebbels predicted, the Soviets had a "commission" investigate the matter, falsely concluding that the Germans had killed the POWs. The Soviets did not admit responsibility until 1990.
On August 16, 1941, in attempts to revive a disorganized Soviet defense system, Stalin issued Order No. 270, demanding any commanders or commissars "tearing away their insignia and deserting or surrendering" to be considered malicious deserters. The order required superiors to shoot these deserters on the spot. Their family members were subjected to arrest. The second provision of the order directed all units fighting in encirclements to use every possibility to fight. The order also required division commanders to demote and, if necessary, even to shoot on the spot those commanders who failed to command the battle directly in the battlefield. Thereafter, Stalin also conducted a purge of several military commanders that were shot for "cowardice" without a trial.
In June 1941, weeks after the German invasion began, Stalin directed that the retreating Red Army also sought to deny resources to the enemy through a scorched earth policy of destroying the infrastructure and food supplies of areas before the Germans could seize them, and that partisans were to be set up in evacuated areas. This, along with abuse by German troops, caused starvation and suffering among the civilian population that were left behind. Stalin feared that Hitler would use disgruntled Soviet citizens to fight his regime, particularly people imprisoned in the Gulags. He thus ordered the NKVD to take care of the situation. They responded by murdering around one hundred thousand political prisoners throughout the western parts of the Soviet Union, with methods that included bayoneting people to death and tossing grenades into crowded cells. Many others were simply deported east.
In July 1942, Stalin issued Order No. 227, directing that any commander or commissar of a regiment, battalion or army, who allowed retreat without permission from his superiors was subject to military tribunal. The order called for soldiers found guilty of disciplinary measures to be forced into "penal battalions", which were sent to the most dangerous sections of the front lines. From 1942 to 1945, 427,910 soldiers were assigned to penal battalions. The order also directed "blocking detachments" to shoot fleeing panicked troops at the rear. In the first two months following the order, over 1,000 troops were shot by blocking units and blocking units sent over 130,000 troops to penal battalions. Despite having some effect initially, this measure proved to have a deteriorating effect on the troops' morale, so by October 1942 the idea of regular blocking units was quietly dropped By 20 November 1944 the blocking units were disbanded officially.
After the capture of Berlin, Soviet troops reportedly raped German women and girls, with total victim estimates ranging from tens of thousands to two million. During and after the occupation of Budapest, (Hungary), an estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped. Regarding rapes that occurred in Yugoslavia, Stalin responded to a Yugoslav partisan leader's complaints saying, "Can't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?"
In former Axis countries, such as Germany, Romania and Hungary, Red Army officers generally viewed cities, villages and farms as being open to pillaging and looting. For example, Red Army soldiers and NKVD members frequently looted transport trains in 1944 and 1945 in Poland and Soviet soldiers set fire to the city centre of Demmin while preventing the inhabitants from extinguishing the blaze, which, along with multiple rapes, played a part in causing over 900 citizens of the city to commit suicide. In the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, when members of the SED reported to Stalin that looting and rapes by Soviet soldiers could result in negative consequences for the future of socialism in post-war East Germany, Stalin reacted angrily: "I shall not tolerate anybody dragging the honour of the Red Army through the mud." Accordingly, all evidence of looting, rapes and destruction by the Red Army was deleted from archives in the Soviet occupation zone.
Stalin's personal military leadership was emphasied as part of the "cult of personality" after the publication of Stalin's ten victories extracted from 6 November 1944 speech "27th anniversary of the Great October socialist revolution" () during the 1944 meeting of the Moscow's Soviet deputies.
According to recent figures, of an estimated four million POWs taken by the Russians, including Germans, Japanese, Hungarians, Romanians and others, some 580,000 never returned, presumably victims of privation or the Gulags, compared with 3.5 million Soviet POW that died in German camps out of the 5.6 million taken.
Soviet POWs and forced laborers who survived German captivity were sent to special "transit" or "filtration" camps meant to determine which were potential traitors. Of the approximately 4 million to be repatriated 2,660,013 were civilians and 1,539,475 were former POWs. Of the total, 2,427,906 were sent home, 801,152 were reconscripted into the armed forces, 608,095 were enrolled in the work battalions of the defense ministry, 272,867 were transferred to the authority of the NKVD for punishment, which meant a transfer to the Gulag system and 89,468 remained in the transit camps as reception personnel until
the repatriation process was finally wound up in the early 1950s.
Homefront.
During the rapid German advances in the early months of the war, nearly reaching the cities of Moscow and Leningrad, the bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain harvests left standing in the fields that would later cause hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asian, Ural, and Siberian regions. In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labour.
The whole of the Soviet Union become dedicated to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was probably better prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to citizens of the USSR because it was fought on Soviet territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over a million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and old people. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionary all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were often so expensive that they could not add substantially to a citizen’s food supply unless that person was especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.
Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied by a belief of protecting their Motherland against the evils of German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of Communist Party propaganda campaign in the Soviet society in order to mobilize the religious elements.
The social composition of Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honors and money benefits if they had a great enough number of children—mothers could earn around 1,300 rubles for having their fourth child and earn up to 5,000 rubles for their tenth.
Survival in Leningrad.
The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during the war, as it was under siege for 900 days, from September 1941-January 1944. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege of Leningrad; civilians lost weight, grew weaker, and became more vulnerable to diseases. Citizens of Leningrad managed to survive through a number of methods with varying degrees of success. Since only four hundred thousand Russians were evacuated before the siege began, this left two and a half million in Leningrad, including four hundred thousand children. More managed to escape the city; this was most successful when Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road—or “road of life”—to safety. 
Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck. One way to do this was by securing factory employment because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the tools of survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers got larger rations than regular civilians and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced crucial goods. Factories also served as mutual-support centers and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horses in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.
Survival opportunities open to the larger Soviet community included bartering and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with Soviet citizens that had extra warm clothes to trade. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens got to keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.
Many of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime as a way to support themselves in trying times. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards, which could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes such as murder and cannibalism also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.

Maxelende Ganade

Maxelende Ganade (born on November 24, 1937) is a Filipino musician, lyricist and composer. She composed the Awit sa Bohol or Bohol Hymn which is the official provincial hymn of the province of Bohol, Philippines.
Biography.
Ganade to started playing the piano while in Grade 3, encouraged by her parents Nicomedes Ganade and Consorcia Bag-ao who are both musicians. She graduated her elementary and high school at Holy Spirit Tagbilaran City. She took Bachelor of Music from the College of the Holy Spirit in Manila and she had rendered performances, helped in musical shows and had written compositions. 
Ganade’s repertoire as an orchestral soloist ranges from the classical repertoire of Mozart and Beethoven to the Romantic literature of Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Schumann and Rachmaninoff to the modern works of Debussy, Ravel, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Bartók.
It was during the administration of then Governor Lino Chatto that the provincial government of Bohol undertook the initiative to formally identify the provincial symbols and seals, including the Bohol flag and hymn.
Justino 'Ning" Romea, a writer of the Bohol Chronicle and composer of the RPC Song (now the UB Hymn) and the Bohol Provincial School of Nursing Hymn, was commissioned to pen the Bohol Provincial Hymn. It was first sung publicly by a female choir of the College of Holy Spirit of Tagbilaran on March 1, 1970 in time for the unfurling of the Bohol Flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1970 East Visayan Athletic Association held in Tagbilaran City.
On September 24, 1970, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 215 adopting it as the official song of the province of Bohol.
As the hymn's original version was in English, the Provincial Board, a few years after, endeavored to have it translated into the vernacular. A competition was launched and the entry of Maxelende Ganade emerged as the best and was adjudged the winner. With some modifications by the Board of Judges in consultation with the authorities in music authorities Mrs. Enriquita Borja-Butalid and Mrs. Maria Fe Rocha-Lumayag, then Division Supervisor and music consultant, the Boholano version was adopted by the Provincial Board in Resolution No. 151 dated September 13, 1974.
While the lyrics and music of the Bohol Hymn (English version) is credited to Romea, the Awit sa Bohol (Boholano version) is largely attributed to Ganade.
Ganade also composed the Carmen hymn and other hymns in school and special affairs. Her arrangement of Pobreng Alindahaw is included in the Loboc Children's Choir...And A Child's Heart Sings album. 
Ganade is teaching piano lessons at the Holy Spirit School in Tagbilaran City, a job she has been doing for many years now.
She can play the province's old pipe organs and marimba during cultural affairs.

This is our land I love, 
The land God gave to me, 
Caressed by the sun, 
Bathed by the sea, 
And kissed by the cool breeze 
Night and day. 
Here’s where the early heroes lived, 
Here’s where they wrought peace 
and here they bled, 
Here rise the marvelous cone-shaped hills, 
Here’s sweet kinampay grows. 
Blessed with white sandy beaches,
Rivers that water valleys,
Seas teem with fishes and cows graze 
on the plains,
In ev’ry home love reigns, 
God keep my homeland always free, 
Let her forever be, 
I pledge my strength, my heart and soul, 
To my dear home, Bohol

Hurricane Kiko (1989)

Hurricane Kiko was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to have hit the eastern coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula during recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August 25. Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day. Strengthening continued until early August 27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600 UTC, the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur. The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August 28, shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean. The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains.
Meteorological history.
Unlike most other eastern Pacific hurricanes between 1988 and 1990 that began as tropical waves off the western coast of Africa, Hurricane Kiko developed out of a large-scale mesoscale convective system on August 23 on the coast of Sonora. The system slowly tracked southward into the Gulf of California and became increasingly organized. Shower and thunderstorm activity was present around an area of low pressure the following day; however, insufficient reports from the region hindered the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) forecasting ability. By August 25, satellite intensity estimates, using the Dvorak technique, indicated that the low had developed into a tropical depression around 1200 UTC, while the storm was located about 115 miles (185 kilometers) south of Mazatlán, Sinaloa. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression; instead it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kiko with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Located within an area with little or no steering current, and situated over warm waters and underneath an upper-level low, conditions were near perfect for rapid intensification, despite the proximity to land. A general northwestward drift was anticipated, and the NHC forecast the storm to reach hurricane intensity within 24 hours.
Convective banding features began to develop late on August 25 as winds around the center reached 50 mph (85 km/h). With the development of an anticyclone over the storm, Kiko's outflow become more pronounced. Around 0600 UTC on August 26, an eye developed within the small circulation, suggesting the cyclone had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. However, satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of only 40 mph (65 km/h). Shortly after, Kiko was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Ships in the vicinity of the hurricane reported tropical storm-force winds extending roughly 50 mi (85 km) from the center. Winds within the eyewall subsequently increased to 115 mph (185 km/h), making Kiko a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Intensification continued for another six hours, ending around 0000 UTC on August 27, at which time the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg).
Around the time of peak intensity, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T6.0, equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h). A trough located to the north of the hurricane began to weaken, causing the storm to track in a more westward direction. Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena, on the southern tip of Baja California, with winds of 115 mph (185 mph). Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to ever make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable recordkeeping began in 1949, with the other being 1967's Hurricane Olivia. Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm, it rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 1800 UTC. Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August 28. Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression, and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800 UTC on August 29; however, its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena.
Preparations and impact.
Around 2100 UTC on August 25, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the Islas Marías and areas between the southern border of Sonora and El Dorado. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Los Burros and the southern tip of Baja California Sur along the Gulf of California. By 0900 UTC the following day, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a warning. Roughly three hours later, the previous hurricane watch issued for Sonora was discontinued as Kiko was no longer forecast to make landfall in the state. The hurricane warning on Baja California was also extended northward to Bahía Concepción. Due to uncertainty in Kiko's track, a hurricane watch was re-issued for Sonora between El Dorado and Los Mochis. Around 0900 UTC on August 27, a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California. The hurricane watch for Sonora was then discontinued. By 1800 UTC, the hurricane warnings on the Gulf Coast of Baja California were replaced by a tropical storm warning which was declared for areas between the southern tip of the peninsula and Bahía Concepción. At this time, the hurricane warning for the Pacific coast was revised to a tropical storm warning. Early on August 28, all watches and warnings were discontinued as Kiko weakened into a tropical depression and moved away from land.
In Baja California Sur, more than 1,300 people evacuated to shelters in La Paz. Flights arriving and departing in the region were canceled or diverted to other airports. The Red Cross prepared shelters in schools, hospitals, and other public buildings throughout the city. On the Islas Marías, an unconfirmed report of sustained winds was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Due to the hurricane's small size, only areas directly in the path of the storm received precipitation; however, a monsoonal outer band on the eastern side of the storm produced widespread rainfall in eastern Mexico. In Sonora, over of rain fell in mountainous areas, while numerous locations recorded at least . In Baja California, the heaviest rainfall was recorded in Los Cabos, and amounted to . Only a small portion of the peninsula received more than of rain. At least 1,000 people were evacuated from heavily damaged areas. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed by Hurricane Kiko. High winds, gusting over , brought down numerous trees and power lines.
Before Kiko's eye moved ashore, the airport near Cabo San Lucas reported sustained winds of with gusts up to . Meteorological recordings near the place of landfall were not available as the small system tracked over a sparsely populated region. From La Paz to Cabo San Lucas, power and water supplies were lost. The heavy rains flooded several highways, and the resultant flood waters overturned a bus. Passengers on the bus managed to escape injury and were quickly brought to shelter by the local fire department. The storm's effects washed out roughly of the San Antonio–San Bartolome highway. The Rancho Leonero Resort in Buena Vista sustained severe roof damage and several docked boats were damaged. Several days after Kiko dissipated, remnant moisture from the storm contributed to a complex weather system that produced torrential rainfall throughout the U.S. state of Kansas, unofficially reaching in localized areas.

SM UB-8

SM "UB-8 was a German Type UB I submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. She was sold to Bulgaria in 1916 and renamed Podvodnik No. 18" (), and was the first ever Bulgarian submarine.
"UB-8" was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-8" was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. "UB-8" was originally one of a pair of UB I boats sent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy to replace an Austrian pair to be sent to the Dardanelles, and was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Pola in March 1915 for reassembly. She was launched and commissioned as SM "UB-8" in the German Imperial Navy in April when the Austrians opted out of the agreement.
Although briefly a part of the Pola Flotilla at commissioning, "UB-8" spent the majority of her German career patrolling the Black Sea as part of the Constantinople Flotilla. The U-boat sank two ships. One of them, , was disguised by the British Admiralty as a Royal Navy battlecruiser as part of a decoy operation. In October, she helped repel a Russian bombardment of Bulgaria.
In May 1916, the submarine was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy as "Podvodnik No. 18" and commissioned in a ceremony that was attended by Crown Prince Boris and Prince Kiril. In Bulgarian service, the submarine patrolled the Bulgarian Black Sea coast and had encounters with Russian vessels on several occasions. After the war ended, the submarine was surrendered to France in February 1919 and scrapped at Bizerta in August 1921. However in July 2011 Viceadmiral Manushev, Commander of the Bulgarian Navy, announced that the submarine, discovered in 2010 at the sea bottom near the town of Varna, is UB-8. Divers discovered manufacturer numbers and according to them the identity is confirmed.
Design and construction.
After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes. "UB-8" was last boat of the initial allotment of eight submarines—numbered from —ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.
"UB-8" was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 4 December. As built, "UB-8" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, "UB-8" was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.
"UB-8" was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. "UB-8"s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.
While "UB-8"s construction neared completion in early March 1915, Enver Pasha and other Turkish leaders were pleading with their German and Austro-Hungarian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions. The Germans induced the Austro-Hungarian Navy () to send two boats—its own Germaniawerft-built boats and —with the promise of and "UB-8" as replacements.
When work on "UB-7" and "UB-8" was complete at the Germaniwerft yard, they were both readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars. The boats were ready for shipment to the main Austrian naval base at Pola on 15 March, despite the fact that the Austrian pair was still not ready. German engineers and technicians that accompanied the German boats to Pola worked under the supervision of Kapitänleutnant Hans Adam, head of the newly created U-boat special command (). Typically, the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks, and, accordingly, "UB-8" was launched at Pola sometime in April.
German career.
During her trials, "UB-8" was assigned the Austrian number of "U-8" and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for "UB-8" to be transferred to the "K.u.K. Kriegsmarine"—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian "U-3" and "U-4" were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.
With the change of heart from the Austrians, Germany resolved to retain "UB-8" and send her to the aid of the Turks. So, the boat was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-8" on 23 April under the command of Kapitänleutnant Ernst von Voigt, a 27-year-old first-time U-boat commander. At commissioning, the boat temporarily joined the Pola Flotilla ().
Because of her limited range, "UB-8" would not have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on 2 May, she was towed by the Austrian cruiser from Pola down the Adriatic and through the Straits of Otranto. The duo continued until spotted by French forces near Kefalonia. "UB-8" slipped the tow and "Novara" raced back into the Adriatic without incident. Two days after her departure, "UB-8" was running on the surface when the stern of the boat suddenly dropped. The watch officer, on the conning tower with the helmsman and a lookout, was able to partially close the hatch before the entire submarine slipped below the waves, depositing the three men in the water. On board the submarine, water continued to pour in through the hatch and the boat was sinking by the stern. Voigt ordered the interior hatch to the control room sealed and all the ballast tanks filled with compressed air to increase buoyancy. The tactic returned "UB-8" to the surface where the boat's diesel engines were restarted. Voigt circled back for the missing crewmen but only the watch officer and helmsman were recovered; the lookout had drowned.
On 29 May 1915, "UB-8" came upon an Allied convoy near Lemnos, and, enticed by the prospect of hitting what he identified as the Royal Navy battlecruiser , Voigt allowed five fully laden transport ships to pass unmolested. When he had a clear shot, Voigt launched one of his torpedoes at the stationary ship and hit it, sending debris into the air. Unfortunately for Voigt and "UB-8", they had in fact torpedoed the British ocean liner , which was a participant in an Admiralty plan to disguise large liners as Royal Navy capital ships. "Merion", which eventually sank on 31 May, had been outfitted with wood and canvas "guns" and overloaded with cement and stones to approximate the profile of "Tiger". There are no reports of any deaths during "Merion"s sinking.
On 4 June, "UB-8" became the first submarine in the new Constantinople Flotilla () based in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). Despite German intentions to use her in the Dardanelles, "UB-8" was ineffective because she was hampered by her limited torpedo supply and her weak engines, which made negotiating the strong currents there nearly impossible. Because of this, "UB-8" was sent to patrol in the Black Sea, where she was active by late July. Off Sevastopol on 31 July, "UB-8" sank her second and final ship, the 1,265-ton Russian ship "Peter Melnikoff".
On 12 August, "UB-8" fired a torpedoe at HMS Manica from 500 yards, which passed under Manica's shallow draught, the submarine was then sighted outside net, two torpedoes fired and missed Manica, which hit the net at an acute angle and burst. An attack two days later on similar vessels was also unsuccessful.
In September, "UB-7" and "UB-8" were sent to Varna, Bulgaria, and from there, to patrol off the Russian Black Sea coast. Because Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers, battleships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and aircraft from the seaplane carriers and began attacks on Varna and the Bulgarian coast on 25 October. "UB-7" and "UB-8", both based out of Varna by this time, sortied to disrupt the bombardment. "UB-8" was never able to launch any attacks, but "UB-7" launched a torpedo at the (most well-known under her former name of "Potemkin"), but it missed. Despite the lack of any success by either submarine, their presence did cause the Russians to break off their attacks and withdraw.
In early 1916, "UB-7" and "UB-8" were still cruising in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans did not have good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw the value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase "UB-7" and "UB-8". Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of "UB-8" to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, "UB-7" remained under the German flag.
Bulgarian career.
Upon acceptance of "UB-8" by the Bulgarian Navy, she was renamed "Podvodnik No. 18" (in Cyrillic: "Пoдвoдник №18"). Although the commissioning ceremony for "Podvodnik No. 18" was kept out of newspapers, it was attended by Crown Prince Boris and his brother Prince Kiril, who both boarded the submarine for a ceremonial first voyage to Euxinograd, the Bulgarian summer palace located just north of Varna. In Bulgarian service, the submarine was armed with a deck gun that supplemented its machine gun.
"Podvodnik No. 18"s first patrol under the Bulgarian flag took place on 4 and 5 July 1916 when she sailed to Cape Shabla and Mangalia. The submarine was used for reconnaissance and coastal defense, and patrolled a regular route. This route was a loop that began in Varna and went northward to Kaliakra, Mangalia, and Constanţa; then southward to Burgas, and Sozopol; then ended at Varna. On 6 September, she had an encounter with the Russian destroyers and , drove off Russian submarines on other occasions, and on 16 December helped turn back a Russian sortie against Balchik. After the Russian withdrawal from World War I in 1917, "Podvodnik No. 18"s activities were greatly reduced.
After the end of the war, "Podvodnik No. 18" was surrendered to the French on 23 February 1919. Towed to Bizerta, she was scrapped after August 1921.

HMS Cerberus (1758)

HMS "Cerberus" was a 28 gun sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. 
She was ordered on 6 May 1757 from the yards of Pleasant Fenn, East Cowes and was laid down on 13 June 1757. She was launched just over a year later on 5 September 1758. 
The "Cerberus" saw action in the American Revolutionary War. One of its first duties was to dispatch generals William Howe, Henry Clinton, and John Burgoyne to Boston after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The American press likened the three generals to the three-headed dog that was the ship's namesake. It provided naval reinforcement at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The ship was the target of an early torpedo attack by David Bushnell's newly developed powder keg torpedoes in 1777. The attack a killed four sailors in a small boat, but did not severely damage the ship.
The "Cerberus" was eventually burnt to prevent being captured by the French on 5 August 1778 during the American War of Independence, in Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island. The remains of the "Cerberus" are now part of a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the "Wreck Sites of HMS "Cerberus" and HMS "Lark"."

A Work of Art

"A Work of Art" is a science fiction short story by James Blish. It was first published in the July 1956 issue of "Science Fiction Stories" with the title "Art Work". It has often been anthologized, appearing in "The Worlds of Science Fiction" and "The Golden Age of Science Fiction", among others.
Plot.
In the year 00 
2161, a new medical specialty has been developed, known as "Mind Sculpting." Human personalities from history are re-created and placed into voluntarily donated physical bodies. Two mind sculptors, Drs. Kris and Seirds, re-create the mind of Richard Strauss and place it in a body. After animation, the "new" Dr Strauss is encouraged to re-commence his life as a composer of music, which he does.
After some difficulty adjusting to the current techniques and theories of musical composition, based largely on random choices on a composition machine, Strauss searches for subjects to inspire him and composes several songs. He then comes across a play by Christopher Fry, "Venus Observed", which he realises is an ideal subject for his music.
Working to a tight deadline, he completes the opera and conducts its premiere. But during the performance, he begins to suspect that something isn't quite right, and finally realises that he's used all the same musical language many times before and that he has nothing left to say musically.
The applause, when it comes, is not for him, but for the mind sculptors, and Strauss realises that it was all an experiment. Before the sculptors pronounce the formulation that will destroy the re-created mind and restore the mind of the donor – a man completely devoid of musical ability – he feels the satisfaction that the sculptors will never know that the music lacked any spark of genius: "the 'Strauss' had created was as empty of genius as a hollow gourd." His final regret is that he will not now be able to set to music "Personae", a poem by Ezra Pound appropriate to the occasion that he had just discovered.
Commentary.
In "The Worlds of Science Fiction", James Blish writes:
Ostensibly this is a story about the future of serious music, but actually it proposes no novelties in that field. Its real subject is the creative process itself ... The story adopts a radical scientific assumption in order to make a philosophical and emotional point that could have been made in no other way.

Boat Mail

The Boat Mail was a combined train and steamer ferry service between India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Connecting Chennai and Colombo, the system initially utilised a rail-to-sea operation, but changed to a rail-to-sea-to-rail operation. Passengers could buy a single ticket for the journey.
History.
Tuticorin-Colombo era.
In the late 19th century, the railway portion of the route within India was from Madras (Chennai) to Tuticorin. At Tuticorin, passengers embarked on the boat mail steamer to Colombo in Ceylon. The train took 21 hours and 50 minutes for the journey from Madras to Tuticorin. The Boat Mail was one of the early trains to be given vestibuled carriages, in 1898.
Dhanushkodi-Talaimannar era.
In 1914, after the Pamban bridge was built, the train's route changed and it went from Madras to Dhanushkodi. A much shorter ferry service then took the passengers to Talaimannar in Ceylon, from where another train went to Colombo. The 35-kilometre long ferry journey was considerably shorter than the 270-kilometre long Tuticorin-Colombo route.
Post cyclone.
In 1964 a passenger train was washed into the sea by huge waves during the 1964 cyclone, when nearing Dhanushkodi. The railway tracks and the pier at Dhanushkodi were also destroyed. Following this, the Indian portion of the train service now only operates up to Rameswaram, while the ferry service to Talaimannar has since been discontinued.
Alternative Proposals.
At one time the South Indian Railway considered constructing a bridge 12 miles (19 km) long across the shallow waters and sand shoals and reefs known as Rama Sethu (Adam's Bridge) between India and Sri Lanka. However, this plan was shelved when World War I broke out.
