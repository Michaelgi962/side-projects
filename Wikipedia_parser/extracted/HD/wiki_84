János Jacobinus

János Jacobinus (1574 – 17 July 1603) was a Hungarian politician and historian of Saxon origin in the Principality of Transylvania, who served as Chancellor of Transylvania for a short time in 1603.
Career.
He was the son of Bernát Jacobinus, a prestigious citizen of Kolozsvár (today: "Cluj-Napoca, Romania"). After finishing studies, he became notary of his birthplace between 1592 and 1598. He participated in the Wallachian Campaign of 1595 against Sinan Pasha. He described the events in detail and reliability. He served as secretary for Princes Sigismund Báthory, Andrew Báthory and Michael the Brave since May 1598.
In September 1600, he defected from Michael to the insurgent nobles. He became the secretary of the Transylvanian Chancellery after Sigismund Báthory retake his throne. In this capacity, he, probably, controlled the domestic policy of Transylvania around that time, when the position of Chancellor remained vacant. He joined to Mózes Székely in April 1603 who appointed him as Chancellor. Several months later, he died in the battle of Brassó (today: "Brașov, Romania") along with his lord against Radu Şerban, ruler of Wallachia.
For a short time, he was the owner of the Wolphard–Kakas House, an important Renaissance monument on the Main square of Kolozsvár. General István Csáky gave him the house for his services. However the original owner, István Kakas, a diplomat and traveler sued back that from Jacobinus.

Incredible Edible Todmorden project

The Incredible Edible Todmorden project is an urban gardening project started in 2008 by Pamela Warhurst, Mary Clear and a group of like minded people in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, England. The project aims bring people together and through actions around local food, help change behaviour toward the environment and build a kinder and more resilient world.
Since its conception, the Incredible Edible ethos has been taken up by communities all over the world where local people are coming together in their own time to turn unloved pieces of land into community gardens growing food to share, and there are now more than twenty other 'Incredible Edible' towns following the lead of Yorkshire's Todmorden.
"At first, we had trouble getting people to help themselves, because we're from a country where people say, 'Get off my land', so we had to tell people it was OK ... nearly 50% said it had had a positive impact on their income." -- Mary Clear
In 2009, Prince Charles visited the Incredible Edible Todmorden project in support.

Port of Pensacola

The Port of Pensacola is an operational deep-water port located on Pensacola Bay. With origins dating back to 1743, it is now one of the City of Pensacola's Enterprise Operations, having been incorporated in 1943 as the Municipal Port Authority. 
The present-day Port of Pensacola occupies approximately 50 acres of landfill at the southern terminus of Barracks Street in downtown Pensacola, on the site of the former Commendencia Street and Tarragona Street wharves. The Port has eight berths, 265,000 square feet of warehouse space, and on-dock rail service. 
The importance of Pensacola as a port city declined significantly over the latter half of the 20th century with the introduction of containerization to the shipping industry. Other Gulf ports such as New Orleans, Mobile, and Tampa, which can handle containerized traffic, have eclipsed the Port of Pensacola, which cannot. The decline in traffic has resulted in significant, sustained financial losses for the Port. Accordingly, the future of the Port has become a political issue, with groups such as Take Back the Port advocating its closure.
History.
The first recorded export of commercial cargo from Pensacola, a shipment of pine and pitch products, took place in 1743. Pensacola's first private commercial dock was built in 1784. 
This 1940 aerial view of Pensacola's waterfront illustrates how Pensacola's port facilities looked in the first half of the 20th century, with Commendencia Street, Tarragona Street and Muscogee wharves intact.In the early 1940s, the Pensacola Exchange Club hosted a forum called the "Civic Roundtable," where representatives from Rotary, Lions Club, Kiwanis, the Chamber, the Jaycees and others would meet to discuss business issues, among them the port, which was enjoying a wartime resurgence. The group pressed State Representative Dave Thomas to introduce a bill in the Florida legislature creating the Municipal Port Authority in the spring term of 1943. Its members were initially appointed by state senator and included J. D. Johnson, Henry Hilton-Green, Calvin L. Todd, William S. Rosasco, W. V. Fauria, Morris Levy, J. H. McCormack, J. W. Smith, Jr., Charles W. Smith, J. H. Allen and R. H. Turner, Jr. (Later members would be appointed by the Pensacola City Council, which also approved annual funding to the Port Authority, as it had no taxing authority of its own.) The group first convened on July 7, 1943 in Council's chambers.
Improvements.
In 2012 Mayor Ashton Hayward announced that the city will be given more than US$3.61 million to the Port of Pensacola for improvement. Many people criticized this act as a huge problem for Pensacola's economy.

Pemberton-Billing P.B.1

The Pemberton-Billing P.B.1, sometimes known as the "Supermarine", was a 1910s British single-seat flying-boat built by Pemberton-Billing Limited, which later became the Supermarine Aviation Works. Only one P.B.1 was built, and it never flew any distance further than a hop.
Design and development.
The P.B.1 was a single-seat open cockpit biplane powered by a 50 hp (36 kW) Gnome rotary engine driving a three-bladed pusher propeller, which was mounted in a tractor configuration nacelle between the upper wings and the fuselage. It had a single-step hull designed by the naval architect Linton Hope, with a spruce skin over a mahogony structure, and covered with waterproof fabric. It had two-bay wings constructed of spruce and Ash, with ailerons on the upper wing and floats under the lower wingtips. The pilot sat in a cockpit aft of the wing trailing edge. 
Described as "a boat that will fly, of an aeroplane that will float", only one P.B.1 was built; the prototype was displayed at the Olympia Aero Show in March 1914. It was rebuilt during April 1914, with the pilot's cockpit moved forward to the nose of the aircraft, and the Gnome engine mounted on top of the fuselage, driving two 3-bladed pusher propellers via chain drives. Following the modifications, the P.B.1 entered testing, but failed to achieve flight during testing on Southampton Water on 30 May 1914. Noel Pemberton Billing, the head of Pemberton-Billing Limited and designer of the PB.1, claimed that the aircraft made a short hop during June, but other sources state that the PB.1 never flew. 
Following the conclusion of the attempted flight testing, the P.B.1 was dismantled on 28 July 1914, with its engine being used in the Pemberton-Billing P.B.9 single seat scout aircraft.

Justin Tucker

Justin Paul Tucker (born November 21, 1989) is an American football placekicker for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He played college football at the University of Texas. He graduated from Westlake High School, near Austin. On January 3, 2014, Tucker was named 1st team All-Pro. 
College career.
Tucker played college football at the University of Texas. In 2011, concluding a 118 game rivalry with Texas A&M University and The University of Texas, Tucker kicked the game winning field goal as time expired. Texas (then ranked #25) won, 27-25. He played in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.
Professional career.
Baltimore Ravens.
An undrafted free agent in the 2012 NFL Draft, Tucker was not selected by any of the 32 teams. However, the Baltimore Ravens signed him on May 29, 2012 to begin workouts and camp for the Ravens alongside placekicker Billy Cundiff. After impressive showings and accurate field goals during the team's preseason games, Tucker earned the starting job as the Ravens official placekicker upon Cundiff's release from his contract with Baltimore on August 26, 2012.
In his debut season, Tucker proved to be a very accurate kicker, making all 42 of his PAT attempts while missing only 3 out of his 35 Field Goals. During Week 3 against the New England Patriots, Tucker kicked a game winning field goal with 2 seconds left, giving the Ravens a 31-30 victory and their first ever Regular Season victory over the Patriots.
On January 12, 2013, during the divisional playoff round game against the Denver Broncos, Tucker kicked a 47-yard field goal in double-overtime to win the game (later known as the Mile High Miracle) and sent the Ravens to the AFC championship for the second consecutive year. During the 2nd quarter of Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers, Tucker failed in converting the first fake field goal attempt in Super Bowl history, coming up just one yard short of the nine needed for the first down. Nonetheless, the Ravens went on to win the game, giving Tucker his first Super Bowl ring.
The following 2013 season, despite missing two field goals in Week 2 against the Cleveland Browns, Tucker continued his success as an accurate kicker for the Ravens. He kicked the game winning field goal in overtime against the Cincinnati Bengals, letting the Ravens win 20-17. Tucker was then named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for November. On Thanksgiving, Tucker kicked five field goals en route to the Ravens 22-20 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was also selected as the player of the game along with Jacoby Jones by John Madden. He brought his holder, Sam Koch and long snapper, Morgan Cox, to accept the award on screen with him.
Tucker kicked a franchise record-tying six field goals that were the Ravens' only points in an 18-16 win against the Detroit Lions in a Monday Night Football game at Ford Field in Detroit on December 16, including a personal (and franchise) record 61-yard field goal in the last minute to seal the victory. During the game, Tucker became the first NFL kicker to kick a field goal in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s in the same game. Tucker's 61 yard field goal also set the NFL record for longest field goal in a domed stadium. Tucker was elected to his first Pro Bowl to end the 2013 season. He was also voted 1st team All-Pro by AP voters.
Personal.
Tucker is a practicing Roman Catholic and makes the sign of the cross before every kick.
He is currently engaged to girlfriend Amanda.

Hydroentanglement

Hydroentanglement is a bonding process for wet or dry fibrous webs made by either carding, airlaying or wet-laying, the resulting bonded fabric being a nonwoven. It uses fine, high pressure jets of water which penetrate the web, hit the conveyor belt (or "wire" as in papermaking conveyor) and bounce back causing the fibres to entangle.
Hydroentanglement is sometimes known as spunlacing, this term arising because the early nonwovens were entangled on conveyors with a patterned weave which gave the nonwovens a lacy appearance. It can also be regarded as a two-dimensional equivalent of spinning fibres into yarns prior to weaving. The water pressure has a direct bearing on the strength of the web, and very high pressures not only entangle but can also split fibres into micro- and nano-fibres which give the resulting hydroentangled nonwoven a leatherlike or even silky texture. This type of nonwoven can be as strong and tough as woven fabrics made from the same fibres.

In a memorial, four of his colleagues wrote that Wilson:
was a tall, slim grey-haired eminence, always properly clad in his long, white coat while at work. His favored mode of transportation . . . was his old black bicycle, which he rode daily, in fair weather and foul, bundled up in cold weather with scarf, gloves, warm coat and ear muffs.

In 1970, Wilson became acting vice president and dean of the medical school. Of that year, his colleagues wrote:
This was a time of campus unrest nationwide. . . . Activities of the protestors affected the very fabric of the University, including attempts to shut down the hospital. Only one person remained calm throughout[,] and that was John L. Wilson. . . . He refused to be intimidated or pressured at the negotiating table, even when the leader of the protest placed a loaded Colt 45 on the table.
From 1971 to 1985, Wilson was associate dean for faculty affairs, retiring from active university life in the latter year, but returning for a one-year stint in 1987 as acting chief of staff at Stanford University Hospital. In that year he received the Alwin C. Rambar Award for "excellence and compassion in patient care and in dealing with all members of the Hospital community."
Wilson's last endeavor was in writing a 1,500-page manuscript on "Stanford University School of Medicine and the Predecessor Schools: A Historical Perspective," which was published online.

The Crow Canyon Archaeological Center near Cortez, Colorado, in the heart of the Mesa Verde, has been conducting research in the region since 1982.
Although the Mesa Verde National Park contains the largest and best known ruins of the Pueblo peoples, there are many other community centers in the central Mesa Verde region dating to the period between 1050 and 1290 AD. This is a huge area covering over .
Over 130 centers containing fifty or more residential structures have been identified in the central region, many of which have yet to be examined in any detail.
A small portion of the Mesa Verde to the southeast of Cortez, Colorado contains the Mesa Verde National Park, which protects almost 5,000 archaeological sites, including 600 cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples who lived in the area between 600 and 1300 AD.
Other parks in the Mesa Verde from west to east include the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Natural Bridges National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, Yucca House National Monument and Aztec Ruins National Monument.

Just Be (Paloma Faith song)

"Just Be" is a song by British singer-songwriter Paloma Faith from her second studio album "Fall to Grace". It was released on 16 December 2012 by RCA Records as the fourth single from the album. Written by Faith, Greg Wells and Matt Hales, "Just Be" is a "love song for real lovers". One critic called it an honest portrait of the highs and lows of relationships. "Just Be" reached Number 66 in the UK Singles Chart, three months before it was released. The official music video was released on 5 November 2012 and features Faith in a love affair with a man in New York City. 
Background.
"Just Be" was written by Faith along with Greg Wells and Matt Hales. It was co-produced by Nellee Hooper and Jake Gosling. It was released by RCA Records on 16 December 2012. Explaining the meaning of the song, Faith stated "It's supposed to be a realistic love song for real lovers. It's saying, 'He gets on my nerves, but I love him.' I find that more endearing than, 'There's no one out there but him.' That seems naive. I have a lot of admiration for people who've been in relationships a long time, married for years. This is a more knowing take on romance." "Just Be" was used by ITV as the soundtrack to their New Season Drama trailer.
Reception.
Critical response.
During his review of "Fall to Grace", Digital Spy's Robert Copsey called "Just Be" a ballad that is "packed to the brim with old glamour." Copsey later gave the song five stars and stated that the song "strips back the usual grandiose production" and allows Faith's "rich and velvety voice to come to the fore". He added "The result is soul-pop perfection that, if we had it our way, would be topping the charts this Christmas." Trent Maynard from 4Music said "The song is an honest and moving portrait of the highs and lows of love and relationships." Perez Hilton commented that the song is "gorgeous", before adding "A power ballad that grabs you instantly by the heartstrings and doesn't let go till the song is over! No gimmicks here! Just a piano, a special voice, beautiful melodies and meaningful lyrics!" Mark Blankenship from Newnownext.com revealed that "Just Be" was his favourite Faith song, saying it is "a torchy ballad with some delicious theatrical touches. In the first chorus, my girl actually shushes her man! But because a true diva knows the importance of restraint, she doesn't repeat that shushing until the very end of the song. Twice is enough, y'all. She has made her point. And besides, that frees her up to growl like a wounded love tiger."
Chart performance.
In early September 2012, "Just Be" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 66.
Music video.
The accompanying music video, directed by Emil Nava, was released on 5 November 2012. It was shot in black and white and on location in New York City. The video shows Faith in a tempestuous love affair with a man. Faith's lover is played by James Kelly, the same actor who previously appeared as her love interest in the videos for "Picking Up the Pieces, "30 Minute Love Affair" and "Never Tear Us Apart. Faith and Kelly act out "a passionate love scene", during which Kelly removes her dress. Other scenes see the singer performing the track while she is naked in an empty room. She sits on the floor hugging her knees to protect her modesty. Grace Carroll from Gigwise commented "Paloma Faith is no stranger to odd antics, so her choice to strip off - and sit on a bare wood floor - in her latest video is definitely one of the least strange things she's done."
Live performances.
To promote "Fall to Grace", Faith performed "Just Be" on "Later... with Jools Holland" in May 2012. Viewers voted it the second best performance of the night during a poll on "The Guardian's" website. Faith included "Just Be" in her set for her performances at Somerset House in July. In August, Faith filmed and released an acoustic performance of the song. The following month, she included "Just Be" in her set list for BBC Radio 2's Live in Hyde Park concert.

Rosemary Rice

Rosemary Rice (May 3, 1925 – August 14, 2012) was an American actress, singer, and voice-over artist. Rice was best known for her role as Katrin Hansen, the oldest daughter in the television series, "Mama", which aired on CBS from 1949 to 1957. She provided the opening voice narration for "Mama" through her character.
Biography.
Personal life.
Rice was born to Albert and Laura (née Rogers) Rice in Montclair, New Jersey, on May 3, 1925. She married John B. Merrell, in 1954; the couple had two children.
Early career and Broadway.
Rice's acting career began during junior high student in Montclair, when she was cast in her first Broadway production, later attending New York's Professional Children's School. She appeared in twelve plays and musicals on Broadway. Her Broadway credits included the 1943 production of "The Naked Genius", a play written by Gypsy Rose Lee, as well as "Dear Ruth" and "Junior Miss".
Radio.
She enjoyed an active career in radio, appearing in mysteries, comedies and soap operas. Her best known role was as "Betty Cooper" in the Archie Andrews radio series. Other radio credits included "CBS Radio Mystery Theater", "NBC Playhouse", "Calvacade of America", "Playhouse 90", "When a Girl Marries", "My True Story", "Westinghouse Studio One", "Young Doctor Malone", and "Let's Pretend".
"Mama".
In 1949, CBS debuted "Mama", an early, live television series adapted from "Mama's Bank Account", a book written by Kathryn Forbes. The series, which was set in San Francisco, California, in the early 20th Century, centered on the life of a Norwegian American family. The show, which aired from 1949 to 1957, was originally broadcast live from a television studio located above the Oyster Bar in Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal.
Rice was cast as Katrin Hansen, the family's oldest daughter. Rice opened each episode by showing and narrating a family photo album with the television audience, always ending the scene with the phrase, "But most of all, I remember Mama." Veteran actress Peggy Wood starred as her Katrin's mother, Marta Hansen. Judson Laire appeared as the father, Lars Hansen, while Dick Van Patten was cast as the younger brother, Nels, and Robin Morgan as the younger sister, Dagmar. Rice described the cast, which spent five days a week working together, as very close, explaining to the "New York Times" that she called Judson Laire "Papa" until he died in 1979.
"Mama" was filmed using kinescopes. Rice kept some kinescopes from the production, though most of the machines have been destroyed or thrown away, along with many of the "Mama" episodes. In 1985, Rice donated her kinescopes to the The Museum of Broadcasting, now called the Paley Center for Media, for exhibition of surviving "Mama" episodes. She appeared at "Mama" reunions and fan gatherings throughout her life. 
She continued to work in guest spots on series and television commercials. Additional television credits included roles or appearances on "Kraft Television Theatre", "The Mike Douglas Show", "One Life to Live", "Playhouse 90", "Search for Tomorrow", "The Edge of Night", and Dave Garroway.
Children's music.
Additionally, Rice wrote, sung and narrated fifteen children's albums during her career. She released nine albums through Columbia Records and six albums on the RCA label. Rice won a Grammy Award for one of her albums from Columbia Records.
Commercial work.
Rice also worked in several dozen radio and television commercials, both on camera and through voice-over work. She became a familiar voice to consumers of Clairol products by recording the ad slogan, "If I've only one life to live, let me live it as a blonde!" Her other campaigns included Johnson & Johnson. Her work in the advertising industry earned her three Clio Awards. She provided the voice for the Bell Telephone exhibit at the 1964 New York World's Fair in 1964 and 1965.
Audio books.
Later in life, Rice recorded the books-on-tape narrations for Caedmon Audio. She provided the narration for more than twenty textbooks published by Allyn & Bacon of Boston. She narrated nine audio books for The American Girl Collection, a line of books which accompany the popular American Girl dolls.
Awards.
In addition to the Grammy Award for her children's album and the three Clio Awards, Rice also won one Emmy Award and three Peabody Awards.
Later life.
Rice was a longtime resident of New Canaan, Connecticut, before moving to nearby Stamford, where she died from a heart attack on August 14, 2012, aged 87. She was survived by her daughter, Mrs. Marcie Schonborn; her son, John Merrell, as well as a brother and three grandchildren.

Cantabrigian Rowing Club

Cantabrigian Rowing Club, known as Cantabs, is a rowing club in Cambridge.
History.
Cantabs was founded in 1950 as a rowing club for the old boys of the Hills Road Sixth Form College, then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys. It first accepted general membership in the 1960s and has been an open club since. The club is affiliated to the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association and British Rowing.
The club is currently one of the fastest on the River Cam, holding the Mens Headship in the Town Bumps for five of the last six years and currently second on the river in the Women's races. The club has qualified at least one boat for Henley Royal Regatta in the majority of the last decade and in 2012 the Mens senior squad qualified two eights for the Thames Challenge Cup, a first for any Cambridge town club. In addition, there has been substantial individual success, with John Hale winning silver in the lightweight sculls at the 2012 British Rowing Championships before representing England in the lightweight double at the Home International Regatta and Charlie Palmer reaching the finals of the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 2005 and 2006.
The club runs the Cambridge Winter Head every November, an event that can attract over a thousand competitors.
Facilities.
The club is based out of its own boathouse in Chesterton on the banks of the River Cam. The current boathouse has rooms for weights and ergs and rack space for the men's squads. The club also makes significant use of the CRA boathouse in Cambridge.
A new boathouse is under construction that will allow both sides of the club to be reunited and to provide additional facilities that the current boathouse lacks such as dedicated changing rooms and a kitchen. Financial support for this development includes Olympic legacy funding from Sport England’s Inspired Facilities Fund.

<doc id="36833944" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36833944" title="Christchurch mayoral election, 2013">
Christchurch mayoral election, 2013

The 2013 Christchurch mayoral election was part of the New Zealand local elections and was won by former MP Lianne Dalziel. The elections were held on 12 October 2013 for the Mayor of Christchurch plus other local government roles.
Incumbent Bob Parker announced 14 months prior to the election that he would seek a third term as mayor. There was much speculation for many months over who would challenge Parker. Dalziel's name was persistently mentioned, but she denied any interest, declaring instead that the job that she really wanted is Gerry Brownlee's as Earthquake Recovery Minister, rather than Bob Parker's. Three first term councillors were also rumoured, with Tim Carter seen as the most likely to come forward. In April 2013, Christchurch's main newspaper, "The Press", announced that Dalziel would stand, having asked Student Volunteer Army organiser Sam Johnson to be her running mate. This caused surprise since Dalziel and Johnson are from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but he declined the invitation anyway. It was not until mid June that Dalziel confirmed her candidacy. At the same time, serious problems developed at Christchurch City Council (CCC) over building consent issues, which led to Parker withdrawing his candidacy and council's chief executive, Tony Marryatt, losing his job. In early August, central city retail manager Paul Lonsdale announced his candidacy and was immediately credited by "The Press" as the most viable alternative to Dalziel, but senior journalist Lois Cairns predicted the following day that Lonsdale "will come in a distant second". Dalziel, the former Labour Party MP for Christchurch East and up to the election the representative of the Christchurch East electorate, had been in Parliament since and was considered the top favourite. Of the remaining ten candidates, "The Press" labelled them a mixture of eccentrics, tryers and also-rans.
Dalziel won the election with nearly a 50,000 votes margin and a majority of 48%, with Lonsdale receiving nearly 23,000 votes. Lonsdale also stood for a position as city councillor and was successful on that front. The third placed mayoral candidate received a mere 1,000 votes. Dalziel and the new council were sworn in on 24 October.
Candidates.
Since the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, there were persistent rumours that Labour Party MP Lianne Dalziel would contest the 2013 Christchurch mayoralty. Dalziel had first been elected to Parliament in the , representing first Christchurch Central and since the Christchurch East electorate. In May 2012, Dalziel tried to put an end to the rumours by announcing: "The job I really want is Gerry Brownlee's, rather than Bob Parker's. Brownlee is Earthquake Recovery Minister, whilst Parker is the current Mayor of Christchurch.
In August, Parker announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. Due to the controversy caused during his mayoralty, the general expectation had been that he would not seek re-election. There was confidence in the neighbouring areas that Selwyn District and Waimakariri District Councils had responded well to the earthquakes, but the same could not be said for Christchurch City Council (CCC). Former National Party cabinet minister Philip Burdon called Christchurch Council's response a "dysfunctional failure". CCC had commissioned an external communications review in 2012, which found that the council was seen as having a "can't do attitude", and that it was commonly agreed that the organisation was not customer focussed. The report concluded:
Christchurch City Council is an isolated "fortress" which is "culturally reluctant" to communicate openly with its city's inhabitants
At the time of Parker's announcement, the main Christchurch newspaper, "The Press", published a list of other likely candidates. Dalziel was understood to be backing prominent businessman Humphry Rolleston. Rolleston was on the board of several companies that were listed on the stock exchange and until 2004 had been in business with Allan Hubbard.
In the second half of the year, former mayor Garry Moore actively sought media exposure and when asked about his career aspirations replied: "I spent 15 years of my life on the council and it worries me where democracy is heading in Christchurch." "The Press" listed three sitting councillors who had possible mayoral aspirations: Peter Beck, Tim Carter, and Glenn Livingstone. All three were in their first term, with Beck first elected in a February 2012 by-election. In a follow-up article in November, "The Press" added Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce chief executive Peter Townsend and radio host Mike Yardley to the list of potential mayoral candidates.
In the February 2013 reshuffle of opposition portfolios, Dalziel dropped out of the top 20; only the first 20 positions are ranked by the Labour Party. An editorial in "The Press" speculated that she might reconsider her political future:
The demotion is bound to concentrate Dalziel's mind on whether she should run for the Christchurch mayoralty. As things stand, a place for her in a Labour cabinet as minister for the earthquake recovery looks unlikely, but she would be a strong candidate for mayor.
By March, Parker was still the only person who had declared their candidacy. An editorial in "The Press" discussed two possible opponents: Tim Carter and Lianne Dalziel. Carter is from Christchurch's richest family, with his father Philip topping the local rich-list, and there has been a long-running political interest in his family. Philip Carter was a Christchurch city councillor from 1989 to 1995, David Carter, a brother of Philip Carter, is the current Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, and their father Maurice Carter was a Christchurch city councillor from 1956 to 1989.
On 10 April, Carter was hosted by "The Press" for a livechat event, where questions put to Carter by readers were answered online by him. Whilst Carter said that he would only make a decision whether to stand in the coming weeks, the newspaper commented that his answers were campaign-style, that he used "fait accompli-language", and that he had "launched a pre-election broadside at mayoral incumbent Bob Parker".
"The Press" reported on 20 April that Lianne Dalziel will challenge Parker for the mayoralty, and that she had asked Student Volunteer Army organiser Sam Johnson to be her running mate, with a view of Johnson becoming deputy mayor. The newspaper expressed surprise by this pairing, given that Dalziel is a Labour Party member, and Johnson is a member of the Young Nats, the youth arm of the National Party. Johnson declined the invitation, and Dalziel maintained that she was not yet committed to standing, saying that it required the right team to be formed.
Carter announced on 24 April that he would not contest the mayoralty, but that he would endorse Dalziel instead. This followed several meetings between him and Dalziel that "left him convinced she was the best person for the job". Dalziel, meanwhile, had still not confirmed that she would stand in the election. Carter reiterated in mid-July that he would not stand for the mayoralty, and announced that he may indeed retire from the city council altogether. Vicki Buck and Garry Moore, the only two ex-mayors alive, were reported in early June as both considering running as councillors in the local elections, but both ruled out standing for the mayoralty; Buck also ruled out standing for the deputy-mayoralty. Buck confirmed that she had been meeting regularly with Dalziel, and Moore commented of Dalziel announcing her mayoralty bid as "reasonably high". Moore and Buck both expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the current council, with Moore saying:
Vicki and I have been sitting weeping into our coffees for the last couple of years. We have looked at all our hard work and thought: 'My God, what's happening?' This is not a place for show ponies, it's a time for carefully thought through strategic thinking.
Moore's comment was a swipe at Parker, who is by many referred to as a "show pony". Parker, meanwhile, was rumoured by "The Sunday Star-Times" to retire at the end of the term, which he immediately denied.
On 19 June, Dalziel formally confirmed that she would contest the mayoralty, also announcing that she would resign from Parliament with effect from the day prior to the mayoral election, which would cause a by-election in the Christchurch East electorate. Dalziel stated that she would not run for Labour, but that she would contest the election as an Independent. Despite Dalziel's earlier claims that she had to form a strong team first before she would stand, she declared that she would not form a team and did not have a 'running mate', i.e. deputy mayor.
After a troublesome period starting in mid-June, Christchurch City Council lost its accreditation with International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) for issuing building consents, and council's CEO, Tony Marryatt, was placed on indefinite leave on 3 July. On Friday morning, 5 July 2013, "The Press" was working on a feature article for the first opinion poll and phoned Parker and Dalziel for their reactions on the 30% and 70% respective poll results. Later that afternoon, Parker gave an exclusive interview to John Campbell in which he announced that he would not stand for re-election. The interview was screened on "Campbell Live" that evening.
On 1 August, Hugo Kristinsson joined the mayoralty contest. He was an IT specialist from Iceland who came to Christchurch in 1995.
On 9 August, Christchurch businessman Paul Lonsdale announced his candidacy for a position as councillor in the Hagley-Ferrymead ward, and as mayor. Lonsdale was regarded by the local paper, "The Press", as "the most viable alternative yet to Lianne Dalziel" and was endorsed by Parker for his "many fine qualities". Lonsdale was best known as the driving force behind the Re:Start Mall project, and was previously the manager of Riccarton Mall. Lonsdale works closely with property developer Antony Gough, who is the current chairman of the Central City Business Association, and Gough's preference was for Lonsdale to only contest a city council position, as Dalziel "is the frontrunner by a country mile". In an opinion piece, senior journalist Lois Cairns credited Lonsdale as the person with the best name recognition yet who can challenge Dalziel, but that he was not likely to be able to keep up with her campaign: "In all likelihood Lonsdale will come in a distant second." "The Press" asked candidates about their five key issues, to which 10 of the 12 nominated candidates replied. In a commentary, the newspaper stated:
With sitting Mayor Bob Parker out of the contention, the contest is effectively Lianne Dalziel's to lose. She faces some competition in the form of prominent business figure Paul Lonsdale, but the other 10 candidates are a mixture of eccentrics, tryers and also-rans.
List of candidates.
When nominations closed, there were twelve candidates for the Christchurch mayoralty:
Campaign.
On 19 September, six of the candidates held an open-air forum on the corner of Fitzgerald Avenue and Ferry Road. It was organised by Wakeman, Anderson, and Tindall over concerns that the lesser candidates do not receive enough attention from the media. In addition to the organisers, Cattermole, Kristinsson, and Maxwell attended in front of 20 members of the public.
On 23 September, "The Press" editor Joanna Norris moderated a debate between the two top candidates, Dalziel and Lonsdale, at the Cardboard Cathedral. The sold-out event was attended by 450 members of the public.
On 25 September, the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce hosted Dalziel and Lonsdale to address about 50 of their members. There was much common ground between the speakers, and both advocated closer ties to neighbouring councils Selwyn, Waimakariri, and Hurunui, with Lonsdale suggesting that conversations about an Auckland-style "super city" should be had.
On 3 October, eight of the candidates participated in a debate at the University of Canterbury, organised by the university's political science club and moderated by the political science lecturer, Lindsey MacDonald. About fifty people attended the debate.
Opinion polls.
"The Press" published its first opinion poll on 6 July, but as the main event of the day was Parker's announcement to withdraw from the race, more detailed results were only published two days later on 8 July. Of the decided voters, 70% supported Dalziel and 30% supported Parker. 32% of those polled had yet to decide whom to vote for. The survey work was carried out between 30 June and 3 July, and the poll had a margin of error of 3.5%.
"The Press" published its second opinion poll on 21 September. It had Dalziel on 75% of the decided voters, with Lonsdale on 21% in second place. None of the other candidates polled above 1%. 17% of voters had not decided whom to vote for. The survey work was carried out in late August and early September, and the poll had a margin of error of 5.2%.
"The Press" published its third opinion poll on 30 September. It had Dalziel on 78% of the vote, with Lonsdale on 19% in second place. Hansen and Maxwell both received 1% of the support, and the remaining candidates a combined 2%, whilst 1% did not know who to vote for. The poll was carried out between 17 and 25 September, questioned 541 people, and had a margin of error of 3.49%. In addition, a further 190 respondents stated that they would not vote.
Political scientist Bronwyn Hayward, a lecturer at the University of Canterbury, predicted a poor turnout based on the one-sidedness of the race, and tiredness of the voting populations due to earthquake-induced stress.
Timeline and election.
Local elections happen across New Zealand on the same day. Under section 10 of the Local Electoral Act 2001, a "general election of members of every local authority or community board must be held on the second Saturday in October in every third year" from the date the Act came into effect in 2001, meaning 12 October 2013. The local elections include District Health Board members. In 2013, Christchurch voters thus voted for a mayor, city councillors, community board members, and District Health Board members. All elections were conducted by postal ballot. Like most other local authorities, Christchurch City Council used the first-past-the-post (FPP) voting system.
Key dates for the election as set out by the Electoral Commission were:
Results.
Dalziel was elected, and preliminary results saw her having received some 48,000 more votes than her nearest rival, Lonsdale. Final results were published on 17 October, and declared in a public notice on 19 October, with the margin between the top contenders having increased to 49,745 votes.
Unlike Dalziel, who contested the mayoralty only, Lonsdale also stood for a position as a city councillor and came second in the two-member Hagley-Ferrymead ward, and was thus confirmed elected. As "The Press" had predicted, the remaining mayoral candidates received a low number of votes, with only Cattermole gaining just over 1,000 votes. The mayor and councillors were sworn in on 24 October.
Voting statistics.
Participation in local elections had been falling for years to a low in 2004. In the 2013 local election, 42.56% of registered voters cast their vote, which is significantly lower than the 2010 election, when the increased interest was caused by the 2010 Canterbury earthquake just prior to the election. The following table shows the voting statistics since the 1989 local elections:

Horton Hatches the Egg (1942 film)

Horton Hatches the Egg is a ten-minute animated short film based on the book by Dr. Seuss, by Leon Schlesinger Productions in 1942, released as part of Warner Bros.' "Merrie Melodies" series. The short, which in contrast to the original children's book was more adult-oriented, was directed by Bob Clampett. Horton was voiced by Kent Rogers along with the Peter Lorre fish, Sara Berner voiced Mayzie and the elephant bird, Robert C. Bruce narrated, and Mel Blanc performed most of the other voices.
In producing the cartoon, Clampett's unit did not use a storyboard, as was the customary practice; instead, they sketched and wrote additional ideas for the cartoon in Clampett's copy of Seuss' book (there is no story credit for this cartoon's original credits). Several elements that do not appear in the original book were added to the cartoon, including;

Land grant to Ḫasardu kudurru

The land grant to Ḫasardu kudurru, is a four-sided limestone "narû", or memorial stele, from the late 2nd millennium BC Mesopotamia recording the gift of 144 hectares of land on the bank of the Royal Canal in the Bīt-Pir’i-Amurru region of the Diyala valley by Kassite monarch Meli-Šipak (ca. 1186–1172 BC) to an official or "sukkal mu’irri", by the name of Ḫa-SAR"-du" (reading uncertain). It is titled, “O Adad, the hero, bestow irrigation ditches of abundance here!" and is notable for the light it sheds on middle Babylonian officialdom.
The stele.
The object was excavated by Hormuzd Rassam during his 1881–82 excavations in Sippar on behalf of the British Museum. It was recovered, along with two other entitlement stelae, from a room in the temple of Šamaš and given the museum reference BM 90829. 
Deities invoked.
Thirteen gods are invoked by name together with "all the gods whose names are portrayed on this "narû"." These are represented by eighteen icons arranged around the conical top.
The god Marduk is pictured twice, once by a "kusarikku" holding a spade, and once with a "marru" or tasseled spade in front of the "kusarikku". Ea may be represented both by the south wind and a ram-headed crook. Šuqamuna and Šumalia, the Kassite deities associated with the investiture of kings are portrayed by a bird on a perch. Several of the symbols are widely attested icons of their gods such as the lunar disc for Sîn, solar disc for Šamaš, the lightning-fork for Adad, the lamp for Nusku, the leaping dog for Gula, the mace with twin lion-heads for Nergal, the eagle-headed mace for Ninurta, the eight-pointed star for Ištar, and the coiled snake for Ištaran.
Cast of characters.
The principal parties to the transaction were the king and a Kassite military official:
The title "sukkal mu'erru" suggests his rȏle is as a representative or liaison officer at the royal court on behalf of the military commander, or "mu'erru". 
The officials conducting the transfer:
The witnesses to the transaction:
The term "ša rēši" designated a royal eunuch in the Assyrian court but there is no evidence of a similar fate for a court official in middle Babylonia. Furthermore, Kidin-Marduk (not the witness on this kudurru), an official with this title is pictured bearded having inherited the position from his father, and later bequeathing it to his son, on a cylinder seal of the reign of Burna-Buriaš II. It is significant that both the military positions are occupied by Kassites.

Judith of Hohenstaufen

Landgravine Jutta Claricia of Thuringia, also known as "Judith of Hohenstaufen" or "Judith of Swabia" ( – 7 July 1191) was a daughter of Duke Frederick II of Swabia and a half-sister of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. She was baptized as "Judith", but was commonly called "Jutta" or "Guta". Sometimes the Latinate form "Clementia" was used, or "Claritia" or "Claricia".
Life.
In 1150, Judith married Landgrave Louis II of Thuringia. This marriage was intended to cement the relationship between the Ludowingians dynasty and the House of Hohenzollern. The should help Emperor Barbarossa in his conflict with Duke Henry the Lion of the House of Guelph.
In 1168, Judith began the construction of Runneburg Castle in Weißensee. The neighbouring Counts of Biechlingen objected, and protested to Emperor Barbarossa. However, the emperor sided with his half-sister and rejected the protests. Runneburg Castle was situated halfway between Wartburg Castle and Neuenburg Castle and became the residence of the Landgraves of Thuringia. Later during the conflicts between Germany's most powerfule dynasties, the strategically located Runneburg Castle became one of the most important castles in the area.
Judith survived her husband and her eldest son Louis III. She died on 7 July 1191 and was buried in Reinhardsbrunn monastery, next to her husband.
Her name is still omnipresent in Weißensee, which shows how highly she was regarded during her lifetime.
Grave stone.
Judith's grave stone was moved from Reinhardsbrunn to the choir of the St. George church in Eisenach. It was created in the 14th century, well after her death. It must have been installed after the fire of 1292.
The Landgravine is depicted holding a lap dog in her left arm, while her right hand holds a scepter. A wide cantilevered canopy, held up by two angels, is extended over her head. The angels appear to sit on a pillow behind her head. The inscription reads ("the sister of Emperor Frederick").
Due to the canopy, this grave stone was larger than those of the other Landgraves of Thuringia (which are also on display in the St. George church in Eisenach). It must have made her grave very visible, even when the grave stone was part of the church floor. The presence of the Emperor's sister in the family tree introduced additional honor, which is why her family background was emphasized in the inscription.
Marriage and issue.
In 1150, Judith married Louis II, Landgrave of Thuringia. They had the following children:

Wire cutter (jeep)

A wire cutter is a military installation used to protect personnel in open vehicles against taut-wire traps. It was first used late in World War II and mainly installed as a field modification. There are no standard models, but wire cutters usually consisted of a piece of iron installed vertically on the front bumper coming up between two and three feet above the windshield of the vehicle when raised.
These wire cutters offer no protection against tripwires, or IED triggering.
The first land vehicle wire cutter to be demonstrated was fitted to the Killen-Strait tractor, during a demonstration in 1915. This used a pre-existing design of torpedo net cutter, intended for use on submarines. Despite the tactical importance of removing barbed wire barriers during World War I, this type of cutter was not attempted in the field. Heavy tanks were used simply to crush the obstacles.

Crossett Methodist Church

The Crossett Methodist Church is now known as the First Methodist Church of Crossett. It is at 500 Main St., Crossett, Arkansas and was built in 1949.
History.
It is a work of architect John Parks Almand, and it is work of Trapp, Clippord & Phelps. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 17, 2010.
Before 1902, a travelling Methodist minister held meetings in a tent, across from the Missouri Pacific Railroad station. The owners of Crossett Lumber Company owned all the property in town and paid the preacher. The Arkansas law in 1837 prohibited the sale of liquor within one mile of a place of worship. Overnight, a wooden church was built on the site of the tent meeting. This kept a pending saloon license from being issued, and stopped its opening in the town.

707th Bombardment Squadron

The 707th Bombardment Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to Twelfth Air Force as an Air Force Reserve unit at Lubbock Air Force Base, Texas in 1950. During World War II the squadron served as a heavy bombardment unit in the European Theater of World War II.
History.
Training for combat.
The squadron was first activated on 1 April 1943 at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona as the 707th Bombardment Squadron with an initial cadre drawn from the 39th Bombardment Group. It was one of the original squadrons of the 446th Bombardment Group. The cadre departed for Orlando AAB, Florida for training with the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics, where they flew simulated combat missions from Montbrook AAF.
The unit headed for Alamogordo AAF, New Mexico in June 1943, but was diverted to Lowry Field, Colorado, where the squadron was filled out and advanced training was completed. The squadron lost one aircraft during this training. The ground echelon left Lowry on 18 October 1943 for Camp Shanks, New York and embarked on the RMS Queen Mary, sailing on 27 October 1943 and arrived in Greenock on the Firth of Clyde on 2 November 1943. The aircraft left Lowry on 20 October 1943 for staging at Lincoln AAF, NE. The aircrews ferried their planes under the control of Air Transport Command via the southern route from Florida through Puerto Rico, Brazil, Senegal, and Morocco to England. The 707th was part of the first United States Army Air Forces group to complete the Transatlantic hop from Brazil to Africa without the installation of additional bomb bay fuel tanks.
Combat in the European Theater.
The squadron arrived at its new base at RAF Bungay in the east of England in early November. The 707th flew its first mission on 16 December 1943 against shipping facilities in Bremen. The unit operated chiefly against strategic objectives. Its targets included U-boat installations at Kiel, the port at Bremen, a chemical plant at Ludwigshafen, ball-bearing works at Berlin, aircraft engine plants at Rostock, aircraft factories at Munich, marshalling yards at Coblenz, motor works at Ulm, and oil refineries at Hamburg.
Besides strategic missions, the 707th often carried out support and air interdiction operations. It supported the Normandy invasion in June 1944 by attacking strong points, bridges, airfields, transportation, and other targets in France. The squadron aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. It dropped supplies to Allied troops near Nijmegen during Operation Market-Garden in September. The unit bombed marshalling yards, bridges, and road junctions during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945. It flew low level missions to drop medical supplies, arms, and food to airborne and ground troops near Wesel during Operation Varsity in March 1945. The 707th flew its last combat mission on 25 April, attacking a bridge near Salzburg, Austria. 
After V-E Day, the 707th flew transport missions to France, sometimes landing at fields that had been targets the previous year. It also flew Trolley missions, transporting support personnel for "sightseeing" trips over Germany to view the results of their efforts. The squadron began to redeploy to the US in June 1945. The first aircraft of the air echelon departed the United Kingdom in mid-June 1945 flying the northern route via Iceland. The ground echelon sailed from Greenock on the Queen Mary on the sixth of July 1945 and arrived in New York on 11 July 1945. Personnel were given 30 days leave. The ground and air echelons reassembled at Sioux Falls AAF, South Dakota in late July. Its personnel were transferred to other Second Air Force units or demobilized and the squadron was inactivated on 28 August 1945.
Reserve Operations.
The squadron was reactivated as an Air Force Reserve squadron in April 1948 at Lubbock AFB, Texas, although group headquarters was located at Carswell AFB. It was apparently never fully manned or equipped and was inactivated in 1950.

Suvarna Vidhana Soudha

The Suvarna Vidhana Soudha is a new legislature building of the State of Karnataka in Belagavi in the Belgaum district of Northern Karnataka. It was inaugurated on 11 October 2012 by President Pranab Mukherjee.
The Building.
The Suvarna Vidhana Soudha has been so named to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Karnataka's formation day. The building is a four floored structure with a total built-up area of 60,398 sq.m. and consists of an Assembly hall that seats 300, a Council hall for 100 members, a 450-seat Central Hall, 38 ministerial chambers and 14 meeting halls. It also has conference halls, a banquet hall, secretariats for both the houses of legislature, meeting halls and office accommodations. The entire complex is located on 127 acres of land that was acquired from farmers in the area. The Ashok Chakra atop the main dome of the building, measuring 3.68 metres by 2.11 metres and weighing 6.50 tonnes was created by the V T N Creative Art Studio in Bangalore.The facade of the building has the motto 'Work is Worship' ("kayakave kailasa") given by 12th century poet Basavanna inscribed on it.
History of Construction.
The Suvarna Vidhana Soudha was constructed as a part of Karnataka's reiteration of its control over Belgaum in its inter state rivalry with Maharashtra for control of the district. While the proposal to build a legislature building in Belgaum to counter Maharashtra's claim to the area had been mooted several years ago, it was after HD Kumaraswamy became Chief Minister that the project gained momentum. In 2007, B. S. Yeddyurappa, the then Deputy Chief Minister who held the finance portfolio allotted funds to build the new legislature building. While it was originally to have come up at Tilakwadi, it was subsequently relocated to its present location at the Halga-Bastwad area of Belgaum, 10 km from the city and just off the Bangalore-Mumbai highway, which is a part of the Golden Quadrilateral project. The "bhoomi puja" for the original building was performed by the then Chief Minister, Kumaraswamy in 2007 while his successor, Yeddyurappa performed it for the construction of the building at its new venue in 2009.
Work began on the building in August 2009 and it was to have been completed in 18 months within an original budget of 2.30 billion. The Pune based B.G. Shirke Construction Technology Pvt. Ltd. were given the contract to construct the building. There were repeated extensions of the deadline on account of tardy progress in construction. By August 2012, the cost of the building alone had reached 391 crore with estimates suggesting a final bill of nearly 5 billion(roughly USD 100 million) on its completion. The inauguration ceremony itself has been billed at 150 million.
Criticism.
The building of the Suvarna Soudha has been criticised as an extravagance as the building will only be used once a year to hold a session of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. The Karnataka Government however has suggested that the building will also host legislative committee and regional meetings of the State government and conferences and meetings with foreign delegations when the legislative session is not being held there.

Trium Mondo

The Trium Mondo is an early touchscreen smartphone designed and marketed by Trium, a Mitsubishi subsidiary, which runs the Windows Pocket PC 2000 operating system. 
The product was originally announced on January 10, 2000, at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and was released in the UK in August 2001. It featured dual-band GSM cellular connectivity, and was amongst the first devices released with GPRS support for data transfer.
Screen and input.
The touchscreen on the Mondo is a 9.9 cm (3.9 in) passive-matrix monochrome liquid crystal display. The resistive touchscreen has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels in 16 shades of monochrome.
There are five physical buttons on the front of the Mondo, located under the display to toggle standby, and to provide shortcuts to the phone, messages, calendar and contacts features. A jog wheel on the left spine of the phone controls volume and another button starts and stops audio recordings.
The design omits a physical keypad, instead providing a virtual keypad operated using the touchscreen while in the phone application, and a virtual keyboard where applicable in other applications.
Critical reception.
Ilaria Santi writing in ZDNet concluded that the Trium Mondo is a "well-featured handheld/mobile phone" and that the price at launch was not unreasonable for the type of device. The Register believed that the compromises in the phone and PDA functionality in order to combine them was an issue, and suggested that it was "hard to see anyone replacing a PDA and a cellphone with a Mondo". In the New Straights Times, Matthew Mok highlighted the ease of having the PDA and phone features combined in one product over connecting two standalone devices but noted the lack of expansion slots compared to normal PDAs and the omission of a colour screen.

Cueva de los Murciélagos

The Cueva de los Murciélagos is a cave system in the Sierras Subbéticas located about four km southeast of the town of Zuheros in the southern province of Córdoba in Spain. Although the caves were discovered in 1868, they were not studied until 1938. The caves host one of the largest bat colonies in Andalusia.
Location and formation.
The caves are located in an extensive karst landscape at an altitude of 980 metres in the heart of the Cañada de Malos Vientos mountain (1000 m) in southern Andalusia. The rock formations and caves with stalactites, stalagmites and subterranean lakes were formed due to weathering and leaching of carbonate rocks. The caves have a total length of 2,000 metres, of which only 450 metres can be accessed.
History.
Speleologists discovered tombs from the middle Paleolithic period, which show evidence of human occupation of the caves 35,000 years ago. According to the Carbon-14 dating method, finds from the Neolithic period have an age from 4,300 to 3,980 BC. The researchers reconstructed the lives of people whose artefacts were found preferentially at the cave entrance. Here they cooked their meals on an open firepit. Their diet consisted of the meat of wild and farm animals and various cereals. They used tools created of flint and bones, in order to cut leather. They manufactured red painted vessels, as well as necklaces and bracelets made of sea shells, which they probably acquired through trade with coastal residents. Apparently, the group was on the transition from a live as hunter-gatherers to a live as farmers, who cultivated crops and bred domestic animals.
On various walls there are cave paintings which show depictions of goats, of an eye, and of several human figures. The drawings are dated from the Neolithic period (6000-3000 BC) and the bronze age (3000-2000 BC).

Theorem on formal functions

In algebraic geometry, the theorem on formal functions states the following:
The theorem is used to deduce some other important theorems: Stein factorization and a version of Zariski's main theorem that says that a proper birational morphism into a normal variety is an isomorphism. Some other corollaries (with the notations as above) are:
Corollary: For any formula_13, topologically,
where the completion on the left is with respect to formula_15.
Corollary: Let "r" be such that formula_16 for all formula_13. Then
Corollay: For each formula_13, there exists an open neighborhood "U" of "s" such that
Corollary: If formula_21, then formula_22 is connected for all formula_13.
The theorem also leads to the Grothendieck existence theorem, which gives an equivalence between the category of coherent sheaves on a scheme and the category of coherent sheaves on its formal completion (in particular, it yields algebralizability.)
Finally, it is possible to weaken the hypothesis in the theorem; cf. Illusie. According to Illusie (pg. 204), the proof given in EGA III is due to Serre. The original proof (due to Grothendieck) was never published.
The construction of the canonical map.
Let the setting be as in the lede. In the proof one uses the following alternative definition of the canonical map.
Let formula_24 be the canonical maps. Then we have the base change map of formula_10-modules
where formula_27 is induced by formula_1. Since formula_2 is coherent, we can identify formula_30 with formula_31. Since formula_32 is also coherent (as "f" is proper), doing the same identification, the above reads:
Using formula_34 where formula_35 and formula_36, one also obtains (after passing to limit):
where formula_38 are as before. One can verify that the composition of the two maps is the same map in the lede. (cf. EGA III-1, section 4)

La Voz (Spanish TV series)

La Voz (Spanish for "The Voice") is a Spanish reality talent show that premiered on 19 September 2012 on Telecinco. It is part of the international syndication "The Voice" based on the original Dutch television program "The Voice of Holland", created by Dutch television producer John de Mol.
One of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the audition.
The series is hosted by Jesús Vázquez, with Tania Llasera as social media correspondent. The original judging panel consisted of David Bisbal, Rosario Flores, Malú and Melendi as the four coaches. In the second season, Antonio Orozco replaced Melendi.
Overview.
Format.
The show consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and the live performance shows. Four judges also known as coaches, all noteworthy recording artists from Spain, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that performer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same performer (as happens frequently), the performer has the final choice of which coach's team to join.
After the coaches fill each respective slots in their team the batch of singers in the team is mentored and developed by its respective coach. In the second stage, called the battle phase, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together in a stage that look like a battle ring, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of individual "battles" into the first live round.
Within that first live round, the surviving four acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with public votes determining one of two acts from each team that will advance to the final eight, while the coach chooses which of the remaining three acts comprises the other performer remaining on the team.
In the final phase, the remaining contestants compete against each other in live broadcasts. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the final 4 phase. With one team member remaining for each coach, the (final 4) contestants compete against each other in the finale with the outcome decided solely by public vote.
Development, production and marketing.
Mediaset Spain acquired the rights of the franchise back in 2011 after the success of the US counterpart.

Cody Asche

Cody James Asche (born June 30, 1990) is an American professional baseball third baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is tall, and weighs . After growing up in O'Fallon, Missouri, he attended the University of Nebraska, where he played college baseball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, majored in economics and achieved recognition for both his athletic and academic performance. He was drafted by the Phillies in 2011. He quickly progressed through the minor league system, briefly dabbling at second base before predominantly sticking at third base. At both positions, minor league scouts regarded his defensive ability as sub-optimal.
The Phillies called him up to the major league team in July 2013. He performed adequately in his first season in the major leagues, and was expected to start at third base in 2014. Many compare his playing style, particularly his demeanor and work ethic, to that of Phillies' teammate Chase Utley. As a hitter, he is better as a contact hitter than a power hitter; defensively, he has improved, which has drawn accolades from Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg. Asche is engaged to his girlfriend, is an ardent supporter of his alma mater's football team, and enjoys other sports, including hockey and golf.
Early life.
Asche was born on June 30, 1990 in St. Charles, Missouri to Todd and Julie Asche; he has a brother named Tyler. He grew up playing baseball, which he started playing with his father and brother in the yard around age five, and football, but he quit playing football in his freshman year of high school. He attended Fort Zumwalt West High School in O'Fallon, Missouri. Playing for the school's baseball team, he had a .425 batting average across his career and batted .512 in his senior season. He then enrolled at the University of Nebraska, where he played college baseball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. In 2011, Asche's junior year, he had a .327 batting average. His 12 home runs led the Big 12 Conference, while his 56 runs batted in (RBIs) placed him second in the conference. He was named a second-team All-American. While at Nebraska, he majored in economics and maintained a grade point average (GPA) of 3.407. Because of his strong grades, he earned placement on the Big 12 Conference Commissioner's Honor Roll, a distinction bestowed upon student-athletes that achieve a GPA of 3.0 or greater, for five of his college semesters.
Professional career.
Minor league career.
The Phillies drafted Asche in the fourth round, with the 151st overall selection, of the 2011 MLB Draft. In 2011, the Phillies moved him to second base for his professional debut the Williamsport Crosscutters of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League. He struggled there, posting a batting average of just .192. After the season, he was moved back to third base. In 2012, he hit .349 with the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and was promoted to the Reading Phillies of the Class AA Eastern League, where he batted .300. Using his combined stats from all levels during the 2012 season, he led all Phillies minor leaguers with a .324 batting average, and 168 hits; his efforts earned him two Phillies Minor League Player of the Week selections (one in May and one in August), and a Minor League Player of the Month selection in May. The Phillies assigned Asche to the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League after the season for further development, and he played in the league's all-star game and led the league in doubles with 11.
Keith Law, a minor league talent evaluator for ESPN, derided Asche as a prospect both offensively and defensively, noting that he likely would not be much of a power hitter and was a questionable defender. Nevertheless, "Baseball America" rated Asche as the Phillies' seventh-best prospect after the 2012 season. After the 2012 season, another analyst wrote that Asche had an "average" body for a baseball player, commented that while he had limited power potential, he could be a solid contact hitter because of quick hands and "incredibly sound" hitting mechanics, but was a "terrible" defender with a "fringy arm". Subsequently, however, he improved defensively to become "passable". In 2013, Asche played for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League (IL). He was named to the IL team in the Triple-A All-Star Game. After batting .295 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs for Lehigh Valley, and being named their Player of the Month for July, the Phillies promoted Asche to the major leagues on July 30. One writer found it "mildly surprising" that the Phillies called up Asche rather than Maikel Franco, a fellow third base prospect who most thought had far more potential than Asche.
Major league career.
Philadelphia Phillies.
2013.
Although Asche was a non-roster invitee to major league spring training, the Phillies called up Asche to give him "an extended look" at the third base position, particularly in comparison to Franco. Upon his call-up, some scouts compared him to Chase Utley, particularly his demeanor. Asche hoped to emulate Utley, noting, "I can only hope someday I can be compared to that guy." On August 8, Asche went 3-for-5 with a double, a home run and two RBIs. He had a two-run home run to right field in the fourth inning to give the Phillies a nine-run lead. It was the first home run of his big league career. On September 6, 2013, Asche hit a game-winning two-run homer to lead the Phillies over the first-place Atlanta Braves. Asche concluded the 2013 season with a .235 batting average, 5 home runs, and 22 RBIs at the major league level.
2014.
Entering the 2014 season, most writers thought he had earned the starting third baseman's job. Bill Baer, a writer for ESPN, NBC Sports, and "Baseball Prospectus", noted that not only had Asche earned a starting spot, but that his 2013 success helped the development of the team at large. He explained, Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg also called Asche the leading candidate for the job, noting that he would be the Phillies first homegrown third baseman since Scott Rolen. Most were optimistic on Asche's development, though noted he is another left-handed hitter in a lineup dominated by lefties, featuring only one-to-two righties. Later in the offseason, speculation increased that Asche was the likely starter at third baseman when the Phillies announced that Franco would see action at first base in addition to third. The Phillies ultimately demoted Franco, and Asche was named the opening day starter at third base.
Asche began the 2014 successfully; on opening day, he went three-for-four at the plate (3 hits in 4 at bats), scored four runs, had a double, home run, and two RBIs. However, over the first month of the season, he struggled, which led to frequent replacement in the lineup by either Freddy Galvis or Jayson Nix, particularly against left-handed pitchers. None of the trio produced offensively, which led to suggestions within the media the Phillies should promote Franco. On May 6, however, he had four hits in four at bats, including a game-tying grand slam in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, though the Phillies ultimately lost in extra innings. He struggled mightily in the field on May 13, committing three total errors, two of which occurred in an inning during which the Angels scored four unearned runs. However, since that series, Asche bounced back against the Reds in a three games series and went 7 for 12 with 6 RBI's and 3 extra base hits, including a 3-run home run. On May 25, he was placed on the disabled list as a precaution due to a strained left hamstring.
Player profile.
Batting.
When Asche reached the major leagues, he was regarded as having decent potential at the plate, perhaps comparable to Mariners' third baseman Kyle Seager. While he hit for power in the minor leagues, his big league power was expected to be adequate, perhaps averaging 12–14 home runs per season. "Baseball Prospect Nation" reported that he "gets pull happy when he sells out for power and ultimately swings too hard at times." Like most left-handed hitters, Asche performed better against right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers, hitting .238 off the former and .219 off the latter in the major leagues during 2013. "FanGraphs" columnist Michael Barr summarized Asche's offensive potential by writing, "He’s certainly not going to be a world beater, but having double digit home run and speed potential while hitting something in the .275 range is likely the kind of hitter than many of you could use at third base. If forced to guess, and it appears I’m forcing myself, I’d say if given a full time role, Asche could hit something like .275/.315/.400 with five to eight home runs, and six to seven steals with runs and RBI around 20 a piece."
Fielding.
Though as a minor league prospect, analysts derided his defensive potential, with one calling him "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it. I've seen a lot of improving developments since I saw him in mid-February. He's come a long way."
Playing style.
New Phillies' bench coach Larry Bowa said, "(Asche) reminds me of a younger Chase Utley, he gets real mad when he misses a ball, he wants to make every play, he wants to go out and work, you can't hit enough groundballs to him ... he's got a great attitude ... that kind of energy can invigorate a ball club." Marcus Hayes, a writer for the "Philadelphia Daily News" concurred with Bowa's comparison of Asche to Utley, calling their similarities "eerie", and writing, "Already, Asche's solution to failure is to ignore fatigue; to work harder; to improve at all costs. His objective is not necessarily to hit home runs, or to hit a big payday, but, rather, to make sure he can beat out a ground ball in late September. Sound familiar?" Sal Rende, the hitting coach for the Phillies' AAA affiliate, noted that Asche also has solid intangibles, including makeup and work ethic, garnering yet another comparison to Utley. For his part, Asche said that while he appreciates the comparison, he wants to be his own player. Asche's determination and work ethic contributed to his fast ascent through the Phillies minor league system.
Personal life.
Asche is engaged to his girlfriend, Angela Albers. He is a fan of football and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was "Parks and Recreation", and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..."

Simiyu River

The Simiyu River is an East African river in Tanzania, that flows into Lake Victoria. As one of the six main inlets to Lake Victoria it forms part of the upper headwaters of the Nile.
Geogafie.
The Simiyu arises on the western slopes of Mount Loolmalassin and the Ngorongoro Highlands. It flows across the Serengeti into Magu Bay of the Speke Gulf of Lake Victoria. The Simiyu has two main tributaries entering from the right, the Duma River and the Komahola River, and one from the left the Maloho River. There is considerable farming in the lower reaches of the Simiyu Basin, which causes runoff of fertilizers and pesticides. The delta of the Simiyu is a marsh that starts just downstream from the town of Magu. Upstream from Magu just below the Ndagalu Forest Reserve is the village of Samilunga.
History.
In 1875, Henry Morton Stanley was the first European to sight the Simiyu River.
Climate.
There are two rainy seasons, the light one from November into January, and the heavy one from March to May, which result in 700 to 1000 mm of annual rainfall. Less than 10% of the rainfall makes it to the mouth of the river due to a very high evapotranspiration rate.
Hydrometrie.
Average monthly flow of Simiyu measured at the hydrological station in Magu Mjini Estate, about 10 km above the mouth in m³ / s (1999–2004). The Simiyu flows stimulate time-dependent, like most rivers in the region.

Jon Challinor

Jon Challinor (born 2 December 1980) is an English footballer who plays for Stamford and FC Halifax Town on dual registration as a defender or midfielder.
Challinor started his career with Rushden & Diamonds, and after being released in 2000 had spells with Stamford, Cambridge City, the Kalamazoo Kingdom and St Albans City. He reached the 2004 Football Conference play-off Final with Aldershot Town, and after another unsuccessful play-off campaign in the 2004–05 season signed for Exeter City in 2005. He played in the 2007 Conference National play-off Final defeat before returning to Rushden in 2007. He left for Cambridge United a year later, playing for them in the 2009 Conference Premier play-off Final.

Here, he won promotion to League Two in his fourth appearance in a Conference play-off final, following victory in the 2012 Final, also winning in the 2012 FA Trophy Final. He was released by the club a year later.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Northampton, Northamptonshire, Challinor began his career in the youth system at Rushden & Diamonds. He made his first team debut for the Football Conference club as an 18-year-old in a Conference League Cup game against Farnborough Town on 22 December 1998. He signed a contract at the end of his scholarship, but after failing to break into the first team squad was released in May 2000. Challinor dropped two divisions to join Southern League Division One East side Stamford in search of first team football. He impressed with Stamford, moving to Southern League Premier Division side Cambridge City in February 2001, scoring two goals in 11 league appearances before the end of the 2000–01 season. He made 46 appearances, scoring three goals, in the 2001–02 season before spending the close season with the Kalamazoo Kingdom in the American USL Premier Development League.
Challinor returned to England after joining Isthmian League Premier Division side St Albans City on a two-year contract in August 2002. His debut came in St Albans' 4–0 victory away at Ware in the Herts Charity Cup first round on 3 August 2002, before scoring his first goal in a 2–0 home win against Heybridge Swifts on 26 August. Challinor played in St Albans' 4–1 FA Cup first round defeat to Second Division team Stockport County on 16 November 2002. He scored six goals in 57 games in the 2002–03 season, before spending a second close season with the Kalamazoo Kingdom, making 17 appearances and scoring two goals in the USL Premier Development League.
Aldershot Town.
After being released by St Albans, Challinor signed for Football Conference side Aldershot Town on 8 August 2003, having appeared for them in pre-season. He made his debut in a 2–1 home win over Accrington Stanley on 10 August 2003, before scoring his first goal in a 5–2 win away to Telford United on 16 August. After being sent off in a 2–0 home defeat to Margate on 20 December 2003 he was given a three-match suspension, making his return in a 4–0 defeat away to Farnborough on 24 January 2004. He played in the 2004 Football Conference play-off Final against Shrewsbury Town at the Britannia Stadium, which Aldershot lost 3–0 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw following extra time. His 2003–04 season with Aldershot finished having scored 13 goals in 48 appearances. Challinor missed his penalty kick in the penalty shoot-out, before Danny Livesey scored the penalty that secured Carlisle's place in the play-off final. Having finished the season with nine goals in 44 appearances,
Exeter City.
On 20 May 2005, Challinor joined Conference National side Exeter City on a two-year contract. Manager Alex Inglethorpe described him by saying "He's 24 years of age and he fits the bill of the type of player that will help us next season. I liken him to Tim Cahill of Everton. He likes to get forward and score goals, and has a good grounding in both League and non-League football." Challinor made his debut in a 2–0 win away at Gravesend & Northfleet on 13 August 2005, before scoring his first goal on 3 September in a 2–2 away to Dagenham & Redbridge. After the match, Challinor said "I got one over on the manager and proved him wrong, he didn't think I was good enough. Their fans were at me throughout the game but it only made me focus more." He finished the 2005–06 season with 13 goals in 48 appearances for Exeter. but after remaining at Exeter he was offered a new contract at the club in February 2007, which he did not sign. He played for Exeter in the 2007 Conference National play-off Final on 20 May 2007, the first Conference play-off final to be played at the new Wembley Stadium. He assisted Lee Phillips' ninth minute opening goal for Exeter, although the side went on to lose 2–1 to Morecambe. Challinor made 48 appearances and scored 10 goals for Exeter in the 2006–07 season.
Return to Rushden & Diamonds.
Challinor returned to Conference Premier club Rushden & Diamonds after signing a two-year contract on 28 May 2007. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw away at Woking on 11 August 2007, before scoring his first goal with Rushden's only strike in a 1–1 draw away at Salisbury City on 8 September. He started the season playing in midfield, but after being played as a striker in late February 2008 he went on a run of scoring six goals in five consecutive games.
He appeared for Rushden in the 2008 Conference League Cup Final against Aldershot at the Recreation Ground on 3 April 2008. The match finished a 3–3 draw after extra time, but Aldershot won 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out. Challinor made 57 appearances and scored 10 goals for Rushden in the 2007–08 season, only missing out on ever-present status after missing the last game of the season against Grays Athletic through injury.
Cambridge United and Mansfield Town.
He joined Conference Premier rivals Cambridge United on a two-year contract for a £15,000 fee on 6 August 2008. His debut came in a 1–0 win away to Northwich Victoria on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008. Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying "It will put the added responsibility on me to start shooting and take some pressure off the forwards. If the midfield can get some goals as well, then that will help the team". He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against Weymouth in a 1–0 home win on 11 October 2008, coming from a low right-footed shot into the corner from 25 yards.
Challinor's first sending off for Cambridge came after receiving a second yellow card during a 5–0 home defeat to Crawley Town in the FA Trophy second round on 14 January 2009. He made his return from suspension in a 1–1 home draw with Oxford United on 29 January 2009. Challinor came on as a 79th minute substitute for Paul Carden in the 2009 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley, in which Torquay United won 2–0. Having struggled to make an impact for Cambridge in the 2008–09 season, which he finished with two goals in 39 games, he was transfer-listed.
He was sent out on loan for the start of the 2009–10 season to divisional rivals Forest Green Rovers for one month on 7 August 2009. Challinor made his debut the following day in a 2–1 home defeat against Kettering Town, going on to make seven appearances at Forest Green. Forest Green had been interested in taking Challinor on another loan, until appointing a new manager. He left Cambridge on loan again after joining Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town on a two-month loan on 20 November 2009. Challinor made a scoring debut for Mansfield with the equalising goal from close range in a 1–1 draw at home to Eastbourne Borough on 21 November 2009. After making six appearances and scoring one goal in his loan spell, Challinor signed permanently for Mansfield for the rest of the season on 6 January 2010. He was released by Mansfield at the end of the season, having made 15 appearances and scored two goals after signing permanently.
Brackley Town and Newport County.
Challinor signed with Southern League Premier Division side Brackley Town in July 2010, after he had been set to sign for Corby Town of the Conference North, with whom he had been on trial. He then signed for Conference Premier club Newport County on a short-term contract on 30 October 2010, making his debut later that day as a 28th minute substitute for Martin John in a 2–1 home defeat to Kettering Town, but was himself substituted in the 73rd minute for Robbie Matthews. Challinor scored on his next appearance for Newport, with the winning goal after netting Sam Deering's cross in the 29th minute of extra time in a 1–0 victory away at Wealdstone in an FA Trophy first round replay on 13 December 2010. He was released by Newport on 30 December 2010, having made four appearances and scored one goal for the club.
Kettering Town.
He joined Conference Premier side Kettering Town on a contract until the end of the 2010–11 season on 18 January 2011. Kettering were fighting against relegation, and Challinor was quoted as saying "We have to stay positive. We know it's a transitional period for the club and there is a lot going on". He made his debut later that day as a half-time substitute for Callum Wilson in Kettering's 2–1 loss away to Grimsby Town. His first goal for Kettering came in stoppage time against Southport in a 3–1 home victory on 30 April 2011, having entered the match in the 89th minute. Challinor finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal for Kettering. He agreed to stay at Kettering ahead of the 2011–12 season on non-contract terms, in the belief that a permanent contract would later be agreed, and started the season playing in defensive midfield.
York City.
On 25 August 2011, Challinor signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on a contract until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right-back at York, a position in which he displayed composure and an ability to start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away at Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal from the edge of the penalty box.
He signed a new contract with York until the end of the season in January 2012. He featured in the York side that won 2–0 in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley against his former club Newport on 12 May 2012. Eight days later he again played at Wembley to win promotion to League Two through the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final with a 2–1 victory over Luton Town.

GAMA202627

GAMA202627 (also known as G202627) is a spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way. 
The galaxy was described in a 2012 paper 
by astronomer Dr Aaron Robotham, jointly from the University of Western Australia node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) and the University of St Andrews in Scotland, when he searched for groups of galaxies similar to ours in the most detailed map of the local Universe yet, the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA). The Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey is an international collaboration led from ICRAR and the Australian Astronomical Observatory to map our local Universe in closer detail. The galaxy has a redshift measured at z = 0.051219 +/- 0.000123, which corresponds to a distance of 705 mly, or 216 mpc.
Dr Robotham noted, “We found about 3% of galaxies similar to the Milky Way have companion galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds, which is very rare indeed. In total we found 14 galaxy systems that are similar to ours, with two of those being an almost exact match.”
The Milky Way is surrounded by its close companions, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are visible in the southern sky. Many galaxies have smaller galaxies in orbit around them, but few have two that are as large as the Magellanic Clouds. That is why GAMA202627 is so unique as it has two massive satellite galaxies in close proximity.

She carried out five patrols before being sunk north of the Azores by British warships in March 1944.
She was a member of 11 wolfpacks.
She sank four ships and one warship.
Service history.
The submarine was laid down on 25 June 1940 at the "Flensburger Schiffsbau" yard at Flensburg as 'werk' 477, launched on 30 April 1942 and commissioned on 15 August under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Rolf Manke.
1st patrol.
The boat's first patrol was in two parts; it began with her departure from Kiel on 12 January 1943. During the second part, which began with her departure from Kristiansand in Norway on the 16th, she negotiated the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands and sank the "Neva" west of these islands on the 22nd. On the 26th, she sank the "Nortind" east of Cape Farewell, (Greenland). She arrived at St. Nazaire in occupied France on 8 March.
2nd patrol.
Having left St. Nazaire (which would be her base for the rest of her career) on 11 April 1943, "U-357" sank the "Bristol City" and the "Wentworth"; she was attacked south of Cape Farewell by the British corvette and badly damaged. (This attack had originally credited "Pink" with the destruction of .
3rd patrol.
The submarine's third foray took her south, as far as the Gulf of Guinea, off the west African coast. At 84 days, it was her longest patrol.
4th patrol.
Sortie number four saw the boat northeast of the Azores.
5th patrol and loss.
"U-357" had left St. Nazaire on 14 February 1944. From the 29th, she was hunted by the British frigates , , and north of the Azores. "Gore" and "Garlies" had to break off the assault and sail to Gibraltar to re-fuel. The U-boat sank "Gould" on 1 March, but "Affleck" persisted with the attack, sinking "U-358" with gunfire after the submarine was forced to the surface.
50 men died in the U-boat; there was one survivor.

Louis de Beausobre

Louis Isaac de Beausobre (19 August 1730 – 3 December 1783) was a German philosopher and political economist of French Huguenot descent. He was born in Berlin, the son of the French Protestant churchman and ecclesiastical historian Isaac de Beausobre and his second wife, Charlotte Schwarz. He is not to be confused with his elder half-brother, the pastor and theologian Charles Louis de Beausobre (1690–1753).
Beausobre was educated at the Collège Français in Berlin, where he was taught and greatly influenced by Johann Heinrich Samuel Formey. He went on to study philosophy at Frankfurt an der Oder, and later in Paris. On his return to Berlin he was received as a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1755. 
Frederick the Great, out of esteem for Isaac de Beausobre, adopted Louis as his son, and supported him in his studies.

Gustav Adolf Neuber (24 June 1850 - 13 April 1932) was a German surgeon born in Tondern (today- Tønder, Denmark). 
He studied medicine in several universities, receiving his doctorate in 1875 at the University of Giessen. Later he worked as an assistant to Friedrich von Esmarch (1823-1908) at the University Surgical Clinic in Kiel.
In 1884 he first proposed the use of separate operating rooms for septic and non-septic surgery, emphasizing the need for complete cleanliness in all aspects of surgery. In 1886 he opened his own private hospital on Königsweg in Kiel, where he implemented modern principles of asepsis. Neuber's clinic in Kiel is considered to be the first aseptic hospital in the world.
In 1879 he developed a "decalcified bone tube" for wound drainage. In the field of plastic surgery, he introduced a procedure for "fat auto-grafting".

South Side Main Line (CTA)

The South Side Main Line, also known as the South Side Elevated, is a branch in Chicago, run by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as part of the Chicago 'L' system. It is an active branch that is only served by the Green Line, with the exception of Roosevelt, which is also served by the Orange Line. It has on average 12,509 passengers, counting branch divisions, boarding each weekday as of February 2013, according to the CTA. The branch is long with a total of 7 stations (11 counting the Englewood-Jackson Park branches), and runs from the Loop (Van Buren Street) to the Washington Park neighborhood of Chicago. The branch runs from 4am-1am on weekdays, 5:15am-1am on Saturdays and 5:50am-1am on Sundays/Holidays.
Route.
The South Side Elevated serves the Near South Side, Douglas Bronzeville, Grand Boulevard, and Washington Park neighborhoods of Chicago and has stops near the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago.
The South Side Elevated feeds the Englewood branch (Ashland/63rd) and the Jackson Park branch (Cottage Grove).
History.
The South Side elevated started passenger service on June 6, 1892, with service as far south as 39th Street (Pershing Road), making the branch the oldest section of the Chicago 'L'. On January 22, 1893, service on the line was extended as far south as 61st Street. The Jackson Park Branch was added later in 1893 to serve the site of the 1893 World's Fair. Several other lines were grafted in over time to serve parts of the city, though most have since been demolished. The Englewood Branch was opened in 1905, followed by the Kenwood and Normal Park branches in 1907, and the Stock Yards branch in 1908. Today, only the Englewood and Jackson Park Branches remain.
In 1993, the Green Line was created when the CTA color-coded the lines. In 1994, the 58th Street station was closed while remaining viaducts and stations were renovated or rebuilt entirely depending on their state. In February 2012, the platform of the 58th street station was completely demolished.
Future stop at Cermak.
On January 17, 2012, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel announced at a press conference that the Cermak station will be rebuilt in order to serve McCormick Place. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2013, with completion in July 2014.

Clarence Mason Dobell (1836-1917) was a British artist and illustrator.
Life.
Clarence Dobell was born in Cheltenham. He was the son of John Dobell, a wine merchant, and Julietta Thompson, a daughter of Samuel Thompson (1766-1837). His older brothers were the poet Sydney Dobell and the doctor Horace Dobell, and a younger sister Mary married the painter Briton Riviere. 
The family lived in Charlton Kings, where they were friends of the writer Dinah Craik. Clarence accompanied her on the visit to Tewkesbury Abbey which apparently inspired her to write "John Halifax, Gentleman"; according to family tradition, several of the novel's characters were based upon members of his family. Dobell illustrated Craik's 1860 collection "Our Year".
As a student at the Academy schools, Clarence Dobell introduced his future brother-in-law Briton Riviere to pre-Raphaelite painters. He was a contributor to "Good Words" from its inception in 1860, and an occasional contributor to "Once A Week". He had a studio in Grafton Street, London, and was a friend of John Pettie, whose studio was nearby. He, his brother Sydney and Dinah Craik were close friends of W. J. Linton and his wife Eliza Lynn Linton.
In May 1868 he married Emily Duffield. A son, Walter Duffield Dobell, was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford. 
In later life, Dobell seems to have later entered the family wine business: he and his brother Cyrus were listed as owners of Cheltenham's Restoration Inn at the end of the century.

It is located about northeast of Reims and about west of Charleville-Mézières on the edge of the Froidmont forest. It was founded on March 25 1135, the feast day of the Annunciation. It was sold as national property in 1793 and completely demolished. Its library was burned. 
History.
A group of monks traveled to "Signiacum" by way of the Roman road from Reims to Cologne by way of Château-Porcien, and the valleys of the Aisne and Vaux River. The name "Signiacum" ("Sinni-ACUS") suggests the existence of a Gallo-Roman villa located in the Vaux River valley, in the middle of the ancient Ardennes forest. The arrival of twelve monks to the what was to become Igny Abbey occurred under the leadership of Bernard of Clairvaux on 20 March 1135, and the abbey was founded five days later, on March 25 1135. Upon their arrival at Signy, the monks found that there was no religious community nearby so they lived in Draize during building construction..

Claude George Drummond Hay

The Honourable Claude George Drummond Hay (24 June 1862 - 24 October 1920) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. 
The fifth son of George Hay-Drummond, 12th Earl of Kinnoull and Lady Emily Blanche Charlotte Somerset, he was educated at Radley College and on the European Continent. He entered business as a member of the stockbroker company of Ransford & Co in London, and became a director of the Fine Arts & General Insurance Co. 
He became active in Unionist politics and was first secretary of the Primrose League. He unsuccessfully contested the 1892 and 1895 general elections as the Conservative candidate in the east London constituency of Shoreditch, Hoxton. On his third attempt in 1900 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Hoxton, defeating the sitting Liberal Party member, Professor James Stuart. He held the seat in 1906, but lost the seat to Dr. Christopher Addison of the Liberals in January 1910. It was an ill-tempered campaign, and Hay took libel proceedings against a number of newspapers following his defeat. He chose not to make an attempt to regain the seat. 
During World War I he was granted a temporary commission as a captain in Army Service Corps, subsequently transferring to the General Staff. 
He died in Sevastopol while working as a special correspondent in southern Russia for the "Daily Telegraph".

Première Ligue de soccer du Québec

The Premier League soccer du Québec is a semi-professional league of soccer was created in 2012 and organized by the Quebec Soccer Federation.
This league, Division 3, the highest level of play in Quebec. The Canadian Soccer Association is relying on provincial soccer organizations to sanction regional leagues at the Division 3 level behind the NASL and MLS.
The league commissioner is Stéphan Lessard.
The first season of Premier League soccer Quebec began April 15 and ended in October 2012. The first season was won by Saint-Léonard FC.
History.
Before the Second World War soccer was more of a fringe activity than today; however, the best clubs in Quebec were determined in a provincial championship with the winner facing his Ontario counterpart for the title of the "National League.” All the players were not amateurs; in 1934, for example, 27 professionals were identified in Quebec. The war brought a halt to Quebec's semi-professional soccer league development.
Mass immigration of quality players and ambitious leaders in the 1950s allowed Quebec to have many semi-professional teams, and even some professional clubs until the early 1960s. Organizational and competitive disagreements including unhealthy rivalries coupled with slowing immigration reduced the number of skilled young local players taking over from their predecessors. The player pool shrank.
Beginning in 1986, the semi-professional LNSQ (National Soccer League Quebec), stirred passions by creating very good memories. However, at that time the pool of players was not large enough to allow the LNSQ to survive alongside a professional team. The arrival of the Montreal Supra, with all the best players and a much greater media profile was fatal to the fledgling league which lost its splendor before giving way to today’s LSEQ .
In 2011 there are 200,000 players, 300 clubs, 25,000 coaches, 7,000 officials, 50,000 volunteers: soccer is by far the most practiced sport in Quebec, and is experiencing unparalleled popularity throughout the province.
• The organization of soccer in Quebec has changed dramatically with the recent competitions reform conducted by the Federation helping to modernize and stabilize the soccer pyramid, but also to considerably raise standards.
• For several years, the senior level teams of the LSEQ (Quebec Elite Soccer League) enquired about a semi-professional competition.
• The amount of coaches’ development in recent years has led to a major breakthrough in the availability of quality training offered to young participants.
• Thanks to the structure of the club set up, the National Center for High-Performance (NTC), and the academy youth teams of Impact de Montreal, the number of top players developed in Quebec has increased sharply.
• Challenges of the past are no longer as applicable, and it is hoped the PLSQ will facilitate transitioning between the club set up and amateur LSEQ to Impact de Montreal. Also the profile of Impact de Montreal will grow with its 2012 entrance to Division 1 Major League Soccer (MLS). As a result of its promotion, it is much more important for Impact de Montreal to develop its own young talent and offer attractive opportunities to players that previously would have moved to Europe.
Format.
7 teams will play an 18 game season. The winner gets the regular season championship. At the end of the year, there will be a League Cup where the top 6 teams will participate by separating the 6 teams in 2 groups of 3, with the top team in each group making it to the final. The final will be played on a neutral venue.
Each team has a minimum of 9 players paid and is subject to a salary cap 1.

Igny Abbey

Igny Abbey (French: "Abbaye Notre-Dame d'Igny"; translation: "Abbey of Our Lady of Igny"; current: "Abbaye N.-D. du Val d'Igny") is a Cistercian abbey located in Arcis-le-Ponsart, Marne, France. It was close to the Premonstratensian abbey, dedicated to S. Euodius. Founded March 12, 1128, it was nicknamed the "Abbey of Saints" before becoming national property. The abbey was destroyed and rebuilt three times. Festival days are celebrated January 26 (holy founders, Robert, Alberic and Stephen), August 19 (Blessed Guerric), and August 20 (St Bernard).
History.
Igny Abbey was founded by the Archbishop of Reims, Rainaud II de Martigny, who provided land at Igny. In 1128, Bernard of Clairvaux sent monks to Igny to establish it. Humbert, previously prior of Clairvaux, was the founding abbot of Igny. While at Igny, he established a sister abbey Notre-Dame de Signy Abbey was founded by him. After Humbert's departure, the second abbot was Guerric of Igny (died ca. 1157) who is known most for his sermons. Raised to the rank of Blessed, his relics are still venerated in Igny, and are preserved in the church's side chapel.
The monastery was rebuilt in 1792 when it was home to at least six monks. After it became national property during the time of the French Revolution, the property was sold off. In 1876, the buildings were purchased by the Bishop of Reims who restored the monastic community. Igny was destroyed in 1918, but a new monastery was rebuilt in 1929 for a group of nuns from Laval. Igny reorganized in 1955, based on the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Our Lady of Clarity God-first Cistercian monastery in Africa. In 2008, Igny and two other Cistercian communities in northeastern France, Belval (Pas-de-Calais) and Grâce Dieu (Doubs), chose to restructure as Abbaye Notre-Dame du Val d'Igny. The re-organization nearly doubled the size of the Igny Abbey house. The abbey's gates are from the 18th century, while stones from the twelfth century's first monastery are situated along the walkway.

<doc id="36835210" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36835210" title="Office du Niger">
Office du Niger

The Office du Niger is a semi-autonomous government agency in Mali that administers a large irrigation scheme in the Ségou Region of the country. Water from the Niger River is diverted into a system of canals at the Markala dam downstream of Ségou. The water is used to irrigate nearly of the flat alluvial plains to the north and northeast of Markala that form part of the "Delta mort". Although the French colonial administration constructed the system to produce cotton for the textile industry, the main agricultural product is now rice. Around 320,000 tons are grown each year representing 40 percent of the total Malian production. Large quantities of sugar cane are also grown in joint ventures between a Chinese company and the Malian state. The irrigation scheme uses of water each year corresponding to around 10 percent of the total flow of the Niger River.
Niger river.
The Niger, and its tributaries, the Sankarani, the Niandan, the Milo and the Tinkisso, rise in Guinea Highlands and the Fouta Djallon nearly to the southwest of Markala. The climate of both Mali and Guinea is determined by the West African Monsoon with the maximum rainfall occurring in August, but while the annual rainfall in the Guinea Highlands approaches , that at Markala is only . The short but relatively intense rainy season produces a surge of water flowing down the river system which in turn leads to the flooding of the Inner Niger Delta. Since the construction of the Sélingué hydroelectric dam on the Sankarani in 1982, some of the flood water has been retained and released later during the dry season.
At the Markala dam, in an average year, the discharge of the Niger River reaches a peak of around in the second half of September but drops to under in the dry season between February and April. The average discharge is around , but there are large year to year variations in the intensity of the monsoon and thus in the water flowing in the river. In a dry year such as 1989, the average discharge was only , while in a wet year such as 1995 the discharge was .
Water management.
The Markala Dam maintains the water in the Niger at a level above the lowest point of the river bed. Water for the Office du Niger scheme is diverted into the main irrigation canal, the Canal Adducteur, on the left bank upstream from the dam.
Irrigation system.
The irrigation scheme utilizes two ancient branches of the Niger River, the Fala de Molodo that runs northwards from the Niger for to the Alatona region and the Fala de Boky-Wéré that runs in an east-northeast direction towards the town of Macina. Before the construction of the Markala Dam these channels would fill with water during the annual flood.
The Canal Adducteur has a capacity of and runs for to the junction called "Point A". Here the water is distributed into three canals, the Canal du Sahel that flows northwards to the Fala de Molodo, the Canal Costes-Ongoïba that supplies water to the Siribala sugar cane farm and the Canal Macina that carries water to the Fala de Boky-Wéré.
Irrigation impact on the river.
Between 2000 and 2005 the average flow of water used by the Office du Niger was but the flow varied throughout the year, reaching a peak of in October and dropping to a minimum of in December. On average the Office du Niger used around 10 percent of the total water in the river and although during the wet season only a small proportion was diverted, at the end of the dry season when the river discharge was at a minimum, a large proportion was used for irrigation. To satisfy some of the downstream requirements, there is an international agreement to allow at least of water to flow past the Markala dam at all times. In March this left on average only available for irrigation and in the driest year only . The water released by the Sélingué Dam to generate electrical power increased the flow of water in the dry season.
The maximum amount of water diverted from the river is set by the dimensions of the canal. Until the upgrade associated with the Alatona project in 2007-12 the greatest flow was around but with the upgrade to the canal system flows of up to should be possible. Taking into account the passing through the dam, the Niger would need a flow of at least to satisfy the demand. The river only has this amount of water between July and December in an average year and between August and November in a dry year. There is a longstanding proposal to build a hydroelectric dam at Fomi in Guinea on the Niandan. The effect on the Niger at Markala would be similar to that of the Sélingué Dam: the flow would be reduced during the wet season and increased during the dry season. This increased flow during the dry season would allow the Office du Niger to divert additional water from the river.
Extent of irrigated areas.
Keïta "et al." (2002) give the total irrigated area in January 2000 as and provide the following breakdown:
The extent of the irrigated area has since increased. The N-Sukula joint venture setup in 2009 controls of land of which has been irrigated for the cultivation of sugar cane. The Millennium Challenge Corporation funded development at Alatona which ended in 2012, included of rice polders and market gardens.
Sugar cane.
Since the 1960s sugar cane has been cultivated in an area between Markala and Niono. The Dougabougou complex covering an area of 1654 ha between the Fala de Molodo and the Costes-Ongoïba Canal, was established in 1965 together with a sugar mill capable of processing 400 tonnes of cane a day. This was followed in 1974 by the establishment of the larger 3520 ha Siribala complex at the northern end of the Costes-Ongoïba canal. The associated mill had an initial daily capacity of 1000 tonnes. Both complexed were established with Chinese financial aid and managed by the Office du Niger. The farms employed salaried workers to grow the cane and hired seasonal workers at harvest time.
In 1996 the two sugar producing complexes were taken over by SUKALA, a Sino-Malian public–private partnership in a debt-to-equity swap arrangement with 60 percent of the 5 billion franc CFA (7.6 million Euro) equity held by China Light Industrial Corporation for Foreign Economic and Technical Co-operation (CLETC) and 40 percent by the Malian government. In 2009 the company produced around 39,000 tonnes of sugar and 2.8 million tonnes of ethanol. The sugar production represents about a quarter of the annual Malian consumption.
A separate Sino-Malian joint venture, N-SUKALA, was agreed in June 2009 between CLETC and the Malian government. Of the 8.8 billion franc CFA equity (13.4 million Euro), 60 percent is held by CLETC with the remainder held by the Malian state. The company is developing 20,000 ha of land near to the Dougabougou complex that had not previously been irrigated. At the time of the agreement the land was occupied by a number of villages. The construction of a new sugar cane processing plant and refinery with a capacity of 6,000 tonnes a day, expandable to 8,000 tonnes was begun at the end of July 2009. The new sugar cane farm will be irrigated using several hundred rotary centre pivot sprinkler systems. The complex is expected to produce around 100,000 tonnes of sugar and 9.6 million tonnes of ethanol each year.
Alatona expansion.
In November 2006 the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a United States foreign aid agency, signed a 460 million US dollar agreement with the Malian Government to develop the Alatona zone of the Office du Niger and to upgrade Bamako Airport. The project was intended to run for a period of five years between September 2007 to September 2012 but was terminated in May 2012 after a military coup deposed the elected civilian government of Amadou Toumani Touré. Of the total investment, 235 million US dollars were assigned to the Alatona irrigation project.
The Alatona Irrigation Project included the upgrading and paving of the 81 km of road between Niono with Goma Coura, increasing the capacity of the main canal system linking the Alatona region with the Niger River and the establishment of the Alatona region itself with its small irrigation canals and social infrastructure. The initial plan was to irrigate an area of 14,000 ha but this was later reduced to 5,200 ha.
Large-scale land leases.
From around 2008, in an effort to attract foreign investment, the Malian government began offering 30 or 50 year leases on large areas of farmland that had not previously been irrigated. The aim was to bring about a large expansion of the total irrigated area. At the time, other than the Dougabougou and Siribala sugar cane plantations, all the irrigated land was cultivated by small family farms. The average area was around 3.3 ha. The farmers did not have title to the land which was all owned by the state.
The policy of granting leases on large areas of farmland has attracted criticism on the grounds that the procedure lacked transparency and the land rights of local communities were being ignored. Although the development of the leased land leads to a competition for water and requires resettlement of the resident population no environmental and social impact assessments have been published.
The most high profile case is the Malibya project. In 2008 the Malian government awarded a 50-year renewable lease for 100,000 ha of un-irrigated farmland to the Libyan government. The land was to be managed by Malibya, a subsidiary of Libya's sovereign wealth fund. Although the details were not made public, a leaked copy of the agreement was later posted on the internet. No rent was to be paid for the land, but an annual fee of 2,470 F CFA (3.77 euro) was to be paid for each hectare irrigated by a sprinkler system. The land lies to the northeast of the town of Macina, and at the time was occupied by a number of villages.
As the first stage in the development, Malibya arranged for the constructed a 40 km canal and a new paved road by the China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC), a subsidiary of Sinopec. The canal begins at Kolongo Tomo and runs in a northeasterly direction parallel to the Fala de Boky-Wéré. It passes to the north of village of Boky Wéré and ends near the hamlet of Tangana. Malibya announced that they were planning to initially irrigate an area of 25,000 ha. Although the canal has a capacity of 130 m3/s, the maximum flow will be much less than this. According to the hydraulic report for the Alatona project, the capacity of the Canal du Macina that feeds water into the Fala de Boky-Wéré is 75 m3/s and this water is also used to irrigate the existing 20,712 ha of the Macina irrigation zone.

Voices (magazine)

Voices was a monthly literary magazine published in England from 1919 to 1921. Under the editorship of Thomas Moult, "Voices" tried to create a new readership for poetry among the young generation awaiting demobilization or returning from the war".
The first edition of "Voices" appeared in January 1919, costing one shilling. Following the February 1921 issue, the magazine only managed to publish a Summer and Autumn issue before folding.
Some regular contributors, like Neville Cardus, came from Manchester, where Moult had been educated. Jewish contributors included Louis Golding, Maurice Samuel, and the Zionist poet Israel Zangwill; Stephen Winsten, the arts editor, was one of the so-called Whitechapel Boys group, and attracted contributions from David Bomberg, Jacob Kramer, Lucien Pissarro, and Jacob Epstein.
The magazine reviewed war literature and published war poetry by soldier-poets such as Frederick Victor Branford and Edmund Blunden. Open to both Georgian and Modernist poetry, the magazine published artwork by avant-garde artists including Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Wyndham Lewis, David Bomberg, Jacob Kramer, Edward Wadsworth, Lucien Pissarro, Paul Nash, Eric Gill, Edmund X. Kapp, Anne Estelle Rice, John Duncan Fergusson, and Robert Gibbings. However, several "Voices" critics used the war experience as an argument against modernist abstraction as "beauty for beauty's sake."

Atomic Age in design refers to the period roughly corresponding to 1940-1960, when concerns about nuclear war dominated Western society during the Cold War. Architecture, industrial design, commercial design (including advertising), interior design, and fine arts were all influenced by the themes of atomic science, as well as the Space Age, which coincided with that period. Atomic Age design became popular and instantly recognizable, with a use of atomic motifs and space age symbols. Retro-futurism is a current resurgence of interest in Atomic Age design.
Vital forms.
"Vital forms", or abstract organic forms, were identified as a core motif in the 2001 exhibition of Atomic Age design at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, titled "Vital forms: American art and design in the atomic age, 1940-1960". Atomic power was a paradox during the era. It held great promise of technological solutions for the problems facing an increasingly complex world; at the same time, people were fearful of a nuclear armageddon, after the use of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. People were ever-aware of the potential good, and lurking menace, in technology. Science became more visible in the mainstream culture through Atomic Age design.
Atomic particles themselves were reproduced in visual design, in areas ranging from architecture to barkcloth patterns. The geometric atomic patterns that were produced in textiles, industrial materials, melamine counter tops, dishware and wallpaper, and many other items, are emblematic of Atomic Age design. The Space Age interests of the public also began showing up in Atomic Age designs, with star and galaxy motifs appearing with the atomic graphics.
Free-form organic shapes also appear as a recurring theme in Atomic Age design. British designers at the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) produced fabrics in the early 1950s that showed "skeletal plant forms, drawn in a delicate, spidery graphic form", reflecting x-ray technology that was becoming more widespread and familiar in pop culture. These botanic designs influenced later Atomic Age patterns that included repeating organic shapes similar to cells and organisms viewed through a microscope. 
There are similarities between many Atomic Age designs and the mid-century modern trend of the same time. Elements of Atomic Age and Space Age design were dominant in the Googie design movement in commercial buildings in the United States. Some streamlined industrial designs also echoed the influence of futurism that had been seen much earlier in Art Deco design.
Space Age design.
Whereas Atomic Age motifs and structures leaned towards design fields such as architecture and industrial design, Space Age design spread into a broader range of consumer products, including clothing fashion, and even animation styles, as with the popular television show "The Jetsons". Beginning with the dawn of the Space Age (commonly attributed to the launch of Sputnik in October, 1957 ), Space Age design captured the optimism and faith in technology that was felt by much of society during the 1950s and 1960s. Space Age design also had a more vernacular character, appearing in accessible forms that quickly became familiar to mainstream consumers. Space Age design became more closely associated with kitsch and with Googie architecture for popular commercial buildings such as diners, bowling alleys, and shops. "Space Age design is closely tied to the pop movement [...] the fusion of popular culture, art, design, and fashion". 
Fashion.
Two of the most well-known fashion designers to use Space Age themes in their designs were Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne. Pierre Cardin established the futuristic trend of using synthetic and industrial materials in fashion, with "forward thinking" innovations in his early 1960s work.
Cardin "popularized the use of everyday materials for fashion items, like vinyl and metal rings for dresses, carpentry nails for brooches, and common decorative effects such as geometric cut-outs, appliqués, large pockets, helmets and oversized buttons". In 1964, Cardin launched his "space age" line, and André Courrèges showed his "Moon Girl" collection.
Designers.
Some of the leading designers who employed the Atomic Age style in their works include:

Tri-Chess

Tri-Chess is the name of a chess variant for three players invented by George R. Dekle, Sr. in 1986. The game is played on a board comprising 150 triangular cells. The standard chess pieces are present, minus the queens, and plus the chancellor and cardinal compound fairy pieces per side.
Tri-Chess was included in "World Game Review" No. 10 edited by Michael Keller. 
Game rules.
The illustration shows the starting setup. White moves first and play proceeds clockwise around the board. When a player is checkmated or stalemated, his king is immediately removed from the game and his remaining men become the property of the player delivering the mate or stalemate. Pawns of appropriated armies do not change their direction of movement toward promotion. The last surviving player wins the game.

Hank Nichols

Henry O. 'Hank' Nichols was an American college basketball referee and later supervisor of officials. In 2012, he was inducted as a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Nichols is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5 Hall of Fame, Villanova Athletic Hall of Fame, the Philadelphia Athletic Hall of Fame, the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame, and the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. He officiated 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association(NCAA)Final Fours, a record 6 NCAA Men's Basketball National Championships, 3 NIT Finals, 2 Olympic Games and 1 European Championships. He was also the first official to work both the NIT and NCAA Championship Basketball Finals in a single year, and the first National Coordinator of Officials. Since 2004, he has worked as an Umpire Observer for Major League Baseball.
Early life.
Nichols grew up in Niagara Falls, New York. In high school, he attended Bishop Duffy High and lettered in three sports. He earned a scholarship to Villanova University, where he played catcher. He also started on the freshman basketball team.
After graduation, Nichols spent two years in the Marine Corps, followed by three years playing minor league baseball in the Cincinnati Reds organization. In his last season (at age 27), he hit .330 as a player-manager in the Western Carolina League.
Officiating career.
In the fall of 1969, while at Duke, Nichols started his officiating career with six freshman Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) basketball games. In 1970, Nichols became assistant professor in the Department of Education and Human Services at Villanova, where he would remain for the next 33 years. He also began officiating varsity games in the ECAC and the ACC.
In 1974, Nichols worked his first NCAA tournament, the first of 13 in a row. That season, Nichols was one of the officials for the 1974 North Carolina State-Maryland ACC championship game. Nichols said that game was the best he ever worked, and NC State's David Thompson as the greatest player he officiated. NC State won the game in overtime, and went on to win the national championship. At the time only one team from each conference made the NCAA Tournament. 
"I just remember getting out of everybody's way," Nichols said. "Those players were so good. We just kind of watched them. It was a magnificent game."
In 1975, Nichols worked the first of 10 Final Fours, and the first of six national championships. The championship game was John Wooden’s final game as the head coach at UCLA.
In 1976, he officiated at the Olympic Games in Montreal, the first of two Olympic assignments. His second would come in 1984 in Los Angeles.
NCAA National Coordinator of Officials.
In 1987, Nichols became the first NCAA coordinator of officials. He spent 22 years in that position. Nichols said, "the goal was to try to get guys across the country to officiate the same way, not have the ACC be different from the Big Ten and the Big Ten different from the Pac-10. We wanted to teach guys to ref better, to try to get them to be more consistent. We didn't want them to be another factor when teams played on the road. We wanted them to stand tall and figure out tough situations. I think a lot of that has been accomplished." While in this position, Nichols also was the secretary/editor of the Basketball Rules Committee from 1991-1997.
Nichols retired after the 2007-2008 season. He was replaced by John Adams.

Black Sea Biosphere Reserve () is a biosphere reserve of Ukraine that is located at littoral zone of the northern Black Sea coast covering regions of the Kherson and Mykolaiv Oblasts and including Gulf of Tendra and Yahorlyk Bay. The reserve is part of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
History.
The preserve was initially established on July 14, 1927 as part of the Trans-Maritime Preserve by the decree No. 172 of the Council of People's Commissars of Ukrainian SSR. In 1933 the preserve became an independent research institution. In 1973 to the Black Sea Preserve were added the Danube floodplains, Kinski islands in Yahorlyk Bay, and the shallow portion of the Gulf of Tendra. Next year the neighboring Yahorlyk reserve was annexed as well. In 1981 the Danube floodplains became an independent preserve. In 1983 there was established the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve that included the Black Sea State Preserve and the Yahorlyk State Ornithological Reserve (as its buffer zone). In December 1984 the reserve was accepted to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The territory of the preserve is included into the International list of Ramsar Convention.

<doc id="36835395" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36835395" title="Great Gatsby curve">
Great Gatsby curve

The Great Gatsby curve is a chart plotting the (positive) relationship between inequality and intergenerational social immobility in several countries around the world.
The curve was introduced in a 2012 speech by chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger, and the President’s Economic Report to Congress, using data from labor economist Miles Corak. The name was coined by former CEA staff economist Judd Cramer, for which he was given a bottle of wine as a reward. The curve plots "intergenerational income elasticity"—i.e. the likelihood that someone will inherit their parents' relative position of income level—and inequality in the United States and twelve other developed countries, though some versions of the curve include developing countries. Countries with low levels of inequality such as Denmark, Norway and Finland had some of the greatest mobility, while the two countries with the high level of inequality—Chile and Brazil—had some of the lowest mobility.
Journalist Robert Lenzner calls it "A very frightening curve that requires policy attention.". Krueger predicted that "the persistence in the advantages and disadvantages of income passed from parents to the children" will "rise by about a quarter for the next generation as a result of the rise in inequality that the U.S. has seen in the last 25 years."
By contrast Harvard economist Greg Mankiw noted that "this correlation is not particularly surprising", showing that comparisons of more diverse groups (like the USA) with less diverse groups (like the population of Denmark) will automatically exhibit this phenomenon even when there are in fact no differences in the processes of mobility between these groups, i.e., the curve is an artifact of diversity 
Journalist Timothy Noah argued the effect results from growing inequality: you can't really experience ever-growing income inequality without experiencing a decline in Horatio Alger-style upward mobility because (to use a frequently-employed metaphor) it's harder to climb a ladder when the rungs are farther apart. Another journalist argued that a connection between income inequality and low mobility could be explained by the lack of access for un-affluent children to better (more expensive) schools and if this enabled access to high-paying jobs; or to differences in health care that may limit education and employment.
However, the apparent connection may arise as an artifact of heterogeneous variance in ability across nations, questioning the need for intervention. Thus:
Germans are richer on average than Greeks, and that difference in income tends to persist from generation to generation. When people look at the Great Gatsby curve, they omit this fact, because the nation is the unit of analysis. But it is not obvious that the political divisions that divide people are the right ones for economic analysis. We combine the persistently rich Connecticut with the persistently poor Mississippi, so why not combine Germany with Greece?
A blog by M.S. at The Economist replied to Mankiw's counter-argument as follows:
The argument over the Great Gatsby curve is an argument about whether America's economy is fair. With his Germany/Greece and Mississippi/Connecticut analogy, Mr Mankiw has stumbled on a very convincing point: whether you are rich or poor in Europe or America depends to a great extent not on your own qualities or efforts, but on where you happen to be born. America is not a meritocracy, Mr Mankiw is saying; not only do those born rich tend to stay rich and vice versa, "just being born in one state or another" makes a huge difference to your lifelong earnings. Amazingly, he seems completely unaware that this is the case he's just made.
Economist Paul Krugman has also countered Mankiw's arguments in his column.
The name of the curve refers, somewhat ironically, to Jay Gatsby (born Gatz), the character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel "The Great Gatsby". Jay shows a high degree of mobility, rising from being a bootlegger, to leading the Long Island north shore social set .
Carter Price of the WCEG suggests "the line to serfdom" as an alternative name on the grounds that it may better convey the meaning of the correlation.

2002 West Bengal cyclone

The 2002 West Bengal cyclone (JTWC designation: 04B, officially known as Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 04) was a deadly tropical cyclone that affected India and Bangladesh in November 2002. The sixth tropical cyclone and fourth cyclonic storm of the 2002 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it developed in the Bay of Bengal northeast of Sri Lanka on November 10, as a tropical depression. After tracking northeast, the system strengthened into a cyclonic storm on November 11, as maximum sustained winds exceeded 65 km/h (40 mph). On November 12, it further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm. Later that day, the storm made landfall on Sagar Island in West Bengal with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). After moving inland, it rapidly weakened and dissipated over Bangladesh on November 12.
Rough seas offshore Odisha caused two fishing trawlers to collide, resulting in 18 fatalities, while two additional trawlers were reported missing. In West Bengal, the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall. Throughout India, 124 deaths were confirmed. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Bangladesh impacted many cities and villages, including the capital city of Dhaka, forcing thousands to evacuate. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150 men sank offshore Bangladesh, with only 11 reaching safety. Eight additional boats with 60 occupants were reported missing. One death was reported in Bangladesh after a man attempted to cross a swollen river. Overall, there were 49 fatalities in Bangladesh. The storm was attributed to at least 173 fatalities in India, Bangladesh, and offshore areas.
Meteorological history.
Around 0300 UTC on November 10, a depression developed in the southwestern Bay of Bengal. Three hours later, a bulletin from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicated that BOB 04 formed about 265 km (165 mi) east-southeast of Chennai, India. The system steadily intensified and headed northeastward. At 1200 UTC on November 11, the depression reached gale force and was upgraded to Cyclonic Storm BOB 04. At that time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on Tropical Cyclone 03B. Further strengthening briefly slowed later on November 11. However, early on the following day, the storm resumed intensification. 
At 0600 UTC on November 12, BOB 04 became a severe cyclonic storm and reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 100 km/h (65 mph), in addition to an estimated minimum barometric pressure of . However, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Kolkata, India bulletin at 0530 UTC on November 12, reported maximum sustained winds of only 55-75 km/h (35-45 mph). At 0900 UTC on November 12, it made landfall near Sagar Island, West Bengal with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). Shortly after moving inland, the storm rapidly weakened to a depression. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm at 1200 UTC on November 12, while it was centered about 200 km (125 mi) northeast of Kolkata. However, the IMD tracked the cyclone until about six hours later, at which time it dissipated over eastern India.
Impact.
As the storm approached, residents of low-lying areas were advised to seek shelter. According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones. Additionally, district authorities collected food, water, and other essential emergency supplies. Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two trawlers to collide, resulting in 18 fatalities; their bodies were later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional trawlers were reported missing. Nine fishing trawlers sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66 fishermen accounted for. Initially, as many as 600 were estimated to have been missing, though 250 people swam back to Digha, where most of them received treatment at either a medical clinic or a hospital. According to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, 111 people were still missing offshore West Bengal by late on November 12. Forty-nine fatalities were confirmed offshore India, while two deaths occurred inland in West Bengal. Later, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters raised the death toll to 124.
Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior officials in Dhaka and coastal districts to prepare for the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24 ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel. In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150 men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60 people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November 15, 47 fishing vessels were still unaccounted for. A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.
Overall, the storm resulted in 173 confirmed fatalities. Officials in West Bengal accused the meteorological offices of issuing warnings too late, as most of the fishermen were already in deep sea areas. Immediately following the storm, the Indian Red Cross Society and the Participating National Societies began to assess the situation and plan. At a warehouse in Salt Lake City, Kolkata, the Indian Red Cross Society prepared to distribute 2,000 tarpaulins, 2,000 blankets, 200 kitchen sets, and 20,000 mosquito nets.

Randolph Tower

Randolph Tower, formerly known as the Steuben Club Building, is a historic Gothic Revival skyscraper in Downtown Chicago. The building was constructed in 1929 and designed by architect Karl M. Vitzthum, who designed another Chicago landmark, the historic One North LaSalle Building.
Randolph Tower was built for the Steuben Club of Chicago to promote German-American heritage. After the first World War, American citizens of German descent sought to clubs to serve as a testimonial of their loyalty to the ideals of American citizenship. The first 25 floors were built for retail and offices and the club was located at the top floors. Several of the tenants were also club members.
Randolph Tower is recognizable for its terra-cotta clad exterior and was depicted in the 2009 film "Public Enemies" as a hangout for the main character, John Dillinger, who dated one of the coat-check girls. The city of Chicago designated the structure a landmark on July 26, 2006. On May 22, 2007, the building was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Central Chicago. Randolph Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 2007. In 2011, the building began receiving an exterior renovation and remolding of the interior by Randolph Tower Development Company where it is now used as an apartment building with 312 apartments. The renovation was completed in 2012.

Aztec creator gods

In Aztec mythology, the Creator-Gods are the only four sons of the creator couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl "Lord and Lady of Duality", "Lord and Lady of the Near and the Close", "Father and Mother of the Gods", "Father and Mother of us all", who received the gift of the creation to create other living beings without childbearing, they are residing atop a mythical thirty heaven Ilhuicatl-Omeyocan"the place of duality".
Each of the four sons takes a turn as Sun, these suns are the sun of earth, the sun of air, the sun of fire, the sun of water (Tlaloc, rain god replaces Xipe-Totec). Each world is destroyed. The present era, the Fifth Sun is ushered in when a lowly god, Nanahuatzin sacrifices himself in fire and becomes Tonatiuh, the Fifth Sun. In his new position of power he refuses to go into motion until the gods make sacrifice to him. In an elaborate ceremony, Quetzalcoatl cuts the hearts out of each of the gods and offers it to Tonatiuh (and the moon Meztli). All of this occurs in the ancient and sacred, pre-Aztec city of Teotihuacan. It is predicted that eventually, like the previous epochs, this one will come to a cataclysmic end.
List.
Tezcatlipoca.
Tezcatlipoca was generally represented with a stripe of black paint across his face and an obsidian mirror in place of one of his feet. The post-Classic (after ad 900) Maya-Quiche people of Guatemala revered him as a lightning god under the name Hurakan ("One Foot"). Other representations show Tezcatlipoca with his mirror on his chest. In it he saw everything; invisible and omnipresent, he knew all the deeds and thoughts of humans.
By Aztec times (14th–16th century ad), Tezcatlipoca's manifold attributes and functions had brought him to the summit of the divine hierarchy, where he ruled together with Huitzilopochtli, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl. Called Yoalli Ehecatl ("Night Wind"), Yaotl ("Warrior"), and Telpochtli ("Young Man"), he was said to appear at crossroads at night to challenge warriors. He presided over the telpochcalli ("young men's houses"), district schools in which the sons of the common people received an elementary education and military training. He was the protector of slaves and severely punished masters who ill-treated "Tezcatlipoca's beloved children". He rewarded virtue by bestowing riches and fame, and he chastised wrongdoers by sending them sickness (as leprosy) or by reducing them to poverty and slavery. The main rite of Tezcatlipoca's cult took place during Toxcatl, the fifth ritual month. Every year at that time the priest selected a young and handsome war prisoner. For one year he lived in princely luxury, impersonating the god. Four beautiful girls dressed as goddesses were chosen as his companions. On the appointed feast day, he climbed the steps of a small temple while breaking flutes that he had played. At the top he was sacrificed by the removal of his heart.
Xipe-Totec.
Representations of Xipe-Totec first appeared at Xollalpan, near Teotihuacan, and at Texcoco, in connection with the Mazapan culture—that is, during the post-Classic Toltec phase (9th–12th century ad). The Aztecs adopted his cult during the reign of Axayacatl (1469–81). During Tlacaxipehualiztli ("Flaying of Men"), the second ritual month of the Aztec year, the priests killed human victims by removing their hearts. They flayed the bodies and put on the skins, which were dyed yellow and called teocuitlaquemitl ("golden clothes"). Other victims were fastened to a frame and put to death with arrows; their blood dripping down was believed to symbolize the fertile spring rains. A hymn sung in honour of Xipe-Totec called him Yoalli Tlauana ("Night Drinker") because beneficent rains fell during the night; it thanked him for bringing the Feathered Serpent, who was the symbol of plenty, and for averting drought.
Quetzalcoatl.
One important body of myths describes Quetzalcoatl as the priest-king of Tula, the capital of the Toltecs. He never offered human victims, only snakes, birds, and butterflies. But the god of the night sky, Tezcatlipoca, expelled him from Tula by performing feats of black magic. Quetzalcoatl wandered down to the coast of the "divine water" (the Atlantic Ocean) and then immolated himself on a pyre, emerging as the planet Venus. According to another version, he embarked upon a raft made of snakes and disappeared beyond the eastern horizon. The legend of the victory of Tezcatlipoca over the Feathered Serpent probably reflects historical fact. The first century of the Toltec civilization was dominated by the Teotihuacan culture, with its inspired ideals of priestly rule and peaceful behaviour. The pressure of the northern immigrants brought about a social and religious revolution, with a military ruling class seizing power from the priests. Quetzalcoatl's defeat symbolized the downfall of the Classic theocracy. His sea voyage to the east should probably be connected with the invasion of Yucatán by the Itza, a tribe that showed strong Toltec features. Quetzalcoatl's calendar name was Ce Acatl (One Reed). As the god of learning, of writing, and of books, Quetzalcoatl was particularly venerated in the calmecac, religious colleges annexed to the temples, in which the future priests and the sons of the nobility were educated. Outside of Tenochtitlan, the main centre of Quetzalcoatl's cult was Cholula, on the Puebla plateau.
Huitzilopochtli.
Representations of Huitzilopochtli usually show him as a hummingbird or as a warrior with armour and helmet made of hummingbird feathers. In a pattern similar to that found in many hummingbirds, his legs, arms, and the lower part of his face were painted one color (blue) and the upper half of his face was another (black). He wore an elaborate feathered headdress and brandished a round shield and a turquoise snake. Huitzilopochtli is presented as the deity who guided the long migration the Aztecs undertook from Aztlan, their traditional home, to the Valley of Mexico. During the journey his image, in the form of a hummingbird, was carried upon the shoulders of priests, and at night his voice was heard giving orders. The Aztecs believed that the sun god needed daily nourishment (tlaxcaltiliztli) in the form of human blood and hearts and that they, as people of the sun, were required to provide Huitzilopochtli with his sustenance.
The legend of Huitzilopochtli is recorded in the Mexicayotl Chronicle. His sister, Coyolxauhqui, tried to kill their mother because she became pregnant in a shameful way (by a ball of feathers). Her offspring, Huitzilopochtli, learned of this plan while still in the womb, and before it was put into action, sprang from his mother's womb fully grown and fully armed. He then killed his sister Coyolxauhqui and many of his 400 brothers. He tossed his sister's head into the sky, where it became the moon, so that his mother would be comforted in seeing her daughter in the sky every night. He threw his other brothers and sisters into the sky, where they became the stars. For the reconsecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, dedicated to Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 20,400 prisoners over the course of four days. While accepted by some scholars, this claim also has been considered Aztec propaganda. There were 19 altars in the city of Tenochtitlan.

Sir Edward Wotton

Sir Edward Wotton (1489–1551), was the Treasurer of Calais and a privy councillor to Edward VI of England.
Life.
Edward first appears in the commission of the peace for Kent on 2 June 1524; subsequently his name was generally included in the commissions of the peace, of gaol delivery, and oyer and terminer for the county. He was knighted before 22 April 1528, and on 9 November 1529 was appointed sheriff of Kent. He accompanied Henry VIII to Calais in 1532, landing on 11 Oct., officiated at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1534, and at the christening of Edward VI in 1537. He was again sheriff of Kent in 1535–6, and in December 1539 was one of the knights sent to Calais to receive Anne of Cleves. He seems to have eagerly adopted the principles of the Reformation, and in September 1538 a correspondent told Heinrich Bullinger that Wotton had received one of the reformer's books "with the greatest satisfaction, and is diligently engaged upon it." In July 1540 Henry VIII intimated his intention of reviving the office of treasurer of Calais, and appointing to it his trusty "councillor" Sir Edward Wotton, whose patent was dated 24 Nov. following. The phrase does not necessarily imply that Wotton was a member of the English privy council, and he is not recorded as attending any of its meetings during Henry's reign. After the conclusion of the war with France he served on the various commissions appointed in 1548 for delimiting Henry's conquest, the Boulonnais. According to Raphael Holinshed, Henry VIII made Wotton lord chancellor; the offer, improbable in any case, is more likely to have been made to Sir Edward's brother Nicholas.
Henrv VIII nominated Wotton one of his executors and a privy councillor to his son Edward, though Wotton's official superior at Calais, Lord Cobham, was neither. Wotton remained a privy councillor when Somerset reconstructed the council in March 1546-7, but his duties at Calais prevented his frequent attendance at the council board. In April he was again made a commissioner to settle the disputes as to the frontier of the Boulonnais, and the growing hostility of France kept him busy with preparations for defence. On 13 March 1547-8, however, he signed the council's letter ordering the administration of the sacrament in one kind only, and on 17 January 1548-9 joined in proceedings against Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September following he again came over to take part in Warwick's scheme for overthrowing Somerset. He was lodging in Warwick Lane, Holborn, on the 18th, he signed the council's manifesto against the Protector on 6 October, and accompanied the other councillors to Windsor six days later, when Somerset was arrested. In November he appears to have returned to Calais, but a year later he was again in attendance at the council. Hasted states that be died on 8 November 1550, but he attended the council on the 22nd of that month, and in January 1550-1 was suppressing disorder in Kent. In the same year also he was included in various commissions among which the young king proposed to divide the work of the privy council. Apparently it was on 8 November 1561 that he died. He was buried in Boughton Malherbe church.
Personal.
Wotton was born in 1489. He was the eldest son of Sir Robert Wotton, by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir Henry Belkman. Sir Robert was grandson of Nicholas Wotton (1372–1448), who was sheriff in 1400 and lord mayor in 1415, and again in 1430, and represented the city in parliament continuously from 1406 to 1429.
Robert acquired the manor of Boughton Malherbe, Kent, by his marriage with Joan, only daughter and heir of Robert Corbie of that place, and was succeeded by his son Nicholas, who died on 9 April 1481. The latter's son. Sir Robert, born in 1465, was knighted by Edward IV, served as Sheriff of Kent in 1498-9, was made lieutenant of Guianes, and from 1510 to 1519 was knight-porter of Calais. He left issue two sons, Edward Wotton and Dr. Nicholas Wotton, and three daughters. Edward's sister Margaret was the second wife of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset.
Sir Edward Wotton married, first, Dorothy, fourth daughter of Sir Robert Rede (she died on 8 Sept. 1529); and he married, secondly, Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Dymoke and widow of Sir John Rudaton, lord mayor of London. By her Wotton had no issue, but by his first wife he was father of Thomas Wotton (1521–1587).

UK Public Affairs Council

The UK Public Affairs Council (UKPAC) is a United Kingdom organisation enabling self-regulation of individuals engaged in UK lobbying activities.
The UKPAC was established in 2010 by the Association of Professional Political Consultants, the Public Relations Consultants Association and the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, and held its first meeting in July 2010, chaired by Elizabeth France. However, the PRCA resigned from the UKPAC less than 18 months later, in December 2011.
The UKPAC maintains a register of individual lobbyists, first published on 1 March 2011, though the initial completeness and accuracy of the web-based register was much criticised, and was a factor in the PRCA's resignation. The Alliance for Lobbying Transparency also criticised the register, saying an estimated 85-90% of lobbyists were shunning it, and highlighting criticisms by Austin Mitchell MP and others.

Marcus Mariota

Marcus Ardel Taulauniu Mariota (born October 30, 1993) is an American football quarterback for the University of Oregon football team.
Early life.
Mariota is of Samoan descent. He was born in Honolulu to Toa Mariota and Alana Deppe-Mariota. He grew up idolizing the quarterback play of Jeremiah Masoli, who was also a standout quarterback at St. Louis High and the University of Oregon.
High school career.
Mariota was relatively unknown late in his high school career due to not starting until his senior season. As a senior, he led St. Louis to an 11-1 record and the state title while being named PrepStar Magazine All-West Region and Interscholastic League of Honolulu Offensive Player of the Year. Mariota threw for 2,597 yards on 165 of 225 passing attempts (64.7%), including 32 touchdowns against only five interceptions. He also rushed the ball 60 times for 455 yards (7.6 yards per carry) and 7 touchdowns. Marcus was named to the NUC All World Game alongside Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel.
High School Awards & Honors
Recruitment<br>
Mariota attended an Oregon football camp in the summer of 2010, which allowed Mark Helfrich, Oregon's then offensive coordinator, to be one of the first recruiters to discover Mariota. After the camp, Helfrich visited Mariota in Hawaii to watch the somewhat unrecognized quarterback practice going into his senior season. Helfrich called Chip Kelly during the visit and they made the decision to immediately offer Mariota a scholarship, despite never starting a varsity game.
After his senior season, he was rated the No. 2 recruiting prospect in the state of Hawaii and No. 12 dual-threat quarterback in the nation by Rivals.com. He was recruited by Oregon, Hawaii, Memphis, Utah, Oregon State, Washington, Arizona, Notre Dame, UCLA and USC but was only offered a scholarship by Memphis and Oregon.
College career.
2012 Season.
After redshirting the 2011 season, 2012 showcased Mariota as the first freshman to start a season opener for the Ducks in 22 seasons. He led Oregon to a 12-1 record and the #2 final season ranking while being named Pac-12 All-Conference 1st Team, Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year, and earning the 2013 Fiesta Bowl Offensive MVP Award as he guided the Ducks to a 35-17 victory over #5 Kansas State.
Starting in all 13 games, Mariota threw for 2,677 yards on 230 of 336 passing attempts (68.5%), including 32 touchdowns against only 6 interceptions. He also rushed the ball 106 times for 752 yards (7.1 yards per carry) and 5 touchdowns. His athletic versatility was exhibited against Arizona State, when he caught a touchdown pass, threw a touchdown pass, and then ran for an 86-yard touchdown, achieving all three scores with 12 minutes still left in first half.
2013 Season.
Mariota earned Pac-12 All-Conference 1st Team honors for the second consecutive year after setting a Pac-12 record from the end of the 2012 season into the 2013 season by attempting 353 passes without an interception. Starting in all 13 games, he completed 245 of 386 passing attempts (63.5%) for 3,665 yards with 31 touchdowns and only four interceptions, while rushing for 715 yards (7.4 yards per carry) and nine touchdowns.
Mariota suffered a partial tear of the MCL against UCLA on October 26th but continued to play the remainder of the season. After Oregon’s 8-0 start, Mariota was featured on the national cover of the November 4th, 2013 issue of Sports Illustrated as the favorite to win the Heisman trophy before the #2 ranked Ducks fell to #6 Stanford on November 7th. Despite Oregon's 11-2 season record and top-ten ranking, Mariota’s sophomore season was considered a letdown after the Ducks failed to reach a BCS bowl birth for the first time since the 2008 season.
After a loss to Arizona on Nov. 23, Oregon’s first loss to an unranked opponent since 2008, Mariota and the Ducks bounced back to beat rival Oregon State 36-35 in the Civil War. Mariota threw a touchdown pass to Josh Huff with 29 seconds remaining to give Oregon the come from behind victory over the Beavers.
Mariota guided the Ducks to their third consecutive bowl victory, beating Texas 30-7 in the 2013 Alamo Bowl while being honored as the game's Offensive MVP after rushing for 133 yards on 15 carries and finishing with 386 total yards. He finished the season with 4,380 yards of total offense, becoming the only player in Oregon history to eclipse 4,000 yards in a season.

<doc id="36835637" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36835637" title="Caludon Castle">
Caludon Castle

Caludon Castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade I listed building in Coventry, in the West Midlands of England. A second moated site to the south is a Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right. The castle is now a ruin, and all that remains is a large fragment of sandstone wall. What remains of the estate is now an urban park, owned and run by Coventry City Council, but much of it was sold and developed into housing estates in the early 20th century.
The site has been occupied since at least the 11th century CE. The original building, pre-dating the Norman conquest of England, was a large house, which became the property of the Earl of Chester after the conquest. The house was given to the Segrave family in the 13th century, and was first described as a manor in 1239. A license for crenellation was granted in 1305, at which point the house is thought to have been re-styled as a castle. Another license was received in 1354, and the property was again rebuilt. In the 14th century, it came into the possession of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who was banished in 1398, after which the castle fell into disrepair. Mowbray's son, John, inherited the building, and it remained in the Mowbray family until 1481, when it passed to William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley. It was rebuilt again circa 1580, this time as a mansion, having lain derelict since Mowbray's banishment. The castle was all but destroyed in 1662, and remained in ruins until 1800, when the remains were used in the construction of a farmhouse on the site.
The estate was divided up and much of it sold in 1815, and remained in the hands of multiple private owners until most of the land was purchased by the Coventry Corporation after the First World War and used for housing developments.
Architecture.
The remains of the Caludon estate are today located in Wyken, a suburban area to the east of Coventry city centre. However, until portions of it were sold off in the 19th century, the estate was much more expansive. The estate was historically a detached part of St. Michael's parish, but was transferred to Wyken in 1884, which in turn was absorbed into the City of Coventry in 1928. The original boundary of the estate ran from Sowe Bridge (now known as Clifford Bridge, ) over the River Sowe in the south-east to high ground near Stoke Heath in the north-west.
The original castle was in an oval shape, surrounded by a defensive wall, including towers, and a moat. Entrance was via a gatehouse and bridge on the east side. Most living quarters were to the north and west sides of the enclosure, while kitchens and offices were to the south and east. Several farm buildings, associated with the castle, lay just outside the moat, along with a bowling green, gardens, and a three-acre field known as "the pool". When the property was converted to a mansion, circa 1580, many outbuildings were recorded as still standing, including a porter's lodge and brewing house.
A survey conducted in 2008 found the foundations of a rectangular building, oriented north-north-west, thought to be the remains of a large hall, 33 x 13 metres (108 x 43 feet). To the north of the hall the survey found magnetic anomalies representing a complex of living buildings styled as a manor house. The same survey also found large magnetic anomalies in the eastern part of the site, which could be buried rubble from the demolition of a farmhouse, or the remains of in-filled cellars which are believed to have been built on the site. Evidence of a footpath around the interior of the site was also discovered. Given the evidence found, it is likely that the anomalies represent more than one phase of construction, though this could not be conclusively proven with the methods used.
A moat, approximately 190 metres (620 feet) to the south of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely around the time of the rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.
History.
The site was originally occupied by a house, which pre-dated the Norman conquest of England. After the conquest, it came into the possession of the Earls of Chester. Circa 1232, Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester gave the house to Stephen de Segrave, who served as Chief Justiciar of England. His son, Gilbert de Segrave, inherited the property, and passed it on to his son, Nicholas de Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave, who was created Baron Segrave. The house was first described as a manor in 1239, and, at that time, was the only permanent nobleman's residence in Coventry. The Caludon estate expanded slightly into Wyken, to the north, in 1279 when Nicholas de Segrave purchased a carucate and mill.
The house was likely rebuilt as a castle in 1305, when John de Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave, Nicholas' son, was granted a license by King Edward I of England to crenellate the property (decorating a parapet with rectangular gaps in the wall through which archers could fire; largely a status symbol by that time) and to build a moat and wall. The property was also extended with a chapel and several outbuildings at around the same time. Further rebuilding was undertaken in 1354, when another license to crenellate was received. In the second half of the 14th century, the castle was inherited by Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who, in 1398, accused Henry of Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV) of treason against King Richard II. The two noblemen were to take part in a duel at Gosford Green, between Caludon Castle and Coventry, but Richard III banished both before the duel could take place. After Henry took the throne, he stripped Mowbray of the dukedom, and Mowbray died in exile shortly afterwards. Mowbray was succeeded by John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, who was restored to the dukedom.
The property remained in the Mowbray family until the death of Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk (the child bride of Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York) in 1481. Anne's estate was divided between John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk and William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley, of whom the latter took possession of Caludon Castle. It lay derelict from shortly after Mowbray's banishment until the late 16th century (circa 1580), when it was rebuilt by Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley in the style of a mansion. A large banqueting hall was added later by Elizabeth (née Stanhope), wife of George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley. The latter kept the house until 1632, when he sold it to Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet. It passed from Morgan to Sir John Preston through the latter's marriage to Morgan's daughter and co-heir, Jane. The house was badly damaged in 1662 when King Charles II took revenge on Coventry for its heavily parliamentarian sympathies in the English Civil War. Their son, Sir Thomas Preston, inherited the estate, and upon his death in 1709 it passed to his daughter, Anne and her husband, Hugh Clifford, 2nd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. The Cliffords retained the property, using the ruins of the castle to build a large farmhouse in 1800, until 1815, when the estate was divided up and much of it sold. The estate was then held by various private owners until after the First World War, when the Coventry Corporation purchased much of it and developed the area into suburban housing estates.
Modern day.
The castle is now a ruin, and all that remains above ground is a large grey sandstone wall, which has been the only remnant of any building on the site since at least the early 18th century. It includes two large tracery windows, decorated by red sandstone, which stand out against the grey. Red sandstone also appears at both ends of the walls, suggesting at least two more windows, and meaning that the wall would have been at least twice the length of the surviving fragment when built. Beneath the large windows are two smaller ones, suggestive of an undercroft, and a flue runs between the sets of windows. The wall fragment is thought to be 14th century, likely dating from the reconstruction in 1354.
The castle is now situated in a small urban park called Caludon Castle Park, owned and managed by Coventry City Council. The moat is now dry, and at least part of it is filled in, but parts are still visible, along with other earthworks. The remaining wall is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, as is the moated site to the south. Since 1955, the wall has also had Grade I listed building status.

Benjamin Jackson (soldier)

Benjamin Jackson (January 2, 1835 – August 20, 1915) was a Nova Scotian who became a sailor, farmer, and decorated American Civil War soldier.
Early years.
Jackson was born at Lockhartville, Nova Scotia, a small village near Hantsport. He married Rachel Cartier of Windsor, and together they had five children. 
When Jackson was a young man, Nova Scotia was experiencing a shipbuilding boom. At nearby Hantsport, a major shipbuilding centre and port, Jackson readily found work as a sailor aboard several vessels.
American Civil War.
In 1864 he sailed to the United States, during the Civil War. Jackson took the opportunity to fight for the Union Army by substituting for a Lewis Saunders (during the War individuals such as Saunders who were drafted into the army could pay to have a substitute go in their place.) On May 21, 1864, Jackson enlisted in the US Navy and soon found himself aboard the USS Richmond assigned as the captain of the #10 gun crew. The Richmond was assigned to patrol and blockade the Mississippi River. Jackson took part in the Battle of Mobile Bay in August 1864. During the battle he retrieved a grenade that had landed on deck and threw it overboard before it could explode. Mobile Bay was littered with torpedoes (during the Civil War a device similar to a contact mine) and Jackson disarmed a number of these which threatened Union vessels. Unfortunately one of the torpedoes exploded wounding Jackson. After convalescing in hospital, Jackson was discharged on June 2, 1865. He earned the Civil War Campaign Medal and was entitled to receive a pension from the US Government. 
Jackson returned to Nova Scotia where he operated a small farm and went to sea again as a sailor aboard ships owned by Ezra Churchill of Hantsport. 
Jackson died on August 20, 1915 and was buried at Lockhartville, Nova Scotia in an unmarked grave.
Legacy.
The Ben Jackson Road (exit 8A Highway 101) in Nova Scotia is named in his honour. 
On June 12, 2010, in a ceremony attended by approximately 400 people, including Civil War reenactment soldiers, Jackson's grave site was marked with a commemorative stone.

1979 European Competition for Women's Football

The 1979 European Competition for Women's Football was a women's football tournament contested by European nations. It took place in Italy from 19 to 27 July 1979.
The tournament featured 12 teams, with games staged in Naples and Rimini. Considered unofficial because it was not run under the auspices of UEFA, it was a precursor to the UEFA Women's Championship. Denmark won the tournament, beating hosts Italy 2–0 in the final at Stadio San Paolo.
Tournament review.
Economically, the tournament was not a success:
In the late 1970s the issue of international tournaments for women's football teams was contentious. The international governing body International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) refused several requests to sanction independently organised tournaments, declaring that such matters "were only possible through the National Association and the Confederations." Writing in 2007, Jean Williams observed that "The fact that they had been busy not organising these events seems to have escaped [FIFA's] notice. According to Williams, FIFA's bureaucratic suppression of women's football was becoming unsustainable: "By the 1970s it simply wasn't a viable option for FIFA to ignore women playing the game and hope that they would go away."
The European Confederation, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), displayed little enthusiasm for women's football and were particularly hostile to Italy's independent women's football federation. Sue Lopez, a member of England's squad, contended that a lack of female representation in UEFA was a contributory factor:
At a conference on 19 February 1980 UEFA resolved to launch its own competition for women's national teams. The meeting minutes had registered the 1979 competition as a "cause for concern".
Results.
First round.
The top team in each group advanced to the semi-finals.
Knockout stage.
Final.
After a goalless first half, Denmark took the lead 10 minutes into the second period through 18–year–old striker Lone Smidt Hansen (who later became Lone Smidt Nielsen through marriage). Inge Hindkjær secured Denmark's victory with her fourth goal of the tournament, four minutes from full-time. After the tournament, the Danish Football Association (DBU) were subject to media criticism for their failure to properly develop women's football.

Anaphalis triplinervis

Anaphalis triplinervis is a species of flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the family Asteraceae or Compositae, native to the Himalayas and South West China. Grey-green felted leaves produce sprays of small white flowers.
The plants with their veined leaves are valued as groundcover, and the blooms as dried flowers, hence the common name "triple-veined pearly everlasting". This plant and the cultivar 'Sommerschnee' ('Summer Snow') have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Garden and Landscape Uses.
Pearly everlastings are suitable for flower beds and less formal areas. They provide attractive, but not brilliant displays of bloom in late summer and fall. The flowers are useful for cutting and are easily prepared for dried arrangements. This is done by cutting them before they attain their fullest opening and before the whiteness of the stems and foliage begins to dim, tying the stems in small bundles, and hanging them in a cool, airy, shaded place. It is not uncommon to color the dried flowers by dipping them in dyes. 
Cultivation.
Pearly everlastings thrive with little care in sunny locations where the soil is thoroughly well drained and tends to be dryish rather than wet. They are easily increased by division in early spring, and can be raised from seeds. Dividing in fall is likely to result in winter losses. On poor soils these plants benefit from a spring application of a complete garden fertilizer, but this is unnecessary where the soil is reasonably fertile. Old plants that show signs of deterioration should be dug up, divided, and replanted in fall or spring. This may be needed every third or fourth year.

Levi Cooper Lane

Levi Cooper Lane (May 9, 1828 – February 9, 1902) was a physician and surgeon in San Francisco in the 1800s. He established the Cooper Medical College, forerunner to the Stanford University School of Medicine, as well as laying the groundwork for Stanford's medical library and the Stanford School of Nursing. The University's medical library is still named Lane Medical Library in his honor.
Early life and education.
Lane was born in Somerville, Ohio on May 9, 1828. He attended Farmer's College near Cincinnati and received an MA degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York City.
He received a medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1851. He interned for four years and then served in the U.S. Navy as an Assistant Surgeon from 1855 to 1859. 
Early career.
He then settled in San Francisco, where his uncle, Elias Samuel Cooper, also a physician, had just established the first medical college on the West Coast of the United States in 1858. The medical school was chartered by the College of the Pacific (now the University of the Pacific). It was called the Medical Department of the College of the Pacific and was staffed entirely by local practicing physicians. Cooper served as president and chief surgeon; Lane became a faculty member.
After Cooper's death in 1862, the Medical Department ceased operation. Lane and other faculty members began teaching at the newly established Toland Medical College (later the University of California, San Francisco) instead.
Later career.
Lane wanted to revive his uncle's college and in 1870 he succeeded in reopening it. He served as president and recruited some of Cooper's former faculty members as instructors. The school was affiliated with University College, later the San Francisco Theological Seminary, and the name was changed to the Medical College of the Pacific. 
Lane had bigger plans for the school, and in 1882 he renamed it Cooper Medical College, after his uncle, the founder. He moved it to a new brick building at Sacramento and Webster Streets which he had personally financed. He also built Lane Hospital and a nursing school, and made provision in his will for the construction of a freestanding medical library. 
Death and legacy.
Lane died on February 9, 1902, and his widow died that August; one third of Lane's estate was bequeathed to Cooper Medical College to establish a medical library. In 1908, Stanford acquired Cooper Medical College as the nucleus for the Stanford Medical Department, now the Stanford University School of Medicine. 
In 1910, Stanford also acquired the assets of the Levi C. Lane Medical Library Trust, consisting of 30,000 volumes as well as a building site and funds for the building of a library. Lane Library was dedicated November 3, 1912, on the southeast corner of Webster and Sacramento Streets, across the street from the medical school. By then the medical school had become the Stanford University Department of Medicine. The medical school and Lane Library were moved to the main Stanford campus in 1959.

Vũ Ngọc Nhạ

Vũ Ngọc Nhạ (Thái Bình, 3 March 1928 - Ho Chi Minh City, 7 August 2002) was a Vietnamese communist spy who served as an advisor to South Vietnamese presidents Ngô Đình Diệm and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. 
Nhạ served with the Viet Minh during French-Indochina War, and transferred South after the Geneva Accord in 1954. In Vũng Tàu, Nhạ met Hoang Quyen, an anti-communist priest who recommended him to the Ngo brothers. He served on the presidential staff from 1957 until 1969. In 1968, Nha warned the communists that the U.S. planned to curtail the annual Tết ceasefire. During the Tet offensive he opened presidential wine cellar so that the palace guards would become drunk. Assuming that the wine was distributed to improve morale, Thieu commended Nha when he returned to the palace a few days later. In 1969, a probe by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exposed Nha as a spy. He was handed over to North Vietnam in 1973 as part of a prisoner exchange. His story received little attention at the time and is known mainly from the book "Ông cố vấn" (The Advisor) by Hữu Mai, which was published in 1989.

89th New York State Legislature

The 89th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 2 to April 20, 1866, during the second year of Reuben E. Fenton's governorship, in Albany.
Background.
Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county. 
At this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
Elections.
The New York state election, 1865 was held on November 7. All ten statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Secretary of State, was: Republicans 301,000 and Democrats 273,000.
Sessions.
The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 2, 1866; and adjourned on April 20.
Lyman Tremain (R) was elected Speaker with 88 votes against 33 for Smith M. Weed (D).
On January 29, DeWitt C. Littlejohn (R) was elected Speaker pro tempore of the Assembly.
On February 6, Charles J. Folger (R) was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.
On February 16, the Legislature elected Benjamin F. Manierre (R) to succeed William McMurray (D) on March 1 as a Metropolitan Police Commissioner.
On April 16, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly seats per county. Allegany, Chenango, Herkimer, Jefferson, Livingston, Steuben and Suffolk counties lost one seat each; Erie County gained one seat, Kings County gained two seats; and New York County gained four seats.
On April 25, the Legislature re-apportioned the Senate districts.
The State Senate met for a special session on June 12; adjourned on June 15; met again on August 28; and adjourned again on August 31. This session was called to hold the trial of George W. Smith, Judge of the Oneida County Court. The trial continued during the next session, and Smith was removed from office on January 25, 1867.

Willie van Niekerk

Willem (Willie) Abraham van Niekerk (29 June 1937, Pretoria – 8 August 2009) was a South African physician, professor, and politician. Niekerk was Minister of Health in the government of P. W. Botha from 1985 to 1989 and Administrator-General of South West Africa from 1983 to 1985. He specialized in cytogenetics, cell biology, gynecology, and obstetrics.
Biography.
Van Niekerk was born in Pretoria and grew up on the family farm located in the Orange Free State. After high school, he studied medicine and surgery at the University of Pretoria, graduating in 1959. He worked as a researcher for the Roswell Park Memorial Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York in the United States, before returning to South Africa in 1960 where he worked at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pretoria.
In 1965, he became a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG) in London. Van Niekerk became a Fellow of the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRCOG) in 1971. In 1969, he was appointed a lecturer/consultant at the University of Pretoria where he taught. In 1970, he moved to the University of Stellenbosch where he was given a full professorship and made Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. 
Van Niekerk left the University of Stellenbosch in 1982 to enter politics. He renounced his presidency of the International Academy of Cytology in 1983, and was appointed administrator of South-West Africa. He was appointed Minister of Health and Population Development in the Cabinet of P. W. Botha from 1985 until 1989 and served on the President's Council from 1989.
In 1992 as the National Party began to lose its grip on power, Niekerk left politics to return to the private sector as a Gynaecologist in the suburbs of Cape Town. He retired in 2004.
Van Niekerk is the author of over 27 publications on cytology, cytogenetics, gynecology and obstetrics, gynecological pathologies. He was the first to describe the cytological appearance of cervical cells in folate deficiency, which had certain similarities with pre-neoplastic changes (Nel,JT). His doctoral thesis on hermaphroditism, published in 1972, is considered the authoritative work on the subject. He became an honorary member of the combination of the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Gynecological Society in 1981.

Corky Kell Classic

The Corky Kell Classic is an annual series of high school football games played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA. It is played at the beginning of each GHSA football season featuring 10 of the state's top teams. There are currently five games played on the first Saturday of the season starting at 9:00 am and closing with an 8:30 pm game.
History.
In 1992, former Wheeler head football coach Corky Kell came up with an idea to change Georgia high school football. He was helped by Kell High School in creating the High School Football Classic in 1992 that opened up the Georgia Dome to high school football. The games have been played in the dome every year except in 1995 and 1997 when it was played at McEachern High School. Since the opening, teams have been honored to open their seasons in the Georgia Dome while helping to raise money for the Corky Kell Scholarship Fund.
The Classic has featured both McEachern High School and Brookwood High School all 20 years. It has included other teams such as Southwest DeKalb High School, Kell High School, Chattahoochee High School, and many other of the state's top high school football programs.

Doudna earned her B.A. in Chemistry from Pomona College and her Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Harvard University on ribozymes under the mentorship of Jack W. Szostak. She did her postdoctoral work with Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Research.
While in the Szostak lab, Doudna reengineered the self-splicing Group I catalytic intron into a true catalytic ribozyme that would copy RNA templates. Recognizing the limitations of not being able see the molecular mechanisms of the ribozymes. She started work to crystallize and solve the three-dimensional structure of the Tetrahymena Group I ribozyme in 1991 in the Cech Lab and continued while she started her professorship at Yale University in 1994. While the group was able to grow high-quality crystals, they struggled with the phase problem due to unspecific binding of the metal ions. One of her early graduate students and later her husband, Jamie Cate decided to soak the crystals in osmium hexamine to imitate magnesium. Using this strategy, they were able to solve the structure, the second solved folded RNA structure since tRNA. The magnesium ions would cluster at the center of the ribozyme and would serve as a core for RNA folding similar to that of a hydrophobic core of a protein.
Doudna was promoted to the position of Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000. In 2002, she accepted a faculty position at University of California, Berkeley as a Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology so that she would be closer to family and the synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This initial work to solve large RNA structures lead to further structural studies on the HDV ribozyme, the IRES, and protein-RNA complexes like the Signal recognition particle. Her lab now focuses on obtaining a mechanistic understanding of biological processes involving RNA. This work is divided over three major areas, the CRISPR system, RNA interference, and translational control via MicroRNAs.
Honors and Awards.
Doudna was a Searle Scholar and received the 1999 NAS Award for Initiatives in Research and the 2000 Alan T. Waterman Award. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 and to the Institute of Medicine in 2010. In 2014, Doudna was awarded the Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health as well as the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research with Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier.

Fellini (band)

Fellini was a Brazilian post-punk band formed in São Paulo City, São Paulo, in 1984. It consisted of Cadão Volpato (vocals), Jair Marcos (guitar), Ricardo Salvagni (drums and percussion), and former Voluntários da Pátria and Smack member Thomas Pappon (bass and occasionally other instruments). One of the most influent bands of the Brazilian underground post-punk scene of the mid-1980s (and having a cult following to this day), they were known for their sonority that mixed post-punk with other genres such as MPB, new wave and samba rock, thus having a unique, almost non-descript musical style.
Fellini was first disestablished in 1990, but re-established in 2001 and ending once more in 2010.
History.
Fellini was founded in 1984 by Cadão Volpato, Thomas Pappon and Celso Pucci (or Minho K.), being later joined by Jair Marcos and Ricardo Salvagni. The band's name was suggested by Thomas Pappon during a brainstorm; he wanted the band to have a "weird, funny-sounding" name (in contrast to the "serious" and "gloomy" names Brazilian post-punk bands had at the time), and chose Fellini in a homage to Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini and to The Stranglers' album "Feline", one of Fellini's major influences. The band performed their first show at the now-defunct Bar Albergue, located at the 13 de Maio Street, in the "bairro" of Bixiga. However, Minho K. could not play at the gig because he was drunk at the time, passed out and could not wake up. He left the band afterwards. It is worth noting that the show was realized on a May 18, the fourth anniversary of Joy Division front-man Ian Curtis' suicide.
In late 1984, Fellini obtained a contract with independent record label Baratos Afins, and released their debut album, "O Adeus de Fellini", in 1985, which contained underground hits such as "Rock Europeu" and "Funziona Senza Vapore". It would be followed by 1986's "Fellini Só Vive 2 Vezes", 1987's "3 Lugares Diferentes" (which Cadão Volpato says it was their best album so far, and their last to be released by Baratos Afins) and 1989's "Amor Louco". However, the band broke up in 1990, with Cadão Volpato saying because he was tired of so much work, and because of his "intellectual pretensions". Also, Thomas Pappon moved to Germany (and later to England) in the same year, leaving Fellini to form alongside his wife Karla the duo The Gilbertos.
Fellini briefly regrouped in 1992, under the moniker Funziona Senza Vapore, with Stela Campos replacing Pappon. They recorded also in 1992 a homonymous obscure album, that was only released in 2002.
After an 11-year hiatus, Fellini returned in 2001, with the album "Amanhã É Tarde", and in 2003 they played at the TIM Festival alongside Beth Gibbons and Los Hermanos, subsequently doing some other sporadic shows. In 2010 they released a compilation featuring re-recordings of previous songs, "Você Nem Imagina", before breaking up again.

<doc id="36836451" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36836451" title="Modern sculpture">
Modern sculpture

Modern sculpture is generally considered to have begun with the work of Auguste Rodin, who is seen as the progenitor of modern sculpture. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works. He "dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void". Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like Edgar Degas and Paul Gauguin, Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, "arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century".
Modernist sculpture movements include Art Nouveau, Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Land art, Conceptual art, and Installation art among others.
Modernism.
The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the Rodin exhibit at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his Burghers of Calais, Balzac, Victor Hugo statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his Gates of Hell which included The Thinker.
Cubist sculpture, in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with cubist painting, and the formal experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using collage, sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze "Head of a Woman" as the first cubist sculpture. Artists like Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and Alexander Archipenko, who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 "Walking Woman" were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead. Joseph Csaky, a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.
In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his "constructions" fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was "construction" a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the "found object" (French: "objet trouvé") or "readymade" with pieces such as Fountain (1917).
Similarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his "Bird in Space" series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture. In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.
Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Ásmundur Sveinsson, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art.
Post-1950s.
Since the 1950s Modernist trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge, -high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the "Chicago Picasso". He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.
In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.
By the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero. Other Minimalists and Postminimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Ronald Bladen, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, Christo, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, and others like John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line. led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Arman, Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Manuel Neri and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were Robert Graham in a classic articulated style and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's "oversized figures" into monumental sculptures. Ceramic sculpture as practiced by Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, Stephen De Staebler, Kenneth Price, and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.
Contemporary movements.
Site specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the "land art in the American West" group of projects. These land art or "earth art" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, and Bruce Nauman, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.
Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways.
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include "One and Three Chairs", 1965, by Joseph Kosuth, and "An Oak Tree", 1973, by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys and James Turrell among others.
Postmodern sculpture occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. Rosalind Krauss identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of Land art, Minimalist sculpture, and site-specific art into the category of "sculpture":
Minimalism.
Contemporary genres.
Some modern sculpture forms are now practiced outdoors, as environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators. Light sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment. Site-specific artwork is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, Athena Tacha, and others. Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic Lucy Lippard. Land art, Earthworks, (Earth art) is an art movement that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of nature generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, soil, rocks, logs, branches, leaves, and water, as well as man made materials like Chain-link fencing, barbed wire, rope, rubber, glass, concrete, metal, asphalt, and mineral pigments. Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.
Sound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt.

Nubl

Nubl (, also spelled Nubbul or Nubbol) is a small city in northern Syria, administratively part of the Aleppo Governorate, located northwest of Aleppo. Nearby localities include al-Zahraa immediately to the south, Anadan to the southeast, Tel Rifaat to the northeast, Aqiba to the north and Barad to the west. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Nubl had a population of 21,039 in the 2004 census. Its inhabitants are predominantly Shia Muslims and together with nearby al-Zahraa, Nubl forms a small Shia-inhabited pocket in a mostly Sunni Muslim area in the Aleppo Governorate.
Syrian civil war.
Nubl and al-Zahraa have been placed under siege by the opposition Free Syrian Army (FSA) starting in July 2012. Movement out of Nubl has been severely curtailed and it currently relies on goods being airlifted by the Syrian Army. Although relations between the inhabitants of Nubl and the surrounding villages were normally friendly, during the ongoing Syrian civil war, anti-government supporters from nearby Sunni villages have claimed that Nubl and al-Zahraa hosted pro-government militias that have launched attacks against opposition supporters. There have been numerous tit-for-tat kidnappings between Nubl and pro-opposition villages in the vicinity. After months of rebel siege and continuous reciprocal kidnappings, popular committees in the two towns agreed to begin negotiations with Sunni rebels on 27 March 2013. The agreement to negotiate was organised by Kurdish parties from the neighbouring Kurd Dagh region, which is controlled by Kurdish separatists of the PYD. The talks were to be brokered by Kurds, and several kidnapped individuals had been freed on both sides.

Yogesh (lyricist)

Yogesh Gaur (born 1943) is an Indian writer and lyricist. He wrote songs for Bollywood, and is best known for songs like, "Kahin Door Jab Din Dal Jaaye" and "Zindagi Kaisi Hai Paheli" in Anand" (1971).
Life.
Yogesh was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
He moved in search of work, his cousin was a screenplay director. His first work was with Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and wrote "Kahin Door Jab Din Dal Jaaye". He wrote songs like "Zindagi Kaisi Hai Paheli" and "Rimjhim gire Saawan", "Kai baar yunhi dekha hai" from Rajnigandha and "Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha" from Baaton Baaton Mein.
Yogesh also worked in television serials as a writer.
Lyric writer Yogesh Gaur was a man in great demand among the slice-of-life filmmakers like Basu Chatterjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The story goes that Mukherjee heard the lyrics of two songs Yogesh had written for producer LB Lachman’s film, and wanted them for Anand.
"Lachmanji was adamant about keeping the songs, but Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and Mukherjee pleaded with him. Bachchan, who was a young man then, would say to me, Please get us these two songs somehow. Finally, Lachmanji relented and gave them one of the songs," says Yogesh.
The song, Kahin door jab din dhal jaaye, shot the lyricist to overnight popularity. Mukherjee was so happy he got Yogesh to pen another song for him, Zindagi kaisi yeh paheli for Anand too. Soon, the fan mail was pouring in.
"Funnily, people also sent me flowers for Maine tere liye, which was written by Gulzar," says the man, popularly known as ‘shaayar’ by actresses of that time. The nickname happened because the heroines, when they reported on the sets, would insist he recite some of his shaayari. “Producers thought the heroines were getting distracted by my poetry, especially when I waxed eloquent about their beauty,” he laughs.
Known as the ‘sensible film lyricist’, Yogesh worked primarily with Chatterjee and Mukherjee, rather than ‘masala’ filmmakers. "My problem was similar to that faced by the filmmakers themselves. My work was appreciated, but was restricted to ‘art’ films. But they were more real than arty," he says.
Working with Basu Chatterjee was not the easiest, says Yogesh. "Basuda was a master of his craft, but brainstorming sessions with him weren’t all that fun. While discussing a song for Rajnigandha, he would say, in true Bengali style: ‘Uske baad, Vidya wahan se aata hai.’ I had to stop him and ask if he meant heroine Vidya Sinha’s character or hero Amol Palekar’s. He got angry and said he was referring to Vidya. I didn’t bother explaining to him that he had actually mixed up the gender while speaking in Hindi," Yogesh says. But the collaboration was a fruitful one. Yogesh wrote some of his best songs for Chatterjee, like Kai baar yunhi dekha hai from Rajnigandha and Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha from Baaton Baaton Mein.
Incidentally, Yogesh began by writing for C-grade potboilers like Flying Circus, Marvel Men, Rustom Kaun and Husn Ka Ghulam. After arriving in Bombay from his ‘nawabi kothi’ in Lucknow, he was looked after by his cousin, screenplay writer Vijendra Gaur, for a while. He often hung around the sets, not knowing what to do. Depressed about leaving his home at a young age – he was 16 – Yogesh spent hours at Marine Drive and the Hanging Gardens brooding about his situation, and penning his thoughts. It was while sharing his diary with music composer Robin Banerjee, that he was coaxed into writing lyrics for a tune Banerjee had created. Yogesh took the job and the song got selected for a film, which never got made.
Several jam sessions with Banerjee followed, leading to six songs that were selected for Sakhi-Robin, the film that marked Yogesh’s entry into the stunt-film genre — and the industry itself. "I got Rs25 per song, and a total of Rs150. Two of the songs were played on primetime slots on Radio Ceylon. That helped," he says.
But the big league had to wait. With just enough money to shift from a jhuggi in Andheri to a chawl in Oshiwara, Yogesh couldn’t buy discs of his own compositions. He would spend hours at the home of Savita Chowdhury, wife of music composer Salil Chowdhury. “She had a jukebox, and struggling musicians would get together to listen to music on it. It was during one such session that I requested a meeting with Salilda.” 
The first time Yogesh saw Chowdhury, he was too intimidated to open his mouth.
“He lived in a room full of encyclopedias and stuff, and appeared oblivious to the world. I had to make repeated visits to make my presence felt.” The break, however, came a few months later. After the death of his regular collaborator, lyricist Shailendra, Chowdhury was looking for another writer. He gave Yogesh half an hour to write a song. Yogesh got cold feet and couldn’t think of anything.
“Salilda’s assistant laughed and said a novice like me could never do justice to Salilda’s tunes. That shook my confidence.” A dejected Yogesh walked out, but while waiting for the bus, was struck by some lines. He went back to Chowdhury, and recited them. “He started screaming out to Savitadi. I thought he would tell her how incompetent I was, and then kick me out. Instead, he told her that I had written some beautiful lyrics.
That was a moment I will never forget,” says the lyricist. It’s right up there with the time that Lata Mangeshkar complimented him on a song for the first time. Yogesh has worked in more than 100 films, and written for albums as well. His most recent work are Kuch Khatta Kuch Meetha and twofilms, which are lying in the cans “The style of working has changed. Earlier, we were given a situation and asked to write accordingly. Today, the brief is ‘superhit duet likhna hai’,” he says.

Pluteus nevadensis

Pluteus nevadensis is a species of fungus in the agaric family Pluteaceae. Described as new to science in 2010, the species is known only from subtropical and pine forests in Mexico, where it grows on rotting pine and oak wood. Fruit bodies (mushrooms) have red-orange caps up to in diameter with a shape ranging from conic, convex, or flattened, depending on their age. The silky yellow stems are up to long. It is similar in appearance to "Pluteus aurantiorugosus", with which it shares an orange- or scarlet-colored cap and a yellow stem. "P. nevadensis" can be distinguished from this and other superficially similar "Pluteus" species by differences in microscopic characteristics.
Taxonomy.
The species was described by Olivia Rodríguez in 2010 in the journal "Mycotaxon", based on collections made in 1991. The holotype material was collected on the Colima volcano, in the Municipality of Zapotlán el Grande, at an elevation of . The species was formerly referred to "Pluteus aurantiorugosus", with which it bears a close resemblance. After close examination and comparison of the two species, the authors concluded that the differences in morphology and DNA sequence were sufficient to warrant describing a new species.
According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric classification of the genus "Pluteus", the fungus belongs in the section "Celluloderma". Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-metuloid. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, that may or may not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in "Celluloderma" include "P. romellii", "P. aurantiorugosus", "P. pulverulentus", "P. thompsonii", and "P. horakianus". Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of "P. nevadensis" in "Celluloderma", and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with "P. horakianas". The specific epithet "nevadensis" refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.
Description.
The cap is in diameter, conic when young, bell-shaped to convex or plano-convex when mature, and umbonate. The cap margin is curved downward, even or slightly eroded. The red-orange cap surface is dry to moist, and wrinkled towards the margin but smooths out as it approaches the center. Sometimes there is white-yellowish flesh underneath the cap cuticle. The gills are free from attachment to the stem, crowded closely together, broad to swollen in the middle, and white or whitish when young to salmon-pinkish in age. The edge of the gill is floccose (with wool-like tufts) or fringed, and whitish. The stem, which is centrally attached to the cap, measures by , and is roughly equal in width throughout. It is smooth to slightly fibrillose (covered in small slender fibers or filaments), silky, and hollow. The color is yellow or yellowish near the top, and deep orange or with orange tinges towards the base. The base of the stem is covered with cottony whitish mycelia. The flesh of the cap is 1 mm thick or more at the center and whitish. The stem tissue is yellowish or yellow gold. Fruit bodies of "Pluteus nevadensis" have no distinctive taste or odor.
The color of the spore print is pinkish-brown. The smooth spores measure 5.5–7 by 4.5–6.5 µm, roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid in shape. Their walls are thin to slightly thickened, and almost translucent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are 22–29 by 6.5–7.5 µm (including sterigmata), club-shaped, and four-spored. They have refringent contents and are hyaline (translucent). The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 41.8–75 by 11.8–24 µm, frequent, scattered, and flask-shaped with short or elongated necks. Some pleurocystidia are somewhat fusiform (tapered on each end) or somewhat utriform (shaped like a leather bottle or flask), thin-walled, and hyaline. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 32–55 by 10–18.5 µm, crowded, and club-shaped. Some are utriform, roughly cylindrical or egg-shaped, thin walled, and hyaline. The gill tissue is convergent, meaning that the hyphae appear to converge toward the center of the tissue. The cap cuticle comprises club-shaped or sphaeropedunculate cells that measure 25.6–60 by 13.6–31.2 µm. These cells typically have a long pedicel (stalk) with a thin or slightly thickened wall, and are hyaline. The species lacks oleiferous hyphae (filled with oil-like contents) and clamp connections.
Similar species.
"Pluteus aurantiorugosus" is very similar to "P. nevadensis" in external appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. "P. aurantiorugosus" is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.
The species "Pluteus horakianus" shares with "P. nevadensis" a fragile fruit body, a red cap, and similar cystidial morphology. It differs in its orange-red gill edges, red stem, and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment. Other species with a roughly similar appearance, including "P. aurantiopustulatus", "P. aurantipes", "P. flammipes", "P. laetifrons", and "P. laetus", can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics.
Habitat and distribution.
"Pluteus nevadensis" is known only from subtropical and pine forests in the states of Guerrero and Jalisco, Mexico, where it grows on the rotting wood of pine and oak. It is one of 34 "Pluteus" species known in Mexico.

DIAL Scam

DIAL Scam, also called Delhi Airport Land Scam, Airport Scam and the IGI Scam is a title popularly used in the media to refer to the irregularities pointed out in a report titled "Implementation of Public – Private Partnership at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi" tabled on 17 August 2012 by the CAG (or the Comptroller and Auditor General of India). According to this report, 1.63 Lakh Crore (approx $29.4 billion) was lost by the people of India due to a deal entered between the Airports Authority of India and DIAL (Delhi International Airport Limited) for the lease of land.
DIAL is a consortium led by GMR (with 54% ownership, Germany's Fraport AG and Malyasia Airport Holdings. According to the report 4800 acres (approx 19 square kilometers) of land of a brownfield airport (i.e. an existing airport were allotted to DIAL of which 240 acres (approx 971,245 square meters) could be developed commercially at Rs. 100 ($1.8) every year.
The report states that the land has an earnings potential of 1.63 lakh crores (approx $29.4 billion) which was assigned to the consortium against an equity contribution of 2,450 crores (approx. $442.7 million). The report also criticizes the development fees charged to passengers of the Delhi Airport who have to pay between Rs. 400 ($7.2) and Rs. 2600 ($46.85) depending on whether they are travelling on a domestic or international flight, as this charge was not a part of the original contract. According to the report this fee gives DIAL an advantage of Rs. 3,415 crores (approx $617 million), and should have been approved by the ministry and then mentioned initially to all parties bidding for the deal. The report also mentions that DIAL carried out construction on 553,887 square meters of land while it was allotted only 470,179 square meters in the major Development Plan (MDP) which led to an increase of the projected cost by 43%.
The DIAL in its defense has stated that the amount mentioned is the simply the amount of revenue due to DIAL and does not represent actual revenues; it does not consider the time value of money and it does not mention that 46% of this revenue is due to the Airports Authority of India. The DIAL also states that the entire land allotted to it for commercial use cannot be used immediately and would have to be developed in the future and hence, the revenue earned from the one acre (approx 4046 square meters) currently in use cannot be applied to the entire parcel of land. Further more, DIAL points out that the commercial usage of land was always a part of the agreement and was not given to it as preferential treatment, and that the parceling of this land has saved the government a lot of money in stamp duties.

In addition to books, journals and documents for medical research and the teaching and practice of medicine, Lane Library houses a significant collection of material relating to the history of medicine. The library also provides specialized search capabilities, classes and tutorials, writing and grant support, and group and individual study spaces.
History.
Levi Cooper Lane was a physician and surgeon in San Francisco in the 1800s. He served on the faculty of the Medical Department of the College of the Pacific, which was the first medical school on the Pacific Coast, founded in 1858 by Lane's uncle Elias Samuel Cooper. After Cooper's death in 1862 the medical school stopped operating. In 1870 Lane revived it, became president, and renamed it Medical College of the Pacific. In 1882 he changed the name to Cooper Medical College, named for his uncle, its founder. He built with his own funds a new brick medical school building at the corner of Sacramento and Webster streets, which served continuously as a medical school from 1882 until 1959. He also built an adjacent hospital and nursing school, and made provision in his will for the construction of a library across the street from the college. 
Lane died on February 9, 1902, and his widow died in August 1902; in his widow's will, one third of Lane's estate was given to Cooper Medical College to establish a medical library. In August 1906, the directors of Cooper Medical College passed a resolution establishing the Lane Medical Library. In 1908, Stanford acquired Cooper Medical College as the nucleus for the Stanford Medical Department, now the Stanford University School of Medicine. In 1910 Stanford also acquired the assets of the Levi C. Lane Medical Library Trust, consisting of 30,000 volumes as well as a building site and funds for the building of a library. Lane Library was dedicated November 3, 1912. It was an integral part of the Stanford library system despite being located in San Francisco. It was the largest medical library west of Chicago. The building still stands; it now houses the California Pacific Medical Center Health Sciences Library. The medical school and Lane Library were moved to the main Stanford campus in 1959.

The Only Solution

The Only Solution is the fifth album by Cold 187um and his first and only album for Psychopathic Records. Released on October 22, 2012, it is a concept album, focusing on the story of a hired killer, the "Psychopathic Assassin", as he performs his job and pursues revenge against his uncle, Black Swan, who had murdered the Assassin's father.
Background.
In 2009, Cold 187 um was invited to perform at the Gathering of the Juggalos, but because of his mother's cancer, he declined the offer. However, he later agreed to develop a project with Insane Clown Posse's Violent J. After releasing "Only God Can Judge Me" on another label, Violent J proposed that Psychopathic Records release their project, and Cold 187 um agreed to tour with Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid to promote the project.
Psychopathic wanted to develop an album that would combine the talents of Cold 187 um and Psychopathic in a way that would appeal to Juggalos, the label's fanbase, and establish the rapper to that audience, as he was well known for his efforts in gangsta rap, but not previously established to Juggalos.
Additionally, Cold 187 um felt that in order to sign with Psychopathic, he had to create material that would be different from what he produced for his own label, West World Records. During the tour, Cold 187 um and Violent J created the character of a hired killer, and developed the concept of the album as a long-form story. After the tour, it was officially announced that Cold 187 um had signed with Psychopathic.
Concept and storyline.
"The Only Solution" is a concept album which tells the story of an assassin as he develops from a young boy into a hired killer, the "Psychopathic Assassin", who is hired by "The Company" whenever someone "needs to be taken care of". It is prepackaged with a comic book that corresponds with the album's story. Within the storyline, the album's character is identified as "Cold 187um" and "Hutch".
The story begins with Hutch being brought into the business by his father and uncle, who brought Hutch along during "hits" because the targets are more vulnerable when a child is present. Hutch commits his first assassination at the age of 10. At the height of their success, Hutch's uncle, Black Swan, murders his brother out of greed, and Hutch swears to avenge his father by seeking revenge against Black Swan.
The rest of the album's storyline focuses on Cold 187 um in the present day as he performs assassinations of several people, including Father Duckets, a greedy, corrupt preacher, Willie Brosco, who stole money from Cold 187 um's employers, Larry Longhorn, a corrupt judge who proclaims excessive sentences to the plaintiffs that face him, three despicable criminal brothers, and the corrupt Senator Jones, as well as pursuing Black Swan and seeking revenge for his father. The album's storyline concludes with the Psychopathic Assassin's son stating that he is happy as long he is alive and free, a sharp contrast from the Assassin's view that the world is "dangerous" and "full of snakes".
Production.
While developing the album, Cold 187 um hand selected instrumentals from 12 previously released songs by Psychopathic artists, including Dark Lotus, Anybody Killa, Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Insane Clown Posse, on the basis of which instrumentals would be appropriate for story-based songs which would form an album-length storyline. Official promotional materials termed the album a "deluxe mixtape" on the basis of this production style. The album's storyline was developed by Violent J, and Cold 187 um wrote all of the lyrics based on this story.
Release and promotion.
A panflet included with Insane Clown Posse's album "The Mighty Death Pop!" listed the release date of "The Only Solution" as October 9, 2012. However, the album was pushed back to October 22 to coincide with the release of Twiztid's album "Abominationz".
Psychopathic's YouTube channel released a series of videos entitled "In the Mind of an Assassin", as well as a music video featuring Cold 187 um rapping over the beat from ICP's cover of the Geto Boys' "Assassins", to promote the release of "The Only Solution". The videos depicted Cold 187 um in character as the "Psychopathic Assassin", preparing and performing staged assassinations.
On October 17, the single "An Offer He Can't Refuse", and a series of samples from the album were released. Customers who ordered "The Only Solution" and Twiztid's "Abominationz" within two weeks of the albums' release date received an exclusive CD containing audio of Psychopathic's "Psyphers".
On November 28, Psychopathic Records released the first music video from the album, "An Offer He Can't Refuse". Cold 187 um will tour in promotion of the album.
Reception.
"The Only Solution" debuted at #113 on the "Billboard" Hot 200 Charts, #19 on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, #6 on Heatseekers Albums, #32 on Independent Albums and #17 on Rap Albums.
Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer David Jeffries wrote, "while this concept goes big time in a Tarantino style with characters and locations providing an Iliad-sized journey, some of the tracks get too tripped up in narrative to be considered pure."
Cold 187 um's association with Insane Clown Posse was criticized by both fans of West Coast hip hop and Juggalos. Cold 187 um responded to the criticism, stating "The "Only Solution" project was an innovative good idea between myself and Violent J, but everyone is so damn opinionated these days and not going with the idea of the artist’s creativity, the project was harder than it needed to be. We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, we all should have been one not separate. That goes for both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans. We might come from different places but we are all on the same side, fighting the same fight. It’s like anything else in life, if there is no unity the real enemy will always win. End of story."

Sarah Beth Goncarova

Sarah Beth Goncarova (born 1980) is an American painter, sculptor, and installation artist known for abstract textile pieces and non-specific figurative scenes. Her works are in several individual, corporate, and public collections.
Early personal life.
Sarah Beth Goncarova was born in 1980. Her father was an environmental scientist and her mother, an art teacher. At an early age she studied to play the piano and later reported experiencing chromesthesia, saying "when I would listen to music, I would visualize sinuous colorful shapes in space." She performed with the Alexandria Symphony Orchestra at an early age, with her public debut at age nine. Kim Allen Kluge conducted that debut, and Andre Watts loaned Goncarova his personal piano for the performance. Unfortunately her performances halted when she was 13 due to an accident that severely burned her hand, and also due to severe back pain, joint pain, and a series of personal losses. She took refuge by painting, starting with a mural which ultimately spanned all the walls of her bedroom, transforming it into a "castle courtyard". Photos of this in her application portfolio for undergraduate college helped her earn a full scholarship.
Education.
Goncarova graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2002 from Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Art in Sculpture and Extended Media, with a minor in Art History. As an undergraduate, she worked as a puppet maker, costumer and scenic designer for the theater, which led her to creating gallery-sized installations. She then matriculated at Maryland School of Architecture where she combined her interests in architecture, stage design, and puppetry in her masters thesis. She received her Master’s degree in Architecture in 2005, also graduating Magna Cum Laude.
Career.
Goncarova continued to paint during her time as a student of architecture. Shortly after graduating, she moved to an apartment whose landlord forbade the use of paint; in response she worked in torn watercolor paper and collage. She also incorporated plaster, fibers, and ink, and devoted herself full-time to these works, with a small exhibition in San Francisco in December 2006, and a solo show in Palo Alto, California in October 2007.
By 2008 she had moved to a less restrictive home studio, and resumed painting in oil at the suggestion of a gallerist. Her first paintings of this period were primarily portraits, landscapes, and still lives. These works featured at Kaleid Gallery (San Jose, California) in October of that year. She then embarked on socially significant series such as "The Wake Project" in 2009, where seemingly calm landscapes belie underlying disasters. For example, "Lighter Fluid" depicts a vibrant seascape, where the bright ripples in the water are the result of an oil spill; "Once An Orchard" appears to be a Wild West desert when it actually depicts a former orchard, abandoned due to drought. Her series "Where Ice Meets Sky", also started in 2009, references global warming via scenes of iceberg calving, which she witnessed during a trip to Iceland. These featured in her solo exhibition "Lush/Bleak" during the summer of 2009, and in the "Blue Planet" group show at San Francisco's SOMArts Cultural Center Gallery.
Sarah Beth Goncarova also began exhibiting in shows with feminist themes during this time, including the "Control" show juried by Guerrilla Girls West, and "Reversing the Gaze: Man As Object".
Goncarova returned to minimalist and purely abstract paintings in her "Rainy Season", "Dawn", "Night Spin" and "Cosmos" series in 2010-2011, which showed at galleries including New Haven's John Slade Ely Center for Contemporary Art. In 2011, her larger than life work “Hunks of Burnin’Love” was selected by the curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for exhibition at the Sanchez Arts Center in Pacifica, California.
In 2012 she created a series of large-scale sculptural installations, working with textiles, called "Keeping Time With Needle and Thread". This allowed her to resume sculpting while continuing using feminist themes, referencing cloth, sewing, and needlecraft as "women's work," while avoiding any literalism in pictorial work. These made their public debut at Gallery 195 in New Haven, and have been also exhibited at the Whitney Center, the Kehler-Liddell Gallery, and the A.I.R. Gallery in Brooklyn. The Hiestand Galleries of Miami University selected the large-scale piece "May–June (2012)" from this series for their Young Sculptors' Exhibition of 2013 as part of her nomination for the prestigious William and Dorothy Yeck Award. In 2013, Goncarova received grants from the Barbara Deming Memorial Fund and from the Puffin Foundation for her textile-sculptures.
In January 2013, New York Times art writer Jerry Saltz wrote in a letter to Goncarova that her new textile installations were “brilliant,” likening her sculptures to the work of Louise Bourgeois. He encouraged her to incorporate more dance and “the inner world of women” into her work, which influenced the creation of the performance and video “At My Mother’s Table." Coincidentally, her sculptures drew the attention of Haitian-American dancer and choreographer Nazorine Ulysse, who commissioned several pieces for a dance piece called Zooplankton, which premiered at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven in March 2013. The collaboration with Ulysse broadened Goncarova’s range by combining textile sculpture, dance and sound. In the summer of 2013, Goncarova attended a workshop intensive with the internationally renowned dance troupe Pilobolus, which encouraged her to venture more into performance art, and to create works for several dancers using her sculptural work as thematic vehicles.
In August 2013, Goncarova won sponsorship from Artspire, a program of the New York Foundation for the Arts, for the continuation of her series "Keeping Time with Needle and Thread", in which she furthers her exploration of the definitions of sculpture, combining needle-crafts, sculpture, sound and performance art.
Writing.
Goncarova published the monograph "A Yearlong Summer" on her work in 2010, writing the book's introduction as well as an essay for each piece.
In 2012 Goncarova co-authored and edited "Sonia's Song", Sonia Korn-Grimani's World War II and post-war memoir.

Anne O'Brien (footballer)

Anne O'Brien (born 25 January 1956) is an Irish former international football midfielder. She spent the majority of her club career in Italy and also played in France.
Club career.
O'Brien joined Stade de Reims at the age of 17, after the French club toured Dublin. She arrived in Italy in 1976, having won three league titles with Reims. O'Brien enjoyed similar success in Italy, collecting six Scudetti and two Italian Women's Cups in a career spanning seven clubs and 18 years.
Beginning at Lazio, O'Brien won the league in 1979 and 1980, as well as the Cup in 1977. After the League switched to a winter season, she helped Trani win the 1984 League. Returning to Lazio and playing alongside Pia Sundhage, she lifted the Cup again in 1985. Later in O'Brien's career she won three consecutive League titles; two with Reggiana (1989–90, 1990–91) and one with Milan Salvarani (1991–92).
The "Dizionario del Calcio Italiano" described O'Brien as an elegant midfield playmaker, adept at reading the game and capable of precise passing. She was bracketed alongside Rose Reilly, Conchi Sánchez and Susy Augustesen as one of the best foreigners to play women's football in Italy.
International career.
O'Brien endured a relatively inauspicious international career. Due to travel and accommodation costs, the poorly performing Irish national team only called her up for their most important fixtures after she had emigrated.
Personal life.
In 1987 O'Brien spent a period out of football to give birth to her son, Andrea. Following her retirement from playing she settled in Rome. O'Brien remained in football, serving Lazio as manager in the mid-2000s (trained Lazio in 2005-06 and Women Civitavecchia in 2007-08) and later working for the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as a coach. 
In 1999 son Andrea was playing in A.S. Roma's youth team. O'Brien is reportedly a cousin of Johnny Giles. The League of Ireland footballer Ger O'Brien is Anne's nephew.

Johnny Powers (born John Leon Joseph Pavlik on May 26, 1938 in East Detroit, Michigan) is an American guitar player, singer, writer and producer specializing in rockabilly. Powers is best known for his 1957 recording on the now-defunct Fox Records label entitled “Long Blond Hair”.
Powers (as Pavlik) began his professional career in 1953 at age 15, when he joined a local Detroit country band known as Jimmy Williams and the Drifters. Later, having become a fan of Carl Perkins and the young Elvis Presley, Powers began to include rock & roll elements in his music.
Until 1955, Powers performed and recorded under his given name but, following a studio session for Fortune Records in Detroit, co-owner Devora Brown – seeing Pavlik eating a PowerHouse candy bar – gave him the stage name of Johnny Powers.
Powers released a pair of singles on the Fox Records label (not to be confused with today’s 20th Century Fox Records), including “Long Blond Hair”. Fox went out of business soon thereafter and in 1959 Powers signed with Sun Records, which released one single under his name. In 1960, Powers met with Berry Gordy and signed on with Motown Records, becoming the first white male musician to do so; he is also thought to be the only recording artist to have ever been under contract to both Sun and Motown Records. In his five year relationship with Motown, Powers devoted most of his energies to producing and writing rather than recording.
Powers has been inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Today, he continues to tour and perform throughout the United States and Europe.

A secret cable sent by the Japanese consulate to the Foreign Affairs Ministry notes that the Jikyoku Iinkai was the main organization responsible for the "creation of propaganda and information for the United States". It was headed by K. Takahashi, a local manager of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, until March 15 1940, and from then on by Mitsubishi executive S. Takeuchi, with one Tsutomu Obana, secretary of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco, serving also as the Jikyoku Iinkai's secretary.
Following the passage of the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1938, the Jikyoku Iinkai registered as an agency controlled by Japanese nationals, though when registering Tsutomu Obana had concealed that the organization was directly funded and guided by the government of Japan. The Jikyoku Iinkai spent at least $175,000 over the course of its existence to promote pro-Japanese causes. Among the individuals the organization funded were Frederick Vincent Williams, who was paid $300 monthly to make pro-Japanese articles, speeches, and radio broadcasts, David Warren Ryder, whose wrote a series of pamphlets entitled "Far Eastern Affairs", and Ralph Townsend, who also printed pamphlets with the Jikyoku Iinkai's support.
Termination of the organization and aftermath.
As the FBI stepped up their surveillance of foreign agents the Japanese consulate became increasingly concerned about exposure of the organization's covert activities. The Jikyoku Iinkai was therefore disbanded on August 22 1940.
However a federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which was launched in November 1941 discovered the work that the Jikyoku Iinkai had undertaken from 1937 to 1940, and on 28 January 1942 the United States government indicted Townsend, Ryder, and Williams, for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as well as Obana for filing false and incomplete statements on behalf of the organization. Townsend and Ryder were accused of acting as foreign agents without registering, and while Williams had registered, he was charged with making false declarations and concealing information when registering. Obana and Townsend pled guilty, though Townsend denied that he was acting on behalf of Japan. Ryder and Williams professed their innocence and likewise claimed ignorance about the extent to which the Japanese government had controlled the Jikyoku Iinkai, but both were convicted in June. All four were given prison sentences. The United States government also indicted Takahashi and Takeuchi, and named two Japanese consuls as co-conspirators, but they had all already left the country before the indictment was laid down.

Darius Clemons

Darius Clemons is a retired American basketball player. He is known for his standout college career at Loyola University in Chicago, where he was named Midwestern City Conference Player of the Year in 1981. He remains the school's all-time leader in assists.
Clemons, a 6'3" point guard from Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago, won an Illinois state title in 1975 and was named a Parade Magazine All-American as senior in 1978. He chose Loyola over higher-profile programs in part due to the promise of immediate playing time. 
Clemons was a four year starter for the Ramblers. He broke out as a sophomore in 1979–80, averaging 15.6 points per game. He followed that with a better junior campaign, as he averaged 21.9 points and 7.8 assists per game and was named Midwestern City Conference co-Player of the Year with Oklahoma City's Rubin Jackson. The following season, Clemons' scoring dropped to 12.9 points per game as freshman Alfredrick Hughes became the primary perimeter scoring option and center Wayne Sappleton emerged as a scorer. Clemons did see an uptick in his passing numbers as he averaged 9.9 assists per game.
At the close of his college career, Clemons had scored 1,610 points and dished out 703 assists - still a school record. In his peak season of 1980–81, Clemons became the first player in Midwestern City Conference (now the Horizon League) history to lead the conference in scoring, assists and steals. He was the only player to achieve this until Norris Cole did it in the 2010–11 season.
Clemons was drafted in the fourth round of the 1982 NBA Draft by the San Diego Clippers, but never played in the National Basketball Association. He played 5 games for the Reno Bighorns of the Continental Basketball Association in 1982–83, averaging 2 points and 1 assist per game before being released. He then left basketball and returned to Chicago.

Doping in the United States

Doping, the use of performance enhancing drugs, occurs in the United States, especially in baseball and football.
History.
The use of performance enhancing drugs has existed since the time of the Ancient Greek Olympiads when athletes were known to use special diets to augment themselves for competition. However, restrictions regarding drug use like synthetic hormones by athletes for enhanced performance in competition did not come around until the 20th century. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) established its initial list of prohibited substances in 1967 and introduced the first drug tests at the France and Mexico Olympic games in 1968. Thirty years later, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was founded. WADA was founded at a time when individual governments, sport federations, and the IOC all had differing definitions, policies, and sanctions for doping. WADA bridged these differences by setting unified anti-doping standards and coordinating the efforts of sports organizations and public authorities worldwide. 
The United States, a WADA Foundation Board Member, followed suit by establishing the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in 2000. USADA is recognized by Congress as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sport in the United States. The agency has adjudication powers and abides by WADA’s World Anti-Doping Code (“Code”), which provides the global framework for anti-doping policies, rules, and regulations. 
Doping in sports is generally defined as using a prohibited / banned substance; however, WADA expanded the definition to include breaking one or more of eight anti-doping rules within the Code, which range from presence of a prohibited substance in an athlete’s test sample to administering or attempting to administer a prohibited substance or method to an athlete. As of December 19, 2008, the Code banned 192 performance enhancing drugs, substances, and methods. 
Similar to the definitional disputes the international community faced in the 1990s, national professional sports leagues in the U.S. approach anti-doping policy differently and independently of U.S. government regulation, WADA guidelines, and one another. They do not have the same list of banned substances or tests they require players to abide by, may not provide tests or sanctions for use of some prohibited substances, and negotiate their anti-doping policies with their respective players associations through collective bargaining. 
In 2005, the U.S. Congressional House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform took an active interest on anti-drug policies in professional sports by opening an investigation into the matter following heightened media activity on steroid use in Major League Baseball (MLB). The use, possession, distribution, dispensing, or selling of steroids is a punishable federal offense under the Controlled Substances Act which, in addition to steroids, lists other performance enhancing drugs and substances as Schedule III drugs. A series of hearings were held, most notably with MLB, the National Football League (NFL), and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Each league’s anti-drug policy was compared to that of the IOC, and each fell short of the IOC requirements. Response to the congressional investigation by sports league representatives resulted largely with push back and a “we can police our own” mentality, but the Committee felt differently and introduced the Clean Sports Act—one of six bills introduced that year in both chambers —addressing the need to adopt uniform national anti-drug policy standards among professional sports leagues that are consistent with, and as stringent as, those enforced by the USADA. While most of the bills were voted out of committee, none were enacted. As of 2013, professional sports leagues continue to negotiate their anti-doping policies privately through collective bargaining.
Doping by sport.
Major League Baseball.
The Mitchell Report.
In December 2007 George Mitchell released "Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball". Major League Baseball asked Mitchell to conduct an independent investigation to see how bad steroid use was in baseball. In the report Mitchell covers many topics and he interviewed over 700 witnesses. He covers the effects of steroids on the human body. He also touches on Human Growth Hormone effects. He reports on baseball's drug testing policies before 2002 and the newer policies after 2002. Mitchell also named 86 players in the report that had some kind of connection to steroids. Among those named were: Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, and Eric Gagne. And to finish his report he made suggestions to the commissioner of baseball about drug testing and violations of the drug testing policies. Mitchell also reported that he would provide eveidence to support the alligations made against such players and would give them the opportunity to meet with him and give them a fair chance to defend themselves against the alligations. The report also includes a paper trail of evidence that states, "Former Mets club house attendant, Kirk Randomski sent performimg enhancment drugs to the players mentioned in the report." Quinn, T.J. and Thompson, Teri Daily News Sports Writers York, N.Y. CT. (2007):66
Professional Cycling.
In 2012, Lance Armstrong, cyclist and seven times Tour de France winner, was charged by USADA with using performance enhancing drugs, although he had denied it throughout his career and had never failed a drugs test. The charge is based on blood samples from 2009 and 2010 and testimonies from cyclists and other members of staff on Armstrong's former teams. On August 23, 2012, Armstrong announced that he would not be fighting the USADA's charges. On August 24, 2012, the USADA banned Armstrong for life and removed all his results from August 1998 and thereafter.
National Football League.
In 2009, nearly 1 in 10 retired National Football League (NFL) players polled in a confidential survey said they had used now-banned anabolic steroids while still playing. 16.3 percent of offensive linemen admitted using steroids, as did 14.8 percent of defensive linemen.
The NFL banned substances policy has been acclaimed by some and criticized by others, but the policy is the longest running in American professional sports, beginning in 1987. The current policy of the NFL suspends players without pay who test positive for banned substances as it has since 1989: four games for the first offense (a quarter of the regular season), eight games for a second offense (half of the regular season), and 12 months for a third offense. The suspended games may be either regular season games or playoff games.
While recently MLB and the NHL decided to permanently ban athletes for a third offense, they have long been resistant to such measures, and random testing is in its infancy.
Since the NFL started random, year-round tests and suspending players for banned substances, many more players have been found to be in violation of the policy. By April 2005, 111 NFL players had tested positive for banned substances, and of those 111, the NFL suspended 54.
A new rule is in the works due to Shawne Merriman. Starting the 2007 season, the new rule would prohibit any player testing positive for banned substances from being able to play in the Pro Bowl that year.
Performance Enhancing Drugs in the National Football League.
NFL Performance-enhancing Drug Policy.
Since steroid testing began in 1987, the NFL has made strides to discourage steroid use through their testing policies and procedures. According to nflcommunications.com, The NFL collects more than 14,000 tests each year which is more than any other professional sport league. Furthermore, players are contacted with little time before their testing date, and any player who fails to test is referred to disciplinary review.The NFL has committed to testing for a wide array of Performance Enhancing drugs, Starting in 2011 the NFL implemented random blood test for the use of the Human Growth Hormone (HGH). NFL sanctions include a minimum four game suspension for first-time offenders, six game suspension for second-time offenders and a year around suspension for third-time offenders. All NFL suspensions are without pay in order to further discourage performance-enhancing drug use.
Historical Performance-enhancing Drug Studies in the NFL.
In 2009 researchers conducted a survey of 2552 retired football players. The survey reported that anabolic steroids were introduced to the National Football League as early as 1963. Steroids use became so prevalent that players suspected that 90% of the NFL had used steroids. In addition to these rough statistics, Offensive-Lineman Pat Donovan suggested that up to 70% of the Dallas Cowboys offensive line had been using steroids. In 1990, a survey to 120 current NFL athletes reported that 67% of Offensive Lineman used steroids. At the conclusion of the survey, researchers found that out of 2552 ex-NFL players, 9.1% self reported using anabolic steroids during their career. Furthermore, 16.3% of Offensive lineman and 14.8% of defensive lineman surveyed reported using steroids during their careers.
Recent Developments in Performance-enhancing Drug Use in the NFL.
The widespread use of performance -enhancing drugs in the NFL has been an on-going problem. Within the last eight years, three defensive rookies of the year have been charged with using illegal performance enhancing drugs. After reading such facts, there seems to be a strong correlation between success in the National Football league and the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Furthermore, as these rookies were identified as cheaters, they were disciplined mildly with a suspension of four games.
Sportswriter Mike Freeman recalls a Hall of Fame Coach telling him that "For every one or two PED (performance-enhancing drug) cheats the NFL catches, 10 go free. Maybe 20". Widespread steroid use is extremely common in the NFL, oftentimes going unnoticed by the authorities. In a study of steroid cases surrounding the 2004 Super Bowl, statistics show that multiple players were discovered as steroid users. Furthermore, the study shows that those specific cases were never formally documented. "The NFL says it tests players randomly, without warning, throughout the year. And yet there's no record of these players ever testing positive". The NFL's failure to document steroid use is extremely rare and problematic. While steroid use is concealed in the NFL, it is oftentimes the source of controversy in other professional sports leagues.
HGH Testing.
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform revisited the NFL's anti-drug policy on December 12, 2012, specifically as it relates to testing for Human Growth Hormone (HGH). The collective bargaining agreement that ended the NFL lockout in August 2011 included a provision for HGH testing as soon as the 2012-2013 season — but only once the NFL Players Association approved the process. However, as of February 2013 testing had not yet begun because both parties continue to disagree on a number of issues relating to the accuracy of the testing and whether the test is valid for NFL players. Adolpho Birch, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for law and labor policy, stated the following when interviewed by the New York Times in February 2013: “It has been a stall. I don’t know if it’s a tactic. There is absolutely no reason for this to have taken this long and us not have testing implemented. We should have been more than a year into this by now.” Congress is hopeful that HGH testing will be included in the NFL's anti-drug policy come the 2013-2014 season.
National Basketball Association.
The National Basketball Association (NBA) first developed its anti-drug policy with its players association in 1983. Only eight players have been caught and suspended for the use of performance-enhancing drugs, most serving 5-, 10-, and 20-game suspensions:
United States Anti-Doping Agency.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization and national anti-doping organization (NADO) for the United States. The organization has control of anti-doping programs for U.S. Olympic, Paralympic, Pan-American and ParaPan American sport. Its work includes in-competition and out-of-competition testing, the results management and adjudication process, the provision of drug reference resources, the therapeutic-use exemption process, various scientific research initiatives, and athlete and outreach education. USADA is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
USADA is a signatory to, and responsible for implementation in the United States of, the World Anti-Doping Code, widely considered the basis for the strongest and strictest anti-doping programs in sports. In 2001 the agency was recognized by the U.S. Congress as "the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sport in the United States." USADA is not a government entity; however, the agency is partly funded by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), with its remaining budget generated from contracts for anti-doping services with sport organizations, most notably the United States Olympic Committee. The United States has also ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, the first global international treaty against doping in sport.
Legal issues.
Anti-doping policies instituted by individual sporting governing bodies may conflict with local laws. A notable case includes the National Football League (NFL) inability to suspend players found with banned susbstances; after it was ruled by a federal court, that local labor laws superseded the NFL's anti-doping regime. The challenge was supported by the National Football League Players Association.
In the U.S., anabolic steroids are currently listed as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, which makes the first offense simple possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison, and the unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute anabolic steroids punishable as a first offense by up to ten years in prison. EPO is a drug that may only be obtained through an medical practitioner's prescription. Professional cyclists that test positive for the drug are banned from professional road races for a minimum of two years on the first offense and banned for life on the second offense.

Blob's Park

Blob's Park is a German-style beer hall that opened in 1933, in Jessup, Maryland. It is the "Home of America's First Oktoberfest". One of the shortest, numbered Maryland state routes, MD 917, runs for less than a mile from MD 175 to Blobs Park.
Founder.
In 1893, at age 10, Max Blob passed through Ellis Island, NYC, from Vogenberg, Germany. He was the oldest of three sons of Katherine and Phillip Blob. Accompanying were his two brothers, John and Henry. They settled on 150 acres outside of Jessup, Maryland.
1933-2007.
With the end of Prohibition, in 1933, Max opened up Blob's Park for business.
Blob's Park Bavarian Beer Garden was the home of America's first Oktoberfest back in 1947.
While the original building interior was destroyed by fire in 1956, repairs got the beer hall back up in six weeks. After Max's passing in February, 1969, his extended family kept the hall open. A new hall was built in 1976. The old hall was burned to clear the area for an outdoor pavilion in 1980. The new Blob's Park stayed up in operations until New Year's Eve, 2007 when owner John Eggrel retired and the land was earmarked for development.
2009-present.
However, planned development of the site has been delayed because of the economic slowdown. Max Blob’s grand-nephew Max Eggerl has restored and renovated the place inside and out. He re-opened Blob’s Park in 2009. Blob's Park has been voted as the "Best Place To Polka" in Maryland by Baltimore Magazine and has been nationally televised on CNN News, Good Morning America and had featured articles many times in the Baltimore and Washington Newspapers. Blob's features a 2,500 square foot wooden dance floor with seating capacity for nearly 1,000 people, an outside Pavilion, a lighted parking lot, plus lots of great German/American food with full Bar and Restaurant facilities. The facility was shuttered on March 31, 2014.
Eggerl has announced that he will be opening a new restaurant, The Bavarian Brauhaus, in Hanover, MD at the site of the recently closed Gunning's Seafood restaurant. The new Bavarian Brauhaus will have a small stage for occasional live entertainment, but, unlike at Blob's Park, there won't be polka dancing.

Reflectance paper

Reflectance paper is a surface that contains a lattice of mirrored dimples. The paper is printed with color and the angle-dependent reflectance function for each pixel of an image captured with a light field camera such as Lytro. The image then displays differently depending on the angle of incident light in the viewing environment.
History.
As of 2012, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and 3M had together created the first such paper, using a hexagonal lattice of millimeter-sized dimples. Dimple depth was 50 µm, representing 70% of a hemisphere. Mirroring used silver or sputtered aluminum. A 32x32 matrix of light-field information was printed on a transparent mask over the dimples.

Paraquat murders

The paraquat murders were a series of indiscriminate poisonings carried out in Japan in 1985. Police were unable to gather any evidence about the murders other than they were caused by a poisoned beverage that was left inside or around vending machines. All the beverages were poisoned with the herbicide paraquat except for one which was poisoned with diquat.
The first poisoning and death occurred on April 30, 1985 in Fukuyama, Hiroshima. This drink was found on top of the vending machine. After this, eleven more murders occurred between September 11 and November 17. Most of these drinks were retrieved from outside the vending machine. Vending machine operators posted warnings on machines telling people not to consume drinks found in or around the machines, after which the poisonings stopped. 
No culprit was ever found.
It was established that at least one other unknown person attempted to imitate the paraquat murders by putting lime sulfur into drinks in Tokyo. There were also a small number of people who attempted to poison themselves in a method imitating the murders.

Samuel Charles Brittingham

Samuel Charles Brittingham (1860-12 November 1944) was a British-born architect who worked extensively in Australia in the early twentieth century.
Early life and career.
Brittingham was a pupil in the Victorian Education Department from 1875-9 and then remained as assistant 1879-85, before taking up a position with the Victorian Public Works Department in 1886.
He passed the examination of the Royal Institute of British Architects in London on 9 November 1906, although he appears to have sat it in Melbourne at the time.
He became Victorian Government Architect and was responsible for a number of prominent public buildings in Victoria including the Old Arts Building at Melbourne University, 1919–24, Parkville Post Office, and Bourke St West Police Station as well as a number of other public buildings.
As government architect he was responsible for the first buildings in national parks, including the rangers house (1909) and visors' Chalet (1923) at Wilsons Promontory National Park. It is likely he also designed the Mount Buffalo Chalet. 
In 1918 Brittingham proposed a scheme to alleviate Melbourne's traffic congestion by constructing a bridge to extend Exhibition Street across the Jolimont railway yards anticipating the present Exhibitions Street extension by 80 years. He later attended own planning conferences and was instrumental in the new planning scheme devised for the Morwell coal fields.
Family.

Main Space Intelligence Centre

The 821st Main Space Intelligence Centre () is the headquarters of the Russian military's space surveillance network, SKKP. The centre is part of the Space Command of the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and receives intelligence from a network of reporting stations which includes the Russian missile attack early warning network as well as some stations only used for space surveillance such as Okno and Krona. The purpose of SKKP is to detect satellites, identify them and to discern their orbits. It maintains the Russian catalogue of space objects and provides data which could be used to support space launches, feed an anti-satellite programme and provide intelligence on hostile military satellites. It is the Russian equivalent of the United States Space Surveillance Network.
History.
The centre is based in the military village of Noginsk-9 () on the site of the village of Dubrovo near Noginsk in Moscow Oblast. It was previously known as TsKKP (Цккп) from meaning 'centre for space monitoring'.
The idea of a space monitoring system originated in 1963 and the design was agreed upon in 1965. From the beginning it included civilian astronomical stations run by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The system needed to detect, identify and track satellites and create a satellite catalogue. The first satellite detection system consisted of eight Dnestr radars, four at Mishelevka in Siberia and four at Balkhash in the Kazakh SSR which provided information for the Istrebitel Sputnik anti-satellite system.
Construction on the centre began in 1965 and in 1968 a 5E51 computer was installed. The first part of the centre was placed on alert in 1970 and became operational in 1972, as part of the Soviet Air Defences.
In 1974 plans to link up the space surveillance centre with the missile warning centre and missile defence radars were realised. There were several problems with this; one significant issue was that they used different co-ordinate systems. One drawback of linking the early warning radars to the space surveillance centre was that it caused data on thousands of routine objects to be sent to the centre, overwhelming it with data. To counter this, a programme called "Kosmos" was implemented. This programme asked the radar stations only to send information on requested objects and launches rather than everything they identified. One concern raised with "Kosmos" was that it took the radar stations two to three minutes to do this, which disrupted their tracking of ballistic missiles. It was important that the system concentrated on the military satellites of hostile countries and filtered these out from the noise of the wider space environment.
The early warning radars could only cover satellites in low earth orbits. In the 1980s more US military satellites were placed in geosynchronous orbits. This required specialised equipment, such as Krona and Okno, which could analyse satellites at that height. In the late 1980s the centre received a new building housing an Elbrus-2 computer. Later a new network based on the Elbrus-90 Micro computer was installed.
The space monitoring centre was awarded the Soviet Minister of Defence Pennant for Courage and Military Valour.
In 2003 a notification system for detecting "special spacecraft" passing over the country was implemented.
Catalogue.
The centre maintains the Russian catalogue of space objects, similar to that of NORAD. The radar stations send the centre a six-dimensional vector consisting of co-ordinates and velocities taken from the smoothing of discrete measurements. This data consists of range, azimuth and elevation angle, and in addition some radars send radial velocity. The centre compares the measurements to the catalogue to see whether it is a known object. If not, additional data is collected to see if the signal represents a new orbit of a known object. If it is not then a new object is catalogued. 
Organisational structure.
The space surveillance network was part of the Soviet Air Defences, called the PVO, and was incorporated as part of the missile defence and space defence force. In 1998 SKKP became part of the missile and space defence organisation "ракетно-космической обороны" (RKO) together with missile warning network SPRN and the anti-missile forces. In 2001 these services became part of the newly founded Space Troops, and were incorporated as the 3rd Independent Missile and Space Defence Army.
The Main Space Intelligence Centre was formed on 1 December 2009 and since December 2011 it has been part of the Space Command of the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces, together with facilities such as the 820th Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning and 153rd Titov Main Space Testing Centre.
