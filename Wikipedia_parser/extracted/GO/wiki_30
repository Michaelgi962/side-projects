Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross

The Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross is an American high-wing, strut-braced, open cockpit, pod-and-boom glider that was designed by Hawley Bowlus and introduced in 1938.
Design and development.
Bowlus designed the Baby Albatross as an inexpensive glider during the Great Depression. The aircraft initially sold for US$750 ready-to-fly, and US$385 as a kit for amateur construction. Initially produced as a kit by Bowlus, the rights to the design were purchased in 1944 by Laister-Kauffmann, although that company went out of business before commencing production.
The BA-100 is of mixed construction. The wings and tail surfaces are of wooden structure, covered in aircraft fabric. The tailboom is made from a metal tube and the cockpit pod is of molded plywood. The aircraft features no glide-path control devices, although some were later modified with spoilers. The airfoil is a modified Gö 535 section.
The production of the BA-100 totaled 156 kits delivered.
Operational history.
Many well known soaring pilots owned and flew the BA-100 as their first aircraft. These include Dick Johnson, Richard Schreder and Joe Lincoln. Despite its modest performance the BA-100 has been flown on many flights of over .
One BA-100 was modified by Schweizer Aircraft, replacing the plywood cockpit pod with a steel tube one.
The aircraft were known for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly in front of the aerodynamic center at 25% chord. Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had high friction. Third, the relatively soft pitch axis cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then stored up energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the high friction would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.
As of September 2013 there were still 12 Baby Albatross on the US Federal Aviation Administration civil aircraft register.

100 mm anti-tank gun M1977

The A407 100mm anti-tank gun M1977 is a Romanian rifled 100-mm anti-tank gun which serves as the main towed anti-tank gun of the Romanian Land Forces from 1975 until present. Versions of the M1977 gun were installed on main battle tanks (TR-77 and TR-85) and ship turrets.
History.
The A407 100mm anti-tank gun was the first artillery piece designed in Romania after World War II. The first variant of the gun, the M1975 (M stands for Model) had a semi-automatic horizontal sliding wedge type breech lock. The second variant, M1977, had a more practical vertical sliding wedge breech block.
The M1977 can be also used as a field gun at brigade level, as it has a maximum range of 20.6 kilometers. After 1992, the M1977 anti-tank guns were modernized with improved optical sights. The gun can be towed with the DAC 665T truck and has a maximum road speed of 60 km/h on road and 30 km/h off-road.
Variants.

Operators.
At least one A407 anti-tank gun was captured in Iraq during the Gulf War by the US Army. The exact number of A407 artillery pieces exported by Communist Romania is unknown. The gun is now the property of the Ohio Army National Guard, the transportation unit (1486th Transportation Company) that captured it.

Cross-border cooperation

Cross-border cooperation is the collaboration between adjacent areas across borders. In the European Union this is one of the forms of territorial cooperation (in addition to transnational and interregional cooperation). The European model is very diverse with cooperation between border regions or municipalities, or through specific cooperation structures. These structures are usually composed by public authorities (municipalities, districts, counties, regions) from different countries organized in working communities, euroregions or EGTCs (European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation).

Stephen Muecke

Stephen Muecke BA (Hons, Monash), Mes.L (Paris), PhD (UWA) FAHA is Professor of Writing at the University of New South Wales, Australia. He studied linguistics and semiotics, completing his PhD on storytelling techniques among Aboriginal people in Broome, Western Australia.
Publications.
Muecke's PhD research resulted in "Gularabulu: Stories from the West Kimberley", Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1983. The storyteller was Indigenous leader Paddy Roe (OAM). They later collaborated on the prizewinning "Reading the Country: Introduction to Nomadology" (Fremantle, 1984) with landscape painter Krim Benterrak, a postmodern ethnography of Roebuck Plains, near Broome. In 1993 Muecke became the first Professor of Cultural Studies in Australia, at the University of Technology, Sydney, where he worked from 1985 to 2009. 
Muecke is a significant proponent of fictocritical writing, the travelogue "No Road (bitumen all the way)" (Fremantle 1997) being the first Australian monograph in this genre; a later collection is "Joe in the Andamans and Other Fictocritical Stories" (Local Consumption, 2008). Both books were shortlisted for major literary prizes.
With Adam Shoemaker he edited the writings of David Unaipon, "Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines" (Melbourne University Press, 2001), and co-edited with Jack Davis and Mudrooroo Narogin the first anthology of Black Australian writings, Paperback, (University of QLD Press, 1990). He identified that the book "Myths and Legends of the Aborigines" by William Ramsay Smith was actually mainly written by Unaipon.
Cultural Studies research on the Indian Ocean from 2000 has led to "Cultures of Trade", edited with Devleena Ghosh (Cambridge Scholars, 2007), and a collaborative work with the photographer Max Pam, "Contingency in Madagascar" (forthcoming, Intellect, 2011).
Personal life.
A descendant of pioneering Germans in the Barossa Valley and Adelaide, Muecke has had three sons, Joe, Hugo and Sebastian with his partner Prudence Black. They live in Sydney, Australia.

La jolie parfumeuse

La jolie parfumeuse is an opéra comique in three acts of 1873 with music by Jacques Offenbach. The French libretto was by Hector Crémieux and Ernest Blum.
Performance history.
The opera was premiered at the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Paris on 29 November 1873, where it ran for 200 performances, marking Offenbach’s first major success after the fall of the Empire. The piece, which owes something to the 1850 opéra comique "Les Porcherons" by Sauvage and Grisat, enjoys a “farcical libretto of sexual quiproquos”.
The piece, written in seven weeks, derived much of its success from the performance of Théo in the title role; she returned, along with Daubray, for a revival in 1875 at the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens. The work was successfully revived again in 1892 at the Théâtre de la Renaissance (with Juliette Simon-Girard as Rose and Simon-Max as Poirot) and in 1898 at the Théâtre de la Gaîté with Mariette Sully.
It was seen at the Alhambra in London from 18 May 1874 with Kate Santley, bowdlerized, as the libretto was « inadmissible in an English theatre ». 
Outside France, "La jolie parfumeuse" was also produced (often in translation) in Brussels, Antwerp and Vienna in 1874, Berlin, New York, Birmingham and Milan in 1875, Mexico in 1876 and Stockholm in 1891, but did not remain in the repertory during the 20th century, despite broadcasts on French radio and a run at the Royal Academy of Music in 1973. The Neighbor's Chorus ""Soyez donc bon homme"" at the opening of act 3 remains a favorite of choral societies, however.
Synopsis.
Setting: Paris, 18th century
Act 1.
"The first act is set in a garden cabaret of Les Porcherons, with a band stand and a sign which reads ‘Noces et Festins, Salon de 100 Couverts’. In the background, shrubs and the entrance."
Bavolet, a young clerk who works for the public prosecutor, and god-son of the rich financier La Cocardière, is to marry Rose, who works at the perfume-shop (and bears a striking resemblance to a new member of the ballet recently arrived from Toulouse).
The wedding celebrations are in full swing at the Cabaret des Porcherons. 
Clorinde (a mistress of La Cocardière) is there with her dancer friends. When La Cocardière arrives at the celebration she teases him as it is clear he is taken with the perfume girl, Rose. He wriggles out of the situation and all toast the young couple.
Also present is Poirot (in reality a Swiss worker at the Hotel Saint-Florentin – although from Nogent). He and La Cocardière scheme to get hold of the bride’s garter. Bavolet tells Rose that he is keeping the place of their wedding night a secret until later.
La Cocardière announces a band of blind musicians, and Verrouillaski, the ‘famous Polish painter’ (Poirot in disguise). They persuade Rose to stand on a table to have her portrait painted, during which La Cocardière gets hold of the garter. After another dance all prepare to depart. Bavolet explains to La Cocardière that as he does not want Rose to live in the little room above her shop, he has rented a room adjacent and made a door to join them both. He also asks La Cocardière if he will conduct his wife to the new home, and en route recount to her what her mother would have said to her on her wedding night if she had been alive. After a final dance, La Cocardière leads away Rose to whom Bavolet, surrounded by Poirot and his friends, waves kisses.
Act 2.
"A salon in La Cocardière’s house with several doors leading off, and see-through mirrors making visible the interior of the two adjoining rooms."
Germain, La Cocardière’s manservant, sings of the pleasant life he leads, and with Justine, Lise and other domestic servants sets the table for a meal.
La Cocardière and Rose enter, he assuring her that (despite the lavish furnishings) this is her new home – all paid for by Bavolet. Among the decorations she notices pictures of ballet dancers – including the new arrival from Toulouse.
To fulfil his commission La Cocardière attempts to kiss and embrace Rose, eventually blowing out the candles, but she evades him. He calls the maids to prepare Rose for bed, although she is ticklish. La Cocardière re-enters pretending to be Bavolet, but his big hands, ears and teeth make her feel like little red riding-hood.
Germain suddenly comes in to announce the arrival of Clorinde and her friends. La Cocardière hides Rose. Clorinde sings him a birthday song, but he is not pleased by the surprise visit nor the suggestion of a birthday supper. As La Cocardière tries to get rid of Rose and deal with the dancers, Bavolet and Poirot burst in. Having been to Bavolet’s rooms the young husband wants to know where his wife is, thinking she might have been taken ill en route or had an accident. Realising there is another woman in one of the adjoining rooms, he demands to know who it is. Bavolet rushes to open the door and Rose, beautifully dressed, emerges announcing herself as “Dorothée Bruscambille, native of Toulouse, and future pensionnaire of the Grand Opéra of Paris”. Despite all Bavolet’s questions she insists (in a Toulouse accent) that she is not Rose.
The others leave Bavolet and Rose alone and she tempts him with champagne, after they too disappear into a side room. As the act ends, other come back in, Rose and Bavolet can be seen in the room on the right, while in the left-hand room are Clorinde and La Cocardière. Poirot is on his knees in front of Arthémise.
Act 3.
"The interior of the perfume shop with a counter and on the right a staircase leading to the first floor."
The curtain rises on an empty shop, but people are rattling the shutters demanding entrance. La Julienne, women customers, grisettes, barbers, clerks crowd into the shop. 
Poirot says that he will be an honourable man and marry ‘Bruscambille’ and sings his letter to the parents of the girl; Bavolet, somewhat hung-over, and thinking that he had been with the dancer, and that Rose had only come in at seven that morning, is mystified. As Poirot prepares to go and deliver his letter, Rose enters. Bavolet rushes to her but she silences him with her look. 
After some plotting by Clorinde and Rose, La Cocardière enters the shop and while Rose tries to serve customers he tries to declare his love. Bavolet now confronts Rose but she refuses to answer him and he storms out. Rose now confronts La Cocardière, but when Clorinde comes in he hides in a cupboard. Rose asks what she can get for Clorinde who replies that she wants her partner and proceeds to search all the rooms of the shop for La Cocardière. La Julienne arrives hurriedly and says that a man – Bavolet – is going to throw himself in the Seine, but as Rose decides to go and find him Bavolet himself passes by and demands from the doorway where Rose spent the night. She replies in her false Toulouse accent and all becomes clear. La Cocardière is found hiding in the cupboard; Clorinde shows a ring and claims to be his wife. With a reprise of the first act finale all ends happily.

Urbanlining

Urbanlining or urban slacklining is a balance sport that uses nylon webbing tensioned between two anchor points. It combines all the different styles of slacklining. It is practiced in urban area, for example in city parks and on the streets. Most urban slackliners prefer wide 2-inch slacklines for tricklining on the streets, but some may use narrow (5/8-inch or 1-inch) lines for longline purposes or for waterlining on the beaches.
A slackline's tension can be adjusted to suit the user and different types of dynamic webbing can be used to achieve a variety of feats. The line itself is flat, due to the nature of webbing, thus keeping the slacker's footing from rolling as would be the case with an ordinary rope. The dynamic nature of the line allows for impressive tricks and stunts.
A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and new tricks are born all the time because the sport is fairly new. Some of the basic tricks done today are standing, stand start, walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, opposite turn around, and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: moonwalk, throwing a disc around with someone from line-to-line, sit start, Buddha sit, mantle start, sitting down, lying down, jump start, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or "180s." Some of the advanced/expert tricks are: back flip landing on the line, jumps referred to as "ollies", tree plants, front flip dismount, back flip dismount, doing push-ups, tandem walking, the tandem pass, piggy-back rides across the line, jumping from line-to-line, and 360s.

Mississippi Central Railroad

Mississippi Central Railroad (reporting mark MSCI) is a short line railroad operating over 51 miles from Oxford, Mississippi to Grand Junction, Tennessee owned by Pioneer Railcorp. The railroad's principal commodities are wood products and fertilizer. The MSCI offers connections to the BNSF Railway in Holly Springs and Norfolk Southern Railway in Grand Junction.
Early History (1852-1861).
In 1852, the Mississippi Central Railroad was chartered by the Mississippi Legislature to build a railroad from Canton, Mississippi to Grand Junction, Tennessee passing through the towns of Grenada, Water Valley, Oxford and Holly Springs. The first passenger trains from Holly Springs to Oxford ran in 1857. Passenger service further south to Water Valley bagan in 1858. On January 31, 1860, the final spike was driven in Winona, Mississippi establishing the first ever rail link between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. The line was constructed with track gauge.
Civil War (1861-1865).
In November 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant began the Mississippi Central Railroad Campaign down the line with the ultimate goal of capturing Vicksburg, Mississippi in conjunction with General William Tecumseh Sherman. Grant established a base in Holly Springs and began advancing south along the railroad. Confederate soldiers built earthwork fortifications to defend the railroad's Tallahatchie River bridge near Abbeville but retreated south without firing a shot when they learned of a flanking maneuver by Grant. Skirmishes were fought along the railroad to Oxford and in the streets of the town itself. The Confederates were pushed further south past Water Valley, Mississippi but managed to damage a railroad trestle and lead a successful ambush at Oakland, Mississippi that stalled the Federal advance.
While Grant was stalled, Confederate General Van Dorn lead a successful cavalry raid on Grant's supply base at Holly Springs, burning most of his supplies and then moved north destroying the railroad and telegraph lines along the way. With the railroad destroyed Grant had no way to resupply his army and was forced to end the campaign and retreat to Memphis, TN.
Illinois Central Years (1872-1982).
After the Civil War, the Mississippi Central was rebuilt under the guidance of Absolom M. West and eventually the Illinois Central Railroad started to acquire the line in 1872. Illinois Central established their regional headquarters in Water Valley, MS and based a large maintenance facility there. Famed engineer Casey Jones regularly operated passenger trains along the line and it was said locals could set their watches by him due to his strict adherence to published schedules. In 1927, Illinois Central started to shift traffic to their Grenada-Memphis route and closed the maintenance facility in Water Valley. In 1941, passenger service ended along the route and five years later the regional headquarters was relocated from Water Valley to Jackson, TN. Finally, in 1982, 30 miles of track between Oxford and Bruce Junction in Coffeeville was abandoned and the remaining northern portion of the line sold. Illinois Central continued to operate the southern portion of the line from the junction of the Mississippi and Skuna Valley Railroad to Grenada, MS.
Present Day (1982- ).
In March 1982, Kyle Railroad started operating the line under the name Natchez Trace Railway. In 1993, Pioneer Railcorp purchased the line and resurrected the name Mississippi Central Railroad. The primary customer is a particle board plant in Oxford.
In the mid-2000s, all track south of University-Oxford Airport was abandoned and the airport runway expanded over the right of way. MSCI's tracks now end at the airport's perimeter fence. The remaining abandoned right of way has been turned into two different rail trails (Oxford Depot Trail & Thacker Mountain Rail-Trail) and the Gertrude Ford Parkway in Oxford, MS.
Olin Corporation's recent move of its Winchester brand ammunition production to Oxford may generate additional traffic for MSCI.
Motive Power.
MSCI currently operates three locomotives:

Barberenasuchus

Barberenasuchus is an extinct genus of an archosauriform. Fossils (poorly preserved skull and axis vertebra) have been found from the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil of Late Triassic age. Its phylogenetic position within Archosauriformes is uncertain; the author of its description classified it as a sphenosuchid crocodylomorph, while Kischlat (2000) considered it to be a rauisuchian. Irmis, Nesbitt and Sues (2013) stated that they "could not find any crocodylomorph character states preserved in the holotype specimen". Based on the presence of an antorbital fenestra the authors assigned "Barberenasuchus" to Archosauriformes, but stated that without further preparation and study it is not possible to assign it to any specific archosauriform group. It is named in honor of Mário Costa Barberena.

Tidal Arms

Tidal Arms is an experimental/psychedelic/rock band from Brooklyn, New York that formed in 2009. They self-released their first album, "The Sun Exploding", on February 13, 2011, and followed up with a national tour supporting Glassjaw. The band's self-titled second album was released on November 26, 2013 via Black Numbers.
Formation.
Following the break-up of his bands From Autumn To Ashes and Biology, vocalist/drummer Francis Mark went on to form Warship. In 2009, after the departure of Warship's co-founding members, Mark met guitarist Tom Tierney on Craig's List and hired him to perform with the band on a national tour supporting Goblin Cock. Mark and Tierney continued playing together after the tour, splitting time writing between Philadelphia and Brooklyn. Shortly thereafter, ex-Kiss Kiss bassist Patrick Southern was brought into the rehearsals and writing sessions for what would become Tidal Arms.
Band Name Origin.
When two galaxies pass by each other in close proximity, their shapes distort due to each other's gravity. The outside spiral arms splay out into space, often casting stars and dust into the abyss as their host galaxies drift slowly back towards each other in orbit. These spiral distortions are called tidal arms, or more commonly, tidal tails.

Christopher "Chris" Ryall (born April 2) is best known as the Chief Creative Officer and Editor-in-Chief of IDW Publishing (2004–present), and as a writer in the comic book industry. In February 2011, his Eisner Award-nominated series, "Zombies vs. Robots", co-created with artist Ashley Wood, was optioned by Sony Pictures for Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes.
Career.
In 2002, Ryall was hired by filmmaker Kevin Smith to run the entertainment-based MoviePoopShoot.com, one of Smith’s first forays outside of filmmaking.

Cyanea mceldowneyi is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name McEldowney cyanea. It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from the island of Maui. A 2007 count estimated 60 plants remaining in two populations. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1992. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub growing 2 to 3 meters tall. The leaves are up to 35 centimeters long by 9 wide and are lined with hard teeth. The leaves are prickly, especially when new. The inflorescence bears 5 to 7 tubular flowers. The petals are white with purple stripes and have prickles.
This species is threatened by habitat degradation due to feral pigs and exotic plant species such as Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta"), glorybush ("Tibouchina herbacea"), and thimbleberry ("Rubus rosifolius"). It may also suffer from the lack of pollinators.
This plant was named for a Maui forester named George McEldowney.

Renault Captur

The Renault Captur is a mini-crossover manufactured by the French automaker Renault. The production version made its debut at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show and started to be marketed in France during April 2013. The Captur Concept was first shown at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show.
Characteristics.
The car is based on the fourth generation Clio and incorporates design lines from the homonymous concept, as part of Renault's renovated design strategy developed by Laurens van den Acker. It has various customisation options for the interior and the exterior.
The Captur has some new elements as a big, easily reachable by the driver, drawer-like glovebox instead of a conventional glove compartment in left-hand drive models. As standard, the car has parking sensors and voice activation for certain functions. In some versions it also adds removable seat covers with zippers, a new Renault's satellite navigation system with touch screen, reverse cameras and automated head lamps and windscreen wiper.
The Captur achieved a 5-star rating at the 2013 EuroNCAP tests. Between its standard safety equipment it has three-point seat belts, two airbags, cruise control, speed limiter, ESC, ABS and audible and visual seat belt reminder warnings.
Sales.
Despite being on the market for less than a full year, it managed to rank third in the European small crossover segment for 2013, with just over 84,000 sales, behind the Nissan Juke and the Dacia Duster, and it was the segment's best seller in the last quarter of 2013.
Engines.
The Captur is powered by a range of petrol and diesel engines.
Awards.
The Captur won What Car? 2014 Best small SUV Less than £16,000. It was also named "Voiture de l'Année 2013" (2013 Best Car) by the French Association of

High school career.
Hardaway, who is the son of Yolanda and NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway, spent his freshman year at Palmer Trinity School before transferring to Miami Palmetto High School. As a freshman, he played high school football for a year before focusing on basketball. As he focused on basketball, he had a tumultuous relationship with his father, who acted like a second coach, and was overlooked by most college basketball programs. Michigan was the first school to contact him, communicating by mail during his sophomore year. During his junior year, Michigan head coach John Beilein invited him on an unofficial visit to watch Michigan play #4 Duke on December 6 to see unranked Michigan pull an upset. The 81–73 victory was an important win for the program. Following his junior season, Hardaway began training with Ed Downs, with whom he would work every summer until he became an NBA draftee. In the summer before his senior season, he attended Beilein’s Elite Camp in Ann Arbor, Michigan, receiving an offer that he accepted. At the time, Hardaway was unranked in the Rivals.com Top-150 and his only other offers were from Minnesota and Kansas State. He was a first team All-City selection in 2009 and 2010 after being a third team selection in 2008. During his 2009–10 senior season, he averaged 31.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 4.0 assists. In the Florida state championships against Pine Crest School, he posted 42 points against Brandon Knight who had 36. ESPN rated him as the 93rd best player and 28th best shooting guard in the class of 2010. Scout.com rated him as the 36th best shooting guard in his class. He was not top-ranked by Rivals.com. Hardaway has played summer Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for both the South Florida Heat and Chicago's Mac Irvin Fire, where he teamed with Meyers Leonard and McDonald's All-American Jereme Richmond.
College career.
Freshman year.
Although Hardaway led the team in scoring in his first career game and the season opener with 19 points against , he was soon in a shooting slump that saw him shoot 4 for 30 on his field goals in late November games against Syracuse and . These games marked the beginning of a slump during which he went 13 consecutive games without achieving a 50% field goal percentage and 19 games without exceeding that number.
Hardaway earned four Big Ten Freshman of the week awards. On December 27, the Big Ten Conference named Hardaway co-freshman of the week along with Jared Sullinger. On December 23, 2010, against , the team tied its December 13, 2008 single-game school record of 16 three-point field goals made, and Hardaway was one of three Wolverines to make 4 three-point shots. It was Hardaway's first 20-point game. On February 14, Hardaway earned his second Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week recognition for his first career double-double on February 9 against Northwestern (17 points and career-high 10 rebounds) and a career-high 26 points on February 12 against Indiana. The following week, Hardaway earned a third Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week award as he became the first Michigan freshman to score thirty points in a game in eight years. His thirty points came in a 75–72 February 19 overtime victory over Iowa. He had also scored 10 points and added 5 assists in a 54–52 loss to Illinois. On February 28, Hardaway earned his third consecutive and fourth overall Big Ten Conference Freshman of the week recognition. During the week, Hardaway extended his double-digit scoring streak to eleven by posting 22 points against Minnesota on February 26 after scoring 16 against #12 Wisconsin on February 23. For the week, he shot 9 for 15 on his three-point shots.
As a result of the three consecutive freshman of the week performances and a final week in which he scored 20 in the team's only game, he averaged 20.1 points during the final 7 games of the regular season while the team won six of its final eight, which enabled it to finish tied for fourth for the conference standings and earn the fourth seed in the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He led the team in scoring during the 18-game conference schedule of the 2010–11 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, edging out teammate Darius Morris by a 268–263 (14.9–14.6 points per game) margin. He also led the team in steals (1.17/game), free throw percentage (71.2%, min 2.0 made/game), three point shooting percentage (44.2%, min 1.0 made/game), and three-point shots made per game (2.56) over the course of the conference schedule. Following the Big Ten Conference season, Hardaway was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media. Hardaway was also one of two unanimous All-Freshman team selections by the coaches. He was one of 21 players selected to the 2011 Collegeinsider.com Freshmen All-America selection.
In the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Tournament against Ohio State, he set the Michigan freshman single-season three-point shots made record of 74. For the season, Hardaway led the team in three-point shots made per game and free throw percentage (among qualifying players). He finished the season with 16 consecutive double digit scoring efforts.
Following the season he was invited to the June 17 — June 24, 2011 17-man tryouts for the 12-man FIBA Under-19 World Championship team by USA Basketball. The 12 selected players competed as Team USA in the 2011 FIBA U19 World Championships in Latvia from June 30 — July 10, 2011. He was selected to the team.
Sophomore year.
As a sophomore he was a preseason top 50 watchlist selection for the John R. Wooden Award and the Naismith College Player of the Year. In the 3-game November 21–23 2011 Maui Invitational Tournament, Hardaway scored 60 points against the #8 Memphis Tigers, #6 Duke Blue Devils, and 2011–12 Pacific-12 season favorite UCLA Bruins, which helped the team finish in third place and earned him a place on the All-Tournament team. For his performance at the Maui Classic, he earned the Big Ten Player of the Week. In addition, he was named Big Ten Player of the Week by College Sports Madness. In the subsequent game, he picked up two fouls against Virginia in the first 5:33 and sat the final 14:27 of the first half. He finished the November 29 contest with just 5 points, snapping a 22-game double-digit scoring streak. On December 29, he opened the 2011–12 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season with 26 points against Penn State, despite making only 1 of 7 three-point shots. On January 8, 2012, he had his second career double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds against 19th ranked Wisconsin. By early February, he was in a deep shooting slump. He posted his second double-double of the season and third of his career on March 1 against Illinois with 25 points and a career-high 11 rebounds. As a sophomore, he earned the 2011–12 All-Big Ten 3rd team recognition by the coaches and media.
Junior year.
CBS Sports listed him as the 35th best player in its preseason top 100. He was a preseason John R. Wooden Award top 50 selection. During the season, Trey Burke and Hardaway were constantly referred to as the best backcourt in college basketball. The praise came from a variety of leading media outlets such as FOX Sports, ESPN color commentator Dick Vitale, ESPN journalists such as Miles Simon, "Bleacher Report" columnist Zach Dirlam (who included backcourt depth provided by Nik Stauskas), as well as lots of local press.
Hardaway began the season with a double-double by scoring 25 points (including 5-for-5 three point shooting) and adding 10 rebounds. His fourth career double-double earned him his second Big Ten Player of the Week award. Hardaway earned the NIT Season Tip-Off MVP with 39 points total in the November 21 semifinal and November 23 final against Pittsburgh and Kansas State, respectively. On December 20, he posted a career-high 7 assists against Eastern Michigan. Hardaway suffered an ankle injury that caused him to miss the December 29 game against Central Michigan and that broke his 81 consecutive games played streak that went back to the beginning of his Michigan career. In the subsequent game on January 3, he returned to the lineup for the 2012–13 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season opener against Northwestern with 21 points and four assists in a 94–66 victory. Two games later on January 9, he tied a career high with 11 rebounds and added 15 points for his fifth career double-double. On January 17, Michigan defeated Minnesota (#9 AP/#12 Coaches) at Williams Arena, marking the first time Michigan defeated a top-10 team on the road since a December 6, 1996 victory by the 1996–97 team over Duke. Hardaway earned a second Big Ten Player of the Week Award following a 21-points performance on 7-for-8 shooting (4-for-5 three-point shot) with 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks. On January 28, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992. On February 5, Hardaway tallied a career high 6 three-point shots, including three on consecutive possessions to give Michigan its first lead of the second half in an overtime victory against Ohio State.
Prior to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Jeff Goodman of CBSSports.com named Michigan with Hardaway first among tournament teams in terms of having the most future NBA talent on its roster (in the absence of Kentucky who was relegated to the 2013 National Invitation Tournament). As a number four seed, Michigan defeated its first NCAA tournament opponent, South Dakota State, 71–56. Hardaway established a new NCAA tournament career-high with 21 points. The 27th victory of the season gave the team its most wins in 20 years and matched head coach John Beilein's career high. In the regional finals on March 31 against Florida, freshman Nik Stauskas made all 6 of his three-point shot attempts, pushing his single-season total to 79 and surpassing Hardaway's single-season freshman school record. Following the regional championship postgame prayer and with Mrs. Beilein's consent, Hardaway and Mitch McGary gave 
head coach John Beilein a gatorade shower. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Hardaway contributed a team-high 13 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists. Two nights later, Michigan lost in the championship game to Louisville by an 82–76 margin as Hardaway contributed 12 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists.
Honors and awards.
Following the 2012–13 Big Ten season he was a 1st team All-Big Ten selection by the coaches and a 2nd team selection by the media. On March 12, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association named Hardaway to its 2012–13 Men's All-District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) Team, based upon voting from its national membership. He was named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches Division I All‐District 7 first team on March 26, as selected and voted on by member coaches of the NABC, making him eligible for the State Farm Coaches’ Division I All-America team.
Professional career.
2013 NBA Draft.
At 12:21 PM ET on April 4, Forbes sports business reporter Darren Heitner tweeted that Hardaway and teammate Burke would declare for the 2013 NBA Draft. At 2:23 PM, Heitner tweeted that Hardaway, Sr. said his son was undecided. On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek the advice of the NBA advisory committee. The draft board has until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 12, ESPN journalist Myron Medcalf predicted Hardaway would enter the draft noting that the 2014 draft was likely to be wing-heavy. On April 17, Hardaway declared for the NBA Draft. Hardaway signed with sports agent Mark Bartelstein, the father of a former Michigan teammate who represents 37 NBA players. Hardaway was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. At the combine, Hardaway strengthened his draft stock with his physical measurements and his athletic results.
Hardaway was drafted 24th by the New York Knicks, who had entered draft day with only two guards under contract. Burke and Hardaway became the first Michigan duo selected in the first round since Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose in the 1994 NBA Draft. Hardaway joined his father (14th in 1989 NBA Draft) as a first round selection.
New York Knicks.
Hardaway tweeted that he chose to wear jersey number 5 because that was his father's number as a rookie. On July 8, the Knicks announced that Hardaway signed a 4-year $6.1 million contract, clearing the way for him to play in the 2013 NBA Summer League. In the second game of the summer league on July 14, he suffered a bruised wrist. At the time, ESPNNewYork.com journalist Jared Zwerling noted that Hardaway had shown strong half court offensive skills, such as the ability to drive off of a pick and roll and an explosive first step, but that his lateral defensive skills needed development. His Summer League season ended with the injury although the injury only had a short term impact. In the Knicks' first preseason game, which came on October 9 against the Boston Celtics in Providence, Rhode Island, Hardaway scored 16 points, 10 of which came in the fourth quarter, including the game winning shot with just over 8 seconds left. During the preseason, Hardaway shot 18-44 (40.9%) on his three-point shots. As a result of his performance and a 5-game suspension for J. R. Smith, he began the 2013–14 NBA season with what "Sporting News" described as a well earned role on the team.
Hardaway made his regular season debut in the 2013–14 Knicks season opener on October 30 at home against Milwaukee with 5 points on a 2–2 shooting night and 2 assists during a 15 minutes of playing time. In his second game, on October 31 against the Chicago Bulls, he played 27 minutes totalling 10 points and 3 rebounds. After Smith returned to the lineup, Hardaway scored 11 points against the San Antonio Spurs on November 10 and 14 points against the Atlanta Hawks on November 13 for sequential career highs. He posted his first 3-assist game on November 16 in another contest against the Hawks. On December 1 against the New Orleans Pelicans, Hardaway had a career-high 21 points. When Kenyon Martin sat out against the 
Boston Celtics on December 8, Hardaway earned his first NBA start. With Carmelo Anthony and Raymond Felton sitting out the Christmas Day game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Hardaway matched his career high with 21 points. Hardaway was one of three nominees for Eastern Conference NBA Rookie of the Month for December. Hardaway received a lot of publicity for a January 9 dunk over Ray Allen. On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend. The following night Hardaway set a career high with a game high (tied with Carmelo Anthony) 29 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Hardaway was one of four nominees for Eastern Conference NBA Rookie of the Month for January. In the February 14 Rising Stars Challenge, Hardaway had 36 points, including 7 three point shots, many coming in a one-on-one battle with Dion Waiters. Hardaway was one of three finalists for February Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month, but he lost to Victor Oladipo. After stringing together three consecutive 20-point games, Hardaway was a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and for Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month in March. He was also a finalist for Eastern Conference Player of the Month in April. Hardaway finished fifth in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award balloting. As a result of his fifth place finish in the separate NBA All-Rookie Team voting he was a first team NBA All-Rookie selection.
Hardaway committed to represent the Knicks in 2014 NBA Summer League.
Personal life.
He has a sister named Nia, a dog named Tito, and is the son of five-time NBA All-Star Tim Hardaway. During the 2012–13 season Hardaway memorialized deceased friends on his left shoe and deceased family members on his right shoe.

Shiguan kindergarten attack

The Shiguan kindergarten attack occurred at a kindergarten in Shiguan village in Gongyi, Henan, People's Republic of China on May 8, 2006. At about 9 a.m. that morning 18-year-old Bai Ningyang entered a classroom on the second floor of the kindergarten, which was reported to have been run illegally. In there were 21 children and a female teacher, who, according to locals, had rejected his advances. Threatening them with a knife, Bai forced the whole class to the back of the room. He then locked the door and poured gasoline from two bottles on the floor. Before setting it on fire and escaping he told one child, whose parents he knew, to leave. Two five-year-old children died at the scene, ten more succumbed to their wounds in hospital, and four others, as well as the teacher were injured.
The next day, during an extensive search operation involving 800 police officers, Bai was found hiding in a cave in the nearby mountains and arrested. He was sentenced to death and executed.
Two days prior to the attack, on May 6, Bai had a quarrel with a farmer who had stopped him when using a newly paved road. Later that day he armed himself with two knives and chased the man through the village. When his father tried to intervene he took a five-year-old boy hostage, though the child managed to free himself, whereupon Bai ran away.

The Best of Ray Stevens (1968 album)

The Best of Ray Stevens is a collection of previously recorded songs by Ray Stevens for Mercury Records, the very first label that Stevens signed with. It was released in 1968 by a subsidiary of Mercury called Wing Records. It is not to be confused with the 1967 compilation of the same name. Unlike most of the collections of Stevens' music, this compilation begins with the serious songs of Stevens. The back of the album cover contains an essay by Stuart Lewis that describes Stevens' ability to interpret dramatic songs as equally as much as comedic songs. Lewis' essay begins with comparing this collection with a person, stating that it has two different sides. Indeed, the first side of the LP contains five of his serious songs, while the second side contains five of his novelty songs.

Teichmüller modular group

In mathematics, a Teichmüller modular group, or mapping class group of a surface, or homeotopy group of a surface, is the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of an oriented surface. It is also a group of automorphisms of a Teichmüller space.
Presentation.
Dehn showed that the Teichmüller modular group of a compact oriented surface is finitely generated, a set of generators being given by some Dehn twists. showed that it is finitely presented.
Examples.
The Teichmüller modular group of a torus is the modular group SL2(Z).
The Teichmüller modular group of a sphere with "n" points removed is the spherical braid group on "n" strands, which is the quotient of the Braid group B"n" by its infinite cyclic center.
Dehn–Nielsen theorem.
If "S" is a compact Riemann surface with basepoint "p" and fundamental group π1("S","p"), then the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of "S" is naturally isomorphic to the outer automorphism group Aut(π1("S","p"))/π1("S","p") of π1("S","p"). The Dehn–Nielsen theorem states that the Teichmüller modular group is a subgroup of index 2 of this outer automorphism group, consisting of the orientation-preserving outer automorphisms, that act trivially on the second cohomology group H2(π1("S","p"),Z) = H2("S",Z) = Z.
Action on Teichmüller space.
The Teichmüller modular groups act as automorphisms of the corresponding Teichmüller spaces, preserving most of the structure such as the complex structure, the Teichmüller metric, the Weil-Petersson metric, and so on. Royden proved that in the case of a compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1, the Teichmüller modular group is the group of all biholomorphic maps of Teichmüller space.
Analogues with other groups.
The Teichmüller modular group behaves in some ways like the automorphism group of a free group. The reason is that the Teichmüller modular group is an index 2 subgroup of the group of outer automorphisms of the fundamental group of a surface, and fundamental groups of surfaces are quite similar to free groups.
The Teichmüller modular group also behaves rather like a linear group. proved that it has many of the properties of linear groups. The action of the Teichmüller modular group on Teichmüller space is similar to the action of the Siegel modular group on the Siegel upper half space.

Modalasala

Modalasala (First Time) is a 2010 Kannada film directed by Purushottham and Produced by Yogesh Narayan. The movie stars Yash and Bhama in the lead roles. Rangayana Raghu, Tara, Avinash and Sharan play supporting roles.
Plot.
The film is about two youngsters, both of whom are quite the ideal children. Imagine a girl who makes a guy wait hoping to get her parents to approve his proposal; or a guy who says, “I’ve met the girls parents, I see them in her eyes”. These are the stuff most of the typical families dream of, as they plan their kids’ futures.
The film has its funny moments and occasionally, an overdose of sentimental scenes. The director has done a fairly decent job with the narrative and Yash impresses in his role as the lovelorn urban lad. His dancing skills deserve special mention — he’s easily one of the best we have in Sandalwood.
New girl Bhama makes a decent debut, though Deepu, who has dubbed for her, deserves equal applause. Rangayana Raghu and Tara excel, the film shows Raghu in a different light, as opposed to his over-the-top comical roles.
Reception.
"Modala Sala" completed 100 days of run and was a commercial success. The film was Yash's first commercial solo hit. Yash's performance in the lover boy role was well received.

Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management

Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management is an appellate case pending in both the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court of a lawsuit decided in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The District Court found unconstitutional section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines the terms "marriage" as "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."
Legal Proceedings.
Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) filed the case in District Court in Connecticut on behalf of six same-sex couples and one widower in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire, making the same arguments it made in "Gill v. Office of Personnel Management": that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act should be found unconstitutional based on the Fifth Amendment, equal protection, and the federal government's historically consistent deference to state definitions of marriage. It prevents the federal government from recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples who are legally married in their own states or other jurisdictions and restricts the federal government from granting such couples benefits it provides to different-sex married couples.
On February 23, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder released a memo regarding two lawsuits challenging DOMA section 3, "Pedersen v. OPM" and "Windsor v. United States" stating, "After careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases." However, the administration also announced it intended to continue enforcing the law until its repeal by Congress or until ruled unconstitutional in court.
On April 18, 2011, leaders of the House of Representatives announced they had chosen former United States Solicitor General Paul Clement to defend the case on behalf of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG). On July 15, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. On June 20, 2012, BLAG asked that the case be put on hold pending Supreme Court action on the First Circuit decision in "Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services" and "Gill v. Office of Personnel Management", which BLAG was appeal. The Court denied the request on July 4, 2012.
On July 31, Judge Vanessa L. Bryant found for the plaintiffs. She wrote, "aving considered the purported rational bases proffered by both BLAG and Congress and concluded that such objectives bear no rational relationship to section 3 of DOMA as a legislative scheme, the Court finds that no conceivable rational basis exists for the provision."
Appeals.
The DOJ appealed the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on August 17, 2012, and Pedersen filed a petition for certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court on August 21. On September 11, the Solicitor General filed a similar petition urging the Supreme Court to consider taking the case if the court chooses not to accept either the "Golinksi" or "Massachusetts" petitions. The Supreme Court denied these petitions on June 27, 2013, following its decision in "Windsor".
Plaintiffs.
Joanne Pedersen and Ann Meitzen of Connecticut: Joanne is a retired civilian employee of the Department of the Navy and Ann recently retired from work at a service agency for the elderly and disabled due to a chronic lung ailment. Joanne cannot put Ann on her federal employee health insurance plan because of DOMA, which would save them a significant amount of monthly income.
Geraldine and Suzanne Artis of Connecticut: Geraldine, who is studying for a degree in counseling, and Suzanne, a school librarian, have been together for 18 years. They have three sons – a teenager and twin 12-year-olds. Because they cannot file their federal tax returns jointly, they have paid thousands of dollars extra in taxes since they got married in 2009.
Gerald “Gerry” Passaro II of Connecticut: Gerry lost his spouse, Thomas Buckholz, to cancer after more than 13 years together. Gerry, who is disabled and lives on a modest income, was denied Tom’s pension and a Social Security death benefit because of DOMA.
Damon “Jerry” Savoy and John Weiss of Connecticut: Jerry is a federal employee with more than 20 years of service and John left his job as an interior designer to be a stay-at-home parent for their three children. Because of DOMA, Jerry can’t cover John on his federal employee health insurance plan so they pay an extra 450.00 per month out of pocket for John’s health insurance.
James “Flint” Gehre and Bradley Kleinerman of Connecticut: Brad and Flint have been together for more than 20 years. The parents of three boys, the relocated from California to Connecticut to give their kids a better quality of life. But because they cannot file their tax returns jointly they have paid thousands of dollars more in taxes over the course of their three-year marriage.
Janet Geller and Joanne Marquis of New Hampshire: Jan and Jo are retired teachers who have been together since 1979. They both receive pensions through the New Hampshire Retirement System. Because Joanne had more than 30 years of public school service, she is qualified for a health insurance benefit for herself and her spouse. But she was denied the spousal benefit for Jan because of DOMA, which means they pay more for Jan’s health care coverage.
Raquel Ardin and Lynda DeForge of Vermont: Raquel and Lynda are military veterans who have been together since 1977. They worked together for many years at the U.S. Postal Service. Raquel suffers from degenerative arthritis in her neck and requires quarterly medical treatments at a VA hospital in Connecticut. Lynda was denied Family Medical Leave Act time off to accompany Lynda to her appointments.

Gerald Clarke (artist)

Gerald Clarke is a sculptor, installation, and conceptual artist from the Cahuillia Band of Mission Indians. His work often reflects on and questions current issues in Native America and the United States, as well as his personal life.
"...through art, I can come to an understanding of myself, my community and the world around me." - Gerald Clarke
Background.
Early life.
Gerald Clarke was born in Hemet, California in 1967 to Carol and Gerald Clarke, Sr., his father being born Cahuilla. At the age of 3 his parents divorced and he moved with his siblings and mother to Orange County, and on the weekends he would return to the reservation to spend time with his father. At age 16, he moved to Arkansas with his mother and sister. He attended Ozarka College, where he majored in welding, electrical maintenance, and hydraulics; three necessary components to the artworks Clarke would create as a full-time artist.
Higher education.
After graduation from vocational school, Clarke worked as a welder, and eventually met Stacy Brown, whom he would eventually marry. Ready for change, Clarke was accepted to University of Central Arkansas where in 1991 he obtained a Bachelors of Arts in painting and sculpture. Clarke then went on to obtain his Masters of Arts in 1992 from Stephen F. Austin State University. After graduation he became an adjunct professor of art at Lon Morris College all the while working on his Masters thesis. With his thesis, which looked at the use of traditional American Indian themes and images in contemporary art, accepted Clarke received his Masters of Fine Arts from Stephen F. Austin in 1994.
Teaching career.
With his Masters in hand, Clarke headed the art department at Northeast Texas Community College in 1996, eventually moving on to East Central University to serve as assistant professor of art in 1998.
Current life.
With the death of Gerald Clarke, Sr. in 2003, Clarke and his family returned to the Cahuilla Band of Indians reservation. When not creating his own work or teaching art at Idyllwild Arts Academy, Clarke runs a storage business with wife Stacy, assists in running the Clarke family cattle ranch, and remains heavily involved in Cahuilla culture. He is also is a frequent lecturer, speaking regionally about Native art, culture and issues. In 2008 he was elected to the Cahuilla tribal government, which he still serves on. When not working, Clarke participates in Bird Singing, a traditional form of singing that tells the cosmology of the Cahuilla people.
Fine art career.
Artist statement.
"My ultimate goal as an artist is to remind people of our shared humanity. I wish to give Indian culture back the humanity that has been taken from it by stereotypes created over the past five centuries. Neither the super-shaman nor the drunken-indian do anything to convey what we as a people feel. In my work, I search for the unconventional beauty one finds only in the TRUTH. It celebrates, it mourns and out outshines all else. I'm a California Indian- part traditionalist, part Disneyland. I want to express the passion, pain and reverence I feel as a contemporary Native person." -Gerald Clarke, 2000
Traditional influences.
A traditional art form of the Cahuilla people, basketry is not only a community, but a family tradition for Clarke. While his artworks do not utilize the same materials as seen in traditional basket making, he sees his creation process as similar to theirs: "Cahuilla basket makers go out and gather materials, and they put them together to produce something that is both functional and aesthetic. I kind of do my work the same way. I go out and I gather these things. I combine them."
Major works and themes.
Clarke's work is often politically minded, reflecting on current and past issues taking place in Indian Country, California, the United States as a whole, and within his personal life.
Contemporary Native America.
In 1996 Clarke created "Artifacts", a collection of four shovels with the blades down, meant to be leaned against a wall. The top handles are wrapped in colored ribbons: black, green, red and yellow, colors indicative of the American Indian community. Writing, in black marker, travels around the handle, until the top of the blade. The four shovels represent his father and one for his three aunts, who are represented on their own shovel by a photograph affixed before the blade. A cattle brand is welded into each shovel blade, like those found on Clarke's family ranch. His goal with "Artifacts" is to show how one can dig up the past to reveal American Indians in the world today.
In 2009 Clarke's solo show "One Tract Mind" looked at the effects of tract housing on Native communities in Southern California. In this show Clarke experimented heavily in digital art as well as other mixed media forms looking at water rights, the preservation of sacred sites, and the opposition by Native communities to the invasion of suburbia.
Road signs.
In 2001 Clarke started to create road signs to be displayed along roads on the Cahuilla reservation and near his family's ranch entrance. These road signs show words in the Cahuilla language:
The signs, welcomed by the community, eventually disappeared off the side of the road, plucked off by vandals or road side collectors. Clarke sought to remind his own tribal members that they are valuable to this world. 
When Clarke was rewarded an Eiteljorg Fellowship, from the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, in 2007 he created three signs relevant to the Miami people, connecting with the Miami Nation of Indians in Indiana. Working with Miami artist and historian Scott Shoemaker the three pieces were installed on the museum grounds where they reside to this day:
A wider world.
Examining not only Native America today, Clarke also looks at the current state of affairs in the United State and beyond. In the video and installation artwork "Task" (2002 and 2007) he is shown "ironing out the wrinkles that plague our world" in response to September 11, 2001, which he describes as his own type of healing ritual, a ritual and experience that caused him to question the future that his own children would face and how the creation of fine art and freedom of speech is an intricate part to the healing of the United States through this fragile time.
Native American art and authenticity.
The question of authenticity is a frequent discussion in art markets where Native American art is the emphasis. Another connection to his family cattle ranch, Clarke created two works to discuss the topic of authenticity: "To the Discriminating Collector" in 2002 and "Branded" in 2006. Creating a branding iron that spells out "INDIAN", "To the Discriminating Collector" sets aim at collectors that put their stamp of "Indian" on artworks and creators they deem worthy of the term, allowing them to brand books, clothing, films, objects, religion "Indian" with one stamp of the branding iron. He followed up the branding iron with using it, burning the branding into a white sheet of paper. Conceptually the work is simple yet the meaning is meant to question the lack of authenticity that Native American art collectors find in conceptual art by contemporary artists. Many of these collectors seek traditional art forms as a valid form of Native art, while contemporary artists are placed on the back burner in collections and Indian markets.
Performance pieces and other conceptual installation works further to examine Indian markets throughout the country. Native Americans, specifically writers and religious figures, have often been sought by non-Native people to provide guidance and wisdom not often found in traditional Western religions. Artworks such as 1998's "Indian Wisdom and Manifest Destiny" is an installation piece featuring two gumball machines: "Manifest Destiny" which is covered in fabric displaying the flag of the United States and a white cowboy hat and "Indian Wisdom" which is covered in fabric reminiscent of Southwestern Indian blankets, and features a picture of Clarke stating "Indian Wisdom" in it. Clarke describes it as his own form of selling out and while the gumball machines display containers filled dollar bills, which only cost a mere 25 cents to obtain, the purchaser actually receives a print out with politically minded statements on the back.
Performance pieces such as "Extreme Makeover" and "Antiques Road Show" depict Clark questioning Native American stereotypes, the "whitening" of Native peoples by Europeans, and further exploration into authenticity of being a "real Indian."
Diabetes and alcoholism.
Diabetes and alcoholism are serious factors of reservation life for many Native communities. Responding to the unhealthy social conditions Clark created "Continuum Basket" (2002); a large wall sculpture that shows the spiraling technique traditional in Cahuilla basketry, it is made of beer and soda cans.

SECAT RG-60

__NOTOC__
The SECAT RG-60 was a prototype light sporting biplane built in France shortly after World War II. It was a conventional single-seat design with an open cockpit. The lower wing had a smaller span and chord than the upper wing and was braced against the upper wing and against the fuselage sides with I-struts but no wires. The undercarriage consisted of two fixed, divided main units plus a fixed tailskid. Power was supplied by a tractor-mounted piston engine that drove a two-bladed propeller. Construction was of wood throughout.
History.
The RG-60 was displayed together with other SECAT designs at the "Semaine de l'Aviation légère" (light aviation week) held at Toussus-le-Noble from 22 April 1947 but was already somewhat outdated by the standards of the time. SECAT produced no further examples, and if the RG-60 ever received a civil registration, the details are now lost.

Piano Quartet (Schumann)

The Piano Quartet in E flat major, Op. 47, by Robert Schumann was written in 1842. It has been described as the "creative double" of Schumann's Piano Quintet, also in E-flat major. It is one of the most frequently performed and recorded piano quartets in the standard repertoire.
Background.
The work was composed in 1842, during Schumann's "Chamber Music Year." Prior to that year Schumann had completed no chamber music at all with the exception of an early piano quartet (in 1829). However, during his year-long concentration on the genre he wrote three string quartets and a piano quintet in addition to the piano quartet. 
According to John Daverio, the work shows the influence of Franz Schubert's second piano trio, also in E-flat Major.
Form.
The piece is in four movements:
Second Movement: "Scherzo: Molto vivace - Trio I - Trio II".
This skittering movement resembles the "elfin scherzos" of Mendelssohn.
Third Movement: "Andante cantabile".
A deeply romantic and song-like, melodic movement, with the cello prominent.
Finale: "Finale: Vivace".
A heavily contrapuntal movement built upon the three-note figure introduced in the coda of the preceding movement.

Andrew Dexter, Jr.

Andrew Dexter, Jr. (March 28, 1779 -– November 2, 1837), was an American lawyer, financier, and speculator. He is known for committing one of the first major financial frauds in the United States. He was also the founder of Montgomery, Alabama.
Early life.
The son of Andrew Dexter, Sr., a successful merchant and one of the first cloth manufacturers in America, the younger Dexter was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts on March 28, 1779. He was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, graduated from Brown University in 1798, studied law, and became an attorney in Boston, Massachusetts.
Career.
In the early 1800s Dexter left the law to become involved in business and finance. In 1807 he began construction of the Exchange Coffee House. At seven stories, the tallest building in Boston at the time, Dexter planned the site as a location for business offices, reading rooms, conference rooms and dining rooms to facilitate the transaction of business. In his concept, the Exchange Coffee House would also provide a service by helping establish the relative value of the bank notes of the various financial institutions.
At the time, banks transacted business by issuing paper notes that could be redeemed for their value in gold or silver. Banks, businessmen and workers generally exchanged the notes between each other at a discount to facilitate commercial transactions, and the discounts varied widely depending on each bank's reputation, its distance from the locality where business was being conducted, and other factors. Traders in bank notes set the discount rate by conducting business in outdoor meetings on several Boston streets. Dexter intended for the bank note traders to formalize their business by providing them indoor space at the Coffee House.
To finance the construction of the Exchange Coffee House, Dexter took advantage of this unregulated system by starting or gaining control of banks located far from Boston, including Rhode Island, western Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Michigan, and issuing bank notes that far exceeded the banks' gold and silver deposits. His intent was to circulate in Boston bank notes from locations so far away that no one would ever redeem them for gold or silver. This meant that he could issue bank notes in unlimited quantities, as long as no one suspected there wasn't sufficient specie to back them.
In 1807 President Thomas Jefferson implemented an embargo against Great Britain and France as a protest against violations of American neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars. Business in the United States slowed as a result, and holders of bank notes began to redeem them for specie. In addition, the traders in bank notes whom Dexter hoped to entice into the Exchange Coffee House to conduct their business preferred to continue working outdoors, so he did not realize the increased customer traffic and rents he anticipated.
Becoming suspicious of Dexter's machinations, in 1808 a group of Boston merchants led by Nathan Appleton took their story to the press. As a result, shopkeepers began to refuse the bills issued by Dexter's banks, meaning he could no longer pay suppliers and workmen. Appleton and his allies then paid individuals to travel throughout the country, turning in to the issuing institutions the bank notes the Boston merchants had accepted as payment for goods and services and demanding payment in specie. When the banks proved unable to redeem their paper currency, they collapsed. By 1809 the extent of Dexter's fraud became widely known, and his wife and he fled to Nova Scotia to avoid prosecution.
Ownership of the Exchange Coffee House passed on to other investors, and it remained open and partially occupied until it was destroyed in an 1818 fire.
Later life.
During the War of 1812 Dexter relocated to Athens, New York, where he lived with his father and brother, who assisted him in using New York's lenient bankruptcy laws to partially satisfy his creditors and rebuild his finances.
Dexter's father died in 1816 and Dexter inherited his father's claims to purchase at a discount lands in Georgia and what is now Alabama. At the 1817 auctions in Milledgeville, Georgia, Dexter bought several hundred acres on the east bank of the Alabama River near a Creek Indian trading post, where he founded a town called New Philadelphia. When Alabama entered the union in 1819 Dexter's town was renamed Montgomery.
Charlotte Dexter, Andrew's wife, died in 1819 just weeks after their arrival in Alabama, probably from yellow fever. Dexter raised their three children, farming, buying and selling land, and becoming involved in other ventures, including land speculation in Texas and Mexico. His fortunes waxed and waned as the economy rose and fell. At the time of his death he was once again near poverty, his fortunes reduced during the Panic of 1837.
Death and burial.
Dexter died of yellow fever in Mobile, Alabama on November 2, 1837. He is known to have been buried in Montgomery's Oakwood Cemetery, but the exact location is not known, and attempts to locate it have not been successful.
Family.
Andrew Dexter, Jr. was the nephew of Samuel Dexter, the brother of Simon Newton Dexter, and the son in law of Perez Morton.

The Syndicate is the Outfit's A-team, representing the league in bouts counting toward WFTDA rankings. The Outfit added the Shade Brigade, the B-level team, in January 2009. The Shade Brigade usually competes against lower-ranked WFTDA leagues or the B-teams of leagues that have higher rankings. Due to the large number of new skaters joining the Outfit at the end of 2010, the league voted to start an additional C-level team called the Shakedown for newer skaters. The Shakedown began competing in August 2011. All Chicago Outfit home games are held in the Windy City Fieldhouse. 
The Outfit is a democratic league, run by the skaters and for the skaters. The league has a long history of contributing charitably to several other non-profit organizations, including the Howard Brown Health Center, Ignite the Spirit, Family of Moxie Mayhem, Derby News Network, Help Tequila, Girls Rock! Chicago, the American Cancer Society, and Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN). The Outfit also coaches the Chicago Riots, which is a junior roller derby league consisting of girls ages 12 to 17.

Early years.
On May 25, 1914, she was born as Kathryn Irene Rea in Corydon, Iowa to Fred Albertson Rea and Lenore Gertrude Wilson. She was raised on a farmstead in Missouri. At age 13, while living in Centerville, Iowa, she won 2nd place for piano performance in a statewide contest. She graduated from high school at the age of 15, earning scholarships to Stephens College, a women's college in Columbia, Missouri, and later to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. She worked as an accompanist for other students, and performed in Columbia, Des Moines, and Chicago as a singer/pianist, primarily in hotel ballrooms with various touring big bands. In Des Moines, she and Ronald Reagan modeled together for fashion magazines.

Before making films she worked in Chicago and New York City hotels, musical stage, and radio. She got the lead role in a new musical revue, "Two for the Show", in which she introduced a song written to showcase her vocal style, "How High the Moon", which became a pop standard. According to her son, she had worked in Iowa with Ronald Reagan on radio and print advertising. After she left New York and relocated to California, originally invited to be Fred Astaire's dance partner in movies, Reagan moved there and asked to be introduced around, especially to a good agent. Rea obliged. After Reagan was signed for his first film, the contact ended. Rea was signed with Samuel Goldwyn and appeared in films with several studios under different names, such as Kay Marlowe, Katharine Marlowe, Kay Kimber, Kay Rea, Kea Rea, Kay Rhea, Kathryn Marlow, before landing on Kathryn Marlowe. She quipped that it was ""because no one can understand how to pronounce 'Rea'"". After leaving Hollywood, she had leads in several stage musicals in NYC and London, and roles in Television dramas. She pioneered a daily women's TV program in Ottumwa, Iowa in the early 1950s. Rea was famous for a unique piano style, and for having a three+ octave full-voice range up to high E.
Marriages.
Marlowe, whose stage name was Kay Kimber, married the noted band leader Roy Fox in 1943; the couple had two children, Fredrick Rea and Amanda Kathryn. This was Fox's second of three marriages. The family moved to Great Britain, where Fox enjoyed his greatest popularity. Marlowe worked as a pianist and singer, sometimes as a guest with her husband's orchestra. The marriage ended in divorce after Marlowe and the children were sent back to vacation with her parents in Iowa. Unknown to Marlowe, Fox was having a second business failure due to a his gambling and a recurring bout of pleurisy resulting in another nervous breakdown.
Her second husband, James O'Keefe, worked for the FBI. O'Keefe adopted her children. In 1956 Marlowe retired from show business altogether. She died, aged 96, from numerous debilities and a broken back.

The Austria women's ice hockey Bundesliga (German: or DEBL) is the upper league in Women's ice hockey in Austria. It is organized by the . Austria had 652 female players in 2013.
History.
Founded in 1998, the league uses a format of home and away matches. In the 2004–05 season, the best Austrian teams additionally also competed in the international Elite Women's Hockey League (EWHL). From the following season onward, the top teams only played in the EWHL, making the Bundesliga in a sense the second-level league of Austrian Women's ice hockey. As a result, the title of Austrian champion is decided in a separate tournament titled "" (National Championship), featuring the three teams that play in the EWHL and the top DEBL team. Exceptions were the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons where EWHL clubs were the only competing teams. Since 2008, following the example of the Austrian men's ice hockey league, the DEBL has also featured teams from neighbouring Slovenia.
2010–11 Season.
The six teams of the DEBL are assembled into one division. The teams play each other three times a year.
The top DEBL team qualifies for the "Staatsmeisterschaft" where it meets the three Austrian teams from the EWHL. The tournament uses a home- and away-game format. The two top teams contest the final, using a best-of-three format. The better-placed team has the right to contest the first game in its home ground. The other two teams contest the third-place play-off, also using a best-of-three format.
DEBL II.
In 2004, due to the increasing number of teams, a second division titled DEBL II was created. There was no matchplay in this league in the 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons. 
The team that finishes at the bottom of the DEBL league table at the end of the season meets the top team of the DEBL II over a best-of-three series. The winner of that contest then plays in the DEBL during the next season, while the loser is relegated to the second DEBL.

The ice cream was invented by Matt O'Connor, who claims it is a healthy alternative to other ice creams in the bar. The ice cream is sold in The Icecreamists, in Covent Garden, London. The breast milk donors have been medically screened and the milk pasturised. The ice cream went on sale on 25 February 2011. Within a week of going on sale, the ice cream was seized by officers of Westminster Council to test whether it was suitable for human consumption.
Lady Gaga has threatened to sue the ice cream seller, but the bar has refused to change the name. O'Connor said, "Of course there are those who think it is obnoxious, but the ice cream is made with natural breast milk, organic and free range."

Cyanea pinnatifida

Cyanea pinnatifida is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name sharktail cyanea. It is endemic to Oahu, but it is now extinct in the wild and only exists in cultivation. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
At the time this plant was federally listed as an endangered species in 1991 there was only one individual left. It grew in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu until 2001, when it died. Now some plants are kept at the Lyon Arboretum in Honolulu and a few juveniles have been planted in appropriate habitat. No recruitment has occurred among these, however, and the plant is still considered extinct in the wild.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a shrub which can reach ten feet in height. The leaves are divided into a few deep lobes. The inflorescence produces up to 15 green-tinged white flowers with purple stripes. Little is known about the life history of the plant because so few individuals have been known to science..
The plant was said to be driven to extinction by the destruction and degradation of its habitat by several forces. The most destructive was the feral pig. Others included exotic plant species, such as Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta") and passionflower ("Passiflora suberosa"). Rats and slugs, which are very damaging to many "Cyanea" species, may have affected this one as well.

Calcutta (1947 film)

Calcutta is a 1947 American crime film noir directed by John Farrow, and written and produced by Seton I. Miller. The drama features Alan Ladd, Gail Russell and William Bendix.
Plot.
Commercial pilot in India attempts to avenge friend's murder.
Production.
Calcutta had frequently been in the news with reports of the war and Paramount decided it would make an ideal setting for a film. Production of the movie was announced in late 1944. It was based on an original story by Seton Miller who also acted as screenwriter and producer.
Alan Ladd and William Bendix, who had just appeared in "Two Years Before the Mast" for Miller, were announced as stars, playing pilots who flew over the "hump" from Calcutta to Chungking. Howard da Silva, who had co-starred several times with Ladd, was announced as a co-star but ended up not being cast. John Farrow, who had made two films with Ladd, was chosen to direct.
Filming took place in June and July 1945. Four people were hired as special technical advisers: Joe Rosbert (a member of the Flying Tigers who crashed on "the hump"), Major Whyte (a veteran of the Eighth Burma Rifles), Mrs Madge Schofield (a former resident of Calcutta) and Dr Singh (a resident Hollywood expert on Indian affairs); the last two had small roles in the film. Of the other cast members, June Duprez had suffered a career slump since moving to Hollywood following her appearance in "The Thief of Bagdad" but had been restored to some popularity since appearing in "None But the Lonely Heart". Gail Russell had previously made "Salty O'Rourke" with Ladd. John Witney was from Little Theatre and was a protege of Alan Ladd. Edith King, who had just appeared in Broadway in "Othello", made her film debut. 200 Indian seamen from the British Indian Navy were used as extras.
Reception.
Critical response.
When the film was first released, "The New York Times" film critic Thomas M. Pryor, gave the film a mixed review, writing:
There is just so much that an actor can do on his own to make a character interesting and then he must depend upon the scenarist to provide him with dialogue and situations which will keep the spectator on edge. In "Calcutta," which opened yesterday at the Paramount. Alan Ladd is going through an all-too-familiar exercise. While the actor is giving a competent performance and is nicely abetted by William Bendix, the story by Seton I. Miller, who also produced the film for Paramount, is a sorry mess indeed.
The critic from the "Los Angeles Times" called the film "atmospheric and interest-holding" but thought that Gail Russell was miscast.
More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a positive review, writing:
John Farrow's "Calcutta" is a fast-paced old-fashioned adventure yarn, shot entirely in Paramount's backlot. Seton Miller does the screenplay. It's an entertaining potboiler, though a minor work...Ladd gives an icy action-hero performance as someone who revels in his disdain for women as untrustworthy companions. By Ladd's politically incorrect moves, he takes on the characteristics of the film noir protagonist--which gives this programmer its energy. Ladd quotes an ancient Hindu saying 'Man who trust woman walk on duckweed over pond,' which tells us all we want to know about how he has stayed alive for so long while in the company of dangerous women, ones like Virginia, while Bill so easily succumbed to the beauty of the femme fatale.
Noir analysis.
American studies and film professor, Bob Porfirio discussed the treatment of women found in film noir and novels:
When Ladd rips a pendant from her neck or slaps her around, it makes him appear all the more impervious to women. Their interaction holds this film together and demonstrates the misogynistic strain of hard-boiled fiction; it is as strain implicit in much of post-war American society as well.
Adaptation.
On February 9, 1950, "The Screen Guild Theater," broadcast a 30 minute radio adaptation of the film with Alan Ladd and Gail Russell reprising their film roles.

Sir Samuel, Western Australia

Sir Samuel is an abandoned town located between Leinster and Wiluna in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
Gold was discovered in the area in 1895. Officials lobbied for a townsite to be created in 1896 following the realisation that the area was becoming an important mining centre. The mining warden suggested several names but since the area was already well known as Mount Sir Samuel so the Mount was dropped and the town became Sir Samuel. The townsite was gazetted in 1897. 
The name is derived from the nearby Mount Sir Samuel that was named after Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia Sir Samuel James Way by the explorer Lawrence Wells who was on a surveying expedition in the area in 1892.
A police station camp was opened in the town in 1899 which consisted of tents and brush shelters. The camp was later burnt down in 1901. Tenders were called for to build a new station in 1902 that was completed in 1903 but then closed down in 1910 and the building removed to Youanmi in 1911.

Illinois gubernatorial election, 1848

The Illinois gubernatorial election of 1848 was the ninth election for this office. Democratic governor Augustus C. French was easily re-elected. This was the first gubernatorial election in Illinois that was held on the same date as the presidential election.
This was the first election in which any governor was elected to a second term. The constitution on 1818, which had been replaced this same year, prohibited more than one consecutive term as governor, and Thomas Duncan was the only governor ever to attempt a second term, though it was not consecutive.
At this time in Illinois history the Lieutenant Governor was elected on a separate ballot from the governor. This would remain so until the 1970 constitution.

Edward V. Ramage

Edward V. Ramage (October 2 1908 – December 1981) was a minister of the Presbyterian Church in the United States in Alabama.
Early life.
Edward Ramage was born October 2, 1908, in Weaverville, North Carolina, to Samuel Johnson Ramage (d. 1917) and Elizabeth Jane Vandiver. He was one of three children.
Education.
Edward Ramage is listed as a Doctor of Divinity. However, it is unclear whether Ramage ever obtained a degree. He bounced around colleges, first Davidson in North Carolina, next Emory near Atlanta, then back to Davidson, and returning again to Emory before he attended the conservative Columbia theological seminary in Decatur, Georgia. According to officials at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia, Ramage completed his senior year of study, but the seminary had no record of an actual degree conferred.
Ministry.
After months of struggling to make ends meet he received a job offer during September 1932 to pastor three churches, Main Street, Lindale, and Barkers, scattered over thirty miles of countryside in and around the northwest Georgia town of Rome.
From his pastorate in Georgia, Ramage moved on to lead congregations in Decatur, Alabama, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, before he received the call from First Presbyterian of Birmingham in 1946.
Ramage was a Moderator of the Alabama Synod of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. 
He was one of the eight Alabama clergymen to write and sign A Call for Unity.
During the height of the civil rights tensions in Birmingham, Alabama, pressure from segregationists within his own congregation convinced Ramage to leave his longtime pastorate and pursue a ministry elsewhere.

SECAT RG-75

__NOTOC__
The SECAT RG-75 (sometimes designated SECAT 75T) was a light utility biplane built in France shortly after World War II. It was a conventional cabin monoplane with two seats side-by-side. The wing was mounted high and was of fully cantilever design. The conventional undercarriage consisted of two fixed, divided main units plus a fixed tailskid. Power was supplied by a tractor-mounted piston engine that drove a two-bladed propeller. Construction was of wood throughout, covered in plywood.
History.
Two prototypes, registered "F-WBBX" and "F-WBBT" were tested at the CEV at Brétigny-sur-Orge in 1947 by pilots Marcel Joannès and Guy Buteau. Shortly afterwards, "F-WBBT" was displayed together with other SECAT designs at the "Semaine de l'Aviation légère" (light aviation week) held at Toussus-le-Noble from 22 April 1947 but was already somewhat outdated by the standards of the time. SECAT produced no further examples.

Michael Nobel

Michael Nobel (born 1941 in Stockholm as Michael Oleinikoff) is a member of the Nobel family, a descendant of Ludvig Nobel, a former head of the Nobel Family Society (1995–2006), a co-founder and former Chairman of the Nobel Charitable Trust, and most commonly known for his part in developing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). At present, Nobel serves on several international boards that focus on scientific, medical and charitable initiatives. He is an advocate and authority on environmental issues and alternative energy technology.
Early life.
A member of the Nobel-Oleinikoff branch of the Nobel family, Michael Nobel is the grandson of Marta Helena Nobel-Oleinikoff (née Nobel) and the great-grandson of industrialist and humanitarian Ludvig Nobel, the founder of Branobel and one of the world's richest men in his time. Ludvig was also the brother of Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite and established five prizes in the family name. His legal last name was originally Nobel-Oleinikoff, but his father Sven Nobel-Oleinikoff would eventually change their branch's legal name to simply Nobel, his mother's name (there are no male-line descendants of either of the Nobel brothers alive today). Sven Nobel-Oleinikoff was Chairman of the Nobel Family Society for several years, as was his son.
Michael Nobel has a lengthy educational background which began at Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1967, Nobel completed his studies at the Graduate Institute of Communications in Stockholm. Years later, in 1979, Nobel obtained a doctorate in psycho-pedagogy at the University of Lausanne. His thesis evaluated the effectiveness of substance abuse prevention programs in Switzerland.
Career.
Nobel is a consultant on energy issues and gives regular keynote lectures on the subject. He serves as a guest professor at the Solutions Science Research Laboratory at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, University of Japan, one of the world’s foremost institutions in its field.
Board memberships.
Nobel is a chairman or board member of twelve international companies in diagnostics, treatment and information in the field of medicine, most notably as chairman on the Board of Directors, Governors or Scientific Advisors. Nobel is also serves on several not-for-profit organizations in youth education and development as well as founder and trustee of the Nobel Charitable Trust Foundation and he chairs its sister organization NCT Asia, an organization that bestows scholarships for sustainable energy discoveries and organizes conferences and symposiums in the same field.
The Director of the Nobel Foundation, Michael Sohlman, and the elected head of the Nobel family disapproves of the institution of the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) 
Work history.
MRI.
In 1980, Nobel participated in the introduction of MRI, a field he worked in for 24 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique used in diagnostic imaging to create a detailed visual of internal structures. It provides contrast between the different soft tissues of the body making it especially useful in brain, muscles, heart, and cancer research.
Social Medicine.
Nobel has been a consultant to UNESCO in Paris and the United Nation’s Social Affairs Division in Geneva. He also worked for seven years as a researcher in social sciences at the Institute for Mass Communication at the University of Lausanne and at the Department of Social Psychiatry at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in the field of primary drug abuse prevention.
Honors and awards.
In 2007, Nobel received the International Order of Perfection, First Class in Moscow. Over the years, Nobel has received several international citations and awards for his work in the fields of medicine and conflict resolution. Dr. Michael Nobel has received an honorary doctorate from Soka University and an honorary professorship from the National Academy of Science of Azerbaijan. Michael Nobel also sits on a number of prominent international prize committees
Nobel was awarded the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Award from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 2002. It had only been given once before, to Prince El Hassan Bin Talal of Jordan. In 2004, he became the Board of Trustees Citation Recipient from the Midwest Research Institute of Kansas City and was appointed foreign member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. Nobel has also received the UNESCO medal for outstanding contributions to the cultural dialogue between nations. Two Rotary clubs, in Miami and Karlskoga, have appointed him honorary member and Rotary International has conferred on him the Paul Harris Fellowship Award.
Additionally, Nobel has received the keys to the city from not only one, but two Hollywoods — California and from Hollywood in Broward County.
Nobel was awarded the Gusi Peace Prize in 2010, an honor from the Philippines dedicated to "Excellence and distinction to individuals or groups worldwide who have distinguished themselves as brilliant exemplars of society or who contributed toward the attainment of peace and respect for human life and dignity."
Michael Nobel Energy Award.
In 2007, the Nobel Charitable Trust, founded by Michael Nobel, Gustaf Nobel, Peter Nobel, and Philip Nobel, announced their plans to establish the Michael Nobel Energy Award, to award innovations in alternative energy technology.
The plan was announced at nanoTX 07. The Nobel Foundation quickly reacted by threatening legal action for "clear misuse of the reputation and goodwill of the Nobel Prize and the associations of integrity and eminence that has been created over time and through the efforts of the Nobel Committees". Michael Sohlman, Director of the Nobel Foundation and the elected head of the Nobel family, disapproved to the institution of the so-called 'Dr. Michael Nobel Award' as well as the Nobel Charitable Trust (NCT) and Nobel Family Benevolent society.

Julius Iversen

Julius Gottlieb Iversen () (1823–1900) was a Russian phalerist (scholar of medals).
Iversen was born in Tallinn, Estonia on April 5, 1823. He studied at Tartu University from 1842 to 1846. In 1850 he received the title of Candidate of Philosophy (equivalent to a modern Western Ph.D.) and in that same year arrived in St. Petersburg. 
Iversen taught ancient languages in Anglican and Reformed Church schools from 1851 to 1885. From 1855 to 1880 he taught Greek and Latin at the Petrischule, a prominent Lutheran school which mostly served St. Petersburg's German community.
In 1879 Iversen was appointed senior keeper of the parlor of mintage at the Hermitage Museum.
Iversen's first published work was "Article on Russian Medallions" which appeared in the Petrischule Programme for 1870. His other works include:
Iversen also published a series of articles in various issues of "Archaeology", articles on medals in the "Berliner Blätter", and articles in the "Proceedings of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society" and the proceedings of archaeological congresses.

Have a Little Talk with Myself (album)

Have a Little Talk With Myself was the fifth studio album of Ray Stevens and his third and final for Monument Records; it was released in 1969. Stevens left Monument in early 1970 and signed with Andy Williams' label of Barnaby. This album is quite unique from Stevens' previous albums, as he concentrates more on interpreting the works of other composers' songs and only contributes two of his own compositions. Cover versions include Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," The First Edition's hit "But You Know I Love You," two songs from the musical "Hair", three songs of the Beatles, Blood, Sweat & Tears' hit "Spinning Wheel," and Joe South's hit "Games People Play."
The back of the album cover contains an essay by John Grissim of Rolling Stone, which describes how Stevens handles his recording sessions then praises his craft in music and finally describes Stevens' interpretations of the cover songs on the album. On the back of the album, there is also a technical note from the album's co-producer, Jim Malloy: "In addition to doing all the arrangements on this album, Ray Stevens...sings ALL the voices...plays the piano, organ, bells and any other special effect instruments...and plays the trumpet solo on 'SPINNING WHEEL.'" Two pictures are featured on the album's back cover as well - one with Stevens and Malloy laughing in the studio and another of Stevens playing the piano and singing into a microphone on the floor of the studio.
On interesting notes, Ray Stevens' version of "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" was the very first recording of the song. Although Kris Kristofferson recorded it for his 1970 album "Kristofferson", he never released his version as a single. The song became a bigger hit for Johnny Cash one year after Stevens' release of the song.
Aside from "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" (which came out a few months before the album), two singles were lifted from the album: the title track and a cover of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight."

Laminated steel blade

A laminated steel blade or piled steel is a knife, sword, or other tool blade made out of layers of differing types of steel, rather than a single homogeneous alloy. The earliest steel blades were laminated out of necessity, due to the early bloomery method of smelting iron, which made production of steel expensive and inconsistent. Laminated steel offered both a way to average out the properties of the steel, as well as a way to restrict high carbon steel to the areas that needed it most. Laminated steel blades are still produced today for specialized applications, where different requirements at different points in the blade are met by use of different alloys, forged together into a single blade.
Technique.
Piled steel developed out of the necessarily complex process of making blades that were both hard and tough from the erratic and unsuitable output from early iron smelting in bloomeries. The bloomery does not generate temperatures high enough to melt iron and steel, but instead reduces the iron oxide ore into particles of pure iron, which then weld into a mass of sponge iron, consisting of lumps of impurities in a matrix of relatively pure iron, with a carbon content of around 0.06%. The bloom must then be heated and hammered to work out the impurities, resulting in the relatively soft wrought iron.
Iron is too soft to make a good cutting edge; a good edge requires the addition of carbon to make steel. By heating thin iron rods in a carbon-rich forge, carbon could be added to the surface, making a thin layer of steel on the surface through a process called carburization (see also case hardening). From the beginning of the Iron Age, around 1200 BC, piled steel was the only way to get good steel. Obtaining the right level of carbon was an art, and was very important to the finished product. Too much carbon, or too many of the wrong trace elements, and the resulting steel becomes too hard and brittle, which can result in a catastrophic failure of a sword; too little carbon and the sword will not hold an edge. The ideal sword is one with a hard, sharp edge, and tough enough to bend, but not to shatter.
Blending a number of different pieces of iron and steel together averaged out the properties, ensuring that one bad piece would not produce a total failure of the finished product. This laminating different alloys together produces patterns that, with proper treatment, can be seen in the surface of the finished blade, and this forms the basis for pattern welding.
Other uses of laminated steel.
Since producing high carbon steel from wrought iron was very difficult, careful lamination of different alloys also served to conserve this difficult-to-make steel by using it only for the parts of the blades where it was needed. Many swords were made with the minimum possible amount of high carbon steel along the cutting edge, with the rest of the blade being made of low carbon steel or wrought iron. A thin strip of high carbon steel could be laminated between two layers of softer steel, or a core of soft steel could be wrapped in high carbon steel. The Japanese katana was often found with complex patterns of soft and hard steels; having 5 sections of differing hardness welded together to form the final blade was not uncommon. The end result would be a blade with a very high carbon edge (as much as 1.0%, equal to the highest carbon content found in low alloy steels in use today) and a softer spine. The very hard, but brittle, edge made the swords extremely sharp, while the spine gave the blade flexibility, so that it would bend rather than break.
Many laminated steel blades, particularly those of the Vikings, also used complex structures of steel to produce patterns in the surface of the steel. These patterns were made by manipulating the piles, by twisting or otherwise distorting the piles, before they were forged into the blade.
Modern use of laminate steel.
Modern laminated steel is still found in specialty knives and cutting tools, constructed of multiple alloys of steel to provide specific properties at different areas of the blade. Pattern welding is common in hand-made knives, where the primary goal is to provide a visually striking pattern in the final etched blade.

Career.
Kohira graduated from College of Art, Nihon University completing his bachelor's degree in photography in 1976. After his graduation, he flew to the United Kingdom and stayed there for about a year. During his stay there, he roamed about Europe, visiting many European countries.
Kohira came back to Japan in 1977, where he worked for various magazines as an editorial photographer. Meanwhile, he pursued his aspiration for being a photojournalist and got involved in the launch of a Japanese magazine called "Focus". He became one of the magazine’s exclusive photographers.
In 1987, Kohira moved to Los Angeles with his family, where he worked as a global photojournalist until he came back to Japan in 2009. He later became a media producer. Kohira now lives in Tokyo. He is CEO of Kohira Persons Project Co. Inc., Director of Octavia Records Inc., and Executive Director of the Gohan Society Tokyo Bureau.
Episodes.
During his stay in UK, Kohira met Malcolm McLaren in London and was asked to do a photo shoot for Sex Pistols before their debut.
At "Focus", Kohira was initially a member of the Column section. After the fire at Hotel New Japan, he moved to the News and Affairs section.
When the Japan Airlines jumbo jet crashed into Osutaka Ridge in Gunma Prefecture on August 12, 1985, Kohira was the first photographer who reached the crash site. There he discovered the crash survivors. Six years later, he published a photo book ‘4/524’ in Japan and the United States of America simultaneously.
Kohira accompanied Masayoshi Son as a photographer when Son interviewed Bill Gates on July 23, 1987.
Kohira and Paul Saffo, who was then a Roy Amara fellow at Institute for the Future, traveled together in Japan and the US, thinking about how they should tell about the tragedies caused by the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the world in the next 100 years. After this trip, Kohira published a book ‘Gembaku no Kiseki’ from the Japanese province of Shogakukan.
Kohira met Tomoyoshi Ezaki, a recording producer, in Vienna. This encounter has led Kohira to do over 200 photo shoots of classic CD jackets.
Kohira also organizes IT forums in Kokura, Kitakushu, where he was born.
Kohira did the photo shoot for the book cover of Haruki Murakami's book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running".

List of commercially available roofing material

Roofing material is the outermost layer on the roof of a building, sometimes self-supporting, but generally supported by an underlying structure. A building's roofing material provides shelter from the natural elements, and insulation against heat and cold. The outer layer of a roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material, and the nature of the supporting structure. Those types of roofing material which are commercially available range from natural products such as thatch and slate to commercially produced products such as tiles and polycarbonate sheeting. Roofing materials may be placed on top of a secondary water-resistant material called underlayment.
Commercially available roofing materials.
The weatherproofing material is the topmost or outermost layer, exposed to the weather. Many materials have been used as weatherproofing material:

Adenanthos sericeus subsp. sericeus

"Adenanthos sericeus" subsp. "sericeus", commonly known as Coastal Woollybush, is a shrub native to the south coast of Western Australia. It has bright red but small and obscure flowers, and very soft, deeply divided, hairy leaves. It is the western subspecies of "Adenanthos sericeus" (Woolly Bush), occurring mostly in the vicinity of King George Sound.
Description.
As with the species in general, this subspecies grows as an upright, spreading shrub, or occasionally a small tree. It has erect branches that are covered in short hairs when young, but these are lost with age. Flowers are bright red, and the fruit is an oval-shaped achene about 5 mm (0.2 in) long.
The leaves of this subspecies are typically over 30 mm (1.2 in) long, and divided into many laciniae: average numbers range from 11 to 35, but individual leaves may have up to 50. In this way it differs from the other subspecies, "A. sericeus" subsp. "sphalma", which has smaller leaves typically divided into around 6 laciniae, and rarely more than 12. 
Discovery and naming.
As the autonymic subspecies, the subspecies name necessarily encompasses the type specimen of the species, and is treated as having been automatically published upon publication of the species name by Jacques Labillardière in 1805. However the name did not come into use until Ernest Charles Nelson published "A. sericeus" subsp. "sphalma" in 1978. 
The placement of "A. sericeus" subsp. "sericeus" in Nelson's arrangement of "Adenanthos" may be summarised as follows:
Distribution and habitat.
"Adenanthos sericeus" subsp. "sericeus" occurs mostly around King George Sound, extending west as far as Torbay Inlet and east almost to Cape Riche; it sometimes occurs very close to the sea. It is calcifuge, occurring only in siliceous sands derived from weathered granite. Thus most populations are associated with granite monadnocks. Though its range is restricted, it is locally common and often dominant.

The Railway Club is Vancouver’s longest continually operating nightclub, occupying the same premises uninterrupted since 1931. Three distinct rooms make up the second floor space at the corner of Seymour and Dunsmuir Street. The first is an intimate room that hosts music seven nights a week. The second is a pub-style space, and the 3rd looks like it could date directly from the 30’s with lots of brass and a large wood bar.
History.
Back in the 1930s, the Railway Club used to limit its membership to the railway workers who worked at the CPR Station (now the Seabus Terminal) just down Seymour Street at the waterfront but it has since opened up to the general public.
Over the years the 'Rail' has distinguished itself with some of the most innovative music in town with tons of local bands and some big touring acts. This is where k.d. lang got her 'big break' - Spirit of the West got their start here as well. Other bands who have played the Railway include Los Lobos, The Rheostatics, The Tragically Hip, Blue Rodeo, Hard Rock Miners, Barenaked Ladies, Grapes of Wrath, Great Big Sea and thousands more. New acts as well as current favourites continue to perform every night at the Railway.

Radio Werewolf

Radio Werewolf was an eclectic musical collective active in Los Angeles, California and Europe from 1984 to 1993.
History.
Radio Werewolf was founded in Los Angeles in 1984, by Nikolas Schreck (vocals), Evil Wilhelm (percussion), James "Filth" Collord (bass) and Nathan Pino (hammond organ.) When Nathan Pino was asked to leave the band, he was replaced on the keyboard known by Radio Werewolf as the Lycanthropachord by Paul Antonelli, formerly with the band Animotion. 
Holding a series of controversial theatrical ritual events billed as "Radio Werewolf Youth Rallies" at such landmark Sunset Strip venues as The Whisky A Go Go, the Roxy, and Club Lingerie, as well as at pioneering Gothic underground clubs The Krypt, The Scream, and Zombie Zoo, the band attracted a cult following they came to identify as the "Radio Werewolf Youth Party." As such, Radio Werewolf claimed that their sound was part of a musical purist movement, designed to evoke feelings of power and harmony through the use of the "dominant frequency" which lead vocalist Nikolas Schreck described in the liner notes of the 1989 Radio Werewolf album The Fiery Summons as "sonic magic". 
Although this early Radio Werewolf formation recorded many of their signature songs on a 1987studio album which has since been widely bootlegged, the only official release of music from these sessions was "Buried Alive", on the American Gothic LP compilation released by Bomp! and Gymnastic Records in 1988. The 1988 black comedy film "Mortuary Academy" featured Radio Werewolf as themselves performing "1960 Cadillac Hearse" another song featured on their first unreleased album.
Radio Werewolf's live performances from 1984-1988 in Los Angeles sparked a heated controversy due to the nature of the song material. While Schreck and the rest of the band would later refer to their work as mainly a theatrical performance designed to emulate specific aspects of history or culture, songs like "Pogo the Clown" (about serial killer John Wayne Gacy), "The Night" (about a lovesick vampire), and "Incubus" (about a girl being visited by an Incubus), were pointed to by critics as condoning necrophilia and literal vampirism.
Adding to the controversy of the band was a number of references to National Socialism. The biggest was the song "Triumph of the Will" which was about an elderly former Nazi reminiscing about Nazi Germany. The very title of the song comes from a Nazi propaganda film, and when performing this song on stage, Nikolas would be dressed in an SS uniform. Radio Werewolf's own name is a reference to Werwolf's "Radio Werewolf" propaganda station. The band also had a song called "Strength through Joy," which was a Nazi slogan and recreational program. And their cover of "These Boots Were Made for Walking" features an army march in the background, as well as Zeena singing a few lines in German.
Schreck and Wilhelm also filmed an interview at the August 8, 1988 rally where they had a Nazi flag hanging next to them. The person interviewing them said the Satanic rally seemed similar to what was happening in Germany during the 1930's, to which Schreck and Wilhelm agreed.
In the late 1980s, Radio Werewolf was heavily featured on talk shows and in media material, billed as heading a worldwide Satanic movement. Interviewed variously by investigative journalist Geraldo Rivera, Tom Metzger, Wally George, Christian pastor Bob Larson, and others, the media infamy associated with this phase of the group culminated, on August 8, 1988, with a Satanically themed rally in San Francisco at the Strand Theater held with NON. This event marked the first Radio Werewolf collaboration with Zeena Schreck, who appeared in her capacity as High Priestess of the Church of Satan.
This performance, along with a Radio Werewolf interview featured on the highly-rated Geraldo Rivera's "Exposing Satan's Underground" TV special broadcast on Halloween of 1988, was additionally controversial due to the perception of the band by some quarters of the music press as supporting Neonazi ideologies. Though this was denied by the band, Evil Wilhelm quit Radio Werewolf shortly after the 8-8-88 Rally, later stating that he felt their music was being misunderstood by Nazi groups.
Schreck continued Radio Werewolf as a solo project with the release of the 1989 album "The Fiery Summons", released by Gymnastic Records of Germany. The release of this album and several mainstream magazine interviews with Schreck in the German press increased Radio Werewolf's cult following in Germany. 
In 1989, Nikolas Schreck released a documentary about Charles Manson entitled Charles Manson Superstar under Radio Werewolf's sister label "Video Werewolf." Billed as the only fair interview ever conducted with Manson, the video featured photographs and footage of Spahn Ranch along with interviews of people connected in some way with Manson or movements he has been associated with. Schreck indicated in the documentary that Manson was mostly a misunderstood and misused figure, advocated as evil and archetypal of everything negative through a large scale fabrication by the media. Musical support and Narration also provided by fellow Radio Werewolf member and co-Producer Zeena Schreck.
Zeena Schreck's compositions, performance, and graphic design on Radio Werewolf's 1989 ambient ritual music EP "The Lightning and the Sun" marked her official entry as Radio Werewolf's Co-Director. She also served as Co-Director with Nikolas Schreck, of the Werewolf Order, a magical and ecological initiatory circle which evolved from the earlier Radio Werewolf Youth Party. The subsequent Radio Werewolf recordings,
"Songs for the End of the World", "Bring Me the Head of Geraldo Rivera", "Witchcraft-Boots: A Tribute to the Sin-Atras", and "Love Conquers All" increasingly covered magical and mythological themes related to the couple's use of sound as a magical tool. From 1990-1993, Radio Werewolf toured only in Europe, and were based in Vienna, Austria, where percussionist Christophe D. and viola player Vladimir Rosinski joined the group. 
Radio Werewolf's last performance open to the general public was held at Zurich, Switzerland's historic Kaufleute Hall on December 30, 1991 and was billed as "The Zurich Experiment". A Video Werewolf release of the same name was released in 1992. Zeena and Nikolas Schreck continued to operate the Werewolf Order until 1999, but ended the Radio Werewolf aspect of this activity in 1993. 
In 2012, Radio Werewolf's "The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions" was released by World Operations. The compact disc, the first official Radio Werewolf release since 1992, compiles newly remastered re-releases of 12 ambient sonic magic tracks from Zeena and Nikolas Schreck's rare Radio Werewolf vinyl recordings between 1989-1992 as well as 2 bonus tracks never previously released to the public.
Media & Press for "The Vinyl Solution".
In conjunction with the new release of "The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions", Zeena, Radio Werewolf`s former co-director, composer, performer, graphic designer/art director and She-Wolf from 1988-1993 will grant a very limited number of interviews for its release.
In December 2012, Zeena Schreck was invited to speak for a Nightwatch Radio Interview. Among other topics, the interview was promoting the 2012 Radio Werewolf release of "The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts: Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions" CD, the first authorized Radio Werewolf release in 20 years,

Ralph Michaels

Ralph Joseph Michaels (May 3, 1902 in Etna, Pennsylvania, USA – August 5, 1988 in Monroeville, Pennsylvania) was an infielder who played for the Chicago Cubs from 1924 to 1926. He also played in the minor leagues in 1922 and 1923 and from 1926 to 1937.
Michaels made his major league debut on April 16, 1924. In eight games with the Cubs that season, he hit .364 with two RBI. In 1923, he played in 22 games for the Cubs, collecting 14 hits in 50 at-bats for a .280 batting average. He appeared in two games in 1926, though he did not have an at-bat - though he still managed to score a run. He played his final game on April 30 of that year, finishing his career with a .295 batting average in 32 games. 
As a minor leaguer, Michaels hit .276 with 1,134 hits in 4,110 at-bats. Not a power hitter, he hit only 15 home runs in his career, along with 160 doubles and 41 triples. Perhaps his best season offensively was his very first - in 1922 with the Cedar Rapids Bunnies, Michaels hit .301 with 30 doubles in 129 games. He did not impress in the field that season however, as he committed 53 errprs.
He also managed the Waterloo Hawks for part of the 1936 season.
Following his death, he was interred at St. Mary Church Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Bootstrap error-adjusted single-sample technique

In statistics, the bootstrap error-adjusted single-sample technique (BEST or the BEAST) is a non-parametric method that is intended to allow an assessment to be made of the validity of a single sample. It is based on estimating a probability distribution representing what can be expected from valid samples. This is done use a statistical method called bootstrapping, applied to previous samples that are known to be valid.
Methodology.
BEST provides advantages over other methods such as the Mahalanobis metric, because it does not assume that for all spectral groups have equal covariances or that each group is drawn for a normally distributed population. A quantitative approach involves BEST along with a nonparametric cluster analysis algorithm. Multidimensional standard deviations (MDSs) between clusters and spectral data points are calculated, where BEST considers each frequency to be taken from a separate dimension.
BEST is based on a population, P, relative to some hyperspace, R, that represents the universe of possible samples. P* is the realized values of P based on a calibration set, T. T is used to find all possible variation in P. P* is bound by parameters C and B. C is the expectation value of P, written E(P), and B is a bootstrapping distribution called the Monte Carlo approximation. The standard deviation can be found using this technique. The values of B projected into hyperspace give rise to X. The hyperline from C to X gives rise to the skew adjusted standard deviation which is calculated in both directions of the hyperline.
Application.
BEST is used in detection of sample tampering in pharmaceutical products. Valid (unaltered) samples are defined as those that fall inside the cluster of training-set points when the BEST is trained with unaltered product samples. False (tampered) samples are those that fall outside of the same cluster.
Methods such as ICP-AES require capsules to be emptied for analysis. A nondestructive method is valuable. A method such as NIRA can be coupled to the BEST method in the following ways.

Isaac Nettles Gravestones

The Isaac Nettles Gravestones are three unusual headstones in the Mount Nebo Baptist Church Cemetery near Carlton in rural Clarke County, Alabama. Surveyed for the National Register of Historic Places' Clarke County Multiple Property Submission, they were added to the Register on February 24, 2000. 
Mount Nebo Baptist Church, a traditionally African American Baptist church, was established in the 19th century. The three Nettles markers are made of concrete and feature death masks, presumed by scholars to be of the people whose graves they mark. They are attributed to Isaac "Ike" Nettles, a local man who created them between 1933 and 1946. When surveyed in 2000 the markers had not weathered well, with only the most ornate one, with three individual masks on one marker, in good condition.

Jacopo da Leona

Jacopo da Leona, also spelt Iacopo (died 1277) was a medieval Italian jurist and poet. 
Beginning his career as a notary, he became a nobleman's secretary and later a judge. Sixty of his sonnets survive.
Life and work.
Born as Jacopo del Tancredo in the village of Levane, Arezzo, he took his surname from the Castle of Leona ("Castello di Leona"), on which his village was dependent. Here Jacopo began to follow the profession of notary, under the patronage of the family of Ubertini of Arezzo, and one of the Ubertini, Ranieri, employed him as a secretary. Jacopo went with his master to Volterra, and in 1273, when Ranieri was elected as a bishop, Jacopo was appointed as a judge.
Of Jacopo's poetry, a songbook of sixty sonnets survives, of which the Vatican Library's manuscript Codex 3793 ("Canzoniere Vaticano latino 3793") contains seven. Jacopo's sonnets are divided broadly into love poetry and satire, of which the former is original but somewhat mannered, adopting the style and themes of courtly love. All of the sonnets belong to the years before 1277. His best known work, which takes the form of a dialogue, is entitled "Madonna, di voi piango e mi lamento" ("Lady, I lament me of you").

History.
The revenue cutter "Virginia" was a schooner built in 1797 for the United States Revenue Cutter Service at Portsmouth, Virginia. At the outset of the Quasi-War in 1798, the only ships available to the Navy were the 10 ships of the Revenue Cutter Service, the largest of which was the newly built "Virginia". She was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 25 June, Capt. Francis Bright in command.
In August 1798, "Virginia" received orders to join the frigate off the eastern seaboard of the United States for operations against suspected French warships and merchant ships. She remained on this station until December, when she was assigned identical duty in the West Indies between St. Kitts and Puerto Rico as part of the squadron commanded by Commodore Thomas Truxtun. In addition to cruising with the Navy squadrons, "Virginia" guarded convoys and relayed messages between fleets. While on duty in the Caribbean, "Virginia", assisted by and , captured the armed French schooner "Louis" and her cargo on 26 April 1799.
Despite this success, in June 1799, "Virginia" was declared unfit for further naval service and returned to the Revenue Cutter Service. She was refitted and commissioned in the Revenue Cutter service in 1802. She was sold in 1807.

Mark Mercury

Mark Mercury is an American composer. He has arranged, produced, recorded, and composed music since the 1970s.
Career.
Mark Mercury is an American composer whose music falls into several genres: space, electronic, electro-acoustic, ambient, cinematic, and contemporary classical/serious music. Using orchestral timbres and futuristic electronic sounds, Mark creates soundscapes, albums, and scores for modern dance, ballet, film, video, and high-tech planetariums.
In 1988 Mercury began creating planetarium soundtracks and by 2011 had scored 38 shows. His first album, “Music of the Domes” (1992), contained excerpts from his planetarium soundtracks. Staying in the space music vein, Mercury created all new recordings for his second album, “The Art of Space” (1997), which featured five space poems written by professional poets, recited by actors, and underscored with music. His third album, "Music from Cycles of Spheres" (2002), consisted of three suites drawn from his planetarium scores. The music is part of the touring art exhibition "Cycles of Spheres: Mapping the Planets in Silk and Sound," featuring the silk batiks of artist Mary Edna Fraser.
In recent years Mercury has worked to a large extent on composing music for modern dance and ballet. His music can be heard in such works as Francisco Martinez Dancetheatre’s “Orbital Dances” and The Ballet Collective’s “Spaces Between” and “Dawn to Dusk.”
In his early school years Mercury studied classical piano, jazz, blues, and arranging. He began his professional music career in the late 1970s in Hollywood working as a songwriter, studio musician, record arranger and producer. In 1979 and 1981 he co-founded two music production companies, Bullets and California Star Music, through which he and his partners wrote songs, produced records, and composed and produced the music for animated series, animated features, television programs, videos, and commercials. 
Mercury’s musical output prior to 1988 was in a variety of styles, tailored to the currents in the music and entertainment industries. With his entrance into the world of planetarium scores, Mercury’s musical style became more focused and began its evolution into what it is today.

Zengwen Dam, formerly spelled Zengwun Dam or Tsengwen Dam, () is a major earthen dam in southern Taiwan on the Zengwun River. It is one of the largest dams in the country and forms the largest reservoir in Taiwan. The dam serves to regulate flows of irrigation and municipal water to the southern plains of the country and supports a 50 MW hydroelectric power station.
The first proposals for the dam were made as early as 1939, but due to the intervention of World War II, construction did not begin until October 31, 1967. The first step in its construction, was the building an of earthen diversion dam that sent the flow of the Zengwun River through a pair of tunnels on the south side of the dam site. As the dam was hydraulically filled, construction started on the spillway to its north side. The power plant was completed just before the reservoir began storing water on October 31, 1973, exactly six years after groundbreaking.

Juneau-Douglas Bridge

The Juneau-Douglas Bridge (formally the Douglas Bridge; also colloquially the J. D. Bridge or simply the bridge) is located in Juneau, Alaska. Spanning the Gastineau Channel, it connects Juneau's eastern, mainland side with the city's communities on Douglas Island to the west. The current span is the second bridge of the same name; the original, built in 1935, was demolished in 1981 following the completion of its replacement in 1980. 
The bridge is the only roadway link to the communities on Douglas Island: Douglas, North Douglas and West Juneau, the latter of which is situated at the bridge's western terminus. Egan Drive, Juneau's principal arterial highway, and the bridge are connected at the intersection of Egan and 10th Street, one of the busiest intersections in Southeast Alaska. The current bridge provides a two lane road which accommodates vehicular and pedestrian traffic, as well as a bike path.
History.
Though strong currents occur at times under the bridge, prior to construction of the original bridge, residents of Douglas Island would row across the channel to reach the mainland.
The 1935 bridge, of cantilever steel truss design, underwent construction from both sides of the channel.
The Civil Works Administration and the Public Works Administration provided grants and loans to assist with construction costs. Its opening was celebrated on October 13, 1935. In 1975, construction began on a new girder bridge and it was completed in 1980. The following year, the old bridge was demolished. For a time, the two bridges stood side by side.
A 2006 Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities project included some bridge joint and pavement improvements, as well as a recommendation to add a reversible center lane. Seeking a solution to relieve traffic on the existing bridge, the CBJ has identified a need for a North Douglas Crossing of the channel as a top transportation priority for Juneau.
Structure.
The deck of the newer bridge was constructed using prestressed concrete. It measures in width, and has a span of .
Waterway.
At zero tide, the Juneau-Douglas Bridge is above the waterline. A spring Dolly Varden fishery is situated directly beneath the bridge. The bridge forms a "no wake zone" on its north side.

The Gangster

The Gangster (aka Low Company) is a 1947 American crime film noir directed by Gordon Wiles. The drama features Barry Sullivan, Belita, Joan Lorring and Akim Tamiroff. The screenplay was written by Daniel Fuchs, based on his novel "Low Company" (1937).
Plot.
Shubunka is a racketeer, at odds with Cornell, a rival. Shubunka has a girlfriend, Nancy Starr, a showgirl, and owns a New York beachfront cafe that Nick Jammey operates for him.
A regular customer, Karty, has gambling debts and has stolen money from his brothers. He begs Shubunka for help but is refused. Dorothy, the cafe's cashier, quits her job, disappointed in Shubunka's concern for no one but himself.
Cornell wants to take over the rackets. Jammey gives him inside information on Shubunka's organization. After a couple of Cornell's men beat up Shubunka on a picnic, Shubunka angrily accuses Nancy of having him set up. Karty has disappeared, meantime, but when his frantic wife appeals to Shubunka for help, he again infuriates Dorothy by saying no.
Karty gets into a fight with Jammey at the cafe and accidentally kills him with a skillet. Cornell mistakenly believes Shubunka to be responsible and goes after him. This time Nancy does betray Shubunka, having been bribed with a Broadway stage offer by Cornell.
Shubunka runs to Dorothy for help, but she declines, calling it just desserts for his unwillingness to help anyone else. With nowhere to hide, Shubunka is killed by Cornell in the street, just before the police arrive to place Cornell under arrest.
Reception.
Critical response.
Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, "A Poverty Row crime melodrama that has its moments of traditional crime, but moves along not in the traditional way of tracing the rise and fall of its protagonist. Instead the film noir is more concerned with establishing a forlorn mood and being artistically stylish, as director Gordon Wiles (won an Oscar as art director for the 1931 "Transatlantic") creates a theatrical piece that is unnecessarily stagelike and much too pretentious for the modest storyline. It is adapted by screenwriter Daniel Fuchs from his book "Low Company", and much of its too arty nature is attributed by rumor to the uncredited role Dalton Trumbo played in the screenplay."
"TV Guide" gave the film a positive review, writing, ""The Gangster" is an offbeat entry in the film noir genre, one that places the accent on the psychological. Though at times muddled, the script strives to maintain a deeper approach than such films as "The Public Enemy" or "Al Capone". In its day this film was considered something of an artistic triumph..."
Noir analysis.
Film historian Blake Lucas, discussed the film noir aspects of the film, writing, ..."The Gangster" is arty and affected, as director Gordon Wiles has gravitated toward the creation of a theatrical rather than a visual impression. A film - and the most visually exciting of film noir bear this out - can show discernment and restraint when there are pretentious aspects implicit in the material."

Victoria Clock Tower

The Victoria Clock Tower, also known as the Diamond Jubilee Clock Tower, is a heritage-registered clock tower located in Christchurch, New Zealand. Designed by Benjamin Mountfort, it is registered as a "Historic Place – Category I" by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
History.
Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings.
Mountfort designed the clock tower in ca 1858, to be placed on top of the first (wooden) section of the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings. The iron tower and clock was constructed in Coventry and arrived in December 1860 in 147 boxes, but it was determined that the building structure would be unable to support the tower's weight. The clock was then placed in the stone tower of the Provincial Council Buildings in Armagh Street, and whilst its face could not be seen, the chime could be heard for a distance of 2 miles. The clock was not in good repair, impacted by the sea journey, and it remained in the tower for a short time only. The iron tower, meanwhile, stood for several years in the courtyard of the Provincial Council Buildings.
With the abolition of Provincial Government in New Zealand in 1876, the clock tower became the property of the Crown, but it was transferred to Christchurch City Council.
High / Manchester intersection.
After being stored for 30 years in a council yard in Worcester Street, it was decided that the tower would be used as part of a monument to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. A competition for a stone tower was held and won by the local architecture firm of Strouts and Ballantyne. The clock was returned to the United Kingdom for renovation, and the addition of chimes. In 1897 it was erected on a stone base at the intersection of Manchester Street, Lichfield Streets and High Streets and remained there until 1930 when it was removed due to it being deemed a traffic hazard and impediment. The Hamilton Borough Council unsuccessfully tried to buy the clock tower at this point.
Montreal / Victoria intersection.
It was relocated that year to its current location on a reserve at the intersection of Victoria and Montreal Streets and the clock was replaced.
Restoration work was carried out in 1930 as part of the relocation. Further restoration was carried out as a community project, financed by local businesses, in 1978. More substantial renovation was carried out in 2003–2004, including earthquake strengthening. The middle section of the tower was braced with steel, and rods were inserted into the stonework. The renovation budget was NZ$295,000.
Heritage listing.
On 2 April 1985, the clock tower was registered as a Category I heritage item, with the registration number being 3670. The tower is significant, as it is a landmark in Christchurch, and it was part of Mountfort's original design for the Provincial Council Buildings. The tower is further a remarkable example of High Victorian ironwork, and its use as a monument to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee are an indication of the colonial ties between New Zealand and Britain.
Earthquake damage.
The clock tower was seriously damaged in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with the time (12:51) stopped on the clock's face. Repairs in excess of NZ$700,000 were agreed to by Christchurch City Councillors in July 2012, with most of the cost to be reimbursed by insurance. Stones in the buttress columns and arches are loose or dislodged, and the finial spike needs to be repaired. The clock itself needs to be restored, but it is considered to leave one of the clock faces at 12:51 as a reminder of the earthquake.

Democratic National Union Movement

The Democratic National Union Movement (DNUM) is a Cambodian political party founded after senior Khmer Rouge official Ieng Sary's defection from the Cambodian National Unity Party in August 1996. A magazine entitled "Phka Rik" (Flower in Bloom) is associated with it. It was created primarily to facilitate Ieng Sary's reentry into civilian political life, claiming neutrality and that he had broken away from the Khmer Rouge and from the "fascism and cruelty of Pol Pot's regime," naming Nuon Chea, Ta Mok, Son Sen and Yun Yat as Pol Pot's cohorts and "mass murderers of Cambodia." He stated that he was a supporter of "limited democracy," and named Thailand, Singapore and Japan as examples.
Despite building up ties with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP), the DNUM declined to participate in the 1998 elections. The Movement's support for the CPP-dominated government at the time allowed it considerable autonomy over Pailin, an ex-Khmer Rouge stronghold notable for gem and timber exports.

Ray Stevens...Unreal!!!

Ray Stevens...Unreal!!! was the seventh studio album of Ray Stevens and his second for Barnaby Records, released in 1970. Two singles ("America, Communicate With Me" and "Sunset Strip") were lifted from the album and were moderately successful on the Hot 100 pop singles chart. Each single reached the Top-20 on the Billboard Adult-Contemporary chart, indicating that Stevens' appeal, even as early as 1970, lay with the adult music buyers rather than the kids and teenagers. The tenth track was written by Ray's brother, John Ragsdale. For those who didn't already know, Ray's birth name is Harold Ray Ragsdale. When he became a recording artist in the late 1950s, he started going by the name of Ray Stevens. His stage name is derived from his own middle name, Ray, and his mother's maiden name of Stevens.
On May 17, 2005, Collectables Records re-released this album and Stevens' previous album "Everything Is Beautiful" together on one CD.

Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency (Traditional Chinese: 蔡厝港集選區; Simplified Chinese: 蔡厝港集选区) is a five-member Group Representation Constituency located in the western area of Singapore. 
The constituency covers the areas of Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang (formerly Chua Chu Kang SMC), Upper Bukit Timah, Jurong West and Lim Chu Kang. 
Chua Chu Kang GRC was formerly called Hong Kah GRC, from 1988 to 2011, before the 2011 General Elections. Thus, since it was just a change of name, it would mean that all of its wards are from the former Hong Kah GRC, with the exception of Hong Kah North ward that had been crafted out to become Hong Kah North SMC after the 2011 elections.
It is divided into five wards namely, Bukit Gombak, Chua Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Nanyang and Yew Tee. In 2001, Bukit Gombak SMC was absorbed into the former Hong Kah GRC with the town council being Hong Kah Town Council.
In 2011, Chua Chu Kang was absorbed into the Hong Kah GRC and probably because of that, the Hong Kah GRC was renamed to 'Chua Chu Kang GRC'. Prior to the 2011 elections, Chua Chu Kang was one of the oldest surviving constituencies in Singapore and the only one to have both remained intact and existed before Singapore's independence, existed since 1959 when Singapore gained full self-governance from its colonial British Government.

2011–12 Montreal Canadiens season

The 2011–12 Montreal Canadiens season was the team's 103rd season in franchise history and their 95th season in the National Hockey League since the league was established on November 22, 1917. Finishing in last place in their respective division and conference, the Canadiens did not qualify for the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Off-season.
Heading into the off-season, Canadiens GM Pierre Gauthier had certain issues to address. There were several unrestricted free agents on the team that included, most notably Jeff Halpern, Roman Hamrlik, Alex Auld, Brent Sopel, Hal Gill, James Wisniewski, Mathieu Darche and Andrei Markov.
The team managed to re-sign Gill, Darche and Markov. On the other hand, no contracts were offered to Halpern, Auld and Sopel, thus allowing them to leave the team. Roman Hamrlik rejected the Canadiens's one-year offer and instead accepted a two-year contract with the Washington Capitals. James Wisniewski let it be known that he would be testing the free agent market (where a bidding war for his services would ensue). On June 29, his negotiating rights were traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets.
On the restricted free agent side, qualifying offers were made to Andrei Kostitsyn, Max Pacioretty, David Desharnais, Yannick Weber, Ryan White and Josh Gorges, all were eventually re-signed. No qualifying offers were made to forwards Dustin Boyd, Tom Pyatt, Benoit Pouliot and defenceman Alexandre Picard, thus allowing them to become unrestricted free agents.
On the first day of free agency on July 1, Pierre Gauthier addressed two needs, a big body forward and a reliable back-up goaltender. They were successful in signing forward Erik Cole from the Carolina Hurricanes to a four-year contract worth $18 million. The need for a capable back-up goaltender to help out Carey Price was also fulfilled when they signed free agent Peter Budaj from the Colorado Avalanche to a two-year contract worth $2.3 million.
Another notable transaction during the off-season is the signing of rugged Russian defenceman Alexei Yemelin to a one-year, two-way contract for the 2011–12 season. Yemelin, drafted by the team in the third round with the 84th overall pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, was under the Canadiens radar for quite some time. He finally agreed to make the jump to North America when a clause was inserted in his contract, stating that he would be able to return to the Kontinental Hockey League in Russia should he be unable to crack the Canadiens roster. Yemelin is often compared to fellow Russian and former NHL defenceman Darius Kasparaitis, who was known for his aggressive physical playing style.
Assistant coach Kirk Muller, who was part of the Canadiens coaching staff since 2006, confirmed rumours that he was actively seeking a head coaching position in the NHL and would be leaving the team. On June 27, 2011, following his inability to find a head coaching position in the NHL, the Nashville Predators announced that Muller had been hired as the head coach of their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. He would later fulfill his dream when on November 28, 2011, Muller became coach of the Carolina Hurricanes, taking over for Paul Maurice.
Following Muller's departure, general manager Pierre Gauthier announced the appointment of Randy Cunneyworth and Randy Ladouceur as assistant coaches. Cunneyworth and Ladouceur were coach and assistant coach respectfully for the Canadiens's AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs during the previous season. The addition of Ladouceur also provides the team the first former defenceman as an assistant coach since the 2005-06 NHL season.
Season Timeline.
October
The Canadiens started with the team's worst start since 1941. Prior to their first game of the season, defenceman Andrei Markov was placed on the injured reserved list. The Canadiens started the season with a 2–0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Air Canada Centre. During the game, newly acquired defenceman Chris Campoli suffered a hamstring injury and was sidelined indefinitely.
The team's first win of the season was a 5–1 decision against the Winnipeg Jets at the MTS Centre, which was the Jets' first game in the newly relocated franchise's history.
The Canadiens played their home opener on October 13 in a 4–1 loss to the Calgary Flames. This coincided with Lars Eller's first game of the season following off-season shoulder surgery. That same day, the team announced that forward Ryan White had surgery for a sports hernia and would be sidelined indefinitely.
On October 23, the team traded longtime prospect Brock Trotter and their 7th round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft to the Phoenix Coyotes for forward Petteri Nokelainen and defenceman Garrett Stafford.
The team would go on to a six-game losing streak and five-game losing streak at home until defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 5 – 1 on October 26, 2011 at the Bell Centre. Prior to the game, the Canadiens relieved assistant coach Perry Pearn of his duties, offering him (but he declined) another position in the organization. Pearn was replaced behind the bench by Randy Ladouceur, who until then was situated in the press box during game time.
Molson Cup player of the month: Carey Price.
November
On November 10 the Canadiens beat the Phoenix Coyotes 3–2 in overtime to continue their winning streak in Phoenix. The Coyotes have not beaten the Canadiens at home ice since December 9, 1998, when they won 4–2.
Carey Price recorded back-to-back shutouts for the first time of his career in duplicate 4–0 wins against the Carolina Hurricanes on November 16 and the New York Rangers on November 19.
Max Pacioretty was suspended by NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan for three games following a questionable hit on Pittsburgh Penguins defencemen Kristopher Letang on November 26 at the Bell Centre. Letang suffered a broken nose but still managed to finish the game. No penalty had been called on the hit.
The month also saw the NHL debuts of defenceman Frederic St. Denis on November 16 in a 4–0 win against the Carolina Hurricanes and Louis Leblanc on November 30 in a 4–1 loss to the Ahaheim Ducks.
Molson Cup player of the month: Carey Price.
December
In an effort to bolster their power play, which was ranked 29th out of 30 teams in the league, Pierre Gauthier acquired defenceman Tomas Kaberle from the Carolina Hurricanes on December 9 in exchange for defenceman Jaroslav Spacek. In his first game with the Canadiens, Kaberle registered two assists, including one on the power play, in a 2–1 road win against the New Jersey Devils.
Chris Campoli returned to action on December 13 against the New York Islanders. He was sidelined with a lower body injury suffered during the team's season opener against the Toronto Maple Leafs back on October 6.
Feeling that the team was under performing with its 13–12–7 losing record, Pierre Gauthier fired head coach Jacques Martin on December 17. Assistant Coach Randy Cunneyworth was named interim head coach. Cunneyworth became the first unilingual English speaking active head coach of the Canadiens since Bob Berry, who was head coach from 1981–84. Assistant General Manager Larry Carriere was named assistant coach in a questionable move, as Carriere has never coached hockey in any level whatsoever. Cunneyworth's first game as the interim head coach resulted in a 5–3 loss against the New Jersey Devils at the Bell Centre on December 17.
Under interim coach Cunneyworth, the team embarked on a five game losing skid until finally winning their first game under their new coach in a convincing 6–2 win against the Senators in Ottawa on December 27. Despite this win, the team dropped their next two games and closed off the month losing 7 of their last 8 games.
Molson Cup player of the month: Carey Price.
January
Lars Eller started off the new year in style on January 4 by scoring four goals (three in the 3rd period alone) to help his team pounce the Winnipeg Jets 7–3 at the Bell Centre. Eller becomes the first Canadiens player to score 4 goals in one game since Jan Bulis did so against the Philadelphia Flyers back on January 26, 2006.
On January 12 goaltender Carey Price was invited to the 2012 NHL All Star game which was played on January 29 in Ottawa. He was accompagnied by teammate Raphael Diaz, who participated in the rookie skills competition held on January 28.
One day after Michael Cammalleri made disparaging remarks about the current status of the Montreal Canadiens, the Habs decided to part ways with the veteran forward. On Thursday January 12, Cammalleri was pulled out of a game against the Boston Bruins to find out that he'd been traded to the Calgary Flames along with goaltender Karri Ramo and a fifth round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft. Montreal received forwards Rene Bourque, Patrick Holland, and a second round pick in the 2013 NHL Draft. Bourque is a salary cap hit of $3.3 million until the 2015–16 season. This is Cammalleri's second tenure with the Flames, where he scored 39 goals during the 2008–09 season.
Molson Cup player of the month: Max Pacioretty.
February
Max Pacioretty scored the first hat trick of his career in a 4–2 win against the New York Islanders on February 9.
After being sidelined since the beginning of the season with a sports hernia, Ryan White finally made his season debut on February 15 against the Boston Bruins at the Bell Centre.
With their playoff hopes dying with each passing day, Pierre Gauthier became a seller. On February 17, Montreal sent defenceman Hal Gill and a conditional 2013 fifth-round draft pick to the Nashville Predators for a 2012 second-round pick, prospect Robert Slaney as well as Blake Geoffrion, who is the grandson of former Habs great Bernard Geoffrion and great-grandson of Canadiens legend Howie Morenz.
During the trade deadline on February 27, the Canadiens reacquired their 5th round conditional pick in the Hall Gill trade, as well as the Predators's 2nd round pick in 2013 for forward Andrei Kostitsyn. They also claimed via re-entry waivers enforcer Brad Staubitz from the Minnesota Wild. Despite rumors to the contrary, Travis Moen and Chris Campoli, who will both become unresticted free agents at the end of season, were not moved.
The Canadiens finished the month losing 7 of their last 8 including, including a 5-game losing streak.
Molson Cup player of the month: Carey Price.
March and April
Max Pacioretty became the first American born player in Canadiens history to reach the 30 goal mark during a 5–4 victory on March 8 against the Edmonton Oilers.
March 10 saw the return of defenceman Andrei Markov in the line up. He registered an assist in the Canadiens 4–1 win against the Vancouver Canucks. Markov, who had been sidelined with a torn ACL, played his first game since November 13, 2010, missing almost 16 months of action.
Erik Cole scored a natural hat trick just 5:41 after the opening faceoff on March 24 when the Habs defeated the Ottawa Senators 5-1. Cole in turn becomes the second American born player in Canadiens history to reach the 30 goal plateau. This is also a team record for the fastest natural hat trick to start a game by any Canadiens player. Cole finished the season with a record high 35 goals for an American born player.
The Canadiens were officially eliminated from playoff contention, on their 76th game of the season, following a 4-1 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on March 24.
On March 29, team owner Geoff Molson officially relieved GM Pierre Gauthier of his duties as general manager . Bob Gainey was also let go of his duties as special advisor to the GM. Mr. Molson further announced that former Habs GM Serge Savard would be acting as special advisor to find the next general manager.
April 1 saw the NHL debut of Gabriel Dumont in a winning cause against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Philip R. Goodwin

Philip R. Goodwin (September 16, 1881 – December 14, 1935) was an American painter and illustrator who specialized in depictions of wildlife, the outdoors, fishing, hunting and the Old American West. He provided illustrations for numerous books and magazines, as well as for commercial items, such as posters, advertisements and calendars. He is perhaps best known for illustrating Jack London's "The Call of the Wild" and for providing the cover art for many issues of Outdoor Recreation / Outdoor Life Magazine during the 1920s and early 1930s. He is also the artist who designed the Horse & Rider Trademark of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Goodwin was a very private person and did not seek publicity, so not much was known about his private life during his lifetime. Most of what is known comes from letters held at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center.
Early life.
Goodwin was born in Norwich, Connecticut in 1881. At age 11, he sold his first illustrated story to Collier's Magazine. Goodwin studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design, the Art Students League in New York City, and the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now Drexel University) in Philadelphia under the well known Howard Pyle. He later followed Pyle when he opened his own Howard Pyle School of Illustration Art. N.C. Wyeth, Thornton Oakley and Frank Schoonover were contemporaries of Goodwin who also studied under Pyle at that time.
Early career.
Goodwin illustrated Jack London's "The Call of the Wild" in 1903 at the age of 22. He later illustrated Theodore Roosevelt's "African Game Trails". Goodwin opened a studio in 1904 in New York City, and became well known for his illustrations in numerous magazines and commercial items, such as posters, calendars, and catalogs. Some of the magazines in which his work appeared include: Collier's Weekly, Outdoor Life, Outers' Recreation, Scribner's Magazine, The Popular Magazine, and McClure's Magazine. He also did several covers for The Saturday Evening Post.
Mid-Career.
Goodwin became good friends with Charles Russell, staying with him at Russell's Lazy KY Ranch and his Bull Head Lodge, and also traveling with him on painting, hunting and fishing expeditions. On these expeditions, Russell and Goodwin influenced each other's painting techniques. Goodwin was also friends with Carl Rungius, an avid outdoorsman who taught Goodwin the finer points of hunting and surviving in the wilderness. Goodwin also met and became friends with Theodore Roosevelt, Will Rogers, and Ernest Seton Thompson. Goodwin's calendars were published by Brown and Bigelow, the nation’s largest calendar publisher and he received substantial commissions for illustrating advertisements for the Horton Manufacturing Company (Maker of Steel fishing rods), Winchester Repeating Arms Company and Marlin Firearms Company
Late career.
Goodwin ran into bad luck during the Great Depression when his savings bank failed. His work was primarily commission-based and his primary activities during that time were gun ads and calendar art, which were barely sufficient to maintain his studio.
Style.
Goodwin's style is epitomized by "The Surprise", currently in the collection of the National Museum of Wildlife Art. The museum describes the painting: 
""... a photographer is coming upon a mother bear and her two cubs. The painting exemplifies Goodwin's open color palette, use of distance and atmosphere, and sense of humor. He painted many wildlife, hunting, fishing, and western scenes, often composed from behind the subject's shoulder.""
Collections.
Goodwin is well represented in many private collections and museums featuring western and outdoor themes, including the American Museum of Natural History, the Brandywine River Museum, the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, the Charles M. Russell Museum, the Glenbow Museum, the Cowboy Hall of Fame, the National Museum of Wildlife Art, and the Gilcrease Museum.
Books.
The primary biography on Goodwin's life and art is "Philip R. Goodwin: Americas Sporting & Wildlife Artist"

2011–12 Toronto Maple Leafs season

The 2011–12 Toronto Maple Leafs season was the 95th season for the National Hockey League franchise that was established on November 22, 1917. The team failed to make the playoffs for the 7th straight season.
Off-season.
At the 2011 NHL Draft, Brian Burke fulfilled his pledge to trade up in the First Round, trading the 30th (Rickard Rakell) and 39th (John Gibson) Picks to Anaheim in exchange for the 22nd Pick, which was used to select Tyler Biggs. The Leafs also selected Stuart Percy with 25th Pick.
The Leafs made two key Free Agent additions, adding centers Tim Connolly from Buffalo and Philippe Dupuis from Colorado. The Leafs also added to their blue line by trading Brett Lebda and prospect Robert Slaney to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Cody Franson and center Matthew Lombardi.
The Leafs suffered no major losses during the off-season, however Tim Brent, who had an impressive season with the Leafs was signed by the Carolina Hurricanes and veteran goalie Jean-Sébastien Giguère was acquired by the Colorado Avalanche. Other Leafs to go included Danny Richmond (Washington), Christian Hanson, (Washington) and Fabian Brunnström (Detroit).
On October 4, the Leafs traded their 4th Round Pick at the 2012 Draft to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for centre Dave Steckel.
Prior to the beginning of the regular season, the Leafs unveiled new Alternate Jerseys, similar to the ones they used when they last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.
Pre-season.
They went 4–4 in preseason.
Regular season.
The Leafs got off to a fast start, winning their first three games and seven of their first ten, finishing October in first place in the Northeast Division, second in the Conference. Phil Kessel was the NHL's leading points scorer with 18, and leading goal scorer with 10. James Reimer was the starting goaltender for the first five games, but was injured in his next start when Montreal's Brian Gionta struck Reimer in the jaw while fighting for the puck. Early in the season, the Leafs power play has dramatically improved, with a 21.6% conversion rate, good for third in the league as of December 17, 2011. However, when short-handed, they had been less efficient with a 73.0% kill rate, the worst in the NHL.
On February 9, 2012, the NHL announced that the Leafs would play the Detroit Red Wings at Michigan Stadium for the 2013 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2013. It would later be postponed to 2014 due to the lockout.
With the Leafs falling out of the playoff race and in the midst of losing 10 of their last 11 games, including a six-game losing streak, head coach Ron Wilson was fired and replaced by Randy Carlyle on March 2, 2012. The Leafs went 6–9–3 under Carlyle to end the season.
Playoffs.
The Maple Leafs attempted to finally qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since the 2003–04 NHL season. "The Hockey News" predicted that the Leafs will place tenth and miss the playoffs. The Maple Leafs have since been eliminated from playoff contention.
Transactions.
The Maple Leafs have been involved in the following transactions during the 2011–12 season.

God Forgives, I Don't

"God Forgives, I Don't" is the fifth studio album by American rapper Rick Ross, released on July 30, 2012, by Mercury Records and Island Def Jam. It was produced by several record producers, including Cool & Dre, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Pharrell, Jake One, and Rico Love, among others.
Upon its release, "God Forgives, I Don't" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its opulent production style and Ross' performance. It debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 218,000 copies in its first week, and charted in several other countries. By October 2012, the album had been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and had sold 588,000 copies in the United States. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, presented at the 2013 Grammy Awards.
Background and development.
Rick Ross revealed the title of the album on January 4, 2011 during an interview with the Breakfast Club, along with the first promotional single "Made Men" featuring Drake. A music video for "Made Men" was later released on April 11, 2011. In July 2011, DJ Khaled spoke about the album, saying: ""God Forgives, I Don't" is a classic-in-the-making. Let me tell you something right now: This album is so crazy from the beginning of what I've been in the studio hearing already," he said. "I can't give you too much because I'm going to let him do that, because that's his project, but I could tell you right now it's classic and he is talking that talk." In September 2011, Drake spoke on the album during an interview with "MTV" saying: "That "God Forgives I Don't"; the only way I can describe it, it's like Snoop Dogg's "Doggystyle", The Notorious B.I.G.'s "Ready to Die", or Clipse's "Lord Willin"' or any of the albums that I collected and held on to as a kid — whether it was cassette or CD." Rick Ross revealed that he wanted to collaborate with Lionel Richie on the album. Rick Ross spoke about the album during an interview with "MTV" on October 11, 2011, at the BET Hip Hop Awards saying: "Me making my album is just a real tedious process that I go through and the response from the people that I did play a few records for, the feedback is incredible" and he also spoke on his collaboration with Mary J. Blige. "That's the Queen. I can just tell you about the experience," he said. "We actually worked in Michael Jackson's L.A. studio and we made some magic." Mary J. Blige also spoke of the experience with "XXL" in September 2011, clarifying that the two actually recorded in the last studio that Michael Jackson ever recorded in. "It's a private studio that one of our friends, he was really close to Michael Jackson, he let us use it," Mary said. "It's actually Marvin Gaye's studio. It has murals of Michael Jackson all over the walls and Marvin Gaye. That was the last place Michael actually worked at before he passed. It's such a good vibe." In an October 2011, interview with hip-hop magazine "XXL", Bun B confirmed that he would appear on "God Forgives, I Don't", but did not make the final cut of the album. In October 2011, the first video log of the making of "God Forgives, I Don't" was released, and featured The Alchemist, in a studio session released by Rick Ross.
On October 4, 2011, Ross appeared on the radio station Hot 97; during an interview with Funkmaster Flex, he premiered two promotional singles for "God Forgives, I Don't", titled "You the Boss" and "I Love My Bitches". Ross would later announce neither song would make the album. Funkmaster Flex interviewed Ross on topics such as his beef with Kreayshawn and Young Jeezy, along with details of the album, however Ross declined to divulge information on the album, preferring to keep details of the project under wraps. Two days later on October 6, 2011, Ross appeared on the Breakfast Club to promote the album. Ross maintained his tight-lipped approach of not divulging details of "God Forgives, I Don't". Later on October 6, 2011, Rick Ross along with Def Jam Records held the official "GFID Conference Call", to discuss the album and have Ross answer questions. When callers of the music industry asked questions on producers and features of the album, Ross declined to answer, stating that recording "God Forgives, I Don't" was still in process and did not wish to disclose too many details of the album, preferring to open up about the album as the release date nears. Ross emphasized that less features would be on the album, as opposed to previous releases, as well as creating the album with a "90s Vintage hip-hop sound". In January 2012, Ross spoke about working with Dr. Dre, saying that Dre "highly influenced" his work. Ross confirmed that he and Dre collaborated on records for "God Forgives, I Don't" as well as Dr. Dre's long-delayed album "Detox".
In April 2012, while on his European Tour, Ross explained the reasoning for the album title, saying: "I wanted to approach album like Scorsese would have approached a film. I wanted it to be a bold statement, a dark statement and have music to tell the story behind it. It felt like a film." During his July promo tour, Ross elaborated, "I knew approaching this album, I wanted to approach titling it a lot different from previous albums. I wanted it to be strong and impactful. The first half is "God Forgives": It's a lot of us need forgiveness. That's the beautiful side that alotta people need to focus on, even myself. "I Don't" represented the street aspect of life. I feel we have both sides that we deal with in life. I gave 'em one of those feelings that it was a motion picture, a masterpiece, five-star. That's the way I broke it down. They gon' hear the energy and see exactly what I'm talkin 'bout 'cause we gotta face both sides in life." Ross also confirmed Jay-Z as a featured artist.
After much anticipation and an initial push back, Ross announced that the album would be released on July 31, 2012, at an MMG Press Conference on May 2, 2012. He also announced that no previously released singles, or material from his "Rich Forever" mixtape would be on the album, saying the album would be "100% new". Ross stated that the album would be his most complete and best body of work yet. At the press conference, Ross spoke a bit on the album, saying: ""God Forgives, I Don't" is a very dark story. It's extremely lyrical, the music is next level. I'm expecting nothing but the biggest results. The collaborations will surprise you guys. This album is the missing part of my legacy. This is gonna put me over the top." Ross ended the press conference stating, "I will deliver". On June 12, 2012, Ross released the official album artwork in a video promoting the album. On June 30, the official deluxe cover was released via Rap-Up.
In a July 2012 interview with MTV News, Ross previewed his the album. Ross spoke on the title, the cover, the recording process, the cinematic influence, and a few tracks. Ross stated that several photos were shot inside a church. He elaborated saying, "I remember sitting in the church just waiting for the photographer, and I remember sitting in there praying, just being thankful. I knew I wanted to have 10 Jesus pieces on. Of course, one Jesus piece was always fly, but I just wanted 10. I just wanted to go to that next level." Ross stated that he kept an extremely small circle during the entire recording process. "I keep my circle extremely small when it comes to me recording my music. I put the music together before I even put the words to the music, because I feel it's easier for me to write the words and make it fit the music versus me finding music that can fit my words." Ross has stated numerous times how he has compared this album to films, and has taken a cinematic approach during the entire development of the album. Ross expanded by saying "This may be "Inglourious Basterds", man. We gonna peel your scalp back on this one. Quentin Tarantino, that's one of the vibes I was in when I titled the album. I wanted to approach it like a film." Ross also spoke on the concepts of a few tracks from the album. Ross said the track "Amsterdam" was based on the red light district, "I kinda flipped it where being a boss you gotta get approval for a green light. I'm one of those people you can't green light. As long I've been in this game, there's been a lot of talk, but ain't nobody stepped on these 11 and a half's. The reason being: This is the red light district, you can't move on this side." Rozay had spoken about the track "Diced Pineapples" as well, saying that "When I got out of the hospital — you know, I had a seizure last year — when I was leaving, the doctor told me, 'You gotta eat some more fruit, drink you some water, eat fruit and just relax for a little while.' My fruit of choice was pineapples. For the next three weeks, I woke up every morning and ate diced pineapples, and I put the concept together. Drizzy came in, as well as Wale, and it's kinda like, 'She could be my diced pineapple. This special lady, she could be what I wake up to every morning and help me get by every day." Rick Ross described the album in five words with: classic, untouchable, boss, success, and revenge. He stated, "If you doubted us being here three years ago, five years ago, you don't understand hip-hop, you don't understand the power of rap music."
In a July 2012, interview with the Breakfast Club, Ross was asked about his collaboration with André 3000 for the song "Sixteen". He stated that he had spoken with André 3000 through Skype numerous times, while Andre had been filming overseas for the Jimi Hendrix biopic, "All Is By My Side", and the record was completed over Skype. Ross elaborated that he wanted to make a special track that had an "Outkast-ish vibe", and hinted at an upcoming video for the song. Ross also spoke to "Vibe" about working with Dr. Dre saying, "I got to be in the studio with him and watch him turn those knobs which has been a dream of mine since "Straight Out Of Compton" and I just wanted to ask him. When I'm listening to those "Chronic" skits, that was the end of skits like "The Chronic" or a Snoop album."
Songs.
The first track, "Pray for Us", is an excerpt from the movie "Baby Boy", in which the actors Omar Gooding and Tyrese Gibson pray for forgiveness for the sins they will commit in the future: the excerpt ends with the sound of gunfire. "Pirates" features a backing track consisting of pianos and "bombastic drum hits", with Ross reflecting on the success he has achieved, the hardships he suffered in his early life and the artists who have inspired him, including the late The Notorious B.I.G.. "3 Kings", a collaboration with fellow rappers Dr. Dre and Jay-Z, was felt to be the album's intended centerpiece by many music critics, due to the high-profile nature of the artists involved. Backed by a "dusty-and-soulful" provided by producer Jake One, whose production typically contains "analog warmth", the song is a "rags-to-riches" story in which Dre and Ross discuss their life before fame: Dre observes how he "started out mopping floors, but now he's front row at the awards". Jay-Z, meanwhile, discusses major events in his life since he became a celebrity, including a $150 million deal with concert-promotion company Live Nation, and the birth of his daughter, Blue Ivy Carter. "Ashamed" is a "plush luxury rap", as described by Jayson Greene of Pitchfork Media, in which Ross observes and attempts to justify the lives of drug dealers, and he also recalls difficulties his mother encountered due to her low-paying career. The track's instrumentation is built around a sample of the Wilson Pickett song "Shameless".
"Maybach Music IV", the album's fifth track, is the fourth song of a series which began on Ross' second album, "Trilla" (2008), and has since featured artists such Kanye West, T.I. and Erykah Badu. Unlike the previous entries in the series, the song contains only a single guest, singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, who performs the song's chorus. Production group J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, who have worked with Ross many times in the past, created the song's production; it contains "spiraling" electric guitars and synth sounds, and bears similarities to the previous entry of the series, "Maybach Music III", particularly in the elements of jazz fusion both songs incorporate. L.A. Reid, the chief executive of Def Jam, also makes an uncredited appearance on the song. Ross supposedly "laughs in the face of death", according to Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk, with the lyric "get a blowjob, have a seizure on the Lear", which is a reference to the two near-fatal seizures Ross suffered in 2011. Beringer cited the song as an example of Ross balancing the reflection and more indulgent themes he frequently employs on the album to give "stellar tracks", going on to call "Maybach Music IV" and the following song "Sixteen" a "stunning one-two punch" of such balance execution. "Sixteen", the longest song on the album at eight minutes and sixteen seconds, is also produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League. The elegant, "smooth as silk" backing track also contains influences of jazz, as well as cymbal downbeats, saxophone sounds, string instruments and a guitar solo, performed by fellow rapper André 3000, who also provides vocals on the song. The backing track bears stylistic similarities to André 3000's own single "Prototype" (2004). The song's title alludes to the idea, discussed by both Ross and André 3000 in their lyrics, that a traditional sixteen bar verse is not long enough to get across the ideas they wish to.

On December 24, 2010, Ross released a mixtape titled "Ashes to Ashes" in promotion of the album which included the song "9 Piece" featuring T.I.. Following T.I.'s legal trouble, Ross scrapped T.I. from the song and instead released the official remix, featuring Lil Wayne which was released on April 4, 2011, which was used as the first street single for the album. "9 Piece" was released to iTunes on May 10, and debuted at number 61 on the "Billboard Hot 100". On October 4, 2011, Rick Ross released the album's first two singles. The lead single was "You the Boss" featuring Nicki Minaj, and the second was titled "I Love My Bitches", which was produced by Just Blaze. Three days later on October 7, both tracks were released on iTunes for purchase. In early October 2011, Ross published the first promotional picture of "God Forgives, I Don't" on his Tumblr page, which showed a release date of December 13, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Rick Ross and Wale appeared on BET's "106 & Park" to help promote Wale's new album, "Ambition", which was released under Ross' Maybach Music imprint. Ross also promoted his own LP, "God Forgives, I Don't". It was Ross' first television appearance since his reported seizures on October 14, 2011. Ross announced that he, and Jay-Z had completed a collaboration track for the album, which Rick called "the biggest record we've ever done together".
On November 16, 2011, Ross appeared on MTV's Rap Fix to promote Wale's "Ambition" album as well as to give details on his own album. Rick Ross said that the December 13 date was still tentative, but the album was likely to be pushed back to a 2012 release because of the health scare he suffered in October. Ross expanded by saying that because he was resting due to doctors orders, he was unable to work and had to postpone the groundwork of his album, which he felt was highly important. Consequently, Def Jam Records and Ross' own Maybach Music Group label had scaled back promotion of the album. Ross added that he felt he could make the December 13 date he had originally set, but felt it was in his best interest to push the album back to 2012 in order to create the best possible body of work. On January 6, 2012, Rick Ross released the mixtape "Rich Forever" to help promote the album. The tape contained all new material and features from the likes of Diddy, 2 Chainz, Wale, Meek Mill, John Legend, Nas, Drake and French Montana among others. Two standout tracks from the mixtape, "Triple Beam Dreams" featuring Nas and "Rich Forever" featuring John Legend would later be remastered and included as bonus tracks on the deluxe version of the album.
On July 16, 2012 Ross along with Maybach Music Group, began the GFID Promo Tour, appearing on radio shows and doing interviews to promote the album. The promo tour traveled to Virginia, Delaware, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, Toledo, and New York. On August 2, 2012, the music video was released for "911". On August 14, 2012, the music video was released for "Amsterdam". On September 10, 2012, the music video was released for "Presidential" featuring Elijah Blake. On October 9, 2012, the music video was released for "Diced Pineapples" featuring Drake and Wale. On December 7, 2012, the music video was released for "Ten Jesus Pieces" featuring Stalley. On January 20, 2013, the music video was released for "Pirates". On March 4, 2013, the music video was released for "Ashamed". On April 22, 2013, the music video was released for "Ice Cold" featuring Omarion.
Singles.
On May 15, 2012, the first single from the album, "Touch'N You" featuring Usher was released. In May 2012, Rico Love, who produced and wrote the hook of the song, spoke with "XXL" to discuss the making of the record. He stated the track had been completed relatively quickly. While Ross was recording new material for "God Forgives, I Don't", American record producer and songwriter Rico Love played several productions to Spiff TV, the Artists and repertoire manager for Maybach Music Group, Ross' record label, with the intention of playing Ross a production that the late rapper The Notorious B.I.G. would have recorded were he still alive. On the advice of Spiff TV and fellow rapper Mase, who also listened to the productions, Love played the production that would eventually be used for "Touch'N You" to Ross, who decided upon hearing it that it would be used for "God Forgives, I Don't"s first single. The song was distributed to digital retailers by Def Jam Recordings on May 22, 2012. On June 19, 2012, the music video was released for "Touch'N You" featuring Usher. Rico Love described the record as "Basically the record is an ode to women. A sexy song, an 'I been thinking about you all day' type song. A man telling a woman how bad he wants to touch her, feel her, be intimate with her. Ross puts it in a way, even the street dudes who don’t feel comfortable expressing themselves, feel comfortable with that. It’s a club banger and a radio smash. I’m excited for Ross because I feel it has the potential to be a radio banger.
On May 21, 2012, Funkmaster Flex premiered the second single, "So Sophisticated" featuring Meek Mill. On June 24, 2012, the music video was released for "So Sophisticated" featuring Meek Mill. The third single "Hold Me Back" was released on July 2, 2012. On July 25, 2012, the music video was released for "Hold Me Back". In July 2012, Ross spoke on the concept of "Hold Me Back" with MTV News, saying "That's the struggle, the angle I wanted to take on that record once again from somebody who may not have much, but that don't determine where you end up in the game. From struggle to triumph, as long as you stay loyal with your clique and your family, you can overcome whatever. That's how I feel." It was ranked number 32 in "Complex"'s 50 Best Songs of 2012 list. On July 19, 2012, Funkmaster Flex premiered one of the more anticipated tracks of the album, "3 Kings" featuring rap icons Dr. Dre and Jay-Z. In an interview with DJ Semtex, Ross stated that The D.O.C. had introduced him to Dr. Dre, who then flew to Miami to work with Ross. They had created several records, one of which was "3 Kings". Ross had already completed a track with Jay-Z for the album, but decided he wanted Jay-Z on a track with Dre to have three kings on one record, hence the title "3 Kings". A music video was supposed to be filmed by Andre 3000 for his track with Ross "Sixteen" but Andre later revealed he no longer had the time to make it so it wouldn't be released.
Reception.
Critical response.
"God Forgives, I Don't" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 24 reviews. Allmusic's David Jeffries dubbed it Ross' third "lavish triumph in a row" and stated, "All of it works, there's plenty of ambition with little overreaching, and the most striking bits of the album are striking for unexpected reasons." Kyle Anderson of "Entertainment Weekly" found the album's "size and scope ... undeniable" and cited it as "the first album that really feels like it was made by a boss." Jaeki Cho of "XXL" commented that Ross' "façade" of "hubris and delusion" make the music "irresistibly entertaining." BBC Music's Mike Diver asserted that the album "represents a game-changer" and found its "big-budget rap" tracks to be "point to further success".
Mikael Wood of the "Los Angeles Times" called the album "commanding" and "complicated", and wrote that "he's succeeded by becoming too big to fail." Rick Florino of Artistdirect praised the album as "gritty", "guttural", and "cinematic", and found Ross to be "on par with Nas and Biggie Smalls." Jonah Weiner of "Rolling Stone" complimented Ross' "unburdening rap from the tyranny of realness" and commented that "there are times when "God Forgives" is as engrossing and surprising as rap can be." Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo commended Ross for surprisingly "continuing to find new ways to describe his largesse", and characterized the album as "silly, completely gauche, and still pretty impressive ... massive exercise in excess." Consequence of Sound's Mike Madden commented that the album 
"adds fascinating realism and reflection to Ross’ usual over-the-top gusto."
In a mixed review, Louise Brailey of "NME" found the album's tone too "serious" and wrote that "only '911' continues the gilded legacy of "Teflon Don"". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" criticized that "Ross goes for grand gestures that don't serve him well" and called it "his least tonally consistent album, both in music and in content. An aimlessness and lethargy seeps into too many of these songs". Evan Rytlewski of "The A.V. Club" felt that Ross "comes across as a softened version of his usually unrestrained character" and that the album "rarely shocks or excites." Jordan Sargent of "The Village Voice" called the album an "inarguable misstep" and commented that it "indulges [Ross'] worst tendencies, in the process rewinding time back an era when Ross was merely a big presence with bigger guests and even bigger beats." Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene observed some "higher-profile misfires" and commented that the album "feels depressingly earthbound" in comparison to his previous albums.
Commercial performance.
"God Forgives, I Don't" debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200, selling 218,000 copies in its first week. It is Ross' fourth number-one album in the US. The album was Ross' first album to chart in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number eight on the UK Albums Chart. On September 12, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 500,000 copies in the US. As of November 2013, the album has sold 565,000 copies in the United States.

Derek Keating

Derek Keating (born May 1955) is an Irish Fine Gael politician. He was elected as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Mid–West constituency at the 2011 general election.
Born and raised in Ballyfermot, Keating spent his early married life in Palmerstown, before moving to Lucan, where he has lived for the past 25 years. A former FÁS Community Employment Scheme supervisor at St Mary's Parish Centre, Lucan, Keating was a member of Fianna Fáil during the 1980s but later joined the Progressive Democrats. He was a director of elections for Progressive Democrats candidate Tom Morrissey in the Castleknock local electoral area at the 1991 local elections. In 1998, following the constituency boundary revision which created the new constituency of Dublin Mid–West, he left that party, and in 1999 stood as an independent candidate to South Dublin County Council for the Lucan electoral area. He was elected with just four votes over outgoing Fine Gael incumbent Peter Brady. Keating was comfortably re-elected in 2004, attracting one of the highest votes in the country.
He stood as an independent candidate for Dublin Mid–West at the 2007 general election but was not elected. He joined Fine Gael in 2008, and was re-elected as a Fine Gael candidate at the 2009 local elections. He was involved in controversy after taunting the Garda Representative Association's general secretary by issuing the statement: "Mr PJ Stone should put on a uniform and go and do real work and stop rabble-rousing."
During Budget debates in December 2012 Keating hit out at what he saw as a "Culture of Dependence" in Ireland, saying: “increased dependency on the State encourages a new lifestyle of welfare economy ... a woman will have a lone parent allowance, children’s allowance, rent subsidy, school grants, a medical card, fuel allowance and special payments from the community welfare officer which come under section 13 of the Social Welfare Act for exceptional payments”.
Later in December 2012 Keating returned €7,571 to the Government of expenses following a sample audit of expenses.
In May 2013, Keating was accused by a school principal in Lucan of falsely claiming credit for getting an extension to the school. His parliamentary aide, Tommy Morris, was then investigated by the Garda Síochána for taking c.3,000 copies of the Lucan Gazette (which carried the article) from local shops and dumping them. Keating said Morris acted without his knowledge or consent. Fine Gael also condemned the action.
In July 2013 a protest held outside his home by a pro-life group led to him leaving as he felt threatened by their behaviour. The protestors had shouted at him to open the door and banged on his front door and windows. He called Gardaí and provided names of people he had recognised. Gardaí said that they had been called but that no arrests were made.

Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977

The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 enacted a number of reforms to the Federal Reserve, making it more accountable for its actions on monetary and fiscal policy and tasking it with the goal to "promote maximum employment, production, and price stability". The act explicitly established price stability as a national policy goal for the first time. It also required quarterly reports to Congress "concerning the ranges of monetary and credit aggregrates for the upcoming 12 months." It also modified the selection of the Class B and C Reserve Bank Directors. Discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin was prohibited, and the composition of the directors was required to represent interests of "agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers". The Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, made no mention of services, labor, and consumers. Finally, the act established Senate confirmation of chairmen and vice chairmen of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Reform Act made the Federal Reserve more transparent to Congressional oversight.
Historical Context and Objectives.
Much of the text of the Federal Reserve Reform Act pertains to Congress leveraging its oversight power over the Federal Reserve to make it disclose its monetary objectives. Since Congressional Resolution 133 was passed in 1975, the Federal Open Market Committee had announced the long-term monetary aggregates of M1, M2, and M3. This policy was codified in the Federal Reserve Reform Act. Congress enacted this policy under the belief that the actions of the Federal Reserve directly impacted the business climate, and it wanted to keep track of the Federal Reserve's attempts to alter it. Leaders at the Federal Reserve who objected were not necessarily motivated by a desire for secrecy. Rather, they felt that disclosing the Fed's views made their plans more difficult to realize in the future, because markets would respond to the Fed's plans and alter the Fed's projections. In other words, certain market actors would use the Fed's disclosures to engage in profitable investments, which would alter market outcomes and neutralize the Federal Reserve's actions. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve argued that this benefit would accrue to a few individuals, which would not be in the public interest. This was the reason that the Fed regularly overshot targets for money growth until the Volcker years.
The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 was passed in short succession with a number of other bills regulating the Federal Reserve. Namely: 
Outline of the Reform Act.
The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 is composed of three titles:

Barbara Browning

Barbara Browning (born December 7, 1961 in Madison, Wisconsin) is an American academic, award winning novelist, dancer, and cultural critic.
Browning received her B.A. in comparative literature from Yale University in 1983, spent a year in Brazil on a Fulbright fellowship, where she studied dance, and then returned to Yale to complete her Ph.D. in 1989. She taught for six years in the English Department of Princeton University, where she was awarded the President's Distinguished Teaching Award, and since then has taught in the Department of Performance Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, serving for a time as Chair.
Her first book, "Samba: Resistance in Motion" (1995), was an ethnographic account of her experiences studying and performing Brazilian dance. It was the 1996 recipient of the de la Torre Bueno Prize for an outstanding publication in the field of dance scholarship. Her second academic book was "Infectious Rhythm: Metaphors of Contagion and the Spread of African Culture" (1998). Browning began writing fiction in 2004, producing an audionovel in 2007 ("Who Is Mr. Waxman?"). Her novel "The Correspondence Artist" was published in 2011 by Two Dollar Radio. Her second novel, "I'm Trying to Reach You", was published by Two Dollar Radio in June 2012. It is a multimedia project linked to a series of "chamber choreographies" which she has published on YouTube.
Readers of Browning's academic writing have noted that in addition to representing "a pioneering effort in bringing discussions about the popular culture of Brazil into the North American academy," it evidences "the imagination of a novelist." By the same token, her novels take up such apparently academic concerns as the work of anthropologists Claude Lévi-Strauss and Mary Douglas, the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan, and the correspondence of Simone de Beauvoir and Nelson Algren, as well as incorporating photography and referencing video art, leading one reviewer to characterize her work as "part memoir, part fiction, part epistolary, part metadata-existentialist philosophy, part art installation."

Willem P.C. Stemmer

Willem P. C. "Pim" Stemmer was a Dutch scientist and entrepreneur who has invented numerous biotechnologies that have led to successful products and business ventures. He was the founder and CEO of Amunix Inc., a company that creates "pharmaceutical proteins with extended dosing frequency". His other prominent inventions include DNA shuffling, now referred to as molecular breeding. He holds more than 97 patents.
Stemmer died of cancer on April 2, 2013.
Education.
Stemmer attended the Institut Montana-Zug, a boarding and day school in Zugerberg, Switzerland, in the greater Zurich area, from which he graduated in 1975. He developed an interest in biology at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, from which he received a doctorate in biology in 1980.
It was not until 1980, however, when he traveled to University of Wisconsin-Madison that he was introduced to molecular biology. He received a PhD from the University of Wisconsin for his work on bacterial pili and fimbriae involved in host-pathogen interactions. Afterwards, he conducted postdoctoral research with Professor Fred Blattner on phage display of random peptide libraries and antibody fragment expression in "E. coli" bacteria.
Career.
Stemmer founded Avidia after inventing its Avimer technology. In 1997 he founded Maxygen to commercialize the DNA shuffling, now called molecular breeding, which led to the founding of both Verdia and Codexis. Prior to Maxygen, he was a scientist at Affymax, where he invented DNA shuffling. Before that, he worked on antibody fragment engineering at Hybritech.
His current venture, Amunix, is based in Mountain View, California. Its products comprise a "clinically proven pharmaceutical payload, typically a , genetically fused to ‘XTEN’, a long, unstructured, hydrophilic protein chain", which prolongs serum half-life by "increasing the hydrodynamic radius, thus reducing kidney filtration".
Awards and recognition.
In 2011 Stemmer was honored with the Charles Stark Draper Prize, the United States' top engineering honor, for the pioneering contributions to directed evolution, a "method used to engineer novel enzymes and biocatalytic processes" for various pharmaceutical and chemical products, allowing researchers to endow proteins and cells with properties that ultimately enable solutions food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, toxicology, agricultural products, and biofuels.
His portfolio of patents from Maxygen was ranked as the #1 portfolio in pharma/biotech for 2003 by MIT's "Technology Review", and #2 in a review of the 150 largest pharma and biotechnology companies by "The Wall Street Journal" in 2006. He received the Doisy Award in 2000 and the David Perlman Award in 2001. In 2005 he won the NASDAQ-sponsored VCynic Syndicate, a "syndicate of venture capitalists" that rated business case studies based on historical, current, and mock companies.

7 Day Sunday

7 Day Sunday "(7 Day Saturday in 2013)" was a British comedy radio talk show hosted by Al Murray on BBC Radio 5 Live. Broadcast weekly on Sunday mornings, the show took an irreverent look at the topical news stories of the past seven days. Originally presented by Chris Addison: he was joined by regular guests Sarah Millican and Andy Zaltzman, and a fourth special guest each episode. It premièred in January 2010 to mixed reviews. It returned for a second series in September 2010. Al Murray served as host for the last five episodes of the second series, joined by regular guests Rebecca Front and Joe Wilkinson. The show returned for a third series in January 2012 with Al Murray hosting alongside Andy Zaltzman and Rebecca Front as the regular guests. A fourth series followed from September 2012, with series 5 due to start at 11am on 11 May 2014.
History.
"7 Day Sunday" was announced as a new show on 11 December 2009, to be hosted by Addison and broadcast for an hour in the 11 am to 12 noon slot. The guests for the opening episode were to be Zaltzman, Millican, and a special guest. It was to replace another comedy show "The Christian O'Connell Solution", hosted by Christian O'Connell with Bob Mills. The new show was to begin on 10 January 2010, as part of the wider re-organisation of 5 Live's schedule which had already begun to be announced in October 2009, the largest since controller Adrian Van Klaveren joined the station in April 2008.
The show is produced for 5 Live by Avalon Television. It was initially commissioned for a 20 week run. This first series duly ran from 10 January 2010 until 6 June 2010. After three months it resumed for a second series on 5 September 2010 until 3 April 2011. The third series began 8 January 2012.
In press interviews during March 2010 while promoting his upcoming stand-up tour, Addison explained that doing a radio show was a childhood ambition, and that as a "current affairs junkie", hosting "7 Day Sunday" was ideal, more relaxed than television and good fun, with the weekly deadline being a good motivation.
Format.
When the show was announced, it was cast as a topical news series aiming to "pull apart the week's big news stories and see what makes them tick", with Addison describing it as "four relatively ill-informed idiots fail to take the news seriously for an hour".
Hosts and Regulars.
The following people have hosted the show during its run:
As well as the host there are usually two other regulars plus a guest. For series 1 and 2 regulars were Andy Zaltzman and Sarah Millican. For series 3 Rebecca Front replaced Sarah Millican.
Broadcasts.
The show aired on Sundays from 11:00 to noon. It once aired at 21:00 on 31 January 2010. The series occasionally missed a week for sporting events (Formula 1 Grand Prix, London Marathon, "etc.").
Series One featured 20 episodes which were broadcast between 10 January 2010 and 6 June 2010. There were no episodes broadcast on 7 February 2010, 25 April 2010.
Series Two consisted of 26 episodes, broadcast between 5 September 2010 and 3 April 2011. There were no episode broadcast on 19 September 2010, 3 October 2010, 26 December 2010, 2 January 2010 and 30 January 2010.
Series Three had 15 episodes which were broadcast between 8 January 2012 and 6 May 2012. No episode was broadcast on 25 March 2012.
Series Four also had 15 episodes, began on 9 September 2012, and ended on 16 December.
In 2013, the show returned for a new, slightly different series: it was moved to Saturdays, renamed 7 Day Saturday, had 11 episodes between 8 June and 24 August, kept Al Murray as host, and featured Andy Zaltzman and two guests each programme. There was also a Christmas special, 7 Days of Christmas, broadcast on 24 December 2013.
The show will be retuening to Sundays in 2014, with the first episode on 11 May.
The show was made available on the BBC's iPlayer service and as a podcast, which features additional material.
Reception.
After the first show, Jane Thynne of "The Independent" questioned the lack of variety, covering as it did mainly the heavy snowfall with little political content, which given Addison had made his name in a political satire, she found odd. She ultimately reserved judgement on the show, calling Addison witty but recommending he slow down the pace and stop his "nervous giggling".
Chris Campling of "The Times" criticised the first episode as being a duplicate of the "dismal, desperate" "The Christian O'Connell Solution" it replaced, with a turgid format. Persevering, he described the second episode as just as dreary with no chemistry and "none of the "News Quiz"-esque scoring of laughter points, where clever people fall over each other in their desperation to be funnier than the last."
After the third episode, Elisabeth Mahoney of "The Guardian" said the show was "really quite funny" but the listener needed to stay focussed on the content as the four way dialogue was quite involved as it covered a comprehensive sweep of topics. For listeners who might want to multi-task on a Sunday morning, she recommended Dave Gorman's show on Absolute Radio.

USS SC-19

USS "SC-19", until July 1920 known as USS "Submarine Chaser No. 19" or USS "S.C. 19", was an "SC-1"-class submarine chaser built for the United States Navy during World War I. 
"SC-19" was a wooden-hulled 110-foot (34 m) submarine chaser built at the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York. She was commissioned on 19 October 1917 as USS "Submarine Chaser No. 19", abbreviated at the time as USS "S.C. 19".
"S.C. 19" was assigned to the Second Naval District Experimental Unit at New London, Connecticut.
When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920, "Submarine Chaser No. 19" was classified as SC-19 and her name was shortened to USS "SC-19".
On 24 June 1921, the Navy sold "SC-19" to Joseph G. Hitner of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Weil–Petersson metric

In mathematics, the Weil–Petersson metric is a Kähler metric on the Teichmüller space "T""g","n" of genus "g" Riemann surfaces with "n" marked points. It was introduced by using the Petersson inner product on forms on a Riemann surface (introduced by Hans Petersson).
Definition.
If a point of Teichmüller space is represented by a Riemann surface "R", then the cotangent space at that point can be identified with the space of quadratic differentials at "R". Since the Riemann surface has a natural hyperbolic metric, at least if it has negative Euler characteristic, one can define a Hermitian inner product on the space of quadratic differentials by integrating over the Riemann surface. This induces a Hermitian inner product on the tangent space to each point of Teichmüller space, and hence a Riemannian metric.
Generalizations.
The Weil–Petersson metric can be defined in a similar way for some moduli spaces of higher-dimensional varieties.

Peter Szatmari (geologist)

Peter Szatmari is a geologist born in Budapest, Hungary, where he graduated in geology at the Eötvös Loránd University. He obtained his PhD from the University of Edinburgh on salt (evaporites) and performed post-doctoral research at Princeton University. He also worked at the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, during the early days of plate tectonics theory.
Since 1973 Szatmari has worked in Brazil, initially as a consultant to Petrobras. He has taught courses and led work teams that have made important discoveries of deposits of potassium salts and oil in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Amazonas basins. Since 1980, he has been a member of the research staff of the Research Center of Petrobras, CENPES, in Rio de Janeiro. In addition to coordinating various study groups, he has taught courses in structural geology, tectonics, and tectonic geology of salt (evaporites).
Szatmari has published over 200 works, including articles in scientific journals, monographs and technical reports, and jointly edited the book "Salt - Geology and Tectonics". One of Szatmari's most important contributions is on the formation of oil via catalytic reactions of the Fischer-Tropsch type, as serpentization of mantle's peridotites. He also performed studies on the distribution of metals present in petroleum, comparing them with the mantle rocks, chondrites, crust, and seawater.
His recent research work, with others at Petrobras and its private partners (British Gas BG, Repsol of Spain and GALP of Portugal), on the oil deposites deep beneath the salt layer in the Santos Basin (the continental crust extending about 700 kilometers offshore in the region of the São Paulo) has been mentioned in the Brazilian national press.
In 2009, he was the "honorary president", of the VI International Symposium on Tectonics.
In 2012 received the Prize Gold Medal “José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva” from Brazilian Geological Society in honour to geoscientists who have contributed to the development and advancement of geological knowledge by research and scientific leadership.

List of roof shapes

Roof shapes differ greatly from region to region. The main factors which influence the shape of roofs are the climate and the materials available for roof structure and the outer covering. Roof terminology is also not rigidly defined. Usages vary slightly from region to region, or from one builder or architect to another.
Roof shapes vary from almost flat to steeply pitched. They can be arched or domed; a single flat sheet or a complex arrangement of slopes, gables and hips; or truncated (terraced, cut) to minimize the overall height.

Motordrome (Melbourne)

The Motordrome, also known as the Olympic Park Speedway, the Melbourne Speedway or the Victorian Speedway, was a former speedway and Australian rules football ground located on the site of Olympic Park in Melbourne, Victoria. The ground was primarily a speedway track, but also hosted football matches.
History.
Melbourne Carnivals Pty. Ltd, a company established in 1923 by Jack Campbell and Jim DuFrocq, developed and leased a large site known as the Amateur Sports Ground from the Crown with the help of local entrepreneur John Wren. On the site, the Motordrome was constructed. The stadium contained a grassed oval suitable for football, set inside a saucer-shaped concrete oval track suitable for motor racing; the track was a third of a mile long and banked at a 46° angle. Although Melbourne Carnivals originally had visions for the stadium to accommodate 100,000 spectators, it was ultimately built to accommodate around 32,000. The Motordrome was opened on 29 November 1924, and 32,000 spectators attended the inaugural race meeting.
In 1933, the ageing concrete surface of the motor racing track was no longer suitable for the higher powered vehicles which used it, so it was demolished and replaced with a dirt track which continued to be used for motor racing. In the same year, the Amateur Sports Ground was renamed Olympic Park, and the name was generally used for both the former Motordrome stadium, and the wider park in which it was situated. The name change had no connection to the Olympic Games – Melbourne was not selected as the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics until 1949 – and rather was chosen because the former name 'Amateur Sports Ground' no longer reflected the class and type of sport which was now played on the grounds.
The complex was sold after the Second World War and began to be converted into the Olympic Park Stadium used during the 1956 Olympics.
Motor racing.
During the time of the Great Depression the ground regularly drew in crowds of more than 30,000 to watch speedway, motorcycle and sidecar racing. It is generally acknowledged that the first Speedcar race in Australia took place at the speedway during the mid-1930s.
Football.
Although not much top-level football was played on the Motordrome, its presence as a high capacity centrally-located ground had a significant off-field impact on football during the 1920s and 1930s.
When the venue was first established in 1924, the Victorian Football League was very keen for strategic reasons to control it. Melbourne Carnivals had offered to lease the ground to the new Public Service Football Club if it were admitted to the League in 1925. This offer became the trigger for off-field negotiations which ultimately saw , and admitted to the VFL, but saw the VFL fail to secure the use of the Motordrome. There had been proposals for the Richmond Football Club to move to the venue, or for it to be used as a neutral venue to which each club moved one or two of its home matches each year; however, these proposals fell through. The Victorian Football Association went on to play its finals matches at the venue in 1925, 1926 and 1927.
Then in 1932, the VFA signed a deal to use the Motordrome as a neutral central venue from 1933 until 1940. Like one of the VFL's proposals, the VFA would play one match at the ground each weekend during the season, with each club moving one or two of its home games to the ground each year, as well as playing the finals there. This caused a massive dispute with the local councils which owned the VFA's suburban grounds, and it culminated in seven of the VFA's twelve clubs being kicked out of their local grounds until the agreement was rescinded, almost ruining the 1934 VFA season and potentially forcing those clubs to disband or secede "en masse" from the VFA. The agreement was rescinded shortly before the season began.
The Richmond Football Club formally announced its intentions to move its home base from the Punt Road Oval to Olympic Park prior to the 1936 season, owing mostly to an ongoing dispute with the Richmond Cricket Club. Richmond's proposal to move was ultimately voted down by the VFL, but only by the casting vote of League president William McClelland. The only VFL premiership football ever played at the venue occurred during the early part of 1932, when played three home matches there because the Melbourne Cricket Ground was being resurfaced.
In the 1935 pre-season, the venue staged a night match under electric floodlights between 1934 VFL Grand Finalists and . The players had some visibility problems, mostly with depth perception, but the match attracted 25,000 spectators. Further exhibition night matches were played at the end of 1935 between VFA Grand Finalists Yarraville and Camberwell, and at the end of 1936 between combined teams representing the VFL and VFA.
School and junior football was regularly played on the venue.
Other.
On 11 December 1926, the venue hosted a shambolic ostrich racing event. A full program of races was scheduled, but the event was cancelled after three farcical attempts at races – in which startled ostriches ridden by inanimate jockeys ran in opposite directions, and ostriches attached to sulkies failed to break out of a walk.

Cy Walter

Cy Walter (September 16, 1915 - August 18, 1968) was an American café society pianist based in New York City for four decades. Dubbed the "Art Tatum of Park Avenue," he was praised for his extensive repertoire (with an emphasis on show tunes) and improvisatory skill. His long radio and recording career included both solo and duo performances, and stints as accompanist for such elegant vocal stylists as Greta Keller, Mabel Mercer, and Lee Wiley.
Career.
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Walter grew up in a musical family and received early classical training from his mother, a professional piano teacher. In 1934, after a summer job playing piano on the overnight New York to Boston night cruise, he enrolled briefly at New York University but soon accepted an offer to join the Eddie Lane Orchestra on a full-time basis. Four years later, he formed a two-piano team with Gil Bowers and played at Le Ruban Bleu when it opened. Solo engagements followed at upscale bars and supper clubs like the Algonquin, the Blue Angel, and Tony's on West 52nd Street. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Walter explored other musical surroundings: as pit pianist with the Jerome Kern musical "Very Warm for May," as accompanist for Mabel Mercer and Greta Keller, and as leader of his own orchestra at the night club La Martinique. He briefly ran his own club, Cy Walter's Night Cap, before being called to a fourteen-month stint in the Maritime Service.
From 1944 to 1952, Walter appeared regularly (as part of a duo piano team with Stan Freeman, and later with Walter Gross) on ABC's popular weekly radio series "Piano Playhouse." Reaching an international audience over Armed Forces Radio, and with commentary by Milton Cross, "Playhouse" featured (in addition to the anchor duo) notable guest pianists from the jazz and classical worlds, teamed up "in all sorts of unusual combinations as duos, trios and quartets."
Walter found an ideal showcase for his talents when he opened the elegant Drake Room of New York's Drake Hotel on December 21, 1945. The following year, a "Metronome" profile noted that "The Cy Walter appeal can be summed up with two t's: taste and the tune. ... Sinatra, Whiting and other bigtimers are constantly dropping by... to pick up on some obscure show tune that he has resurrected from the vast storehouse of his musical mind... obscure little melodies that never made the Hit Parade and great timeless songs that have been lost in the shuffle." Walter continued at the Drake Room from 1945 until 1951, building a reputation as the "dean of Manhattan's piano professors," according to "The New Yorker" (1950). 
By then a fixture on the New York music scene, Walter spent the rest of the 1950s performing at various Manhattan venues and recording both as a solo pianist and accompanist—-for example, on Ahmet Ertegun's fledgling Atlantic label. While not a prolific songwriter, he also crafted a number of songs in an advanced harmonic style. For example, he composed both words and music for "Some Fine Day" (1953), and collaborated with Alec Wilder on "Time and Tide" (1961) and Chilton Ryan on "You Are There" (1960) and "See a Ring Around the Moon" (1961).
In 1959, Walter was invited to resume playing solo piano at the Drake Room. This six-nights-a-week engagement would continue until a week before the pianist's death in 1968. "I guess by now I know how to work the Drake Room," he quipped with typical understatement to an interviewer in 1966.

The University of Louisville Marching Band

The University of Louisville "Cardinal" Marching Band is the official marching band of the University of Louisville (a.k.a. "U of L" or "UofL") in Louisville, Kentucky. It is considered the Music Ambassador for U of L. The band plays at all home football games at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium (PJCS), all postseason bowl games, and two regular season away football games. It also plays at the annual Spring Scrimmage Game which pits the Cardinal Offense against the Cardinal Defense. The band is run as a Major Ensemble course at the UofL School of Music and is perhaps best known for its nationally televised performances of "My Old Kentucky Home" every year at the Kentucky Derby.
About.
Overview.
During the University's Fall semester, the band rehearses from 4:30pm to 6:30pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Membership normally ranges from 150 to 250, which includes the players, twirlers, colorguard, and drum majors. It is composed of students at the University (music majors and non-music majors alike) as well as a select few students of other nearby colleges that don't have a marching band program of their own. Members receive both a college credit and a scholarship for participation. The band has performed on MTV and has had musical greats join them in performance such as world renowned trumpeter, Wynton Marsalis. The group was chosen to perform for the Captain's Celebration of the 2008 Ryder Cup at the Valhalla Golf Club. The group has also been featured and/or written about on ESPN, FOX Sports, Good Morning America, ABC World News Tonight with Charlie Gibson, Inside Edition, and ABC’s .
"RED RAGE!".
The marching band adopted the nickname "RED RAGE!" from Fall 2007 to Spring 2011. The nickname was featured on various band apparel. The nickname was chosen in homage to a piece of the Louisville football team's history. Vince Gibson (Louisville football coach from 1975 to 1979) coined the name for his football team during their success. When the band was being announced during pregame and halftime shows, the band was called the "RED RAGE!" Marching Band.
Tau Beta Sigma (ΤΒΣ).
Certain particularly trashy members of the Cardinal Marching Band rush for the co-educational national honorary band fraternity known as Tau Beta Sigma (TBS). The University of Louisville is home to the Theta Psi chapter of TBS.
Performances.
The Kentucky Derby Festival.
Pegasus Parade.
During the Kentucky Derby Festival, the band has two events that it participates in annually. The first of which is the "Pegasus Parade", held in downtown Louisville two days before the Kentucky Derby. It is one of the largest parades in the United States. The band marches the parade among all the other floats and attractions while playing fight songs, both representing the University of Louisville and the city of Louisville itself.
Kentucky Derby.
The second of these events is the Kentucky Derby itself at historic Churchill Downs. The band routinely plays in between the various races held on Derby day, usually alternating play times with a military band. Its greatest honor every year takes place minutes before the big race—the playing of the Stephen Foster classic "My Old Kentucky Home" near the Derby Winner's Circle for all those in attendance and for those that watch on television. The band first played the song at the Derby in 1936, by which time it was established as the music played while the horses are led to the post parade. It has kept this engagement for all but a few years since then. In 2002, famed trumpeter Wynton Marsalis joined the band for this honor. In 1998, Dr. Frederick A. Speck (the UofL director of bands and a composer in his own right) wrote an arrangement of "My Old Kentucky Home" that the marching band has since played for this and many other occasions.
The Louisville Orchestra.
For years, the UofL Marching Band has carried a relationship with the Louisville Orchestra. The first concert of the Orchestra's season is called "Fanfara"—held at The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts in September every year. The marching band is featured as the opening act, usually entering and exiting to a drum cadence but stopping to play The Star-Spangled Banner while on stage. The playing of the American national anthem appropriately kicks off the Orchestra's season of wonderful live music.
KMEA State Marching Championships.
Since 2007, when the competition returned to Louisville after a long drought without it, band members have assisted the Kentucky Music Educators Association (KMEA) in hosting the semi-finals and finals of "Kentucky State Marching Band Championships" at Papa Johns Cardinal Stadium. Band members take on various jobs for the day, from being a band guide to being a press box assistant and more. At the end of the competition, the UofL Drumline (ULD) plays a series of cadences as all of the finalist bands reenter the stadium for the trophy ceremony.
Patrick Henry Hughes.
In 2006, trumpeter Patrick Henry Hughes joined the marching band. Patrick was a young man who had been born without eyes and, furthermore, was bound to a wheelchair, unable to walk. Patrick would play trumpet while his father (Patrick John Hughes) pushed him in his wheelchair through the marching drill. This visible commitment attracted increasing crowd and media attention throughout the fall football season, and the pair of Patricks were featured in a variety of television and newspaper coverage.
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.
In November 2007, at the suggestion of a member of the marching band, ABC's came to Louisville to remake Patrick Henry Hughes' family home. As part of a community project that the show routinely does at the suggestion of the recipient of the home makeover, the band's practice field was given a makeover. The show filmed at two band rehearsals—one rehearsal on the old field and one rehearsal at the unveiling of the new field. New lights and a new sound system were installed for better practice conditions. Other additions to the new field include a new shed for the storage of both instruments and equipment, a roofed sitting area to escape the sun's heat, and water fountains to hydrate the band members. The new field is fenced off and has a tall gate that displays the name of the field: Patrick Henry Hughes Field.
Music.
CDs.
The marching band has released one CD of music played: 2007 Highlights. The CD was engineered and recorded by Christopher Jones and Tim Haertel. It was produced by TNT Productions, Inc. The track listing is found below.

Michelle Mulherin

Michelle Mulherin (born January 1972) is an Irish Fine Gael politician. She was elected as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo constituency at the 2011 general election. She was elected to Ballina Town Council in 1999 and has also served as a Mayo County Councillor from 2004 until her election to Dáil Éireann in 2011. Mulherin unsuccessfully stood for election in the Mayo constituency at the 2007 general election.
In March 2011, Mulherin criticised the Libyan National Transitional Council during the 2011 Libyan civil war saying that it was an "internal matter" and that "oil was what made Libya 'special' and the external interference from countries such as the US is worrying”. Mulherin was not disciplined for her comments, which dissented against the official Fine Gael policy.
Several months later in June 2011 she was among a number of backbench Fine Gael TDs who criticised the level of payments being made to the unemployed. She called for National service to be introduced in order to tackle a "culture of entitlement". The proposal was criticised by a senior member of Fine Gael describing the proposal as not "out of place at a convention of the Tea Party movement in America".
In April 2012, she contributed to a Dáil Éireann debate on the subject of limited abortion. In her brief contribution, she cited the liberating grace of God and the "fallen nature" of all people and claimed that "fornication, I would say, is probably the single most likely cause of unwanted pregnancies in this country". This was criticised by TDs who favoured more access to abortion, including the independent Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Clare Daly, the Socialist Party representative who had proposed the bill being debated. In a television interview a few days later, she clarified that by 'fornication' she had meant 'consensual sex between adults who are not married to each other'.
In March 2013 Mulherin accused youth information site Spunout.ie of publishing inappropriate sex education content. Mulherin claimed that the information on the site was "incredibly regressive" and said that she would raise the issue of funding for the site with Health Minister James Reilly.

Solar MS-1

__NOTOC__
The Solar MS-1 was a prototype airliner built in the United States in 1930. It was a sesquiplane design, its wings braced to each other with warren truss-style struts. The stubby lower wings carried the divided main units of the fixed undercarriage. The fuselage was of rectangular cross-section and featured a fully enclosed flight deck and passenger cabin. The tail was of conventional design with strut-braced stabilizers and carrying a fixed tailwheel. Construction was of metal throughout, and the aircraft was powered by a single radial engine in the nose. 
The MS-1, registered "X258V", flew for the first time on 21 January 1930 with Doug Kelly at the controls. Kelly described it as "one of the finest closed planes I have ever flown", and Charles Lindbergh also praised the MS-2 when he flew it a few days later. Despite this, airlines did not order the type, although Northwest Airways considered buying ten examples. Solar made the prototype available for charter types for a while, but in 1931 sold it to an operator in Mexico who used it to transport coffee beans. On the Mexican register as "XB-AFK", the MS-1 was destroyed in a crash in 1936.

Stephen Hybicki

Stephen Hybicki is an American music producer and recording engineer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin by way of Atlanta, Georgia.
Hybicki started his career as a producer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, making beats and recording local artists until 2010, when he moved to Atlanta Georgia after garnering some radio play for a song he produced in 2009 for local group Y.T.C. and singer Cincere. After two months of working on set as an extra for Tyler Perry's "Meet the Browns", he accepted an internship at Hotbeats Recording Studios in Midtown Atlanta (mostly famous for being Lil Wayne's primary workplace during the recording of the Grammy winning Carter III album). Having not gone to school for engineering, he learned the ropes by watching the staff and networking with up an coming artists and producers. One of these up and coming producers happened to be the then relatively unknown super producer Mike WiLL Made It. Proving his dedication, work ethic, and undeniable ear for music, the owners and management allowed Hybicki to slowly work his way into rotation during regular recording sessions, his first session being with legendary rapper Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan fame. Within six months he was doing a large percentage of the recording sessions while still performing intern duties, leading him to become the studios first intern to be awarded a gold record by the RIAA for his engineering work on T.I.'s album "No Mercy". After a year at Hotbeats, Stephen (Steve) was hired by an independent record label to be the lead engineer and A&R. The label fizzled, but during that time Hybicki started working heavily with producer Mike WiLL Made It. Mike WiLL eventually went on to produce a string of Multi-Platinum hits and appointed Hybicki as his lead recording engineer. On their first project, Miley Cyrus' Platinum selling "Bangerz" album, Stephen recorded 8 of the 16 final songs. Since then Hybicki has been credited on albums for Future, Candice Glover, and Mariah Carey while along the way working with artists ranging from Britney Spears to Lil Wayne.

The View on Fifth

The View on Fifth, formerly the Milroy Apartments, is the fifth tallest building in Saskatoon, Canada, and located in the Central Business District. The building was originally constructed as rental units in 1968.
Condo conversion controversy.
In 2008, the Milroy Apartments building was sold by Kabo Developments to Viking Developments, who applied to the city for permission to convert the building into condominia. Because of the large number of senior citizen tenants who could not afford to purchase condominium units, the proposed conversion generated a public outcry. As a result, the developer agreed to retain ownership of 40 of the 156 units to be rented out to existing tenants for the following four years.
Following the approval of the conversion by the city council, residents tried unsuccessfully to block it in the courts. The residents withdrew their appeal, settling with the developer under the condition that some long-term residents would receive lifelong leases at prevailing market rates.
Post-conversion.
The building was renovated at a cost of CDN $6 million and was renamed The View on Fifth. Some of the units are rented out by Premium Executive Suites as extended-stay hotel suites.

Diocese of Canada

The Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Canada () is a Serbian Orthodox Church diocese located in Canada. Its headquarters are in Campbellville, Milton, Ontario.
Structure.
The Serbian Orthodox Church in the USA and Canada consists of four dioceses of the National Orthodox Church of Serbia (Serbian Patriarchate) that are governed by the Bishop of America and Canada Longin of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate. The four dioceses of the Church in North America are : the Dioceses of Eastern (Bishop Mitrophan), Midwestern (Metropolitan Christopher), and Western (Bishop Maxim) United States and the Diocese of Canada (Bishop Georgije).
The Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, during its regular session on 21 May 2009, based on a recommendation of the Episcopal Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America, relative to the restructuring of the existing Dioceses in North and South America, rendered the following decision confirming the Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America, according to which the Dioceses of our Church on that territory will be restructured:
1. THE METROPOLITANATE OF LIBERTYVILLE-CHICAGO, led by Metropolitan Christopher RIP, with its see at the Monastery of St. Sava in Libertyville (encompassing the Monastery of St. Sava in Libertyville and the Cathedral Church of the Holy Resurrection with its three parishes), whose Metropolitan shall be the President of the Episcopal and Central Church Councils and the Clergy-Laity Assembly, and therefore the ex officio representative of the Serbian Orthodox Church on that territory.
2. THE DIOCESE OF NEW GRACANICA-MIDWESTERN AMERICA, led by Bishop Longin (Krčo), with it see at the Monastery of New Gračanica (encompassing all the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries in Chicago - save the Holy Resurrection Cathedral - and the other Midwestern American States of the previous Metropolitanate of Midwestern American, as well as all of the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries of the previous Diocese for America and Canada of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate on the territory of the previous Metropolitanate of Midwestern America).
3. THE DIOCESE OF EASTERN AMERICA, led by Bishop Mitrophan (Kodić), with its see in Pittsburgh/Mars (encompassing all of the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries of the current Eastern American Diocese and the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries of the previous Diocese for America and Canada of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate on the territory of Eastern America).
4. THE DIOCESE OF WESTERN AMERICA, led by Bishop Maxim (Vasilijević), with its see in Los Angeles/Alhambra (encompassing all of the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries of the current Western American Diocese and the Church-School Congregations, and Parishes of the previous Diocese for America and Canada of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate on the territory of Western America).
5. THE DIOCESE OF CANADA, led by Bishop Georgije (Djokić), with its see in Toronto/Milton (encompassing all of the Church-School Congregations, Parishes and Monasteries of the current Canadian Diocese and the Church-School Congregations and Parishes of the previous Diocese for America and Canada of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate on the territory of Canada).
"With this decision on the said redistribution, Article 8 of the Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America, and by it the previous titles "Metropolitanate of Midwestern America" and the "Diocese for America and Canada of the New Gračanica Metropolitanate" cease to exist, and the new borders for these Dioceses of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America are rendered effective." -- Bishop Irinej of Bačka, Spokesman of the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

<doc id="31022857" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31022857" title="PET-MRI">
PET-MRI

PET-MRI is a hybrid imaging technology that incorporates MRI soft tissue morphological imaging and PET functional imaging. Currently three companies offer combined PET-MR systems: Philips, Siemens and GE. The first two clinical whole body PET-MRI systems were installed by Philips at Mount Sinai Medical Centre in the United States and at Geneva University Hospital in Europe.
Applications.
Presently, the main clinical fields of PET-MRI are oncology, cardiology and neurology. Research studies are actively conducted at the moment to understand benefits of the new PET-MRI diagnostic method. The technology combines the exquisite structural and functional characterisation of tissue provided by MRI with the extreme sensitivity of PET imaging of metabolism and tracking of uniquely labeled cell types or cell receptors.
There is discussion and investigation into utilizing PET-MR with Ion Therapy for the purpose of cancer treatment. with MRI's ability to accurately depict the proton density of tissue is a good match for the benefits and technical challenges of treatment planning utilizing Ion Therapy systems.
Clinical systems.
Currently Siemens is the only company to offer a fully integrated whole body and simultaneous acquisition PET-MRI system. This system received a CE mark and FDA approval for customer purchase in 2011. Over thirty facilities have since installed this technology.
Preclinical systems.
Currently, the combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a hybrid imaging modality is receiving great attention not only in its emerging clinical applications but also in the preclinical ﬁeld. Several designs based on several different types of PET detector technology have been developed in recent years, some of which have been used for ﬁrst preclinical studies.
A preclinical PET-MRI system with sequential acquisition is commercially available from Mediso Medical Imaging Systems since 2011. The first nanoScan PET-MRI system was installed at Karolinska Experimental Research and Imaging Centre of Karolinska Institutet in March 2011. The compact imaging system utilizes magnetically shielded position sensitive photomultiplier tubes and a compact 1 Tesla permanent magnet MRI platform. The integration has no adverse effects on the PET or on the MRI performance due to increased magnetic shielding of the PET component and low fringe field of the MRI component based on the performance evaluation of the system.
Bruker Biospin, in collaboration with the University of Tübingen, have produced commercial prototype systems for their preclinical MRI magnets utilising a Siemens PET platform. The first such system comprising a 7T Clinscan MRI with the PET insert was installed at the CAI in Brisbane Australia in 2012.
Hybrid PET MRI systems require special devices that balance tradeoffs between PET attenuation and MRI performance. XLR Imaging Inc and Ceresensa supply PET/MRI coils and As of May 2013, Hybrid MR Inc has formed to provide 3rd party manufacturing of preclinical PET compatible MRI devices.
PET-MRI versus PET-CT.
Comparisons have been made between PET-MRI and PET-CT, some sources stating that PET-MRI is simply a X-ray radiation-free version of PET-CT (PET-MRI has as well Radiation from Biomarker). In reality, there are differences beyond X-ray radiation dose.

Pierre Robineau de Portneuf

Pierre Robineau de Portneuf, was an officer in the colonial regular troops. He was born on August, 9th, 1708 in Montreal, Quebec, second son of René Robineau de Portneuf and Marguerite Daneau de Muy, He married Marie-Louise Dandonneau Du Sablé on April 22, 1748. He died November 15th, 1761 in the shipwreck of the Auguste off Cape Breton Island.
Bibliography.
Pierre Robineau de Portneuf was a cadet for the colonial regular troops in 1729 at Michilimackinac, Michigan. On April 1, 1733 he was promoted second ensign, and on October 1, 1740, he was made an ensign on the active list in Louisiana. On 15 April 1750 the minister of Marine, Antoine Louis Rouillé, consenting to a request made by Governor Marquis de la Jonquière and Intendant François Bigot, granted permission to build a small fortified post at Toronto on the shore of Lake Ontario. The authorities of the colony hoped by this means to attract the Indians in the region, probably the Mississaugas, to trade with the French and thus dissuade them from taking their furs to the English at Fort Oswego. Pierre Robineau de Portneuf, who was an ensign at Fort Frontenac, was designated to carry out the project. The Sieur de Portneuf set out on May 20, 1750 and reached Toronto some time later. While the necessary provisions and articles for trade were being forwarded from Montreal, he began to build the fort that was planned on the east bank of the Toronto river, near its mouth. Within two months a warehouse and a stockade were put up. Trade with the Indians at Fort Toronto proved successful, and by July 17, a shipment of furs worth 18,000 livres had been sent to Montreal. This result surpassed expectations. On August 20, the governor wrote to the minister to acquaint him of the success and to inform him that he intended to build a new and larger fort at the point of the peninsula called La Baye. He recommended the Sieur de Portneuf for this new project. Recalling the reasons for building the first post, he noted that they were more than ever valid. Moreover he suggested the possibility of persuading the Indians to destroy Fort Oswego. He asked the minister’s permission to give the name Rouillé to the new fort in honor of him. Work was begun in the autumn of 1750 and went ahead throughout the winter. The fort was almost finished in April 1751, when the Sieur de Portneuf returned from Fort Frontenac, where he had spent the winter. He was in command at Fort Rouillé during the 1751 trading season, and returned to Fort Frontenac in the autumn. Early in 1752 he was replaced as commandant of Fort Rouillé by Thomas Robutel de La Noue.
In 1756, he was appointed commandant of Fort Presque Isle. The following year he was promoted captain. He played an active role in the engagements in the Ohio valley during the Seven Years' War. When Fort Niagara was under attack in 1759, he was busy at Fort Presque Isle rallying the Indians of the west. After Fort Niagara surrendered, he sent an emissary under a flag of truce to William Johnson, set fire to Fort Presque Isle, and went to Detroit, where he surrendered to the English. In October 1761, he sailed from Quebec on the Auguste for France, perhaps with the hope of making a new career for himself there. One month later, he was among the 113 passengers and crew members who perished when the ship sank off Cape Breton Island.

Second Chance (album)

Second Chance is the fifth studio album by American R&B recording artist El DeBarge, released on November 30, 2010, by Geffen Records and Interscope Records. It is his first studio album in 16 years and the follow-up to "Heart, Mind and Soul" (1994). Production for the album took place at various recording studios and was handled by DeBarge and several other record producers, including Ron Fair, Mike City, Michael Angelo, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis.
The album debuted at number 57 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 21,000 copies in its first week. It remained on the chart for 12 weeks and produced two singles, "Second Chance" and "Lay with You". Upon its release, "Second Chance" received acclaim from music critics, who complimented its material and praised DeBarge's singing. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, set to be presented at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012.
Background.
The album is DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, following a period of drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on "Second Chance".
Recording.
Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording studios, namely Capitol Studios, Flyte Tyme Studios, House of Music, MAS Sounds Studio, Mischkemusic Studios, No Excuses, Oceanway Studios, Redstar Recording, Shelter Studios, Sly Doggie Studios, Sounds Studio, The Boiler Room, The Boom Boom Room, and Unsung Studios. DeBarge co-wrote and co-produced the album, working with producers such as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Mike City, Ron Fair, the Avila Brothers, and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds, who had worked with him on his previous album "Heart, Mind and Soul" (1994). He also worked with guest artists 50 Cent, Faith Evans, and Fabolous. DeBarge said of the album's music, "There's music to dance to and make love to, music to cry to. I'm starting from scratch, coming fresh. But my sound still embodies the same soulful, intricate harmonies".
Promotion.
DeBarge made several well-received performances and reintroduced himself to the public. On June 27, 2010, he made his first media appearance since his prison release as a surprise guest at the 2010 BET Awards, performing a medley of his earlier hit songs as a member of DeBarge and as a solo artist, including "Second Chance". Subsequently, he opened for recording artist Vivian Green and performed at the 2010 Essence Music Festival in July. Throughout October 2010, he opened for recording artist Mary J. Blige on her Music Saved My Life Tour. He also made promotional appearances on BET's "106 & Park", "The Steve Harvey Morning Show", and "The Wendy Williams Show", as well as signing events at CD retailers in New York City, Chicago, and Houston during the album's release week. 
The album's lead single, "Second Chance", was released on August 17, 2010 as a digital download. It debuted the following week at number 84 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It spent two weeks on the chart and peaked at number 41. "Second Chance" earned DeBarge two Grammy Award nominations, for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song, presented at the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011. The album's second single, "Lay with You", features Faith Evans and was released on October 25, 2010. It reached number 20 and spent 14 weeks on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
In promotion of "Second Chance", DeBarge headlined an eight-date national tour in October, coinciding with concert dates for Blige's tour. In December, he toured with recording artist Fantasia and performed on "The Mo'Nique Show" and "

"Second Chance" was released by Geffen Records on November 30, 2010, in the United States. It debuted at number 57 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 chart and sold 21,000 copies in its first week, the week ending December 18, 2010. It also entered at number 13 on "Billboard"s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album spent 12 weeks on the "Billboard" 200.
The album was released in the United Kingdom on February 11, 2011. It was also released as a two-disc deluxe edition, packaged with a bonus disc of Christmas-themed songs.
Critical reception.
"Second Chance" received universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on six reviews. Allmusic's Andy Kellman called it "one of the year’s best R&B albums" and complimented its "sweet love songs — pleasurable, fresh updates of his tried and true approach", adding that DeBarge's voice "remains capable of elevating substandard material, not that there is much of it here". "Entertainment Weekly"s Mikael Wood commented that "his ethereal vocals still shimmer so effortlessly", and called it "the year's most elegant tell-all". Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" wrote that "DeBarge simply soars, his feather-light vocals still in top form". Steve Jones of "USA Today" felt that DeBarge's "sweet, soaring falsetto remains intact, and he has lost none of his knack for writing catchy, romantic tunes". "The Huffington Post"s Marlynn Snyder critiqued that "the effort to surround with a mix of both established, hit-making songwriters and producers, and younger creative voices, is a rousing success". 
Steve Horowitz of PopMatters asserted that the album's material "succeeds to a large extent simply because it addresses a wide demographic". Mario Tarradell of "The Dallas Morning News" praised DeBarge's "melodic soul-pop" vocals and described the album as "an elegant effort that updates his style without obliterating it". Okayplayer's E. Esi Arthur wrote that the album "does an efficient job of lining up songs where his unique vocal styling is in the front seat". MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave "Second Chance" an A- rating. Christgau found DeBarge's voice to be "unspoiled" and stated, "DeBarge's special gift has always been combining the boyish innocence of J5-era Michael Jackson with intimations of physical congress. The quirky murmurs, yelps, and coos of his head voice, a high end of unequalled softness and give, sound responsive where Jackson's sound willed. There's a girl there, or just as likely a grown woman. And whether or not El seems manly to you, he's turning her on and vice versa".

East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950

The East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950 (also known as the East Pakistan Estate Acquisition Act 1950) was a law passed by the newly formed democratic Government of East Bengal in the Dominion of Pakistan (present day Bangladesh). The bill was drafted on 31 March 1948 during the early years of Pakistan and passed on 16 May 1951. Before passage of the legislature, landed revenue laws of Bengal consisted of the Permanent Settlement Regulations of 1793 and the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885. 
The 1793 legislature created a landed aristocracy (see: Zamindars of Bengal) which was supposed to be loyal to the British Empire. The Act of 1885 defined the rights and liabilities of the peasants ("ryats") in relation to their superior lords ("Zamindars"). After the fall of the British rule in 1948, the law abolished the Zamindari system in the region, after which the lands of the state were under the federal government. It was seen as a democratic move to a "people's state" rather than a feudal class system. India adopted a similar law in 1953 in the Constitution of India. In modern Pakistan, such reforms were never carried out, which is why the effects of feudalism has perpetrated national politics and governance.
History.
During the times of the Middle kingdoms of India rent was called "rajasva" (the King's share). The king's men used to collect rajasva from his subjects according to law, and none could be evicted if rajasva was paid regularly. Later, the Hindu 'rajasva' became 'jama' during Muslim rule of the Mughal Empire. However, the spirit of rajasva and jama remained the same. The cultivators had customary rights in land which the sovereign honoured, as long as they paid revenue to the rulers. These revenues were supplied to the "zamindars", officials of the empire, who created the feudalistic nobility. During the mughal era (specifically during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb), the mansabdari system, the military nobility evolved into the aristocratic landed zamindari system.
During the British rule, the zamindars became equivalents of the landed aristocracy of Britain. in 1793, the zamindars were created absolute owners of the estates, and not just representatives of the sovereign rulers
Abolishing the system.
The Act comprises 152 sections divided into five parts and 19 chapters. In consequence of introduction of the law, no intermediary interest were present between the Government and its people, the government has become the only lord and the cultivators were relieved of the baneful effect of "subinfeudation". The zamindari families were partly reimbursed for their losses during the exchange of land ownership after a few battles in court. The rule of zamindars were substituted by a hierarchy of officials with the Board of Land Administration with Assistant commissioners, collectors and Deputy Commissioner etc. A collector or deputy commissioner is assisted by one additional deputy commissioner for revenue, one revenue deputy collector, and a number of other governmental officials.
Families like the Dhaka Nawab Family, the Prithimpassa Family, the Dighapatia Raj Family, the Puthia Raj family, Singranatore Family were legally abolished and relieved of centuries of duties, rights, titles etc. However, in Chittagong region, the law was not to be applicable, which is why Tridev Roy and Debashish Roy still held on to royal titles of "Raja" (King), "Rani" (Queen) and "Rajkumar"(Prince), while the former families lost theirs.
1950s.
Else where in the former Indian Empire, most of the princely states in the western part of empire (Pakistan) merged into the Province of West Pakistan on the 14th of October 1955 and the new nation was declared a republic within a year even though some of the frontier states continued to be administered as separate units. During the same period 1948-1950, some of the remaining princely states joined India, and the Indian zamindaris were also abolished.
In return for surrendering the government of their states in the case of Princes, and estates in the case of Zamindars, together with their revenues and military forces, the former ruling princes were guaranteed their hereditary styles and titles, certain privileges of rank and honour, as well as privy purses to cover the living expenses of themselves and their families. However, this too was abolished in 1956.
1970s.
In 1971, the styles and titles enjoyed by the former ruling families ceased to be officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan in January 1972. Coincidentally, that year was also the year of Independence of the East province of Pakistan (East Pakistan) into Bangladesh. In Pakistan, however, most of the formerly ruling families continued to exercise significant influence and considerable political and economic power. After a year-long battle in India, an amendment to the Constitution at the end of 1971 abolished the privy purses, guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and eliminated the princely order itself.

Charity Creek

Charity Creek, a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, is a creek west of Sydney Harbour, located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It joins Parramatta River at Meadowbank Park, Meadowbank.
Ecology.
The source of the creek is in the suburb of West Ryde. The Charity Creek catchment area is . 
The catchment is bounded by Victoria Road, Devlin Street, Blaxland Road, Marlow Avenue and the Main North railway line. The catchment boundary crosses the railway line just south of West Ryde railway station. The catchment is predominantly residential with some commercial development in the vicinity of Rhodes Street and Herbert Street. Most of the drainage system in the Charity Creek catchment consists of concrete pipes or boxed culverts. The creek is culverted down to Meadowbank Boys High School. Below this is a short reach of natural open channel to the railway line. Downstream of the railway line the creek is a concrete lined channel. All the tributaries of Charity Creek are piped.
Charity Creek Cascades, named after the creek, is an interconnected series of council parks running from Top Ryde to West Ryde railway station. The area covers approximately , and stretches from Shepherd Street to Linton Lane.
History.
Charity Point, near Charity Creek, is attributed to William Bennet, an early settler who was both a farmer and South Sea trader. When his ships need repairing, a large number of south-sea islander crew camped on the shore. His kind treatment to them earned the names Charity Creek and Charity Headland.
Dinner Point, now called Charity Point, at the Meadowbank Memorial Park, is said to have acquired its name on 15 February 1788. First Lieutenant William Bradley wrote: 
At 1pm returned to the Boats and after dinner went in the smallest boat over the flats past a mangrove island.
Bradley then followed a creek so narrow that boat oars stuck their struck the sides until they were stopped by fallen trees. Charity Point, once backed by a creek which has been filled in, was originally named "Mur-ray-mah", perhaps meaning 'black bream', heard by the linguist Lieutenant William Dawes as "karóoma" ("garuma"). Charity Point was also a popular fishing spot. Kent, a nephew of Governor John Hunter, was first granted on 12 May 1796. He received a further grant in 1803, when his nephew William Kent Jnr obtained in the district of Eastern Farms. It was after the 1840s that the former orchards and farms of the Ryde area began to be subdivided and Charity Creek was filled in.

Chichibu Maru

The was a Japanese passenger ship which, renamed Kamakura Maru, was sunk during World World II, killing 2,035 soldiers and civilians on board. 
The "Chichibu Maru" was built for the Nippon Yusen shipping company by the Yokohama Dock Company in 1930. She had a beam of 22.6 meters, a length of 178 meters and a tonnage of 17,498. Cruising speed was 19 knots, with a maximum of 21 knots. The ship could carry 817 passengers. She differed from her half-sisters, the "Asama Maru" and the "Tatsuta Maru", in her propulsion system, and in having one (rather than two) funnels.
Before the war, the ship carried passengers between Yokohama and San Francisco. Prince Takamatsu and Princess Takamatsu also traveled on this ship. She had her name altered twice: first re-spelt "Titibu Maru" in 1938, following the adoption of Kunrei-shiki romanization; then - upon realizing the name's resemblance to "tit" (a vulgar English term for the female breast) - renamed "Kamakura Maru" in 1939. 
In 1942 she was confiscated by the Imperial Japanese Navy to serve as a troop transport ship, and also as hospital ship.
On April 28, 1943, the "Kamakura Maru", sailing from Manila to Singapore and carrying some 2,500 soldiers and civilians, was torpedoed by the US submarine USS "Gudgeon". The ship was hit by two torpedoes and sank within 12 minutes. Four days later, 465 survivors were rescued from the sea by Japanese ships, meaning some 2,035 people were killed.

<doc id="31023245" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31023245" title="Anti-Pakistan sentiment">
Anti-Pakistan sentiment

Anti-Pakistan sentiment (also known as Pakistan-phobia or Pakophobia) is a sentiment against Pakistanis as a people and nation in a generalising manner. Some political parties use these feelings to garner votes. The opposite of anti-Pakistan sentiment is pro-Pakistan sentiment.
India.
Ideological.
The Indian state does not accept the validity of the Two Nation Theory stating Muslims needed a homeland in South Asia. Hindu nationalists in India support the idea of Akhand Bharat which means Undivided India, and treat the Partition of India as illegitimate. There have been many anti-Pakistan demonstrations in India often involving violent protests in which Pakistani flags are burned. In March 2014 approximately 66 students from Indian-controlled Kashmir were beaten by fellow students when they cheered the Pakistani cricket team in the cricket Asia cup they were also charged with sedition and subsequently released.
Sikh nationalism.
The slogan "Death to Pakistan" ("Pakistan Murdabad") was raised by Sikh leader Master Tara Singh in March 1947, soon after the Unionist Party cabinet of Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana resigned in the Punjab, and immediately after it was announced that the Muslim League would take over the reins of provincial government. The resignation of the Khizar Tiwana government, composed of Muslim, Hindu, and Sikhs, followed the unrest caused by the call for the Direct Action Day by the Muslim League the previous year.
According to historian Stanley Wolpert in "A New History of India", when the administration of Punjab was taken over by Muslim League, "Master Tara Singh, bearded leader of the militant Sikhs, called for direct action by his "khalsa" against the League at this time, igniting the powder keg of repressed violence that set the Punjab ablaze with his cry of ""Pakistan Murdabad"" ("Death to Pakistan"). Tara Singh and his followers were demanding a Sikh nation of their own, Sikhistan, and by demonstrating their willingness to die in defence of their homeland, they sought to prove the validity of their claim." This slogan often was followed by religious fights and conflicts.
Sports.
Shiv Sena warned that it will not allow Pakistan to play any 2011 Cricket World Cup in Mumbai. Pakistan Hockey Federation also feared of sending the national hockey of Pakistan because of anti-Pakistani sentiment in India.
Media.
Several major Bollywood films have depicted Pakistan in a hostile manner by portraying Pakistanis and the state as a hostile enemy. Bollywood movies, however, have been highly popular in Pakistan and India's Bollywood movie star Shah Rukh Khan has advocated India-Pakistan reconciliation. Although Bollywood films were banned for 40 years prior to 2008 because Indian culture was officially viewed as being "vulgar", there had been an active black market during the period and little was done to disrupt it.
In 2012, Raj Thackeray and his party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) told Indian singer Asha Bhosle not to co-judge in "Sur Kshetra", a musical reality show aired on a local television channel that featured Pakistani artists alongside Indians. The MNS threatened to disrupt the shoot among other consequences if the channel went on to air the show. However, amid tight security in a hotel conference, Bhosle played down the threat, saying she only understood the language of music and did not understand politics.
Bangladesh.
The relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan is affected by past history. Due to political, economic, linguistic and ethnic discrimination by the Pakistani state before independence in 1971, and the atrocities against the Bengalis committed by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, some people in Bangladesh abhor everything from Pakistan. The Government of Bangladesh demands a formal apology for those atrocities from the Pakistani head of state, as well as putting on trial former military and political leaders who had played a role in the army action in then East Pakistan. Pakistan has continued to ignore this demand.
In 2012 Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) abandon a planned cricket tour in Pakistan indefinitely amid fears over players' safety, following protests by Bangladeshis and a Facebook campaign against the visit.
Pakistan.
In Pakistan Baloch separatists express their anti-Pakistan sentiment by crying slogans like:"Death to Pakistan" ("Pakistan Murdabad").
Afghanistan.
Afghanistan–Pakistan relations have been negatively affected by issues related to the Durand Line, the 1978–present war (i.e. Mujahideen, Afghan refugees, Taliban insurgency and border skirmishes), including water and the growing influence of India in Afghanistan. Most major attacks in Afghanistan are blamed on neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. This makes anti-Pakistan sentiment high in the country, particularly among the Afghan politicians. From the 1970s onwards Pakistan supported rebels such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Ahmad Shah Massoud, Haqqanis, Taliban, and others against the governments of Afghanistan.
In the 1990s, Pakistan's support to the Taliban movement led to strong anti-Pakistan sentiments in Afghanistan. According to Pakistan and Afghanistan expert Ahmed Rashid, "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" keeping the Taliban regime in power. The role of the Pakistani military during that time has been described by international observers as a "creeping invasion" of Afghanistan. UN documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in Taliban massacre campaigns.
In the course of the Taliban insurgency (2003–present) anti-Pakistan sentiment was again fuelled after a spate of suicide bombings by the Taliban, which in 2011 and 2012 caused 80% of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and which the Afghan government and many international officials claim is supported by Pakistan. Demonstrations in Afghanistan have denounced Pakistan politically for its alleged role in Taliban attacks. Afghan leaders such as Amrullah Saleh or Ahmad Wali Massoud (a younger brother of Ahmad Shah Massoud) have said, that their criticism is directed at the politics of the Pakistani military and not at Pakistan as a country. Both reiterated the distinction by saying that the Pakistani people had been very generous in providing shelter to Afghan refugees but that it was the policy of the Pakistani military which had caused so much suffering to the Afghan people.
Anti-Pakistan sentiment have increased in Afghanistan after 100s of suicide bombings and assassinations. In 2011, while lecturing at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf claimed the reason for anti-Pakistan sentiment was Afghanistan's relationship to the former Soviet Union and India. His statement came despite Afghanistan being known for its historically fierce anti-Soviet resistance.
France.
After the July 2005 bombings in London, there were waves of "Pakistanophobia" in France. A Pakistani community leader said a "right-wing newspaper, for instance, launched a ferocious campaign against Pakistanis in France and placed them in one basket, calling them a "cause for concern."
United Kingdom.
, the United Kingdom had the largest overseas Pakistani community, who are known as British Pakistanis. There have been periodic ethnic tensions faced by the Pakistani community. The first recorded use of the term ""Paki"" in a derogatory way was in the United Kingdom. It has also been used for non-Pakistani ethnic groups. The word is being reclaimed by younger British Pakistanis, who use it themselves.
Pakistani reactions.
Pakistani cable operators have accused foreign news organisations of airing "anti-Pakistan" material, according to the BBC. In November 2011 that organisation was itself blocked from view in Pakistan after it broadcast a documentary called "Secret Pakistan" in which Pakistan's connection to the Taliban were explored. The BBC noted that while it was officially the action of broadcast operators in the country, "the Pakistani government is likely to have put pressure on to impose the ban". The government denied this, saying that it was committed to "freedom of press and media".

Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia

The Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia (PGNUNSC) was an Internationally unrecognized and ostensibly provisional government set up by the Khmer Rouge on July 11, 1994 in opposition to the established Kingdom of Cambodia. Its Prime Minister was Khieu Samphan (who was also head of the armed forces) and its Deputy Prime Minister (in charge also of foreign affairs) was Son Sen. It was staffed by members of the Cambodian National Unity Party. Areas it controlled included Pailin (the capital of the provisional government) and Preah Vihear (where it was based.) The Khmer Rouge radio station was also known as the "Radio of the Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia." Other ministers included Chan Youran, Mak Ben, In Sopheap, Kor Bun Heng, Pich Cheang and Chuon Choeun.
In August 1996 senior Khmer Rouge official Ieng Sary defected from the KR with two armed divisions and the formation of his own party, the Democratic National Union Movement, which in turn encouraged more defections from the KR as Pol Pot ordered the assassinations of Son Sen (which was successful) and Ta Mok (which was not.) In mid-June 1997 Khieu Samphan (who had by now founded the Khmer National Solidarity Party) denounced Pol Pot and began discussing demobilization and a return to civilian life.
With Pol Pot's death in April 1998 and widespread sentiment within the Khmer Rouge for an end to an almost 20-year conflict, Khieu Samphan and Ta Mok dissolved the provisional government on June 22, 1998.

Bardarash

Bardarash (Barda Rash) is a township (subdistrict) located in Iraqi Kurdistan Region, 70 km north of Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and 32 km north east of Mosul. All its people are Kurds and Sunni Muslims and the majority of them speak in Gorani accent (not language), Goran is also the name of the tribe that comprises the majority of the people in Bardarash district. That is why the accent they are speaking is called Gorani as well.
History.
At the era of Ottoman Empire, Bardarash was recognized as a district (Nahiya) in 1879. At the time of Ottoman empire and until the 1970s, it was known as ‘Ashair Al Sab’aa, the meaning of which is "Seven Tribes" in English, because it is said that there are seven major tribes which lived and still live in Bardarash; they are - Rashgary 55%, Gezh 23%, Bot 11%, Shekh-Bzeni 2%, Khidiry 1%, Zangana 1% and others 7%. All of them are called Gorani. But also other tribes live in this area and some of them migrated in the four last decades of 20th century, such as Surchi, Zebar, Sharafan etc.
Bardarash was formerly joined to Akre, and they were joined to Ninewa province until the Uprising of 1991, after which both towns were liberated from the Ba’ath regime and they were joined to Duhok province until now. In 2008 the KRG decided to create a new district (Qaza) centred on Bardarash.
Etymology.
Bardarash means "black stone"; this is because its soil in general is black or, there is a destination south of the Bardarash is called (Shaxe-Rash, Black-Rocks) and it’s said that people are used to live there before they transfer to current place.
Geography and population.
Bardarash district is located between two rivers which they are (Upper- Zab, Zey Badinan) and (Xazir) in the east the west, and in north has a border with Akre and south with Mosul and Hawler. According to an (UN-WFP) census in 1997 the population of Bardarash district was 51,713 people.
But now according to Bardarash Mayoralty, Bardarash now consists of three subjoined districts, which are Daratoo, Roviya, and Kalak, and 88 villages. The population of Bardarash now is more than 115,000 people.
Sub-districts joined to Bardarash are 1- Daratoo 2- Rovia 3- Kalak 
Economy.
The area of Bardarash district according to some sources is 983 Square Kilometres. In general Bardarash is an agricultural area and until now most of the people depend on crop yields like wheat and barly. They used to have more sheep and cows than nowadays.
Bardarash is a rich area for oil resources and several foreign companies are now working on searching and producing oil. One of the companies has recently said that Bardarash is the second Kirkuk of Kurdistan for oil.
Social components.
In Bardarash district the Goran tribe is dominant and they are subdivided into several smaller tribes. Tribal mentality has its biggest effect on the people of Bardarash and as a result of this mentality, there are some problems. As mentioned before there are several other tribes live in Bardarash, most of them came in 1975 when they migrated because of the Ba’ath toppled regime from Zumar, Atrush, Shexan, Rabee’a and Mreba and they were forced to settle in (Kanilan) village. After that Bardarash people took them and they divided to villages and many of them still live in Bardarash.
Becoming a district.
The ceremonies of turning Bardarash sub district into a district were performed in presence of Tamar Remezan, Duhok governor, the head of KDP branch (9), and a number of administrative and party officials and the dignitaries of the area. The mayor of Bardarash first gave a brief history of the sub district and the importance that KRG attached to the area after 1991, and he made it clear how important the decision to make Bardarash a district is. In his speech, the governor congratulated the people of the area and said that it is for the good of people that this decision was taken in order to give more attention to the area and promised to help improve the work of the administrative departments there. Mazin M. Saeed, the mayor, promised to do his best to provide services to the people. It is worth mentioning that Bardarash became a sub district in 1890 and more than 75000 people live in. It has two sub district (Kalak and Rovia), and another subdistrict is expected (Darato).
Bardarash Uprising.
On 12 March 1991 at 9 o’clock in the morning, Bardarash people like other Kurdish people in other parts of Kurdistan, started the uprising against Ba’ath regime and became the Gate of Uprising in Badinan, after that Akre and Duhok and Zaxo upraised against the regime and librated. As we said before 1991 Bardarash and Akre were joined to Mosul province but after the uprising, Bardarash and Akre were only two towns that upraised against Ba’ath Regime in Ninewa province and after that they joined to Duhok province and still managed by the KRG.
Bardarash and The Battle of Gaugamela.
During a workshop conducted by Salahadin University hosting an archeologist and a historian from the Greek Cyprus University, instructors and students of archeology department discussed for several hours the circumstances surrounding the battle. This resulted in pinpointing exactly where Gaugamela took place.
Muhamad Abdullah Kakasoor, Dean of the College of Arts at University of Salahadin stated that the battle was previously thought to have occurred near the city of Erbil. 
A team from the Greek Cyprus University visited Erbil recently to discover the real location of the battle. After a more thorough local investigation, they came to the conclusion that the battlefield was situated in the triangle of Maqloob Mountain ? Tel Gomer Village and Bardarash. 
Mr. Kakasoor said, after the delegation?s visit to the site, intensive excavations will be carried out.
?The importance of this topic is that Gaugamela or sometimes called Erbela is an international historical occurrence, whoever reads the history of Alexander will come across the name Erbela which undoubtedly refers to the current city of Erbil (or Hawler). 
He said that the Greek archeologists revealed that the real location of the battle is in Bardarash District rather than the place mentioned in Greek and Iranian historical sources. 
?The Greek delegation has reached a conclusion, depending on their study and ancient and contemporary Greek sources that the battle occurred in Bardarash District which is a wide area suitable to be used as a battlefield. So now the actual location of the battle is settled? he argued. 
The battle is believed to be the first after which the West could dominate the East powers. According to the historical sources, Darius's army consisted of 100-200 thousand soldiers, but the technique Alexander used in the battle enabled him to win with fewer numbers of soldiers. 
The Head of Archeology at Salahadin University stated during the workshop that he visited the site in Bardarash himself. 
And according to the scripts and documents that Greek Cyprus University professors revealed, the site of the battle is located 90 km far away from the city of Erbil. 
In addition, they say that Persian sources mention the mountain that?s now known as Maqloob which both armies passed by ahead of their arrival to Gomel River, Upper Zap and Xazir River, and both armies reached Tel Gomel (a village in Bardarash District) where there?s a wide plain of 10 km long and 5–7 km wide. He added that the area is very wide, so excavating and searching for military equipment of both armies can be challenging. 
However, modern detecting equipments can facilitate searching and finding some pieces of weapons such as spears, bows and arrows or whatever made of iron and used in the fight. He also stated that excavations haven?t started yet. 
According to archeologists who took part in the workshop, the outcome of this workshop will be presented to Salahadin University and KRG Council of Ministers so that the location could be surveyed and excavated thoroughly and extensively, and finally turned into a very interesting archeological site in Kurdistan Region.

<doc id="31023403" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31023403" title="Walker Whiteside">
Walker Whiteside

Walker Whiteside (1869 – 1942) was an American actor who had played Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Shylock while still in his teens.
Early life.
Walker Whiteside was born on March 16, 1869, near the confluence of the Wabash and Eel rivers at Logansport in northern Indiana. He was the only child of Thomas C. and Lavina (née Walker) Whiteside. Walker’s family would later move to the Chicago suburb of Riverside where his father’s law practice afforded them the luxury of two servants. In the years to come, Thomas Whiteside would serve as an Indiana state judge and as a member of the Indiana Supreme Court. Lavina Whiteside was born in Indiana, the daughter of Judge George B. Walker, a native of Maryland who had settled in Logansport.
Career.
While in his teens or earlier Walker Whiteside attended acting classes under the tutelage of Professor Samuel Kayzer of the Dramatic Conservatory of Chicago. His ability there to play roles that would appear to be beyond his years soon drew local media attention as the boy tragedian of Chicago. In October, 1884, the not yet sixteen year-old actor hired Alderman Ford, a theatrical agent from Kansas City, and on the 17th of November made his professional stage debut in "Richard III" at Chicago’s Grand Opera House. Walker found the experience both terrifying and exhilarating, but knew immediately he had found his calling.
He spent much of the following decade or so with Shakespearean companies touring primarily America’s Midwest before making his New York premier in April 1893 at the Union Square Theatre, playing Hamlet and Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s Richelieu. By the dawn of the 20th century, and barely into his thirties, Walker had played Hamlet in some 1,400 productions.
In the late 1890s Walker began to swing away from classic production in favor of more contemporary and thus more profitable plays. On the 31st of January, 1901, just fifteen minutes after the final curtain call of Walker’s play "Heart and Sword", the Coates Opera House in Kansas City caught fire and burned to the ground. By the time the fire had spread from the boiler room the building had been evacuated forcing Walker’s company to abandon their theatrical gear to the flames. Later Walker signed with Shipman Brothers in New York performing romantic and classic plays under their banner until he was able to recoup his losses.
Walker’s first Broadway hit was in 1909 playing David opposite Chrystal Herne and John Blair in Israel Zangwill’s "The Melting Pot". The play ran for 268 performances at the Comedy Theatre on West 41st Street, and nearly as long a few years later, when he reprieved his role at the Queen’s Theatre in London.
Walker’s performance as Wu Li Chang in the play "Mr. Wu" was so popular that before the premier of a later play he had his press agent release a statement announcing "Mr. Whiteside wishes it known far and wide that this time he is not acting as a sinister Chinaman, educated at Oxford, who wears poison fingernails." Walker played several Asian characters over his career, some evil, at least one not, that were probably comparable to those portrayed in films made in Hollywood over the first half of the twentieth century. Walker Whiteside also appeared in the film adaptation of "The Melting Pot" in 1915 and three years later in the spy film, "The Belgian".
The remainder of Walker’s career would be a successful combination of performances on the road and on Broadway. During this period his leading lady for seven seasons was New Orleans native Sydney Shields. For whatever reason, Walker had several plays that had popular runs on the road that he never brought to Broadway. Until his retirement in 1935, Walker had a large following among Mid-American audiences who considered him one of their own.
Family.
On October 19, 1893 in Hamilton, Ontario. Walker Whiteside married actress Leila Wolston McCord (professionally known as Leila Wolston)), the daughter of John Thomas McCord founder of the Mississippi River Steamship Line, Two years later the couple became the parents of Leila Rosamond, who would go on to be a vaudeville performer and a singer with the St. Louis Opera Company.
Death.
Walker Whiteside died on the 17th of August, 1942, at his family residence in Hastings-on-Hudson, a village in the town of Greenburgh, New York, just a few miles north of New York City. He never recovered from a stroke suffered three years earlier. Leila Whiteside died a little over year later at Hastings-on-Hudson on January 3, 1944, after a short illness. Leila had, as did her husband, taken to the stage at an early age debuting in the play "Alabama" (1888) at the age of sixteen. She had been a member of Augustine Daly’s stock company for a number of seasons before joining her husband as a co-star in Shakespearean productions throughout much of the 1890s. She retired from the stage after a fifteen-year career.

The 1990 Institute

The 1990 Institute is a U.S. based not-for-profit organisation formed in 1989 dedicated to aiding China by studying and resolving the major economic and social challenges associated with its rapid development. It is an all-volunteer programme and it is staffed by academic, business and community leaders.
History.
The Institute started as a think tank dedicated to the examination of current issues in China and has produced books and issue papers such as China's Economic Reform by Walter Galenson and Fiscal Policy in China - Taxation and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations by Roy W Bahl. In addition, it has sponsored conferences and symposia on various topics such as the reform of state-owned enterprise governance in China and Women, Leadership & Sustainability.
The Institute has since then expanded its range of its activities to become an action-oriented think tank, setting out to improve the educational opportunities for girls, improving cross-cultural communications, microfinance, environmental initiative and school construction.
Activities.
Spring Bud (Dragon Fund).
The programme aims to improve the educational opportunities by providing scholarships to girls in rural villages in Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces over a 13-year period – from 4th grade to college. The team aims to 1,000 out of 280,000 impoverished girls in Shaanxi Province beginning in 2001.
Children, Art and the Environment Project (CAEP).
CAEP promotes friendship and appreciation between the children and teachers in U.S. and China through the universal language of art. The Institute funds the China National Children’s Centre (CNCC) which serves as a clearinghouse for visiting students from the U.S. Another initiative is the Magic Moment Fellowship, which supports and partially funds students from the U.S. to embark on cultural trips to China. It educates and spreads the message of environmental protection among children and youths in both countries too.
The Micro-finance Project.
The Pucheng County Women's Sustainable Development Association (PCWSDA) was formed by the Institute in 2005 to provide access to capital, business education and strategy to poor families so that they could establish or expand micro businesses. To date, it has distributed over 7,700 loans worth more than US$1.9 million. It has achieved a 100 percent loan repayment record and these efforts have increased household income by up to 100 percent and improved their standard of living.

Na Wewe

Na Wewe () is a Belgian live action short film. The film's runtime is approximately 19 minutes, starring Renaud Rutten and Fabrice Kwizera. It was directed by Ivan Goldschmidt, written by first-timer Jean-Luc Pening, and produced by Goldschmidt, Pening, Dries Phlypo and Jean-Claude van Rijckeghem. The film was shot in the summer of 2009. It is set in Burundi in 1994, during the civil war between Hutus and Tutsis and exposes the absurdity of ethnic conflicts. It's a "compact story about identity that's both tense and darkly funny".
Plot.
A minivan transporting ordinary citizens is stopped on a Burundian dirt road. With force a band of Hutu rebels armed with Kalashnikovs get the passengers off. The rebel leader barks:""Hutus to the left, Tutsis to the right!"". The sorting fails as all hurry to the left and neither passengers nor rebels can distinguish Hutus from Tutsis.
Accolades.
The film received the Special Jury Award - Honourable Mention at the 20th Flickerfest.
On January 25, 2011, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.

<doc id="31023441" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31023441" title="Docking and berthing of spacecraft">
Docking and berthing of spacecraft

Spacecraft docking and berthing mechanisms are mechanisms which are used to connect one spacecraft to another spacecraft (including space stations). In the case of berthing mechanisms, a space module without its own propulsion can be a berthing partner.
The connection can be temporary for spacecraft visiting each other, or semipermanent for space station modules.
A docking mechanism is used when one spacecraft actively maneuvers under its own propulsion to connect to another spacecraft.
A berthing mechanism is used when space station modules or spacecraft are attached to one another by using a robotic arm – instead of their own propulsion – for the final few meters of the rendezvous and attachment process. Berthing typically involves connection to a space station.
The currently deployed mechanisms are designed to either support docking or berthing – the upcoming NASA Docking System (NDS) will be the first system designed to support both.
Docking and berthing of manned spacecraft.
Androgyny.
Early systems for conjoining spacecraft were all non-androgynous docking system designs. Non-androgynous designs are a form of "gender mating" where each spacecraft to be joined has a unique design and a specific role to play in the docking process. The roles cannot be reversed. Furthermore, two spacecraft of the same gender cannot be joined at all.
Androgynous docking, and later androgynous berthing, on the other hand has an identical interface design on both spacecraft, allowing system-level redundancy (role reversing) as well as rescue and collaboration between any two spacecraft vehicles. In an androgynous interface, there is a single design which can connect to a duplicate of itself. This results in more flexible mission design and reduces unique mission analysis and training.
Adapters.
A docking or berthing adapter is a mechanical or electromechanical device that facilitates the connection of one type of docking or berthing interface to a different interface. While such interfaces may theoretically be docking/docking, docking/berthing, or berthing/berthing, only the first two types have been deployed in space to date. Previously launched and planned to be launched adapters are listed below.
Docking Module.
The Docking Module converted NASA's "Probe and Drogue" docking system used for Apollo spacecraft to the APAS-75 system used for the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission.
Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA).
The Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) allows spacecraft utilizing the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-95) to dock to the ISS and is semi-permanently attached to an "active" CBM berthing port. There are three PMAs attached to the ISS, with PMA-2 and PMA-3 being available to visiting spacecraft and the PMA-1 adapter being semi-permanently attached to the Functional Cargo Block (Zarya) and Node 1 (Unity), in order to connect the Russian Orbital Segment to the rest of the station.
International Docking Adapter (IDA).
International Docking Adapters (IDA) will be attached to the Pressurized Mating Adapters PMA-2 and PMA-3 and convert their APAS-95 docking interface to the NASA Docking System (NDS). PMA-2 and PMA-3 will be outfitted with IDAs, one in late 2014 and the other in either 2015 or 2016, and with one being attached to Node-2's (Harmony) forward CBM port and the other to its zenith CBM port. The adapter will be compatible with the International Docking System Standard (IDSS), which is an attempt by the ISS Multilateral Coordination Board to create a docking standard.
Docking of unmanned spacecraft.
For the first fifty years of spaceflight, the main objective of most "docking" and "berthing" missions was to transfer crew, construct or resupply a space station, or to test for such a mission (e.g. the docking between Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188).
Therefore commonly at least one of the participating spacecraft was "manned", with a pressurized habitable volume (e.g. a space station or a lunar lander) being the target – the exceptions were a few fully unmanned Soviet docking missions (e.g. the dockings of Kosmos 1443 and Progress 23 to an unmanned Salyut 7 or Progress M1-5 to an unmanned Mir). 
Another exception were a few missions of the manned US Space Shuttles, like berthings of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the five HST servicing missions.
This is changing, as a number of economically driven commercial dockings of unmanned spacecraft are planned starting as soon as 2015. In early 2011, two commercial spacecraft providers have announced plans to provide new autonomous/teleoperated unmanned resupply spacecraft for servicing other unmanned spacecraft. Notably, both of these servicing spacecraft will be intending to dock with satellites that were designed neither for docking, nor for in-space servicing.
The early business model for these services is primarily in near-geosynchronous orbit, although large delta-v orbital maneuvering services are also envisioned.
Building off of the 2007 Orbital Express mission — a U.S. government-sponsored mission to test in-space satellite servicing with two vehicles designed from the ground up for on-orbit refueling and subsystem replacement — two companies have announced new commercial satellite servicing missions that will require docking of two unmanned vehicles.
The SIS and MEV vehicles will each use a different docking technique.
SIS will utilize a ring attachment around the kick motor
while the Mission Extension Vehicle will use a somewhat more standard insert-a-probe-into-the-nozzle-of-the-kick-motor approach.
A prominent spacecraft that received a mechanism for unmanned dockings is the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In 2009 the STS-125 shuttle mission added the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM) at the aft bulkhead of the space telescope. The SCM is meant for unpressurized dockings and will be used at the end of Hubble's service lifetime to dock an unmanned spacecraft to de-orbit Hubble. The SCM used was designed to be compatible to the NASA Docking System (NDS) interface to reserve the possibility of a Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle docked mission. 
The SCM will, compared to the system used during the five HST Servicing Missions to capture and berth the HST to the Space Shuttle, 
significantly reduce the rendezvous and capture design complexities associated with such missions.
The NDS bears some resemblance to the APAS-95 mechanism, but is not compatible with it.
Non-cooperative docking.
Docking with a spacecraft (or other man made space object) that does not have an operable attitude control system might sometimes be desirable, either in order to salvage it, or to initiate a controlled de-orbit. Some theoretical techniques for docking with non-cooperative spacecraft have been proposed so far. Yet, with the sole exception of the Soyuz T-13 mission to salvage the crippled Salyut 7 space station, , all spacecraft dockings in the first fifty years of spaceflight had been accomplished with vehicles where both spacecraft involved were under either piloted, autonomous or telerobotic attitude control.
In 2007, however, a demonstration mission was flown that included an initial test of a non-cooperative spacecraft captured by a controlled spacecraft with the use of a robotic arm.
Salyut 7 space station salvage mission.
Salyut 7, the tenth space station of any kind launched, and Soyuz T-13 were docked in what author David S. F. Portree describes as "one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history". Solar tracking failed and due to a telemetry fault the station did not report the failure to mission control while flying autonomously. Once the station ran out of electrical energy reserves it ceased communication abruptly in February 1985. Crew scheduling was interrupted to allow Russian military commander Vladimir Dzhanibekov and technical science flight engineer Viktor Savinykh to make emergency repairs.
All Soviet and Russian space stations were equipped with automatic rendezvous and docking systems, from the first space station Salyut 1 using the IGLA system, to the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station using the Kurs system. The soyuz crew found the station was not broadcasting radar or telemetry for rendezvous, and after arrival and external inspection of the tumbling station, the crew judged proximity using handheld laser rangefinders.
Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7, matched the station's rotation and achieved soft dock with the station. After achieving hard dock they confirmed that the station's electrical system was dead. Prior to opening the hatch, Dzhanibekov and Savinykh sampled the condition of the station's atmosphere and found it satisfactory. Attired in winter fur-lined clothing, they entered the cold station to conduct repairs. Within a week sufficient systems were brought back online to allow robot cargo ships to dock with the station. Nearly two months went by before atmospheric conditions on the space station were normalized.
Uncrewed dockings of non-cooperative space objects.
Non-cooperative rendezvous and capture techniques have been theorized and, in a few instances,
put into practice with uncrewed spacecraft in orbit.
A typical approach for solving this problem involves two phases. First, attitude and orbital changes are made to the "chaser" spacecraft until it has zero relative motion with the "target" spacecraft. Second, docking maneuvers commence that are similar to traditional cooperative spacecraft docking. A standardized docking interface on each spacecraft is assumed.
NASA has identified automated and autonomous rendezvous and docking — the ability of two spacecraft to rendezvous and dock "operating independently from human controllers and without other back-up, which requires technology advances in sensors, software, and realtime on-orbit positioning and flight control, among other challenges" — as a critical technology to the "ultimate success of capabilities such as in-orbit propellant storage and refueling," and also for complex operations in assembling mission components for interplanetary destinations.
The Automated/Autonomous Rendezvous & Docking Vehicle (ARDV) is a proposed NASA Flagship Technology Demonstration (FTD) mission, for flight as early as 2014/2015. An important NASA objective on the proposed mission is to advance the technology and demonstrate automated rendezvous and docking. One mission element defined in the 2010 analysis was the development of a laser proximity operations sensor that could be used for non-cooperative vehicles at distances between and . Non-cooperative docking mechanisms were identified as critical mission elements to the success of such autonomous missions.
Grappling and connecting to non-cooperative space objects was identified as a top technical challenge in the 2010 NASA Robotics, tele-robotics and autonomous systems roadmap.

Bill Ryusaki

Mutsuto "Bill" Ryusaki is a pioneer of Kenpo in the United States.
Early life.
Bill Ryusaki was born October 14, 1936, in Kamuela, on the big island of Hawaii. Being the sixth child of twelve siblings (seven brothers and four sisters) his father, Torazo Ryusaki, named him Mutsuto meaning "Sixth Child." It wasn't until fourth grade when he received the name, Bill, from his teacher who was unable to pronounce his birth name.
Torazo Ryusaki held black belts in both Kodokan Judo and Shotokan Karate, and made it mandatory that all of his sons train in two styles of Martial Arts. Bill Ryusaki trained in Shotokan Karate and Judo while his brothers trained in Kendo, Aikido, and Judo. Bill's older brothers would often use him as their practice dummy. At 19 years old, Ryusaki went to study at the University of Hawaii. He soon started training in Kenpo privately with Mariano Tiwanak (a famous Hawaiian Boxer).
Military career.
Ryusaki was drafted into the U.S. Army and made his way to the Fort Ord military base in California. He was originally a military range finder, until a high-ranking officer got word of Ryusaki's martial art skills because of a fight that broke out on base. He then became advanced infantry where he taught hand-to-hand combat at Fort Benning, Georgia.
Professional life.
Ryusaki returned to California, where Mariano Tiwanak told him to meet Ed Parker (American Kenpo). Ryusaki and Parker trained together and became pioneers of Kenpo Karate on the mainland of the United States. Parker asked Ryusaki to help with John Leoning and actor Poncie Ponce's dojo. In 1962 Ryusaki opened his own dojo combining his unique style of Judo, Jujitsu, Shotokan, Kenpo, and Aikido to become the founder of Ryu Dojo, Hawaiian Kenpo. He dedicated his school to his father, Torazo, to show his love and appreciation for all that is father had taught him. Ryusaki holds a tenth degree (Ju-Dan) in Hawaiian Kenpo and Kajukenbo, a seventh degree in Judo, as well as black belts in Shotokan and Aikido. Ryusaki has trained thousands of students including Dan Guzman, Otto Schumann and family, Benny "The Jet" and Arnold Urquidez, and Cecil Peoples.
Ryusaki has become successful in the entertainment industry as an actor/ stuntman.
