Ohio State Buckeyes football

The Ohio State Buckeyes football team is a collegiate football team that competes as part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing The Ohio State University in the East Division of the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played their home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio since 1922.
The Buckeyes have claimed seven national championships along with 36 conference championships and ten undefeated seasons.
Football was introduced to the university by George Cole and Alexander S. Lilley in 1890. Ohio State was a football independent from 1890 to 1901 before joining the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) as a charter member in 1902. The Buckeyes won two conference championships while members of the OAC and in 1912 became members of the Big Ten Conference.
Ohio State won their first national championship in 1942 under head coach Paul Brown.
Following World War II, Ohio State saw sparse success on the football field with three separate coaches and in 1951 hired Woody Hayes to coach the team. Under Hayes, Ohio State won 13 Big Ten championships and five national championships (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968 and 1970), and had four Rose Bowl wins in eight appearances. Following Hayes' dismissal in 1978, Earle Bruce and later John Cooper coached the team to seven conference championships.
Jim Tressel was hired as head coach in 2001 and led Ohio State to its seventh national championship in 2002 with a win in the Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State won seven Big Ten championships under Tressel and appeared in eight Bowl Championship Series (BCS) games, winning five of them. Through the 2013 season, Ohio State has compiled an official overall record of 837 wins, 318 losses, and 53 ties and has appeared in 43 bowl games, with the most recent being the 2014 Orange Bowl.
On November 28, 2011, two-time National Championship winning coach and Ohio native Urban Meyer became head coach. Meyer led his team to a pair of Leaders Division Championships in his first two seasons, as well as a school record 24 straight victories, beginning with a perfect 12–0 in 2012.
History.
Beginnings (1890–1933).
In the spring of 1890, George Cole, an undergraduate, persuaded Alexander S. Lilley to coach a football team at the Ohio State University. The Buckeyes first game, played on May 3, 1890, at Delaware, Ohio, against Ohio Wesleyan University, was a victory.
OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. The Ohio State University played the University of Wooster on this site, which was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier) between Ebner and Jaeger in what is now Schumacher Place. The weather was perfect, and the crowd cheered loudly. Nonetheless, OSU lost to Wooster, 64–0. Wooster, physically fit for the game, showed OSU that training is critical to winning. Thus, the tradition of training continues.
Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34–0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1–7–1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.
In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated. In 1901, however, center John Segrist was fatally injured in a game and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned. In 1912 football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director.
Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7–0. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game—to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.
Ohio State's very first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 18–6, OSU.
Francis Schmidt (1934–40).
In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a "big-time" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a "wide-open" style called "razzle-dazzle" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7–1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18–13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons. On December 17, 1940, he resigned.
Paul Brown (1941–43).
Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship.
Carroll Widdoes (1944–45), Paul Bixler (1946) and Wes Fesler (1947–50).
Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942–44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis.
Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4–3–2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a "graveyard of coaches" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.
Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the "Snow Bowl". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.
Woody Hayes era (1951–78).
Wayne Woodrow "Woody" Hayes beat out Paul Brown, among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6–3, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.
In 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard "Hopalong" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as "three yards and a cloud of dust".
In a 1955 article in "Sports Illustrated", Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players. The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth "Tug" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and share a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year.
In 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a "football school" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate. Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953.
In 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the "super sophomores" in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset.
The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as "The Ten Year War," in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU’s and UM’s strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary. Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10–7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971.
Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention.
Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: "1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 — 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__" as a constant reminder of their objective. The "super sophomores", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a "first" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20–9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27–17. The "super sophomores" had garnered a record of 27–2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State its national champion for 1970.
1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867.
The following season Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and equally impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies, but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition.
1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's 4-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year the #1-ranked Bucks lost 23–10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all the Buckeyes were 40–5–1 from 1972–75, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship. Archie Griffin, however, received the Heisman Trophy for both years, off-setting much of the frustration, and amassed 5,589 yards in his career.
The falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9–2–1, 9–3, and 7–4–1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally-televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win. Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.
Earle Bruce (1979–87).
Hayes was replaced by a former protégé, Earle Bruce. Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost eleven starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17–16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a "new era".
1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9–3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9–3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10–3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers.
The 1980 team was selected as the top-ranked team of the pre-season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home, but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA, shut out 17–0. The team rebounded to win its next six easily, but then were shut down by a ball-control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball, then lost again to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl.
In 1981, Ohio State opened strong, including a victory at Stanford in which senior Art Schlichter out-dueled John Elway, but then lost back-to-back games to Florida State and Wisconsin (their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games). The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense, losing a third time, at Minnesota. Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over Navy in the Liberty Bowl salvaged the season.
For the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called "the greatest comeback after the worst start" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24–0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45–38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting.
Byars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4–1 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22–13.
In 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31–10, in a game that came to be known as the "darkest day", and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game.
On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since. The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word "EARLE", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl.
John Cooper (1988–2000).
John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University. Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.
Cooper's thirteen years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6–7 record overall, and blowing a 15 point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.
Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: an impressive season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4–6–1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8–4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31–0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41–37.
1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7–4–1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 9–4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, was 8–3–1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13–13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.
The next 6 seasons were very successful, winning ten or more games in 5 of the 6 and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan.
After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the "million dollar coaching club", Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally-televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6–6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8–4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.
In January 2001, the Ohio State University dismissed Cooper. His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win "big games", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.
Jim Tressel (2001–10).
Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel. With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.
Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7–5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship. Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as "Tresselball", and disparaged by detractors as "the Luckeyes". The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26–17. This ended a 3 game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 National Championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team.
In December 2010 it was announced that five student-athletes on the Ohio State University football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the University, such as Big Ten championship rings.
On January 4, 2011, Ohio State completed its season with a 31–26 win over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl. The Sugar Bowl win would have marked Ohio State's first bowl victory over a Southeastern Conference opponent in ten attempts, but the win was later vacated due to NCAA violations. Ohio State ended up with an 0–1 record for the 2010 season after vacating its wins for NCAA violations.
"Tattoogate".
On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan "Boom" Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university. In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31–26. The win along with every other one from the 2010 season would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 0–1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin.
On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011 Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.
On June 6, 2011, a story in "Sports Illustrated" reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1 – unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.
Luke Fickell (2011).
On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations. Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and won't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status is also changed from 'Resigned' to "Retired" in keeping with his wishes to "remain a Buckeye for life." Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6–7 record; going 6–6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida.
Urban Meyer (2012–present).
On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach. Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl, The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds were forfeited as well.
In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12–0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.
The Buckeyes played their 2013 Spring game at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati, home of the Bengals on April 13, 2013. The Scarlet won 31–14.
On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42–14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42–41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34–24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big 10 Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40–35.
Traditions.
Ohio State football is rich in traditions. The following are football traditions in chronological order of longevity:
Begun in 1913 by head coach John Wilce, seniors on the team are recognized at the last practice of the season, either before the Michigan game or before departing Columbus to play in a bowl game, and hit the blocking sled a final time.
The winner of the Ohio State-Illinois game has been awarded the Illibuck trophy since 1925. Until 1927 the teams played for a live turtle, however, since the 1928 season the trophy is a carved wooden likeness of a turtle.
A gold miniature charm depicting a pair of football pants is given to all players and coaches following a victory over the Michigan Wolverines. The tradition began as the result of a comment to reporters by newly hired head coach Francis Schmidt on March 2, 1934: "How about Michigan? They put their pants on one leg at a time, the same as we do!" The first gold pants, which were a creation of Simon Lazarus (president of the Lazarus chain of department stores) and Herbert Levy, were awarded that year for a 34–0 defeat of the Wolverines.
1934 also saw the first gathering of former team captains for breakfast on the Sunday following the Homecoming game. The event began when local businessman Walter Jeffrey invited twenty former captains to the Scioto Country Club to honor them, and continues to welcome new captains and award them mugs bearing their names and season.
Begun in 1934, each player who wins "first-team All-America" honors is recognized by the planting of a buckeye tree and installation of a plaque in Buckeye Grove, now located near the southwestern corner of Ohio Stadium next to Morrill Tower. Trees are planted in ceremonies held prior to the Spring Game. All 126 Buckeye All-Americans dating back to 1914 have been so honored.
Since 1935 the annual game against Michigan has been the final meeting of the regular season for both teams. The week prior to "The Game", known as Michigan Week, is characterized by scheduled school spirit and public service events, such as rallies, touch football games, and blood drives; and by massive displays of school colors and banners in much of Ohio. In an unofficial culmination to Michigan Week, since 1990 on the Thursday night before "The Game" students have participated in the "Mirror Lake jump", an unofficial gathering at Mirror Lake, a pond between Pomerene Hall and The Oval, in which masses of students jump into the water.
Since 1938 the registered student organization Block O has been the "Official Cheering Section" of the Buckeyes. ""Known for spreading spirit, starting cheers and performing card stunts, Block 'O' was founded...by Clancy Isaac "." They occupy Section 39A in the South grandstand of Ohio Stadium, next to the band.
The Victory Bell is rung after every Ohio State victory by members of Alpha Phi Omega, a tradition that began after the Bucks beat California October 2, 1954. Reputedly the ringing can be heard five miles away "on a calm day." Located 150 feet high in the southeast tower of Ohio Stadium, the bell was a gift of the classes of 1943, 1944 and 1945, and weighs 2,420 pounds. The bell is rung for 15 minutes following a victory and for 30 minutes following a victory over Michigan.
Beginning in 1965, Brutus Buckeye has appeared at all Ohio State football games as the live mascot of the Buckeyes. In 2007 he was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame and is now one of the most recognized mascots in the United States.
First played at the Illinois game of October 9, 1965, the rock song "Hang on Sloopy" is now played by the marching band before the start of the fourth quarter, with fans performing an O-H-I-O chant in the intervals between the refrains. The song is also played to encourage the team's defensive players when opponents are moving the ball on offense late in a game. The 116th Ohio General Assembly designated "Hang On Sloopy" as the State rock song by House Concurrent Resolution 16 on November 20, 1985. It is also played before the fourth quarter at Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals games, as well as during Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Columbus Blue Jackets games.
Since 1967, the helmets of Ohio State players have been adorned with white decals approximately the size of a quarter depicting a buckeye leaf, awarded for making significant plays and for consistency of performance. In the 1970s, the decals were approximately the size of a Silver Dollar until the 1979 Season. Most believe that this practice began in 1968 when The Buckeyes switched to their present Silver Helmet design since the decals have become identified with that helmet.
Before the Ohio State/Michigan game at the end of the season, OSU students typically jump into Mirror Lake, located on campus, the Thursday night before the game. The tradition is thought to bring good luck to the football team the following gameday.
The Tunnel of Pride began with the 1994 Michigan game when all former players who were in attendance formed a tunnel through which the team ran to take the field, and Ohio State beat its rival that day, 22–6. Rex Kern, quarterback of the 1968 National Championship team, and then Director of Athletics Andy Geiger together used the concept as a means of connecting current Buckeyes with those who played before them. The Tunnel of Pride was next formed for the 1995 Notre Dame game, which the Buckeyes also won. In each home game against Michigan since, the tradition has been repeated.
Instituted by Coach Tressel in 2001, at the conclusion of all home games the coaches, players and cheerleaders gather in the south end zone next to the marching band to sing the university's alma mater, "Carmen Ohio", to the student section.
Tressel brought to the Buckeye football program two pre-game traditions he developed at Youngstown State. Prior to its warmup routine before every football game, the team exits the locker room as a unit in a controlled manner, linked arm-in-arm in a group known as "The Hive". After warmups the team returns to the locker room, and when it next appears, runs onto the field and forms a circle of players around the strength coach, then they go through their warmup routine.
Marching band.
The Marching Band, often referred to as "The Best Damn Band In The Land" or by the acronym TBDBITL is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football. Home games are preceded by three much-anticipated traditions, and a fourth, "dotting the 'i'" of Script Ohio, enjoys a reputation all its own:
Rivalries.
While its rivalry with the University of Michigan is its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both Big Ten Conference rivals, those of Indiana and Illinois. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4–0–1. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 69–8–4 through the 2013 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0–1–1) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year (That record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2013 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 65–30–4. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.
When Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival Northwestern and neighboring Indiana, and in doing so undermined Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.
With Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013. Michigan was the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.
With the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten, Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year. Ohio State and Michigan will also become division rivals in the East Division.
Coaches.
The Buckeyes have had 24 coaches in their 121-year history. Woody Hayes is the coach who has won the most national championships at five. Paul Brown and Jim Tressel also each have one for seven total.

Conference championships.
Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1913; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 34 times, second most in the conference and third most conference titles of any school in any conference.

2003 LSU Tigers football team

The 2003 LSU Tigers football team represented Louisiana State University in the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season. Coached by Nick Saban, the Tigers played their home games at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After a bit of controversy, LSU won the BCS National Championship, the first national championship for LSU since 1958. The Tigers battled for an 11–1 regular season record and then defeated Georgia in the SEC Championship Game to support their bid in the Sugar Bowl to play Oklahoma for the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) national title.
The regular season ended with three one-loss teams in BCS contention: Oklahoma, LSU, and USC. USC ended the regular season ranked No. 1 and LSU No. 2 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Controversy erupted when the BCS computers selected Oklahoma-LSU as the BCS title game; leading to protests from USC supporters. During the bowl games, USC had a 28–14 win over No. 4 Michigan in the Rose Bowl while LSU beat Oklahoma 21–14 in the Sugar Bowl (designated the BCS title game by the computers). USC remained No. 1 in the final AP Poll and LSU was ranked No. 1 in the final Coaches' Poll.

Gabrielle (2005 film)

Gabrielle is a 2005 French film directed by Patrice Chéreau. It is a screen adaptation of Joseph Conrad's short story "The Return".
Plot.
Jean Harvey and his wife Gabrielle are renowned within Paris' haute bourgeoisie for the salons they host each Thursday evening.
Jean and Gabrielle live a comfortable yet regimented life in a well-appointed Paris mansion, assisted by a retinue of devoted servants. Yet their marriage is more of a contract than a relationship. Jean confides to the audience that he loves Gabrielle "as a collector loves his most prized object."
On their 10th anniversary, Jean comes home to find a note from Gabrielle in which she writes that within the hour she will have left to meet her lover.
Jean spends several minutes digesting the meaning of the note. Gabrielle returns shortly, though, and Jean and Gabrielle reflect on their marriage for the remainder of the film.
Notes.
"Gabrielle" opened in the United States on July 14, 2006 at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and the IFC Center in Manhattan. It was also available that weekend to many home cable subscribers throughout the U.S. via video on demand through IFC.

Episcopal Church of Cuba

The Episcopal Church of Cuba (Spanish: "Iglesia Episcopal de Cuba") traces its origins to the foundation of an Anglican presence on the island of Cuba in 1901. It consists of forty-six parishes, and about 10,000 members. It is a part of the Anglican Communion though part of no ecclesiastical province, having the status of an extra-provincial diocese within the Anglican Communion. As it is not part of a larger province it has no primate. Its governance includes a Metropolitan Council which exercises oversight "in matters of Faith and Order." The Metropolitan Council is chaired by the Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada (currently Fred Hiltz), the Archbishop of the Church in the Province of the West Indies (currently John Walder Dunlop Holder), and the Presiding Bishop of the United States of America (currently Katharine Jefferts Schori).
Internal divisions led to a long period of instability within the Iglesia Episcopal de Cuba, which found itself unable to elect a bishop of its own for many years. The Bishop of Uruguay in the Iglesia Anglicana del Cono Sur de las Americas, the Right Revd Miguel Tamayo Zaldívar, served for many years as interim Bishop of Cuba until his retirement in November 2010. Bishop Tamayo Zaldívar is a native Cuban who moved to Uruguay to serve as a missionary.
Following a number of attempts at resolution of the problem, the Metropolitan Council, in February 2007, appointed Canon Nerva Cot Aguilera and Ulises Mario Aguero Prendes as suffragan bishops of the Iglesia Episcopal de Cuba to carry out pastoral oversight under the direction of Bishop Tamayo Zaldívar. They were consecrated on June 10, 2007. Bishop Cot Aguilera was the first woman to be appointed an Anglican bishop in Latin America. After a short retirement, Bishop Cot Aguilera died suddenly on July 10, 2010 after a brief battle with severe anemia. She was 71.
Bishop Tamayo Zaldívar worked industriously to heal divisions within the diocese, but repeated attempts to elect his successor ultimately failed. Following Bishop Tamayo Zaldívar's announcement in 2009 of his wish to retire, and a further inconclusive election, the responsibility for an appointment fell again to the Metropolitan Council, which in January 2010 appointed the Right Revd Griselda Delgado Del Carpio as bishop coadjutor (assistant bishop with the right of succession). She was ordained to the episcopate on February 7, 2010 and installed as diocesan on November 28, 2010.

<doc id="6000256" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000256" title="Charlton-on-Otmoor">
Charlton-on-Otmoor

Charlton-on-Otmoor is a village and civil parish about south of Bicester in Oxfordshire, England. The village is close to the River Ray on the northern edge of Otmoor.
Church and chapels.
Church of England.
Charlton had a parish church by the 11th century. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was a 13th-century Early English Gothic building but received substantial Decorated Gothic alterations in the 14th century. The east window is slightly later, in the transitional style from Decorated to Perpendicular Gothic. Around the beginning of the 16th century the clerestory and new roof were added to the nave and a new window was added to the south aisle.
In the early 16th century the present rood screen and rood loft (for a crucifix between the chancel and nave) were added to the church. During the English Reformation Edward VI's injunctions of 1547 instructed that rood screens and lofts be removed from all churches in England and Wales. Charlton's screen and loft survived these injunctions, and in the 20th century the critic Jennifer Sherwood judged them "the finest and most complete in the county". A tradition of garlanding the rood cross with flowers and box greenery on May Day and carrying it in procession around the parish also survived the Reformation and continues in modern times.
In 1846 the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street re-roofed the church and restored the north wall. In 1889 the rood screen and loft were restored. St. Mary's has never been over-restored, and its Decorated and Perpendicular mediaeval character has survived almost intact.
By 1553 the bell tower had five bells plus a Sanctus bell, but all have since been recast or replaced. Richard Keene, whose foundries included one at Woodstock, cast the two largest bells in 1681. Thomas Lester of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast another bell in 1746 and Matthew II Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast another in 1755. The then treble bell broke in 1789 but John Warner and Sons of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast it that same year. In the 19th century the Bagley bell survived for a long time with a fracture, but in 1895 its tongue and head fell out. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry replaced or recast the broken bell in 1898. In 1998 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble bell, making the 1789 bell the second bell and increasing the tower to a ring of six bells. In 1999 the new bell was hung and the old bells re-hung as a project for the village to celebrate the Millennium. John Warner and Sons cast the present Sanctus bell in 1793.
St. Mary's church clock is of unknown date but appears to be late 17th century. Two of the wheels of the going train are characteristic of the work of the clockmaker and bellfounder Edward Hemins of Bicester, which would make them an early-18th-century alteration.
St. Mary's is now part of the Church of England Benefice of the Ray Valley.
Baptist and Methodist chapels.
Charlton had a Baptist meeting house by 1810 and a new Baptist chapel in 1835. The village had a Methodist congregation by 1829 which built a new chapel in 1840. The Methodist chapel had ceased to be used by the end of the 19th century and was sold to the Church of England Rector in 1920 who converted it into a club room.
Amenities.
Charlton has one public house, The Crown. There was formerly another pub, the George and Dragon, a 17th-century house at the eastern end of the village. This was where locals formed the Otmoor Association in 1830, leading to the Otmoor Riots in opposition to plans to drain and enclose Otmoor. The rioters achieved their objective, and the villagers continued to farm a four-field open field system. A subsequent attempt at enclosure in 1858 was successful.
The enclosure of 1858 set aside land for the building of Charlton Parochial School, which opened in 1866. The number of pupils grew and a second classroom was added in 1892. It was reorganised as a junior school in 1937 and became a voluntary controlled school in 1951. It is now Charlton-on-Otmoor Church of England Primary School.
Otmoor Women's Institute meets in Charlton-on-Otmoor. Charlton United F.C. plays in Oxfordshire Senior Football League Division One.
Transport.
The Buckinghamshire Railway between and passes through the parish and was completed in 1851. The London and North Western Railway took it over in 1879 and opened , north of the village, in 1905. The 1923 Grouping made the L&NWR part of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which closed Charlton Halt in 1926. The part of the line between Oxford and Bicester is now the Bicester Link. The line's nearest station to Charlton is now , away.
A local bus and coach company, Charlton Services, is based in the village. Two of its routes serve Charlton:

Gordon Rugg

Gordon Rugg was born in Perth, Scotland in 1955. He has a first degree in French and Linguistics and a PhD in Psychology, both from Reading University, UK. His background includes working as a timberyard worker, a field archaeologist and an English lecturer. He became the focus of media attention in 2004 for his work on the Voynich Manuscript.
He is co-author with Marian Petre of two books for students which focus on semi-tacit skills in research. He is head of the Knowledge Modelling Group at Keele University and a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Open University.
Research.
His main research theme is elicitation methods – techniques for eliciting information from people, for purposes such as market research and requirements gathering for software development. His main work in this field includes the following.
A series of co-authored papers on card sorts.
A series of co-authored papers on laddering, including one which integrates laddering with graph theory.
A paper co-authored with Neil Maiden, describing a framework for choosing the appropriate methods to elicit various types of semi-tacit and tacit knowledge.
This work formed one main strand in the Verifier method which he developed with Joanne Hyde. This is a method for critically re-assessing previous research into difficult problems. The initial stage uses a range of elicitation methods to gain an accurate picture of the assumptions and normal working practices used in the previous work. The next stage uses a knowledge of experts’ behaviour and a range of error taxonomies to identify the places where human error is most likely to have occurred. The final stage uses various formalisms to assess whether or not an error actually has occurred. There is no guarantee that this method will catch every error – it is not a method for proving the correctness of a piece of previous work – but it improves the chances of finding key errors.
Rugg’s other work is multidisciplinary, including theoretical archaeology and teaching methods.
Voynich manuscript.
Rugg used an informal version of the Verifier method to re-assess previous work on the Voynich Manuscript, a manuscript widely believed to be a ciphertext based on a code which had resisted decipherment since the manuscript’s rediscovery by Voynich in 1912. Previous research had concluded that the manuscript contained linguistic features too complex to be readily explicable as a hoax, and too strange to be explicable as a transliteration of an unidentified language, leaving an uncracked cipher as the only realistic explanation.
Rugg suggested that these assessments of complexity were not based on empirical evidence. He examined a range of techniques known in the late sixteenth century, and found that, by using a modified Cardan grille combined with a large table of meaningless syllables, it was possible to produce meaningless text that had qualititive and statistical properties similar to those of "Voynichese". Rugg replicated the drawings from a range of pages in the manuscript, accompanying each with the same quantity of text as found in the original page, and discovered that most pages could be reproduced in one to two hours, as fast as they could be transcribed. This suggested that a meaningless hoax manuscript as long and as apparently linguistically complex as the Voynich manuscript could be produced, complete with coloured illustrations, by a single person in between 250 and 500 hours.
However, there is debate about the features of the manuscript which Rugg's suggested method was not able to emulate. The two main features are lines showing different linguistic features from the bulk of the manuscript, such as the Neal keys, and the statistical properties of the text produced. Rugg argues that these linguistic features are trivially easy to hoax using the same approach with a different set of tables, and would add about five minutes to the time to produce each page; the counter-argument is that this makes the hoax too complex to be plausible. Regarding statistics, Rugg points out that text produced from the same set of initial nonsense syllables but using different table structures shows widely different statistical properties. Since there are tens of thousands of permutations of table design, he argues that it would simply be a question of time to find a design which produced the same statistical properties as “Voynichese”. Whether or not this would prove anything useful is another issue, since it could either be used to support Rugg’s argument, or dismissed as coincidence.
Further counterarguments are:
The debate continues.

<doc id="6000269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000269" title="Khamudi">
Khamudi

Khamudi (also known as Khamudy) was the last Hyksos ruler of the Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Khamudi came to power in 1534 BC or 1541 BC, ruling the northern portion of Egypt from his capital Avaris. His ultimate defeat at the hands of Ahmose I, after a short reign, marks the end of the Second Intermediate Period.
__FORCETOC__
Attestations.
Khamudi is listed on the Turin canon, column 10, line 28 (Gardiner entry 10.20) as the last Hyksos king. Beyond this, only two scarab seals are firmly attributed to him, both from Jericho.
Additionally, a cylinder seal of unknown provenance but possibly from Byblos is inscribed with a cartouche which may read "Khamudi". This reading is contested by the egyptologist Kim Ryholt who proposed that the cartouche reads "Kandy" instead and refers to an hitherto unknown king. In any case, even if the cartouche bears Khamudi's name, it is believed to have been inscribed on the seal simply to fill up space rather than a explicit reference to Khamudi. The seal is currently housed in the Petrie Museum, catalog number UC 11616.
Reign Length.
Based on the scarcity of material dating to Khamudi's reign, Ryholt has proposed that his reign must have been short, amounting to no more than a year. In this situation, Khamudi would have inherited little more than the Hyksos throne, being possibly already besieged in Sharuhen, the last Hyksos stronghold in the Negev Desert.
This is contested by other scholars, such as Manfred Bietak, who points to a "year 11" of an unknown king on the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.
Bietak and many egyptologists believe that this year 11 belongs to Khamudi since the text of the papyrus refers to Ahmose I, founder of the Egyptian New Kingdom as "He of the South." As Thomas Schneider writes:
Another date on the papyrus is explicitly dated to Year 33 of Khamudi's predecessor Apepi. It is generally believed that Ahmose I defeated the Hyksos king by his 18th or 19th regnal year. This is suggested by "a graffito in the quarry at Tura whereby 'oxen from Canaan' were used at the opening of the quarry in Ahmose's regnal year 22." Since the cattle could only have been brought after Ahmose's 3 to 6 years long siege of the South Canaanite town of Sharuhen which followed after the fall of Avaris, this means the reign of Khamudi must have terminated by Year 18 or 19 of Ahmose's 25 year reign at the very latest.

<doc id="6000274" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000274" title="En svensk tiger">
En svensk tiger

En svensk tiger was a slogan and an image that became part of a propaganda campaign in Sweden during World War II, aiming to prevent espionage by encouraging secrecy.
Explanation.
In Swedish, "svensk" can mean both the adjective "Swedish" and the noun "Swede" while "tiger" can mean either the noun for the animal or the present tense of the verb "tiga" ("to keep silent"), giving the poster the double meaning "a Swedish tiger" or "a Swede keeps silent". The phrase is comparable in use to "loose lips sink ships" in the United States.
Commission and use.
The famous poster for the propaganda campaign was created by Bertil Almqvist in 1941, commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Information (, "SIS"). The poster became the main slogan of the "Vaksamhetskampanjen" (Swedish Vigilance Campaign) that was started in the same year to encourage secrecy about information that may damage Swedish military defence.
Legal battle.
Upon Almqvist's death in 1972, the copyright of the poster/logo was transferred to the Beredskapsmuseet (Military Preparedness Museum). After eleven years of legal battle, the Swedish Armed Forces, who had been using the image without permission, paid SEK 400 000 in damages to the copyright owners in 2008.

Tony Hrkac

Anthony John Hrkac (; born July 7, 1966) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey player of Croatian and Ukrainian ancestry. who played eighteen season of professional hockey.
Playing career.
College.
Hrkac was drafted in the second round, 32nd overall, by the St. Louis Blues in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Hrkac played collegiately at the University of North Dakota, and was the recipient of the Hobey Baker Award for top men's collegiate hockey player during the 1986–87 season. He led the team—widely known during this period as the "Hrkac Circus" (the name rhymes) — to a national championship and his 116 points that season still stands as the NCAA single-season scoring mark.
National Hockey League.
He made his National Hockey League debut with the Blues during the 1987 NHL playoffs, appearing in three games. After two-plus seasons with the Blues, he was traded (along with Greg Millen) to the Quebec Nordiques in exchange for Jeff Brown.
In his NHL career, Hrkac would play for the Blues, Nordiques, San Jose Sharks, Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and Atlanta Thrashers. Hrkac's rights were also briefly owned by the Pittsburgh Penguins when they acquired him and Bobby Dollas from the Edmonton Oilers for forward Josef Beranek. On June 26, ten days after initially acquiring Hrkac, the Penguins lost Hrkac to the Nashville Predators in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft. Less than two weeks later, Hrkac was moved once again; this time to the Dallas Stars. He was traded on July 9, 1998 for future considerations.
In 758 career NHL games, Hrkac scored 132 goals and added 239 assists. He also appeared in 41 playoff games, scoring seven goals and adding seven assists. Four of those seven goals came in one game against the Chicago Blackhawks on April 10, 1988, setting a St. Louis Blues record for most goals scored in a playoff game by one player. Hrkac was a member of the 1998–99 Dallas Stars team which won the Stanley Cup.
American Hockey League.
Hrkac returned to the minor leagues in 2003 after he was unable to sign with an NHL club. He was a key player on the Calder Cup champion Milwaukee Admirals in 2003–04. While there were rumors that the St. Louis Blues were seeking to sign him for one last stint with his original team, Hrkac retired after the 2004–05 season.
Hrkac came out of retirement for the 2008–09 season, at the age of 42, by signing with the AHL's Houston Aeros on March 11, 2009.
Coaching career.
On September 19, 2006, Concordia University officials announced that the university added Division III men’s and women’s hockey to its sports line-up for the 2007–2008 school year. Tony Hrkac was named the first men’s hockey coach in Concordia history serving as coach until February, 2012, with a coaching record of 10-109-10 while at Concordia.

San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics

San Francisco was one of the cities vying to be the official United States bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Like the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, San Francisco and the entire San Francisco Bay Area in California touted a compact but regional-participatory focus for its bid, expressing an interest in developing planning partnerships with a large number of neighboring large cities. Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom announced the bid on September 12, 2005. After failure to secure a venue for use as the main stadium, the bid was withdrawn on November 13, 2006. 
San Francisco also bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but came in second place to New York City during the national bidding process, making the 2016 bid their second unsuccessful bid for the Summer Olympics. The San Francisco 2012 bid organizers offered a concept called the "Ring of Gold" which took advantage of existing athletic venues from as far as Sacramento but revolved around four compact clusters near public transportation hubs: San Francisco; Palo Alto; San Jose and Santa Clara; Oakland and Berkeley. 
Newsom announced on July 11, 2006 that the new bid would be centered around a proposed new San Francisco 49ers stadium in the property on which Candlestick Park stands today. At the same time, he stated that the Olympic Village would be constructed at Hunters Point and that it would be converted into affordable housing following the games. This new Olympic stadium would be necessary as Stanford Stadium, the originally planned venue for athletics and the ceremonies for the 2012 bid, has been replaced by a smaller football stadium.
Bid history.
On July 26, 2006, the USOC officially named San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago as the three US finalists for the 2016 Olympics, dropping Philadelphia and Houston.
On September 22, 2006, San Francisco submitted a report responding to the USOC questionnaire that was distributed to the remaining three U.S. candidate cities. On the same day, San Francisco 2016 issued a press release announcing the design of a new stadium for both the 49ers and the Olympics/Paralympics. The design involves conversion of the football stadium to one including a 400 meter track by elevating the playing field, and also includes provision for expanded seating capacity for events such as the Olympics and Super Bowl. 
On November 9, 2006, the San Francisco 49ers ended negotiations with the city of San Francisco for the development of a new football stadium that would also be used as the centerpiece of the 2016 Olympics. The 49ers would eventually move to nearby city Santa Clara. Bid organizers would have had to create a new plan for a central stadium if the 49ers relocated.
Termination of bid.
On November 13, 2006, San Francisco withdrew its bid from the national selection process. Scott Givens, speaking for the bid committee, cited a "damaged reputation" due to failed negotiations surrounding the 49ers' stadium.
Ultimately, Chicago was elected by the USOC to be the U.S. bid city for 2016. Chicago lost their bid to Rio de Janeiro when the IOC voted to select the host city.

Amr ibn al-Layth

Amr ibn al-Layth or Amr-i Laith Saffari () was the second ruler of the Saffarid dynasty of Iran from 879 to 901. He was the son of a whitesmith and the younger brother of the dynasty's founder, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar.
Biography.
Said to have started as a mule-driver and a mason, he later fought alongside his older brother and in 875 became governor of Herat. When Ya'qub died in Fars in 879, Amr managed to become the successor of the Saffarid throne over his brother Ali ibn al-Layth, who was the preferred choice of both Ya'qub and the army. After Amr's accession, he made peace with the Abbasids. The Caliph was forced to acknowledge the reality of the Saffarids' domination, and reached a "modus vivendi" with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan.
In 884, the Bavandid ruler Rustam I, after being repelled from Mazandaran by the Zaydi ruler Muhammad ibn Zayd, arrived to the court of Amr, and requested his aid to reclaim the Bavand throne. With the aid of Amr, Rustam was allowed to return to his domains in Mazandaran. In 897 Rayy was handed over to the Saffarids by the Abbasids, who could not manage to hold over the city against Zaydi invasions.
The Abbasid–Saffarid partnership in Iran was most clearly expressed against the intrepid general Rafi ibn Harthama, who had made his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid interests in the region. The Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi, who fled and made common cause with the Zaydis of Tabaristan in an effort to conquer Khurasan from the Saffarids. With Amr mobilizing anti-Alid sentiment against him and the expected assistance from the Zaydis failing to materialize, Rafu was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896. Amr, at the pinnacle of his power, sent the defeated rebel's head to Baghdad, and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him.
Death.
The partnership finally collapsed after Mu'tadid appointed the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al-Layth as governor of Transoxiana in 898, which was ruled by his rivals, the Samanids. Al-Mu'tamid encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids, but in the event, Amr was crushingly defeated and taken prisoner in 900. The Samanid ruler, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, sent him in chains to Baghdad, where he was executed in 902, after al-Mu'tadid's death. Al-Mu'tadid in turn conferred Amr's titles to Isma'il ibn Ahmad, but the Saffarid remnant under Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the caliphal attempts at regaining Fars and Kirman for several more years. It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province.

Cresson Kearny

Cresson Henry Kearny (; — ) wrote several survival related books based primarily on research performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Career.
Kearny attended Texas Military Institute in the 1930s, where he became the commanding officer of the cadet corps, a champion runner and rifle shot, and valedictorian of his class. He attended Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania before earning a degree in civil engineering at Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude in 1937. He won a Rhodes Scholarship and went on to earn two degrees in geology at the University of Oxford. During the Sudeten Crisis he acted as a courier for an underground group helping anti-Nazis escape from Czechoslovakia.
Following graduation from Oxford, Kearny joined a Royal Geographic Society expedition in the Peruvian Andes. He then worked as an exploration geologist for Standard Oil in the Orinoco jungles of Venezuela, where he became familiar with equipment and tools of the native inhabitants of the region. He later used the information gained from this experience to develop specialized jungle equipment for U.S. military forces.
In 1940, Kearny went on active duty as an infantry reserve lieutenant in the United States Army. Recognized for his knowledge of jungle travel and use of specialized tools and equipment, Kearny was soon assigned to Panama as the Jungle Experiments Officer of the Panama Mobile Force, and was promoted to captain. In that capacity he was able to invent, improve, and/or field test much of the specialized jungle equipment and rations used by U.S. infantrymen in World War II. Adoption of the jungle field ration and the jungle hammock as standard equipment by the US Army in World War II is credited to Kearny, along with improvements to many other items of tropical gear, such as the Panama-soled jungle boot and the M1942 Machete. In recognition of his service, he was soon promoted to major and awarded the Legion of Merit.
In 1943, he married May Willacy Eskridge of San Antonio.
Kearny later volunteered for duty with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), where he served as a demolition specialist in southern China in 1944. As Japanese forces threatened to overwhelm Chinese defenses in southeast China, he walked night and day to escape capture. After contracting a serious viral disease during that campaign, he was bedridden for many months and partially crippled for several years. After a long convalescence, he retired from active duty with the U.S. Army.
In 1961 he took a position doing civil defense research with the Hudson Institute. In 1964 he joined the Oak Ridge National Laboratory civil defense project. During the Vietnam War, Kearny served as a civilian advisor to the U.S. Army, making several trips to the theater of operations. He died in 2003.
In a "New York Times" obituary, his daughter Stephanie commented: "Throughout his life he believed in being prepared for trouble."
Published work.
Kearny's most notable work is "Nuclear War Survival Skills" (NWSS). It describes civil defense research to determine the methods for ordinary citizens to build effective expedient shelters in a short period of time. It includes "MacGyver-like" plans for the Kearny Air Pump (KAP), Kearny Fallout Meter (KFM) and blast doors designed to be published in a newspaper prior to an attack. This book is in the public domain and is available for purchase, as well as free download online, from the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine.
His other works include "Jungle Snafus ... and Remedies", a book on the history of development of specialized equipment for use by military forces in jungle regions, and "Will Civil Defense Work?"

Seldom Disappointed

Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir is the 2001 autobiography of author Tony Hillerman. The title reflects the attitude that he learned as a child living on a farm in Oklahoma; if one learns not to have unrealistic expectations, one will often be pleasantly surprised and seldom disappointed.
Reception.
The work was well received, with the "New York Times Book Review" stating that Hillerman "is an expert at knowing what to leave out, and at making what he leaves in cut to the bone without seeming overwrought", and further that the prose is "laced with humor and worldly wisdom"; stating that ""Seldom Disappointed" is a splendid and disarming remembrance of things past". It was also well reviewed by David Langness, for Paste magazine, who called the book "touching", "modest" and "powerful"; stating that ""Seldom Disappointed" unfolds with the quiet country cadences of the storytellers that consistently suffuse Hillerman's prose" and praising its "hilarious, perverse black humor".

Faredoon Nawrosjee Driver, better known as Padri, (November 27, 1903 - March 13, 1982) was born in Pune, India and was one of Meher Baba's close mandali (devoted disciples). He lived with and served Meher Baba from 1922 until Meher Baba's death in 1969, beginning his stay with Baba in Baba's first ashram, Manzil-e-Meem. Later, after moving his ashram to Ahmednagar district, Meher Baba called Padri one of the four "pillars" of Meherabad. (Meherabad was Meher Baba's second ashram and is today the site of Baba's samadhi shrine). Padri, who was originally a garage mechanic, later became a doctor of homeopathy treating local villagers near Meherabad.
Meher Baba nicknamed Faredoon "Padri" because of his lanky, priestlike stature. Padri emphasized obedience to the master and had little patience for ostentatious sentimentality, famously quoted as saying, "Love is for the saints and the masts, not for the likes of us!"
Padri's remains are buried at lower Meherabad.

Tahir ibn Muhammad ibn Amr

Abu'l-Hasan Tahir ibn Muhammad ibn Amr (883-after 909) was amir of the Saffarid amirate from 901 until 909. He was the son of Muhammad ibn Amr.
Biography.
During Tahir's early life, he served as the governor of Marw during the reign of his grandfather Amr ibn al-Layth.
In 900, Amr ibn al-Layth, was captured by the Samanids while campaigning against them in Khurasan. The Saffarid army swore loyalty to Tahir, who soon afterwards effectively made his brother Abu Yusuf Ya'qub his co-ruler, although the "khutba" continued to be made in 'Amr's name until late 901. Tahir and Ya'qub returned to Sistan, reaching Zarang in May of that year. From the onset of his reign, Tahir and his brother were under the thumb of the Turkish slave commander Sebük-eri, who managed to destroy Tahir’s vizier and replace him with one more to his liking.
Tahir spent much of his time early in his reign in the western part of his territories, having to deal with occupation of Fars by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tadid after the downfall of 'Amr. A 900-901 campaign, in which both Tahir and Sebük-eri participated, temporarily regained Fars, but the Saffarids withdrew soon afterwards. A second campaign resulted in a caliphal grant of the province to Tahir, although both Fars and Kerman effectively fell into the hands of Sebük-eri.
After the second Fars campaign, Tahir returned to Zarang (mid-904). At this point both he and Ya'qub gave themselves over to lives of pleasure and excesses. Over the next few years the two brothers began to lose the confidence of the people, and although the government bureaucracy continued to function, the stability of the provinces declined as rival factions opposed each other. By 905 Sebük-eri stopped forwarding taxes collected in Fars and Kerman to Zarang. Tahir responded by leading an army against Fars, but was soon persuaded to abort the expedition and return to Sistan, having accomplished nothing. 
In late 908 another Saffarid, al-Laith b. 'Ali, arrived at Zarang with a small army and occupied part of the city. Tahir, who had been in Bust, joined up with Ya'qub and besieged al-Laith's position. Despite reinforcements from Sebük-eri, however, he was unable to dislodge al-Laith and began to suffer from having very little money to maintain the support of those around him, thanks to declining government revenues. Tahir and Ya'qub decided to flee to Sebük-eri. On the way, however, they grew distrustful of the Turkish commander and decided to fight him. The two sides met in June 909; Sebük-eri, who had managed to win over Tahir's commanders, won an easy victory and captured the brothers. They were sent to the Caliph and imprisoned in Baghdad, though they were treated well for the remainder of their lives.

Finding Moon

Finding Moon is a novel written in 1996 by Tony Hillerman. The novel is based on an idea that Hillerman had developed and intended to set in post-World War II Europe; in fact, many characters are named after soldiers he knew while serving. He would later set the story in Southeast Asia in 1975, coinciding with the fall of Saigon, the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and the beginning of the Marcos era in the Philippines.
The plot concerns Moon Mathias, the managing editor of a small Colorado newspaper. When Moon receives a call that his mother has collapsed from a heart attack in an airport across the nation from her home, he discovers that his mother was on her way to Manila to bring his deceased brother's daughter to the United States. With his mother incapacitated, Moon takes over the mission and flies to Cambodia to try to find the niece he didn't know existed and to redeem himself to his mother.
This novel is different in tone from many of Hillerman's other works, especially as it is not a mystery in the traditional sense. There is an investigation of sorts as Moon discovers the details of his brother's life, but no crime instigates the search.

Crime Wave (1985 film)

Crime Wave is a 1985 film made by Winnipeg-based filmmaker John Paizs shot between 1984 and 1986.
The film is an homage to late 1940s-early 1950s "color crime pictures". Paizs plays Steven Penny, a struggling screenwriter who lives above the garage of a suburban family, and begins typing each night from the moment the street lamp comes on. Everything we learn about the character comes from Kim (Eva Kovacs), the family's daughter, who has a schoolgirl crush on him, as Penny never utters a word in the entire film.
Steven is able to write beginnings and endings, but not middles, and we are treated to some of these amusing endings and rather repetitive beginnings that introduce several characters from various geographic regions to settle upon the film's hero "from the North".
The film is designed to emulate the look and feel of educational films from the period. Randolph Peters includes a flute and glockenspiel-based score emulating such films (the film concludes with a song based on this theme that discusses the possibility of Steven and Kim getting married sung by a small 1950s-style pop chorus). When Steven Penny is brought into some shady deals, the film takes on more of a neo noir look and sound, inflected with surrealism. One of the film's signature images is of the street lamp smashed over Steven's head, which he wears home.

<doc id="6000418" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000418" title="Clytemnestra">
Clytemnestra

Clytemnestra or Clytaemnestra (pronounced ; , ), in ancient Greek legend, was the wife of Agamemnon, ruler of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Mycenae or Argos. In the "Oresteia" by Aeschylus, she was a femme fatale, who murdered her husband, Agamemnon – said by Euripides to be her second husband – and the Trojan princess Cassandra, whom he had taken as war prize following the sack of Troy; however, in Homer's "Odyssey", her role in Agamemnon's death is unclear and her character is significantly more subdued.
The name form ("Klytaimnēstra") is commonly glossed as "famed for her suitors". However, this form is a later misreading motivated by an erroneous etymological connection to the verb 'woo, court'. The original name form is believed to have been ("Klytaimēstra"), without the "-mn-", and the modern form with "-mn-" does not occur before the middle Byzantine period. Aeschylus, in certain wordplays on her name, appears to assume an etymological link with the verb , 'scheme, contrive'.
Background.
Clytemnestra was the daughter of Tyndareus and Leda, the King and Queen of Sparta. According to the myth, Zeus appeared to Leda in the form of a swan, seducing and impregnating her. Leda produced four offspring from two eggs: Castor and Clytemnestra from one egg, and Helen and Polydeuces from the other. Therefore, Castor and Clytemnestra were fathered by Tyndareus, whereas Helen and Polydeuces were fathered by Zeus.
Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus were in exile at the home of Tyndareus. In due time the brothers married Tyndareus' two daughters: Agamemnon marrying Clytemnestra and Menelaus marrying Helen. In a late variation, Euripides's "Iphigenia at Aulis", Clytemnestra's first husband was Tantalus, King of Pisa (in the western Peloponnese), who was slain by Agamemnon. Agamemnon also murdered his infant son. He then forcibly made Clytemnestra his wife. In another version, her first husband was King of Lydia, which was known to the Greeks for its shrine of the labrys, the double-bladed ax that some say Clytemnestra used to kill Agamemnon.
Mythology.
After Helen went (or was taken) from Sparta to Troy, her husband, Menelaus, asked his brother Agamemnon for help. Greek forces gathered at Aulis. However, consistently weak winds prevented the fleet from sailing. Through a subplot involving the gods and omens, the priest Calchas said the winds would be favorable if Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis. Agamemnon persuaded Clytemnestra to send Iphigenia by deceptively telling her that the purpose of his daughter's visit was to marry her to Achilles. When Iphigenia arrived at Aulis, she was sacrificed, the winds turned, and the troops set sail for Troy. Clytemnestra learned of this event and grieved for her daughter.
The Trojan War lasted ten years. During this period of Agamemnon's long absence, Clytemnestra began a love affair with Aegisthus, her husband's cousin. Whether Clytemnestra was seduced into the affair or entered into it independently differs according to the respective author of the myth.
Nevertheless, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus began plotting Agamemnon's demise. Clytemnestra was enraged by Iphigenia's murder (and presumably the earlier murder of her first husband by Agamemnon, and her subsequent rape and forced marriage). Aegisthus saw his father Thyestes betrayed by Agamemnon's father Atreus (Aegisthus was conceived specifically to take revenge on that branch of the family).
In old versions of the story, on returning from Troy, Agamemnon is murdered by Aegisthus, the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra. In some later versions Clytemnestra helps him or does the killing herself in his own home. The best-known version is that of Aeschylus: Agammemnon, having arrived at his palace with his concubine, the Trojan princess Cassandra in tow and being greeted by his wife, entered the palace for a banquet while Cassandra remained in the chariot. Clytemnestra waited until he was in the bath, and then entangled him in a cloth net and stabbed him. Trapped in the web, Agamemnon could neither escape nor resist his murderer. (In some versions Cassandra has twin sons by Agamemnon. Whether Clytemnestra was jealous of Cassandra is unknown. It was quite normal at the time for men to take concubines, usually acquired as war prizes, when on campaign.)
Meanwhile, Cassandra saw a vision of herself and Agamemnon being murdered. Her attempts to elicit help failed (she had been cursed by Apollo that no one would believe her prophecies). She realized she was fated to die, and resolutely walked into the palace to receive her death.
After the murders, Aegisthus replaced Agamemnon as king and ruled for seven years with Clytemnestra as his queen. In some traditions they have three children: a son Aletes, and daughters Erigone and Helen. Clytemnestra was eventually killed by her own son Orestes. The infant Helen is also killed. Aletes and Erigone grow up at Mycenae, but when Aletes comes of age, Orestes returns from Sparta, kills his half-brother, and takes the throne. Orestes and Erigone are said to have had a son, Penthilus.
Clytemnestra's personality differs between tellings, as weak and submissive (Homer's Clytemnestra), or ruthless and manipulative (Aeschylus' Clytemnestra). This affects her role in the affair with Agamemnon.

Al-Layth

Al-Layth ibn Ali ibn al-Layth (died 928) was amir of the Saffarid amirate from 909 until 910. He was the son of Ali ibn al-Layth and nephew of the first two Saffarid rulers, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth and Amr ibn al-Layth. 
BIography.
In 890 al-Layth and his brother al-Mu'addal helped their father 'Ali escape from imprisonment at the hands of the latter's uncle, the Saffarid amir Amr ibn al-Layth. The three of them fled to Khurasan, where they entered the services of the leading anti-Saffarid in that region, Rafi' b. Harthama. 'Ali died in 893, the brothers continued to serve Rafi'. After Rafi' was defeated and killed in 896 they were captured by 'Amr, who however treated them well.
Following 'Amr's capture by the Samanids in 900, the slave ("ghulam") commander Sebük-eri began establishing ties with al-Layth, who had gone into hiding in Sistan. As the son of 'Ali, who had originally been designated as the successor to Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar, he was a possible contender for the amirate, and gained supporters in the army. Despite this, he at first remained loyal to 'Amr's successor, Tahir b. Muhammad. He participated in the abortive 900-901 campaign to recover Fars from the Abbasid Caliphate and another and more successful campaign that took place in around 904. 
For the next few years following reoccupation of Fars, al-Layth accompanied Sebük-eri. In 907 or 908 Sebük-eri sent him on a military expedition against Makran, whose ruler, the Ma'danid 'Isa b. Ma'dan, had not paid tribute due to the Saffarids for the last several years. Al-Layth was able to gain the tribute owed, but when he returned Sebük-eri ordered him back to Makran and took his son hostage in an effort to compel him to obey. Instead, al-Layth launched a rebellion in Kerman, which was administered by Sebük-eri, and gained aid from Tahir, but his army abandoned him when Sebük-eri's force approached. Al-Layth was forced to flee to Sistan with few supporters but a large amount of wealth he had gained from plundering the towns of Kerman.
Al-Layth reached the capital Zarang in late 908 and occupied part of the city, despite Tahir's attempts to dislodge him. Tahir was eventually forced to withdraw from the area, and al-Layth was hailed as amir in March 909. He began his reign by sending an army under the command of his brother to enforce his authority in Afghanistan, which resulted in the capture of Sebük-eri's brother Ghalib. Al-Mu'addal then campaigned in Ghazna and, together with support sent by his brother, imposed al-Layth's authority in parts of Afghanistan by the end of the year. 
In February 910 al-Layth left Zarang at the head of an expedition against Sebük-eri. By May he had defeated Sebük-eri on the field and released his son from captivity, and the conquest of Fars proceeded in earnest. Sebük-eri, however, was a caliphal vassal and received support from the Abbasids. Al-Layth's representative in Fars was defeated by Abbasid forces under Mu'nis al-Khadim in August, forcing al-Layth to come to terms, and he left Fars for Kerman. Sebük-eri, however, refused to make peace with the Saffarid, and with Abbasid help he defeated and captured both him and his son; al-Mu'addal managed to escape to Kerman. The captives were sent to Baghdad; al-Layth remained in prison until his death at Raqqa in 928.

Hermocrates

Hermocrates (, c. 5th century – 407 BC) was an ancient Syracusan general during the Athenians' Sicilian Expedition in the midst of the Peloponnesian War. He is also remembered as a character in the "Timaeus" and "Critias" dialogues of Plato.
Life.
The first historical reference to Hermocrates comes from Thucydides, where he appears at the congress of Gela in 424 BC giving a speech demanding the Sicilian Greeks stop their quarreling. In 415 BC he proposed a coalition that would even include non-Sicilian cities (as well as non-Greek cities such as Carthage) in an alliance against Athens.
He was elected as one of Syracuse's three "strategoi", but was dismissed from this position after a short period because of his lack of success in battle. Later he was one of the most important advisers to the Spartan general Gylippus, and thus contributed to the victory over Athens during its siege of Syracuse.
In 412 BC he held the position of admiral during the battle of Cyzicus. In this battle, the Spartans and their allies were badly defeated by the Athenians and, as a result, Hermocrates was banned "in absentia". He did not return to Sicily until 408 BC. He died in a street fight after a failed coup in Syracuse in 407 BC.
Other literary appearances.
Hermocrates is one of the persons appearing in Plato's dialogues "Timaeus" and "Critias". Plato originally might have planned a third dialogue named "Hermocrates", but failed to compose it. F. M. Conford writes: "Since the dialogue that was to bear his name was never written, we can only guess why Plato chose him. It is curious to reflect that, while Critias is to recount how the prehistoric Athens of nine thousand years ago had repelled the invasion from Atlantis and saved the Mediterranean peoples from slavery, Hermocrates would be remembered by the Athenians as the man who had repulsed their own greatest effort at imperialist expansion."
Hermocrates is also mentioned by Xenophon, Plutarch and Polyaenus. 
In popular culture.
In the anime series "Yu-Gi-Oh!", Hermocrates (here named Hermos) is one of the three knight of Atlantis turned into dragons along with Critias and Timaeus in the Waking the Dragons arc of the anime series. This arc was not in the manga.
In Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992) Plato's "Lost Dialogue" (titled "Hermocrates") is the player's guide to locating Atlantis.

Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Layth

Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn al-Layth was amir of the Saffarid amirate from 910 until 911.
Early in 910 Muhammad’s brother, the Saffarid amir al-Layth b. 'Ali, led an army west towards Fars in an effort to wrest it from its ruler, the slave commander Sebük-eri. Since both al-Layth and another brother, al-Mu'addal, were participating in the campaign, Muhammad was left behind in the capital Zarang as al-Layth's representative. The campaign ended in disaster, with al-Layth being captured and sent to the Abbasid court at Baghdad; when news of this reached Zarang in early September, Muhammad was hailed as amir in the provinces still part of the amirate. To cement his power, he imprisoned al-Mu'addal, who had managed to avoid being captured by Sebük-eri and had returned to Sistan.
Shortly after his ascension, Muhammad was forced to deal with the Samanids under Ahmad, who had recently been given a caliphal diploma for Sistan and its subordinate territories in an effort to break the power of the Saffarids once and for all. In response to Ahmad building up his forces in Herat, Muhammad raised an army himself. Due to financial constraints, much of the army consisted of peasants. He headed north to the frontier and had some minor engagements with the Samanids in March of 911. However, he was eventually defeated and the peasant contingent fled, forcing him to abandon the expedition.
At this point Muhammad was persuaded by his advisors that he needed the support of al-Mu'addal, who was still in prison. Following his release, al-Mu'addal took control of Zarang, so Muhammad headed to Bust instead. Here a revolt due to excessive taxation by Saffarid authorities had started. It was led by an Ibrahim b. Yusuf-al'Arif, who declared his loyalty to the Samanids. An advance Saffarid army had difficulty putting down the revolt until Ibrahim suddenly disappeared in battle, allowing the Saffarids to retake control of Bust.
Muhammad shortly after entered Bust, but he himself used violently oppressive methods in a desperate attempt to raise money. As a result, the citizens of Bust grew hostile to the Saffarids, and when the Samanid Ahmad arrived before the city, they helped him take it. Muhammad fled but was soon captured and brought back to Bust. In response to the request of the caliph, Ahmad sent Muhammad to Baghdad. His capture, coupled with the surrender of al-Mu'addal to another Samanid army, allowed the Samanids to briefly take over Sistan.

Suzuki RE5

The Suzuki RE5 is a motorcycle with a Wankel rotary engine that was manufactured by Suzuki from 1974 to 1976.
Notes.
Suzuki's RE5 was one example of the very few Wankel engine motorcycles that were produced. Some of the others were by DKW and Norton Motorcycle Company (e.g. the Norton Interpol 2, Norton Classic, Norton Commander). It was manufactured by the Suzuki Motor Company from 1974 and withdrawn during 1977.
Rotary engines produce high power figures from relatively small displacements. All four major Japanese manufacturers had prototypes or plans. Yamaha showed their Rotary at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1972 (the twin rotor RZ-201). Kawasaki tested a prototype as, allegedly, did Honda. Norton and DKW also marketed rotaries along with a small run by Van Veen (this company used a derivative of NSU/Audi engines developed for Citroën).
There were only two production models of the RE5, the 1975 M model available in "Firemist Orange" or "Firemist Blue" and the 1976 "A" model available in black (blue was shown as an option on the "A" model brochure although they may never have actually been produced). Many "A" models were unsold M models. Suzuki supplied kits to dealers allowing them to swap a number of items, including gauges and lights, on unsold 1975 models converting the bikes to 1976 "A" models. Main changes for 1976 included a color change for the tank and side covers, GT750-style instruments, blinkers, tail lights and headlight housing. The "B" secondary points for overrun were removed on the "A" model, the chain oiler was removed and a sealed drive chain fitted.
History.
The RE5 was touted as the future of motorcycling. Indeed, RE5 section chief Shigeyasu Kamiya of Suzuki Motor Corporation stated that they had considered a rotary-powered motorcycle as early as the mid-1960s. Basic research and development continued to the end of the decade and culminated in the signing of a technical licence with NSU (part of Audi) in November 1970. Suzuki was the 20th firm to do so. The company was at the cutting edge of rotary development, and engineered in-house dozens of machines for the rotary production process. Of these, ten were particularly special and included the machine to cut the trochoid block. This one machine alone took a year to reach experimental status. The company also holds twenty patents in plating, as considerable research went into the composite electro-chemical materials (CEM) which were used to plate the rotor housing. Testing of the running prototypes took two years. The bikes were launched in 1974. Suzuki enlisted astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, to introduce the bike and give it his endorsement. No expense was spared, and about a dozen motorcycle publications were treated to a week-long test ride and instructional session on the motorcycle. Journalists were flown around the US west coast in Cessna Citation jets to take their turn riding five pre-production bikes. This corporate attitude extended to the warranty. It was superior to other motorcycles of the day and a full engine replacement stipulated for any engine problem within the first 12 months or .
Despite having only a single rotor, the RE5's engine was mechanically complex. Also, the rotary engine produced a lot of heat, which required a number of subsystems such as water and oil cooling and modifications to engine components such as the exhaust pipes. The numerous subsystems made the motorcycle heavy overall. Ignition was CDI, but used two sets of ignition points through vacuum and rpm sensors to light the one NGK gold palladium spark plug. There were three separate oil tanks (sump, gearbox and total loss tank) and two oil pumps (one for normal engine lubrication and cooling and one to supply oil specifically for tip seal lubrication). The throttle controlled not only the primary carburetor butterfly but a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the "port" valve) as well as the oil pump which provided lubrication for the tip seals by mixing oil with fuel. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle twist grip. The carburetor was similar to that from a rotary power unit in a car and was complicated, by motorcycle standards of the day.
The RE5 could also be optioned with a full touring kit. This included a large full fairing and windscreen, two saddlebags, a large rack and top box. The fairing included two lockable "gloveboxes", and all three bags were also key-locked. Suzuki later made available bolt-on exhaust extensions which prevented damage to the underside of the saddle bags by the hot exhaust gases. An optional touring saddle may have been also available.
Suzuki commissioned Italian industrial designer Giorgetto Giugiaro for the RE5 styling. The "tin can" instrument cluster encompassed the usual lights and a low-fuel warning light, total loss oil tank light and digital gear indicator. This tubular "can" motif was also used in the tail light, and spherical indicator lights finished off the "rotary" theme. The 1976 "A" model returned to more conventional styling. Suzuki expected its sales teams to promote the model alongside the 1977 model GS750, but production had already ceased. The UK-based Rotary Owner's Club records the earliest serial number as 10049 and the highest 16291. From this total production, numbers of something more than 6,000 bikes for both models are indicated.
As of 2010, Suzuki's newly opened museum in Japan does not feature an RE5.
Test rider impressions.
Although the RE5's frame and suspension were conventional, several motorcycle test riders remarked on its good steering and handling, some claiming it as the best-handling Japanese bike, and close to European standards. The RE5 had good ground clearance. The complex B-point system (explained below) gave smooth running on overrun and some engine braking. Suzuki stopped fitting the B points to the 1976 "A" model, and allegedly had dealers disconnect the system on remaining "M" models. The bikes sometimes exhibited a dead spot or hesitation during acceleration as the carburetor transitioned from primary to secondary throat. This was due to poor synchronization between the positions of the primary, port and the secondary carburetor throat valves. Some evidence links this to jetting, giving an excessively lean primary mixture. The bike is less powerful than the contemporary Suzuki GT750, but its greatest attribute is tremendous torque. The bike is smooth compared to standard reciprocating engines, but road tests revealed a grinding vibration around 4,000 rpm, possibly a feature of the engine harmonics. Average fuel consumption is around ,), but road tests sometimes experienced results as low as and as high as . In the end, and once over its novelty, test riders found that other than its handling, it wasn't superior to more conventional bikes.
Two different approaches.
Suzuki produced the RE5 between 1974 to 1976. A little earlier, BSA's research engineer, David Garside, was developing a twin-rotor Wankel motorcycle. BSA's collapse put a halt on development, but Garside's machine eventually reached production as the "Norton Classic". It is useful to compare the two approaches of Suzuki and BSA:
Wankel engines run very hot, and parts of the engine's trochoid chamber (the ignition and exhaust side) are always hot, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, but Garside reasoned that provided the power did not exceed 80bhp, air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled the rotors with ram-air that was then cooled in a plenum and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily, and thus lubricated the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes get very hot, so Suzuki opted for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth (but with rough patches at 4,000 rpm); Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the rotor high in the frame; Garside put his rotors as low as possible.
The result was that (although it was said to handle well) the Suzuki was heavy, overcomplicated, expensive to make, and (at 60bhp) a little short on power. Garside's design was simpler, smoother, lighter and (at 80bhp) significantly more powerful. As William Bushnell Stout said, "Simplicate and add more lightness!".
Specifications.
Specifications:
Technical features.
The engine has a single rotor with a capacity of 497 cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which was a combination of sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.
Clutch and gearbox.
Wet multiplate clutch and five-speed constant mesh transmission. The gearbox is virtually the same as that fitted to Suzuki's GT750 water-cooled triple. RE5 final drive is by 630 chain via a 14-tooth drive sprocket and 43-tooth unit at the rear wheel.
Carburation.
Two stage Mikuni. Five separate carburetor circuits. Suzuki chose to use peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but are known to have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage carburetor. An 18 mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the 5 throttle cables, and this primary circuit gives decent low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32 mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique "Port Valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port at the end of the exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, and is best illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.
Ignition.
CDI triggered by two sets of points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design is a lack of engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and "lumpy" running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the Apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were triggered by an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700 rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any "M" (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki toyed with the idea of two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18 mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).
Cooling.
The rotary engine places severe thermal stresses on its cases, as two sides of rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external jacketing. Oil is fed from an engine sump by a trochoid pump at around . The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass in case of a blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor jacketing but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that sits across the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the inlet port and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan on the right side of the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at and cutting when the temperature falls below .
Lubrication.
Internally the rotor is cooled and lubricated by engine sump oil and the aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower right side of the cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the "A" models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.
Exhaust.
Rotary exhaust temperatures reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, required a specialized exhaust system. Suzuki dealt with the problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe which is a little shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system at the end of the external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.

Amr ibn Ya'qub

Abu Hafs ‘Amr ibn Ya'qub ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Amr (born 902/903) was the Saffarid amir of Sistan for slightly over a year (912–913). He was the son of Ya'qub, the brother of Tahir ibn Muhammad ibn Amr.
In 912, opposition to the Samanid governor of Sistan Abu Salih Mansur resulted in a revolt. As he was the only surviving member of the Saffarids descended from Ya'qub ibn Layth al-Saffar still in Sistan, the ten-year old ‘Amr was made the figurehead of the movement. Chief among the leaders of the revolt was Muhammad ibn Hurmuz, a former Kharijite and Samanid soldier, who enlisted the support of the "‘ayyarun", imprisoned Abu Salih Mansur and wrested control of Zarang from the Samanids.
Although ‘Amr was the leader of the rebellion in name, Muhammad b. Hurmuz had no intention of handing power over to him once the Samanids had been driven out of Sistan. He declared himself amir, inserting his name in the Friday prayer and minting his own coins. He was soon opposed, however, by the pro-Saffarid party, led by an Ibn al-Haffar, who took over the Ya'qubi palace and proclaimed ‘Amr as amir on May 2, 912. When Muhammad b. Hurmuz attempted to recover his power he was killed.
‘Amr and Ibn al-Haffar were soon forced to deal with a Samanid invasion launched in an attempt to recover Sistan. The Samanids occupied the outskirts of Zarang but were unable to enter the city. For nine months the Samanids and Saffarids fought around the city; at last on May 24, 913 ‘Amr and Ibn al-Haffar surrendered. Abu Salih Mansur was released, and safe conduct was promised for the defenders, but ‘Amr, Ibn al-Haffar and the "‘ayyar" leaders were sent to Herat and then to Bukhara. ‘Amr was sent to Samarkand, while the "‘ayyar" leaders were executed.
‘Amr eventually left Samarkand for Baghdad, where the Abbasids gave him refuge. Some time later he was invited back to Sistan by Abu Ja'far Ahmad, who had reestablished Saffarid rule over the province. He was given full honors and the position of redresser of grievances.

Kelvin transform

The Kelvin transform is a device used in classical potential theory to extend the concept of a harmonic function, by allowing the definition of a function which is 'harmonic at infinity'. This technique is also used in the study of subharmonic and superharmonic functions.
In order to define the Kelvin transform "f"* of a function "f", it is necessary to first consider the concept of inversion in a sphere in R"n" as follows.
It is possible to use inversion in any sphere, but the ideas are clearest when considering a sphere with centre at the origin.
Given a fixed sphere "S"(0,"R") with centre 0 and radius "R", the inversion of a point "x" in R"n" is defined to be
A useful effect of this inversion is that the origin 0 is the image of formula_2, and formula_2 is the image of 0. Under this inversion, spheres are transformed into spheres, and the exterior of a sphere is transformed to the interior, and vice versa.
The Kelvin transform of a function is then defined by:
If "D" is an open subset of R"n" which does not contain 0, then for any function "f" defined on "D", the Kelvin transform "f"* of "f" with respect to the sphere "S"(0,"R") is
One of the important properties of the Kelvin transform, and the main reason behind its creation, is the following result:
This follows from the formula

Tisserand's parameter

Tisserand's parameter (or Tisserand's invariant) is a value calculated from several orbital elements (semi-major axis, orbital eccentricity, and inclination) of a relatively small object and a larger "perturbing body". It is used to distinguish different kinds of orbits. It is named after French astronomer Félix Tisserand, and applies to restricted three-body problems, in which the three objects all vary greatly in size.
Definition.
For a small body with semimajor axis formula_1, eccentricity formula_2, and inclination formula_3, relative to the orbit of a perturbing larger body with semimajor axis formula_4, the parameter is defined as follows:
The quasi-conservation of Tisserand's parameter is a consequence of Tisserand's relation.
Related notions.
The parameter is derived from one of the so-called Delaunay standard variables, used to study the perturbed Hamiltonian in a 3-body system. Ignoring higher-order perturbation terms, the following value is conserved:
Consequently, perturbations may lead to the resonance between the orbital inclination and eccentricity, known as Kozai resonance. Near-circular, highly inclined orbits can thus become very eccentric in exchange for lower inclination. For example, such a mechanism can produce sungrazing comets, because a large eccentricity with a constant semimajor axis results in a small perihelion.

Ahmad ibn Muhammad

Abu Ja'far Ahmad b. Muhammad (June 21, 906 – March 31, 963) was the amir of Sistan from 923 until his death. He is responsible for restoring Saffarid rule over Sistan, and was a great patron of the arts.
Ancestors.
Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s father was named Muhammad. Muhammad was very distantly related to the founder of the Saffarid amirate, Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari; his great-great-grandfather had been the brother of Ya’qub’s great-grandfather. Muhammad shared a closer connection with Ya’qub’s brother and successor Amr bin Laith, having married the latter’s granddaughter.
Life.
Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s rise to power began in May 923, when the people of Zarang proclaimed him amir. Sistan at that time was ruled by 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad, who was unpopular in Zarang due to his harsh taxes. Taking advantage of his ties to the Saffarids, Abu Ja’far Ahmad gained the support of the city ‘ayyars, who stopped an attempt by ‘Abdallah’s son ‘Aziz to maintain control of the town. Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s rule soon expanded outside Zarang; ‘Abdallah’s representative in al-Rukhkhaj defected to him and the citizens of Bust threw their support behind the Saffarid as well. ‘Abdallah was defeated in battle by Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s supporters, forcing him to make for Samanid Khurasan. He was captured, however, and brought back to Zarang in October 923. His capture ended his rule for good.
Although ‘Abdallah was no longer a threat to Abu Ja’far Ahmad, his son ‘Aziz remained opposed to him. Some of Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s supporters turned against him and threw their support behind ‘Aziz, forcing the Saffarid to march on Bust twice to subdue the rebels. ‘Aziz attempted to conquer Sistan but was defeated by a Saffarid army towards the end of 925. He fled to Khurasan, ending his attempt to take over Sistan.
Having successfully defended against the rebels, Abu Ja’far Ahmad sought to expand his realm at the expense of the Abbasid Caliphate, which had been suffering a series of setbacks over the last several years. He therefore sent several of his officials to Kerman, a province which had formerly belonged to the Saffarids. Taxes were collected by the officials, who then returned to Sistan. Saffarid authority over Kerman was therefore only temporary; the Abbasids held a loose grip on the province for a few more years before the Banu Ilyas took over in 932.
Abu Ja’far Ahmad continued to be preoccupied with unrest in Bust. He had to personally arrive at the town in 931 to deal with a rebellion, and another force was sent in the following year. Events in the neighboring Samanid amirate also contributed to the troubles. In 930 a plot to overthrow the Samanid amir Nasr b. Ahmad and replace him with his brothers failed. A few individuals involved in the plot arrived in Bust in 932 at the head of a contingent of troops and attacked the Saffarid governor there. Abu Ja’fa Ahmad was forced to arrive at the head of an army and defeat the fugitives. Because he was frequently needed in Bust and other parts of the eastern provinces, Abu Ja’far Ahmad often left Zarang in the hands of the three sons of one Tahir b. Asnam.
After these initial troubles, Sistan and the outlying provinces calmed down for several years, making for a relatively peaceful period in Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s reign. He was held in high regard by his neighbors; even the Samanids, the historical enemies of the Saffarids, were apparently friendly with him (in fact, the poet Rudaki praised the Saffarid’s name in a panegyric at the Samanid court in Bukhara, see below). Other poets, both Persian and Arabic, also viewed the amir favorably. Many scholarly gatherings in Sistan were conducted, and were attended by leaders in the field such as Abu Sulayman Muhammad al-Sijistani and Nasafi.
This peace was not to last, however. Different factions outside the capital soon came to violence against each other, forcing the dispatch of the army. From the 950s on there was continuing unrest in Sistan. In the meantime, the three sons of Tahir b. Asnam who sometimes governed in Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s name when he was absent from Zarang fell from favor and were imprisoned. In their place, Abu’l-Fath, the commander of the army, took over many functions of the government. He eventually revolted, however, and gained a large degree of support from the people outside of Zarang. Abu’l-Fath was further supported by another Saffarid, Abu’l-‘Abbas b. Tahir, who, as a great-grandson of Amr b. Laith, could claim to be directly related to the original Saffarid amirs (in contrast, Ab Ja’far Ahmad could only claim descent from Amr on his mother’s side).
The pretender Abu’l-‘Abbas, together with Abu’l-Fath, advanced against Zarang. Abu Ja’far Ahmad met them in battle, and together with Turkish reinforcements from Bust, defeated the rebels. Abu’l-Fath fled to Nishapur, where he eventually died in the summer of 963.
Abu’l-‘Abbas, on the other hand joined a plot with one of Abu Ja’far Ahmad’s Turkish ghulams. Together, they killed Abu Ja’far Ahmad at a drinking party at the end of March 963 and plundered his treasury. The amir’s son and heir, Abu Ahmad Khalaf, happened to outside of the capital the night of the murder and less than two months later managed to establish himself in Zarang.

Ștefan Dimitrescu

Ștefan Dimitrescu (January 18, 1886 – May 22, 1933) was a Romanian Post-impressionist painter and draftsman.
Biography.
Born in Huși into a modest family, he completed his primary and secondary studies in his hometown. In 1902, deciding to follow his passion for music, he left for Iași, where he took cello classes at the Iași Conservatory.
In summer of 1903, Dimitrescu entered the National School of Fine Arts in the city, studying in the same class as Nicolae Tonitza; the two studied under Gheorghe Popovici and Emanoil Bardasare. After graduation, Dimitrescu painted murals for the Orthodox churches in Agăș and Asău (Bacău County).
Between 1912 and 1913, he studied in Paris, at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, during which time he was attracted to Impressionism.
Drafted into the Romanian Army at the start of the Romanian Campaign of World War I, Dimitrescu was profoundly touched by the experience, and began painting tragic pieces that documented the misery brought by the conflict. Like his friend Tonitza, he began exploring social themes, such as queuing and the effects of bombardments.
In 1917, along with the painters Camil Ressu, Iosif Iser, Marius Bunescu and the sculptors Dimitrie Paciurea, Cornel Medrea, Ion Jalea and Oscar Han, he founded the "Art of Romania" association in their Iași refuge. In 1926, Dimitrescu, with Oscar Han, Francisc Șirato, and Nicolae Tonitza, established "Grupul celor patru" ("The Group of Four").
He became a teacher at the Iași National School of Fine Arts in 1927, and, during the next year, he was named its headmaster (a position he held until his death). Towards the end of his life, Dimitrescu began expanding his palette to cover more somber colors, while exploring compositions in which the background was stripped of details and usually of a dominant white.
He died in Iași and he was buried at the Eternitatea Cemetery.
Art.
Most of Dimitrescu's paintings take inspiration mainly from the life of simple folk, and especially from that of Romanian peasants and miners; they attempt to portray Romanian traditions and way of life, drawing on his encounters with both Byzantine art and the work of Paul Cézanne.
Part of his art (between 1926 and 1933) was inspired by his travels to Dobruja, and have been considered to be the most accomplished synthesis between his craft as a draftsman and his art as a painter.
Many of his works are exhibited in Bârlad (at the Vasile Pârvan Museum), Bucharest (the National Museum of Art of Romania and the Zambaccian Museum), Cluj-Napoca (Cluj Art Museum) and in private collections outside Romania (in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany).

<doc id="6000477" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000477" title="Khalaf ibn Ahmad">
Khalaf ibn Ahmad

Abu Ahmad Wali 'l-Dawla Khalaf ibn Ahmad (November 937 – March 1009) was the Saffarid amir of Sistan from 963 until 1002. Although he was renowned in the eastern Islamic world as a scholar, his reign was characterized by violence and instability, and Saffarid rule over Sistan came to an end with his deposition.
Early life.
Khalaf was born in the middle of November 937 to Abu Ja'far Ahmad and Banu, a granddaughter of the second Saffarid amir, Amr ibn al-Layth. Little is known about the first twenty-six years of his life; presumably much of it was spent learning. From 957 or 958 at the latest he was recognized as heir to the throne and his name was included on his father's coins.
Succession to the Amirate.
At the end of March 963 Abu Ja'far Ahmad was murdered in Zarang. At the time of the assassination, Khalaf had been outside the capital. When he heard about his father's death, he rode for the town of Bust, whose governor immediately pledged his support. Soon afterward he led an army against Zarang, which was under the control of a rival Saffarid named Abu Hafs b. Muhammad. Seeing Khalaf's army, Abu Hafs fled the capital and sought refuge in Samanid Khurasan, allowing Khalaf to enter Zarang.
Shortly after Khalaf was proclaimed amir, he proclaimed Abu'l-Husayn Tahir ibn Muhammad his co-ruler. Abu'l-Husayn Tahir, who was descended from the Saffarids on his mother's side, had been governing Farah but came to Zarang after Abu Ja'far Ahmad was murdered. Khalaf set him up in the Ya'qubi palace and had his name inserted in the khutba beside his.
A year after Khalaf's ascension, a riot broke out in Zarang. Led by an '"ayyar" leader and involving the city factions, it was quickly put down. Khalaf then decided to perform the Pilgrimage and departed, leaving Abu'l-Husayn Tahir in charge.
Khalaf spent probably one year on the Pilgrimage before returning (965). On the way home he stopped at Baghdad, where the Buyid amir Mu'izz al-Dawla gave him an audience with the Abbasid caliph al-Muti. The caliph confirmed him in his rule of Sistan and gave him a robe of honor and standard. Khalaf felt, however, that Abu'l-Husayn Tahir would not willingly give up control of Sistan upon his return, so he went to the Samanids for assistance and received an army. Returning to Sistan, he forced Abu'l-Husayn Tahir to retreat. As soon as Khalaf's army had been dismissed, however, Abu'l-Husayn Tahir returned, forcing Khalaf to seek Samanid help again. The conflict suddenly ended with the death of Abu'l Husayn Tahir in 970; his son Husayn declared his alliegence to the Samanids and left Sistan for the time being.
Conflict with Husayn b. Abu'l-Husayn Tahir.
Within a year of the death of Abu'l-Husayn Tahir, his son Husayn pressed his claim to the amirate. Returning to Sistan, he soon gained control of Zarang in late 970/early 971. When Khalaf and his forces advanced to retake the capital, Husayn left the city and led his army against him. In the ensuing battle, Khalaf was victorious and several of Husayn's military commanders were killed. Khalaf retook Zarang in April 971 and immediately began to root out Husayn's supporters in the city, causing many of them to flee to Khurasan.
Khalaf's victory proved to be only temporary, as Husayn returned in the following year. With an army that included elephants, Husayn defeated Khalaf in battle and reoccupied Zarang. A further setback for Khalaf occurred when the Samanids decided to get involved in the conflict. Khalaf had neglected to send the customary tribute to the Samanid amir at Bukhara, and Husayn took advantage of the amir's interest in the conflict by leaving Zarang and travelling to Bukhara to seek assistance (Khalaf, for his part, seems to have been more friendly to the Buyids, even including the name of the Buyid amir 'Adud al-Dawla in the khutba at one point, perhaps in an attempt to receive military aid. No record of Buyid intervention in Sistan during this time appears, however). A Samanid army was sent to support Husayn; Khalaf gave battle but was defeated in August of 979.
Husayn and his Samanid allies then surrounded Zarang, which Khalaf had fled to after the battle. A siege lasting for probably three years began. Khalaf's forces attempted numerous sorties but where unable to break the siege; the Samanid and Saffarid armies battled each other several times, with neither gaining a decisive victory. The Samanid amir eventually sent a member of the Simjurid family, Abu'l-Hasan Muhammad Simjuri, to break the stalemate. With his help, a truce was achieved between Husayn and Khalaf in 983. Husayn received Zarang and much of Sistan; he entered the capital and had the name of the Samanid amir inserted in the khutba there. Khalaf left Zarang and took up residence in the nearby fortress of Taq and was to receive the revenues of the state lands and part of the revenues from Zarang.
As soon as Abu'l-Hasan left Sistan, however, Khalaf broke the truce and attempted to retake Sistan. Husayn barricaded himself in the citadel, but found that its supplies had been depleted by Khalaf's forces during the three-year siege. Realizing that he couldn't hold out for long, he contacted the Ghaznavids for help. The Ghaznavid Sebuktigin made his way to Sistan, but Khalaf managed to bribe him and eventually convince him to assist him instead. With no choice left but to surrender, Husayn sent envoys to seek peace. An agreement was reached on December 25, 983, and to celebrate the peace numerous festivities were held. Husayn died not long after.
Later years.
Khalaf was now the sole uncontested amir of Sistan for the first time in twenty years. During the next several years he gained his reputation for being a great scholar and for encouraging learning within his realm. He is also said to have made another Pilgrimage, though the date of this is uncertain. Upon the deposition of the caliph al-Ta'i in 991 by the Buyid Baha' al-Dawla, he recognized the new caliph al-Qadir. This represented a break between him and the Samanids, who with their vassals the Ghaznavids continued to recognize al-Tai as caliph. In any case, it was probably al-Qadir who gave Khalif his "laqab" of Wali 'l-Dawla.
Khalaf also conducted a campaign to retake Bust and Zamindawar. These had been virtually lost to the Saffarids during Abu'l-Husayn Tahir's rule; the local Turks had been more or less independent before the Ghaznavid Sebuktigin conquered the region in c. 978. Khalaf occupied Bust in 986 while Sebuktigin was preoccupied with his own campaign against the Hindushah. When the Ghaznavid returned, however, Khalaf was forced to surrender Bust and return the taxes he had taken from the town.
Khalaf had several sons; the two oldest, Abu Nasr and Abu'l-Fadl, died of natural causes. The third, 'Amr, spent many years at the court of the Samanid amir in Bukhara. In 988 'Amr was sent back to Sistan, where his father warmly welcomed him. A few years later, however, 'Amr took part in a rebellion against Khalaf. The rebellion was soon put down and 'Amr was jailed; he died in prison shortly after.
After the attempt to take Bust, Khalaf and Sebuktigin seem to have been on good terms. Khalaf is reported to have participated in a campaign together with Sebuktigin and the Farighunid amir of Guzgan to assist the Samanids in quelling a rebellion in Khurasan. When Sebuktigin died in 997, however, his two sons Mahmud and Ismail disputed over who should succeed him. Khalaf viewed this as an opportunity to gain territory from the Ghaznavids, and sent his fourth son Tahir to take Quhistan and Badghis in 998. Tahir was defeated in Baghdis by Mahmud's uncle Bughrachuq, although the latter was killed in the fighting.
Mahmud had no intention of letting this assault go unpunished. He led his troops into Sistan in 1000 and trapped a surprised Khalaf, who was staying at a hill resort. Khalaf, lacking an army, had to pay an indemnity, put Mahmud's name before his own on his coins and place the Ghaznavid's name in the khutba.
Khalaf's son Tahir is mentioned as having invaded Buyid Kerman in 1000, although he was ultimately unsuccessful in making any lasting gains. Soon afterwards he, like 'Amr before him, rebelled against Khalaf. The rebellion ended with Tahir's capture; he was imprisoned and died not long after, in 1002. With Tahir's death Khalaf was no longer left with any suitable heirs.
Khalaf's reign had grown increasingly unpopular over the years; his unpopularity especially grew after Tahir's rebellion. After Tahir died, the commander of his army sent a message to Mahmud of Ghazna, stating that the people of Zarang wanted him to become the ruler of Sistan. Mahmud responded by sending an advance force to secure Sistan. Khalaf resisted, barricaded himself in Taq and withstood a siege by the Ghaznavid force, so Mahmud decided to come personally in November 1002. Mahmud's army was reinforced by the townspeople of Zarang, eager to see the Saffarid defeated. By December of 1002 Khalaf was forced to surrender. He was sent to Farighunid Guzgan, where he lived until 1006 or 1007. Rumors that Khalaf was in contact with the Karakhanids, whom Mahmud was at war with at the time, resulted in him being transferred south to Gardiz, where he died in 1009. Sistan remained under Ghaznavid rule until 1029, when the Nasrid dynasty gained control of the country.

Kodi Rammurthy Naidu

Kodi Ramamurthy Naidu(Hindi:प्रोफेसर राममूर्ति नायडू (पहलवान) Telugu: కోడి రామమూర్తి నాయుడు Birth:1882–Death:1942), also known as Prof. Rammurty, was an Indian bodybuilder who earned enormous respect for India in the field of wrestling. Prof. Rammurty worked as Physical Education Teacher in the Branch College of Vizianagaram. He got profound knowledge in "Vayu Stambhana" (en. air resistance) and "Jala Stambhana" (en.water resistance). He was awarded with the title of "Kaliyugi Bhima" by the King George V of the United Kingdom. He established a Circus (company) and earned a lot of money but donated it to the charitable trusts and contributed a lot in the Indian independence movement.
Early life.
Rammurty Naidu was born to Venkanna in the month of April 1882 at the village of Veeraghattam in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh in India. His mother died when he was a little child. Since the boy had become motherless, his father treated him with more care and affection in his childhood. As he grew up he started quarrelling with his age group youngesters the father Venkanna sent him to Vizianagaram for his studies where he lived with his uncle who was serving there as an Inspector of Police.
Joined fitness centre.
Rammurthy joined a fitness centre in Vizianagaram and learnt wrestling. His uncle Kodi Narayana Swamy, sent him to another fitness centre in Madras. He returned to Vizianagaram after one year training and joined as a physical training instructor at a prestigious college of the estate.
He was a strict vegetarian and the Andhra Pradesh government devoted a chapter in the Telugu text books about the prominence of gaining strength purely based on plant based protein.
First body show.
In 1911 he went to Madras and showed his skills of breaking steel chains, stopping motor cars and allowing elephant to pass over his chest before the public and government authorities. He was awarded there the title of "Indian Sandow" for his excellence.
Established a circus company.
He established a circus company at Vizianagaram with the help of his friend, Potti Panthulu. His uncommon feats attracted people from all over the country. He used to break an iron chain tied to his body by taking a deep breath and flexing his muscles. Iron chains would be tied to his shoulders and the other ends were tied to two cars and used to stop them. He took an elephant on his chest and held it for five minutes.
Impressed the lord.
The then Viceroy of British India, Lord Minto, experienced Ramamurthy's strength, when he tried to drive his car with Rammurthy holding it back with iron chains. His fame spread across the length and breadth of the country after this incident.
Demonstrating his physical strength.
He demonstrated his skills at the Indian National Congress meeting in Allahabad. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya encouraged him to perform his feats abroad and sent his team to London.
Honored by the crown.
King George and Queen Mary were impressed with his feats and gave him the title "Indian Hercules" after watching his display of physical strength at Buckingham Palace.
Kaliyugi Bhima.

Performances abroad.
This great bodybuilder performed impressive feats like stopping a car at high acceleration, breaking iron chains and holding an elephant leg on his chest, as well as juggling elephant babies with weights attached to them. He also performed in France, Germany, Japan and Spain.
Bullfighting in Spain.
When he was in Spain the Spanish people invited him to see the bullfighting. He went there, saw the fighting but he was not impressed. In order to show his muscle power, he entered the bullfighting ring, caught hold on a bull by its horns and threw it to the ground. Although he had no experience of fighting such bulls yet he dared to do and performed it successfully.
Contribution to charity and freedom movement.
Ramamurthy was attracted towards the freedom movement through B. Chandrayya Naidu, who used to organise tribal youths against the British rulers. He earned crores of rupees through his circus company but spent a large amount of his wealth on charity and for the Freedom movement of India.
Legacy.
A statue of him is erected on the Beach Road of Vishakhapatnam. Another statue is also situated in his home district Srikakulam. 
A stadium is constructed on his name in srikakulam.

Sailor Beware (1952 film)

Sailor Beware is a 1952 comedy film starring the comedy team of Martin and Lewis and is an adaption of a 1933 Kenyon Nicholson play of the same name. It was released on February 9, 1952 by Paramount Pictures. The working title was "At Sea with the Navy".
This was the fifth film collaboration of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who would make 16 movies together before their partnership's end.
Plot.
After meeting in the Navy recruiting line, Al Crowthers (Dean Martin) and Melvin Jones (Jerry Lewis) become friends. Al has tried to enlist before, 11 times, but was always rejected because of a bad knee. However, he keeps trying so that he can impress women, including Betty Hutton in a cameo role as 'Hetty Button'. Melvin, meanwhile, is allergic to women's cosmetics and his doctor prescribed ocean travel, so he decided to join the Navy as this was the only way he could afford to follow doctor's orders.
Unbeknown to Al, the naval requirements have been lowered and this time he has been accepted, as has Melvin. They are assigned to Lardoski (Robert Strauss), a bully they met in line and referred to as 'fathead'.
While in San Diego, Melvin falls in love with a woman Hilda Jones (Marion Marshall), who does not wear makeup. However, Melvin seems to attract women to him, and Lardoski wagers with Al that Melvin has to kiss any girl he names. Al agrees and Lardoski picks Corinne Calvet, who is playing at a nightclub in Honolulu. The crew then get sent out on the next submarine to Hawaii, in which Melvin is caught on deck when the ship is submerging. Upon his rescue he is tied to a torpedo for the rest of the voyage to avoid any more incidents.
Once in Hawaii, Al romances Corinne while Melvin also vies for her affection in order to gain a kiss to win the bet which his shipmates have informed him about, and is unsuccessful in comforting Hilda who becomes jealous.

The Razor's Edge (1946 film)

"The Razor's Edge" is the first film version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel. It was released in 1946 and stars Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, John Payne, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Herbert Marshall, supporting cast Lucile Watson, Frank Latimore and Elsa Lanchester. Marshall plays Somerset Maugham. The film was directed by Edmund Goulding.
"The Razor's Edge" tells the story of Larry Darrell, an American pilot traumatised by his experiences in World War I, who sets off in search of some transcendent meaning in his life. The story begins through the eyes of Larry's friends and acquaintances as they witness his personality change after the War. His rejection of conventional life and search for meaningful experience allows him to thrive while the more materialistic characters suffer reversals of fortune.
"The Razor's Edge" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Anne Baxter winning Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
Plot.
The film, in which W. Somerset Maugham (Marshall) is himself a minor character, drifting in and out of the lives of the major players, opens at a party held following World War I in 1919 at a country club in Chicago, Illinois. Elliott Templeton (Clifton Webb), an expatriate, has returned to the United States for the first time since before the war to visit his sister, Edith Bradley (Lucile Watson), and his niece, Isabel (Gene Tierney), engaged to be married to Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power), of whom Elliott strongly disapproves for rejecting both inclusion in their social stratum and working in the common world.
Larry is traumatized by the death of a comrade who sacrificed himself on the last day of the war to save Larry and announces that he plans to "loaf" on his small inheritance of $3,000 a year. He refuses a job offer from the father of his friend Gray (John Payne), a millionaire who is hopelessly in love with Isabel, too. Larry and Isabel agree to postpone their marriage so that he can go to Paris to try to clear his muddled thoughts. Meanwhile, Larry’s childhood friend, Sophie Nelson (Anne Baxter), settles into a happy marriage with Bob MacDonald (Frank Latimore), only to lose him and their baby in a tragic car accident.
In Paris, Larry immerses himself in a Bohemian life. After a year, Isabel visits and Larry asks her to marry him immediately. Isabel does not understand his search for meaning and breaks their engagement. Before she returns to Chicago she cannot carry through with a scheme to seduce Larry and trick him into making an "honest woman" of her. She marries Gray to provide her the elite social and family life she craves. Meanwhile, Larry works in a coal mine in France, where a defrocked priest, Kosti (Fritz Kortner), urges him travel to India to learn from a mystic. Larry studies at a monastery in the Himalayas under the tutelage of the Holy Man (Cecil Humphreys), then makes a lone pilgrimage to the mountaintop where he finds enlightenment. The Holy Man tells Larry to return to the world to share what he now knows about life.
Back in Paris, Maugham meets Elliott by chance and learns that Isabel and her family are living with Elliott after being financially ruined by the stock market crash of 1929. Gray has had a nervous breakdown and suffers from terrible headaches. Elliott "sold short" before the crash and "made a killing" in the market. Maugham arranges a lunch for Elliott and his household to meet an old friend, who turns out to be Larry. Larry is able to help Gray using an Indian form of hypnotic suggestion. Later at a disreputable nightclub, they encounter Sophie, now a drunkard. Larry reforms and arranges to marry Sophie, but when he tells Isabel, who is still in love with him, she plots to prove to Larry that Sophie's reform is only temporary. She successfully tempts Sophie back into drinking and Sophie disappears. Sophie is murdered and her death reunites Larry and Maugham during the police investigation.
Maugham and Larry visit Elliott on his deathbed in the South of France. Larry gives Elliott peace of mind after he is deliberately excluded from an important soiree hosted by a princess with whom he had a row, herself once an American Midwesterner like Elliott. Larry persuades Miss Keith (Lanchester), her social secretary, to allow him to use a blank invitation to counterfeit one for Elliott. Isabel inherits her uncle's fortune, which she can use to underwrite Gray's attempt to rebuild his father's bankrupt brokerage. Larry refuses to reconcile with Isabel, deducing that she caused Sophie's return to drinking, and ultimately, her murder. Instead he decides to work his way back to America aboard a tramp steamer. Maugham tries to console Isabel with the knowledge that Larry is happy because he has found in himself the quality of true "goodness."
Production history.
20th Century Fox purchased the film rights from Maugham in March 1945 for $50,000 (equivalent to approximately $) plus 20% of the film's net profits. The contract stipulated that Maugham would receive an additional $50,000 if the film did not start shooting by February 2, 1946. In August 1945, producer Darryl F. Zanuck had the second unit begin shooting in the mountains around Denver, Colorado, which were to portray the Himalayas in the film. The stars had not yet been cast; Larry Darrell was played by a stand-in and was filmed in extreme long shot. Zanuck wanted Tyrone Power to star and delayed casting until Power finished his service in the Marines in January 1946.
Zanuck originally hired George Cukor to direct, but creative differences led to Cukor's removal. Although Maugham wanted his friend (whom he had in mind when he created the character) Gene Tierney for Isabel, Zanuck chose Maureen O'Hara but told her not to tell anyone. As O'Hara recounted in her autobiography, she shared the secret with Linda Darnell, but Zanuck found out, fired O'Hara, and hired Tierney. Betty Grable and Judy Garland were originally considered for the role of Sophie before Baxter was cast. Maugham wrote an early draft of the screenplay but it is unknown how much of his version, if any, was used in the final script.

Dionysos (French band)

Dionysos is a French rock band formed in 1993 in Valence, Drôme; they formed at their lycée. They perform songs in both French and English, and have released six studio albums. They are well known in France for their surrealism and eccentricity.
Their first album, "Happening Songs", was self-produced and with entirely English lyrics. With their second album "The sun is blue like eggs in Winter" (also self-produced) Babet became a member. In 1999, they signed to a major label (the now defunct Trema) and released "Haïku" which brought the band in to the public eye, mainly thanks to the success of the single "Coccinelle". 
The name of the band comes from the ancient Greek god Dionysus, which in French is "Dionysos".
Influences.
There are strong non-musical influences from Tim Burton and Roald Dahl. A lot of the songs are surreal and many feature nonsense lyrics (for example "Surfin Frog"). The albums "Monsters in Love" and "La mécanique du cœur" are set in a surreal world full of whimsical monsters and other fantastic characters which Mathias Malzieu has used as a setting for two original comic books. Joann Sfar illustrated the cover art for the comic books as well as the two albums. Sfar's eccentric and humorous brand of fantasy fiction as displayed in the Donjon comic books lends itself easily to the band's fantasy-humor albums.
The lead singer, Mathias Malzieu, is also working on other projects such as the career of Olivia Ruiz (his partner), and his other hobby : writing (published 4 books in 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2011). His second book is based on the same world as the album "Monsters in Love", his third book on the same world as the album "La mécanique du cœur". In the same way, there will be connections between his fourth book, "Métamorphose en bord du ciel", but not to the same extent as "La mécanique du cœur".
Members.
Mathias is the main songwriter and frontman. He has also written three books - "38 mini westerns" (Pimientos, 2003), "Maintenant qu'il fait tout le temps nuit sur toi" (Flammarion, 2005) et "La mécanique du cœur" (Flammarion, 2007) - with inspiration drawing between the albums and the novels.
The Miky Biky co-produced "La mécanique du cœur" with Mathias.
Babet has begun a solo career and released an album: "Drôle d'oiseau" (March 5, 2007).
Stéphan worked as the band's backliner on tour, but joined officially during the recording of "Monsters in Love".

<doc id="6000580" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6000580" title="Robert H. Brooks">
Robert H. Brooks

Robert H. Brooks (February 6, 1937 – July 15, 2006) was founder of Naturally Fresh, Inc. in 1966 in Atlanta, Georgia. He helped create the Hooters of America, Inc. restaurant chain that would eventually drive that company's rapid expansion in the mid–late 1990s.
Early life and career.
Born in Loris, South Carolina (near the Myrtle Beach area), Brooks grew up on a tobacco farm. A 1960 dairy science graduate of Clemson University, Brooks spent time in the United States Army before founding Naturally Fresh Foods, a condiment and salad dressing manufacturer in the Atlanta area, in 1967.
Involvement with Hooters.
In 1984, Brooks bought the expansion and franchise rights for Hooters from Lynn D. Stewart and his five minority partners. Brooks founded Hooters America, Inc., along with a group of investors. He eventually got majority control and chairmanship of the entire organization. Under Brooks' leadership, Hooters expanded from half a dozen restaurants (in and around Clearwater, Florida) in the mid-1980s; to over 430 stores worldwide (including Taiwan, Venezuela, and Switzerland).
The company also included Hooters Air, an airline that ran from 2004 to 2006; the Hooters Pro Cup (auto racing); the Hooters Pro Tour (golf); the Hooters Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened in February 2006; and the Hooters MasterCard, which debuted in March 2006.
Brooks purchased the Hooters trademark from the company's founders in 2001. He turned over control of the company to his son, Coby, in 2003; and retired to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Brooks would still come up and visit the Atlanta headquarters on a weekly basis, though. Even after his retirement from Hooters, he was still affectionately known as the "World Wide Wing Commander" by company employees.
Awards.
Brooks was named Georgia Entrepreneur of the Year in 1996.
Donations to South Carolina universities.
Brooks was a major donor to universities in South Carolina. The Robert H. Brooks Performing Arts Center at Clemson, completed during the 1993-94 school year, was named in his honor following a large donation. He also donated $2 million to Coastal Carolina University (Conway, SC) in 2003 to create their first football stadium which the university named Brooks Stadium in his children's honor. He also created the Brooks Motorsports Institute (now Brooks Institute for Sports Science), the first of its kind in the US, at Clemson University about the study of the motorsports industry in the US.
Hooters and Hurricane Katrina.
Brooks returned $200 to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in 2005 when it was found out that one of the refugees from Hurricane Katrina spent $200 on a bottle of expensive champagne at the restaurant, earning praise from government officials for his actions.
Death.
Brooks died in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on July 15, 2006 of a heart attack.
He is survived by his wife Tami, and four children Coby, Boni, Jerrett Oates (stepson), and Christi Oates (stepdaughter). The eldest son from his first marriage, Mark, was killed in an April 1, 1993 plane crash with 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup (now NASCAR Sprint Cup) champion, Alan Kulwicki.
Tributes to Brooks.
Following the announcement of Brooks' death on July 17, 2006, the main page of the Hooters website changed their sign to "Farewell World Wide Wing Commander" that ran from July 17, 2006 to September 10, 2006. A tribute was also done in the July 31, 2006 comic strip "Prickly City".
The 2007 Hooters swimsuit calendar was also dedicated in his memory.

Grant Withers

Grant Withers (January 17, 1905 – March 27, 1959) was an American film actor. With early beginnings in the silent era, Withers moved into talkies establishing himself with a list of headlined features as a young and handsome male lead. As his career progressed, his importance diminished, but he did manage a 10-year contract at Republic Pictures. 
His friendships with both John Ford and John Wayne secured him a spot in nine of Wayne's films, but later roles dwindled to supporting parts, mainly as villains in B-movies, serials, and finally television.
Early life and career.
Born Granville G. Withers in Pueblo, Colorado, Withers worked as an oil company salesman and newspaper reporter before breaking into films near the end of the silent era. His more than 30-year acting career took off in the late 1920s, while in his twenties, his hairy-chested rugged good looks made him the leading man over such rising talent as James Cagney, who made his film debut in the Withers feature "Sinners' Holiday" (1930), also starring Joan Blondell and released by Warner Brothers. 
Taller than John Wayne and just as tough, yet capable of sensitivity, it was his early roles for Warner Bros. that brought him his highest accolades. Withers' early work had him opposite such major talent as W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Boris Karloff, Mae West, and Shirley Temple. Appearing in "The Red-Haired Alibi" (1932) with Temple, he played the role of her first on-screen parent.
Starring roles in major pictures later dwindled to supporting parts, mainly as villains in B-movies and serials. Notable exceptions included a 12-part "Jungle Jim" movie serial (1937), starring Withers and released by Universal Pictures, and the recurring role of the brash police Captain Bill Street in the Monogram Pictures series "Mr. Wong", starring Boris Karloff, beginning in 1938. He was under a Republic Pictures contract from February 1944 through April 1954. Withers' credits at Republic total about sixty films from 1937 to 1957. 
After 1940, he was a character actor and a popular Western tough guy. He took numerous supporting roles in television as his demand in films waned. He guest starred as baseball Coach Whitey Martin the 1956 episode "The Comeback"
of the religion anthology series, "Crossroads". He was cast as Gus Andrews and Miles Breck, respectively, in two episodes, "The time for All Good Men" (1957) and "King of the Frontier" (1958), on the ABC western series, "The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp", starring Hugh O'Brian. 
In 1958, Withers portrayed the wealthy rancher Sam Barton in the episode "The Return of Dr. Thackeray" of CBS's "Have Gun-Will Travel". In the segment, lead character Paladin, played by Richard Boone, come to the assistance of a physician friend, portrayed by June Lockhart. Dr. Thackeray diagnoses a cook with smallpox and worries that the disease will infect the ranch hands when Barton refuses to permit his men to be vaccinated. Singer Johnny Western, who performed the "Have Gun-Will Travel" theme song, appeared in this episode as an angry gunslinger. Withers also appeared in two other "Have Gun – Will Travel" episodes. That year he played Charles Stewart Brent, owner of the Brent Building in Los Angeles where Perry Mason had his office, and the defendant in the "Perry Mason" episode, "The Case of the Gilded Lily."
In 1959, shortly before his death, Withers was cast in the episode "Feeling His Oats" of the NBC children's western series, "Fury", starring Peter Graves and Bobby Diamond. He also appeared that year as Sheriff Charlie Clayton in the episode "A Matter of Friendship" in John Bromfield's crime drama, "U.S. Marshal". His last role, also in 1959, was as Ed Martin in "The Ringer" of the Rory Calhoun western series, "The Texan".
In total, Withers appeared in some two hundred film and television roles.
Personal life.
In 1930, at twenty-six, he eloped to Yuma, Arizona, with 17-year-old actress Loretta Young. The marriage was widely reported and ended in annulment in 1931. The annulment took place just as their second movie together, ironically titled "Too Young to Marry", was released. He was also married to Gladys Joyce Walsh.
Some of Withers' later screen appearances were arranged through the auspices of his friends John Ford and John Wayne. He appeared in nine movies with John Wayne, including "Fort Apache" (1948) and "Rio Grande" (1950). 
Wayne was best man at Withers' fifth marriage, to 24-year-old Cuban-born actress Estelita Rodriguez ("Rio Bravo") in January 1953 in Reno, Nevada. They too resided in the San Fernando Valley on Woodcliff Avenue in Sherman Oaks, California. Estelita began a nightclub singing career at the end of her Republic contract. The marriage was not a happy one. They divorced in 1955.
A noticeable weight gain is apparent in his films as his career progresses. In later years, back problems were one of his health issues.
Death.
With failing health, Withers committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates on March 27, 1959. Withers left a suicide note that read, "Please forgive me, my family. I was so unhappy. It's better this way."

Risk II

Risk II is the official computer and online version of the classic board game "Risk". "Risk II" was developed by MicroProse, designed by Deep Red and published by Hasbro Interactive in 2000. The graphics and sound far surpassed previous computer versions of the game.
In addition to the classic board game style of play, "Risk II" introduced new modes including a single-player tournament and a brand new concept called SameTime, in which turns are taken simultaneously by all players. Up to eight players can play, in any combination of human and computer opponents (as long as at least one player is human). Available computer opponents are an assortment of mostly 18th and 19th century generals: Campbell, MacKenzie, Marmont, Barbacena, D'Erlon, Maransin, Solignac, Sherbrooke, Aubert, Spencer, Taupin, Freire, Vauban, Baird, Bonaparte and Wellington. Each computer opponent has a different style of attack and a different reliability in honoring alliances.
Game Types.
Classic Risk.
Classic style employs the standard rules of Risk (depending on version, see below), which is one attack move at a time from one location. In this game type, you can attack as many times as you like, and may move through multiple territories with one army, although at least one unit has to be left in any territory you capture. You may also retreat from an attack and move units from one territory to a bordering territory at the end of your attack turn.
Same Time Risk.
Same Time Risk is a very different concept, and mostly suited for digital play. A player may use two or more different armies from one or more different territories to attack a bordering territory.
After placing reinforcements and making a move, the map will show the moves of all players and where they will attack. Then each battle is fought battle individually (unless AI are battling each other, in that case it is automatically resolved) until all moves have been played.
The Same Time concept requires dynamically different strategies from that of the Classic game. An attack from 2 or more territories to a single enemy territory is called a 'Mass Invasion'. If two different players attack a territory that fails to defend them, then a 'Spoils of War' battle ensues at the end of the turn between the two armies who fought for the territory in question. A player may only move through one territory at a time when attacking, although each player is granted a 'Surge Attack', which can be used to thrust a designated amount of soldiers from a newly acquired territory into a neighboring one. If two armies meet when attacking, a 'Border Clash' battle occurs, which is the first to be resolved.
The dice are also different, and create a new strategy for using armies. If a player uses 3 armies to attack (over 3 bordering territories), the player will use 3 dice. If a player uses just 1 army, he will only use one die and so forth. Also, the greater the number of soldiers in the army, the different color of die. The darker the color, the more "loaded" the die is. For example, if an attacking territory has 30 or more soldiers, it will receive a black die, which will usually roll 4-6's, whereas an army of 5 or less will use a white die, which rolls lower numbers more often. The other "loaded" ranks, from highest to lowest are: red, orange, yellow.
So, the ranks are, white, yellow, orange, red (dark), and a deep black.
Since the battle greatly favors the side that uses mass invasions (they get more dice), sitting back and defending is not a good idea. It is not uncommon for a two sided mass invasion to crash a defending army that is twice the invasion size. The player should try to mobilize all border forces to attack whenever possible. This way the player can avoid the enemy mass invasions and fight some fair border clashes battle, damaging the enemy in the process. Most of the time the benefit of holding a continent border territory is not worth the risk of losings mass amount of soldiers from enemy mass invasions. And since the enemy is only allowed one surge attack per round the damage he can do to the player's inner territory is limited. In fact the enemy that surge attack deep into the player's territory risk having it crashed by the player's mass invasions in the next round, assuming the player can provide a reasonable resistance.
Tournament.
Tournament employs both Classic and Same Time rules. There are 16 different rounds of ascending difficulty, and you are scored after every round. If you are killed during any round, your tournament ends. The aim is to gain as many points as possible. You gain points for completing your objective and bonus points for destroying any enemy factions. There is a scoreboard which is pre-filled with different players before play.
Versions.
Two versions of "Risk II" were developed: the U.S. version (v1.01u) and the European version (v1.01e). This was necessary because the board game rules actually differ slightly based on where the game is played. In the U.S. version, the "trade-on-the-fly rule," which forces a player to trade cards in the middle of a turn if he or she has more than the 5-card maximum, is in effect. In the European version, there is no "trade-on-the-fly". There is also a difference in the options a player has when rolling dice to defend a territory with two battalions. In the European version of "Risk II" a player may only roll one die while in the US version a player may choose to roll two dice or one die (to defend with either one or two battalions). The two versions of "Risk II" are however, completely compatible with each other when used in multi-player games online or across a network. Whichever version is installed by the host of the game is the version that will be used for each player. In the classic board game "Risk", the U.S. version uses ascending card trade-in values (4 additional reinforcements, then 6,8,10,12,15,20,25...), while the European version uses set card trade-in values (Infantry-4, Cavalry-6, Cannon-8, One of each-10). In "Risk II", both versions have the option of using ascending or set trade-in values, and also an additional option of ascending by one (4,5,6...), which is a compromise between ascending and set.
each one 10 point
Online play.
Originally the MSN Gaming Zone supported free online play for "Risk II", though it ceased support of the game on January 31, 2006.

SugarSync

SugarSync is a cloud service that enables active synchronization of files across computers and other devices for file backup, access, syncing, and sharing from a variety of operating systems, such as Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS, Mac OS X, Samsung SmartTV, Symbian, Windows, and Windows Mobile devices. For Linux, only a discontinued unofficial third-party client is available.
The program automatically refreshes its sync by constantly monitoring changes to files—additions, deletions, edits—and syncs these changes with any other linked devices as well as the SugarSync servers.
Originally offering a free 5GB plan and several paid plans, the company transitioned to a paid-only model on February 8th, 2014.
Company history.
SugarSync was born out of a company named Sharpcast, which was incorporated in 2004 by Gibu Thomas (CEO) and Ben Strong (Chief technical officer). In 2006, Sharpcast unveiled Sharpcast Photos, a tool for synchronizing images between multiple devices including PCs and mobile phones. Both founders left the company in November 2008. In December 2008, Laura Yecies was appointed as the CEO. Yecies and her team re-focused the company and renamed it SugarSync in 2009.
In March 2013 Mike Grossman took over as CEO. In his self introductory blog he promised to focus the business on Mobile, Sharing and collaboration, and Enhancing the sync and mirrored capabilities of the product. The blog post was inundated with requests for a Linux client such that the top Google result for searches relating to SugarSync on Linux returned Mr Grossman's introductory message.
Product history.
The company's first product was Sharpcast Photos, software designed to make it easier for people to view their photos on multiple devices and share them via the Internet.
Sharpcast Photos was shut down at the end of 2009. Users were given the option to migrate to the SugarSync service or retrieve their photos.
In June 2013 Samir Mehta posted, on the Introductory Blog post of SugarSync's new CEO, that SugarSync were "in the process of evaluating a SugarSync Linux app". As of July 2014, no further news has been posted about a Linux client for SygarSync.
In December, 2013, SugarSync announced that they would be discontinuing their free 5GB plan and transitioning to a paid-only service by February, 2014.
API and third-party addons.
In March 2010, SugarSync unveiled an API. As a result, there are several unofficial SugarSync addons and applications available. These addons come both in the form of web services and browser extensions and desktop applications such as SugarSync Linux desktop client (now discontinued) by Mark Willis.

Liberté chérie

Liberté chérie was one of the very few Masonic lodges founded within a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War.
The Lodge.
On November 15, 1943, seven Belgian Freemasons and resistance fighters founded the Masonic Lodge "Loge Liberté chérie" (French: Cherished Liberty Lodge) inside Hut 6 of Emslandlager VII (Esterwegen). The name of the lodge was derived from "La Marseillaise".
The original seven Freemasons of Loge Liberté chérie were:
They later initiated, passed, and raised Brother Fernand Erauw, another Belgian.
According to M. Franz Bridoux, former prisoner in Esterwegen’s Hut 6, the founding members of Loge Liberté chérie were Rochat, Sugg, Hannecart, Hanson, Somerhausen, Degueldre, and Miclotte.
De Schrijver and M. Story arrived well after the establishment of the lodge and were not be founding members, but members only.
Paul Hanson was elected master. The brethren met for lodge work in Hut 6 around a table, which was otherwise used for cartridge sorting. A Catholic priest stood watch, so that the brethren could hold their meetings; and protected their secrecy.
Hut 6 was used for foreign "Nacht und Nebel", (German: Night and Fog), prisoners. The Emslandlagercamps were a group of camps whose history is represented by a permanent exhibition in the Documentation and Information Centre in Papenburg, Germany. Altogether 15 camps were established on the Netherlands border, with central administration in Papenburg.
Luc Somerhausen described Erauw's intitiation, etc., as just as simple ceremonies. These ceremonies, (to whose secrecy they asked the community of Catholic priests for assistance, "with their prayers"), "took place at one of the tables. ... after a very highly simplified ritual—whose individual components were however explained to the initiate; that from now on he could participate in the work of the Lodge".
More than hundred prisoners were in Hut 6, and locked up nearly around the clock—allowed to leave only for a half-hour walk per day, under supervision. During the day, half of the camp had to sort cartridges and radio parts. The prisoners of the other half of the camp were forced to work under dreadful conditions in the surrounding peat bogs. The nutrition was so miserable that the prisoners lost 4 kg of body weight each month, on average.
After the first ritual meeting, with admission of the new brother, further meetings were thematically prepared. One was dedicated to the symbol of the Great Architect of the Universe, another "The future of Belgium", and a further, "The position of women in Freemasonry". Only Somerhausen and Erauw survived detention, and the lodge stopped "working" at the beginning of 1944.
Members.
Lodge Master Paul Hanson was moved, and died in the rubble of his prison, during an Allied air bombardment on Essen, on March 26, 1944. Jean Sugg and Franz Rochat, belonged to the Philanthropic Friends Lodge (Les Amis Philanthropes, Lodge No. 5 of the Grand Orient of Belgium).
Franz Rochat, a professor, pharmacist, and director of an important pharmaceutical laboratory, was born on 10 March 1908 in Saint-Gilles. He was a worker in the underground press, and the resistance publication "Voice of the Belgians". He was arrested on 28 February 1942, arrived at Untermansfeld April 1944, and died there on 6 April 1945.
Jean Sugg was born 8 September 1897 in Ghent and was of Swiss German origin. He co-operated with Franz Rochat in the underground press, translated German and Swiss texts, and contributed to clandestine publications, including, "La Libre Belgique", "La Légion Noire", "Le Petit Belge", and "L'Anti Boche". He died in a concentration camp on 8 February 1945.
Amédée Miclotte was a high school teacher. He was born 20 December 1902 in , and belonged to the lodge Union et Progrès. He was last seen in detention, on 8 February 1945.
Jean De Schrijver, was a colonel in the Belgian Army. He was born 23 August 1893 in Aalst, and was a brother of the lodge La Liberté in Ghent. On 2 September 1943 he was arrested on charges of espionage and possession of arms, and died in February 1945.
Henri Story was born on 27 November 1897 in Ghent. He was a member of the lodge Le Septentrion in Ghent. He died on 5 December 1944.
Luc Somerhausen, a journalist, was born on 26 August 1903, in Hoeilaart. He was arrested on 28 May 1943 in Brussels. He belonged to the lodge ACSO III and was deputy secretary of the Grand Orient of Belgium ("Grand Orient de Belgique").
Fernand Erauw, an assessor at the Audit Office, and reserve officer with the Infantry, was born on 29 January 1914, in Wemmel. He was arrested on 4 August 1942, as a member of the "Secret Army". He escaped and was finally arrested in 1943.
Guy Hannecart (1903–1945) a lawyer and leader of La Voix des Belges. He was also member of the lodge les Amis Philanthropes N°3.
Survivors Erauw and Somerhausen met again 1944 in the Oranienburg Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and remained inseparable from then on. In the spring of 1945 they were involved in the death marches, and although Erauw was 1.84 m tall, he weighed only 32 kg on 21 May 1945 — in the Saint Pierre Hospital in Brussels.
In August 1945 Luc Somerhausen sent a detailed report to the grand master of the Grand Orient of Belgium, in which he delineated the history of the loge Liberté chérie. Luc Somerhausen died in 1982 at the age of 79. The last witness, Fernand Erauw, died at the age of 83, in 1997.
The memorial.
A memorial, created by architect Jean de Salle, was raised by Belgian and German Freemasons on 13 November 2004. It is now part of the memorial site of the Esterwegen Cemetery. Wim Rutten, the grand master of the Belgian Federation of the Le Droit Humain said during an address:
We are gathered here today on this Cemetery in Esterwegen, not to mourn, but to express free thoughts in public." - "In memory of our brothers; human rights should never be forgotten.

Ulmus 'Dodoens'

The Dutch hybrid cultivar "Ulmus" 'Dodoens' was derived from a selfed seedling of a hybrid of the Exeter Elm "Ulmus glabra" 'Exoniensis', and the Himalayan Elm "Ulmus wallichiana". The tree was one of several cultivars prepared for release in 1970, but delayed by the outbreak of the new, aggressive strain of Dutch elm disease.
Description.
A very fast-growing tree with upright branches, the generally ovate leaves are dark-green, glabrescent, < 14 cm in length by 10 cm broad, with a pronounced acuminate apex. The UK Champion tree at the Westonbirt Arboretum planted in 1981 measured 17 m in height, with a trunk 36 cm d.b.h. 21 years later in 2002.
Pests and diseases.
'Dodoens' has moderately good resistance to Dutch elm disease, rated 4 out of 5.
Cultivation.
Eventually released in 1973, sales in the Netherlands dwindled from a peak of almost 16,000 in 1979 to 600 in 2004 [http://www.deboomkwekerij.nl/tsde/resources/attachments/download/true/im/false/id/69628/Iep.pdf]. Although still commercially available in Europe, the tree is no longer recommended for planting wherever the disease remains prevalent.
'Dodoens' was included in trials [http://www.netspace.net.au/~stephenf/Resistant_Elms.html] in Canberra, Australia started in 1988, but has not thrived in that environment. It is not known to have been commercially released in North America although it was evaluated at the Iowa State University in the early 1970s where it perished, unable to tolerate the very cold winters.
Notable trees.
The UK TROBI Champion grows at the Westonbirt Arboretum; planted in 1980, the tree measured 20 m high by 47 cm d.b.h. in 2009. 
Etymology.
The cultivar is named for the 16th-century Flemish physician and botanist Rembert Dodoens.

Kearny Fallout Meter

The Kearny Fallout Meter or KFM is an expedient radiation meter. It is designed such that someone with a normal mechanical ability would be able to construct it before or during a nuclear attack and from common household items.
The Kearny Fallout Meter was developed by Cresson Kearny from research performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and published in the civil defense manual "Nuclear War Survival Skills" (ISBN 0-942487-01-X). The plans were originally released in Oak Ridge National Laboratory publication ORNL-5040, "The KFM, A Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meter" and have been formatted in a newsprint ready layout so that they may be quickly printed with accurate dimensions in local newspapers. It must be built from a correctly scaled copy of the plans; photocopies and printouts of digital copies may not be to scale.
History.
Devised in 1978 by Cresson Kearny, the Kearny fallout meter is an application of the gold-leaf electroscope developed in 1787 by Abraham Bennet. Prior to this, the use of the electrometer principle for radiation detection had seen widespread application in the form of the quartz fiber dosimeter. Professional radiation meters, while more accurate and more durable, had a number of potential issues (including cost and lack of availability) which it was hoped the Kearny Fallout Meter would address.
Use.
Commercially made radiation meters are typically based around electronic circuitry or require a battery-powered charging apparatus, allowing susceptibility to battery shortages and to electromagnetic pulse. The Kearny Fallout Meter was designed to utilize static electricity, produced by (for example) a hard plastic rubbed on dry paper. The KFM was also engineered to be less expensive to build than dosimeters were to purchase, and to be made out of commonly available materials, such that they could be constructed even after a disaster. Most commercial radiation meters also require initial and periodic professional calibration, but "If a KFM is made and maintained with the specified dimensions and of the specified materials, its' accuracy is automatically and permanently established by unchanging laws of nature".
The designed operating range is from 30 mR/hr to 43 R/hr, with accuracy of +/-25%. "A KFM looks like a toy" has been cited as a "major disadvantage" of the design.
How it works.
An electrostatic charge is placed upon two aluminium foil leaves, causing them to repel. As radiation strikes the meter the foil leaves lose their charge and start to droop. This droop can be measured and a rate can be established. The KFM has been used as a science project, demonstrating the effects of ionizing radiation.
The dimensions of a KFM and the weight of its leaves permanently establish its calibration, when built as specified with a properly sized scale.

Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill

Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill () to () is a 332.2 hectare (820.9 acre) geological and biological Site of Special Scientific Interest near the western end of the Mendip Hills, Somerset, notified in 1952.
Shute Shelve Hill, which is formed of Carboniferous Limestone laid down in the Dinantian period about 350 million years ago, rises to above sea level. It is an anticline with younger limestones on the lower slopes.
The site.
The site extends for some 5 km from west to east. Near its eastern end it is divided by a gap used by the A38 road and the disused Cheddar Valley railway line. From west to east the site includes these hills:
Most of the site is owned by the National Trust.
A long-distance footpath, the Mendip Way, follows much of the northern boundary of the site.
Etymology.
Crook Peak has been important as a landmark and boundary from very early times, and the origins of the name are unclear. Some believe the name 'Crook' comes from Old British 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'.
Somerset slang for something that isn't straight is 'crook' - as in crooked
Biological.
This site comprises a wide range of habitats which includes ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved calcareous grassland and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Four of the calcareous
grassland communities, two of the woodland types and the calcareous grassland/acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath mosaic all have a restricted distribution in Britain. Four nationally rare and seven notable plant species are also present. Plants of interest include the nationally rare Cheddar Pink ("Dianthus gratianopolitanus"), Bedstraw ("Galium fleurotii"), Dwarf Sedge ("Carex humilis") and Dwarf Mouse-ear ("Cerastium pumilum"). Rose Wood and King's Wood are ancient woodland sites. The nationally rare Purple Gromwell ("Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum") occurs at Rose Wood.
Geological.
There are cave deposits of interest at the southern end of Crook Peak. Picken's Hole is of considerable importance because of its clear, well-stratified sequence of deposits and faunas, all dating from within the Devensian. The rich Layer 3 fauna, radiocarbon dated to 34,265 (+2600/–1950) years BP, includes Spotted Hyena, Lion, Arctic fox, Mammoth, Woolly Rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, suslik and Tundra Vole. The site is a major source of information for this phase of the Middle Devensian. It is also the most carefully excavated hyena-den site and assemblage from Britain.
Shute Shelve Cavern is located on Shute Shelve Hill.
Barton Camp.
Barton Camp, which is on the northern slopes of Crook Peak, is run by the Bristol Children's Help Society which was founded in 1884 to help needy children. The facilities include classrooms, a sports hall, outdoor pool, playing field and bunkhouse accommodation.

Diaea dorsata

Diaea dorsata is one of the smaller crab spiders. Females can grow up to 6 mm, males up to 4 mm. Prosoma and legs are green, the opisthosoma is yellowish with a brown mark. Like "Misumena vatia", this spider can change its color to fit its surrounding; however, this takes several days.
"D. dorsata" prefers forest edges. It can be found on oak leaves. The subadults overwinter under the bark of dead trees. Adults appear in May. The males have an extended non-damaging combat ritual: They stand opposed, stretch their front legs and dance around each other. This can go on for hours. This is highly unusual for crab spiders, but for example often found in jumping spiders.
An agranular green pigment is incorporated into the mesocuticle of this species and thus lost between moults.

Sicko (band)

Sicko were an American rock group from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1991. Exceptionally, the three-piece pop punk group maintained a constant membership for every recording as a band. This line-up was Denny Bartlett (guitar, bass, vocals), Ean Hernandez (guitar, bass, vocals), and Josh Rubin (drums, brother of Aaron Rubin from The Mr. T Experience). Although the band wrote and recorded an extensive catalog of original material throughout the mid-1990s, the group is perhaps best known for its punk-flavored cover of the song "Closer To Fine", originally written and recorded by the folk duo Indigo Girls.
Sicko released four full length albums and five 7" eps as well as a retrospective CD with unreleased and rare material, a released demo and a tour video. They also appeared on approximately fourteen compilations on labels such as Lookout! Records and Liberation Records. They once exchanged covers with Cub. The vast majority of their recorded output was recorded by Kurt Bloch of The Fastbacks and released on Seattle-based punk label eMpTy Records. One EP and the retrospective CD were released on Mutant Pop Records. Three Sicko songs were featured on the Xbox game Project Gotham Racing 2 alongside artists like The Flaming Lips and Princess Superstar.
During its heyday - roughly 1993 to 1998 - Sicko actively played in numerous clubs throughout the Seattle area, toured the United States, and toured Japan. A typical Sicko set would last about twenty songs lasting about 45–50 minutes, in a blistering, no-interruptions manner reminiscent of the Ramones or The Fastbacks (whose lo-fi style resembled Sicko, possibly in part due to Kurt Bloch's production input in the studio). Denny and Ean would typically switch places on the bass and guitar duties halfway through the set (and often handing each other their instruments while on stage). Sicko often split the bill with other bands that would eventually go on to achieve more national acclaim, including a show with Harvey Danger in 1994 at the (now defunct) Lake Union Pub, and several shows with the The Presidents of the United States of America, most notably at a show at the Capitol Hill club Moe's (now Neumo's) on the same night that the Presidents filmed concert footage for the video of their hit song "Lump". Sicko occasionally received dismissive (and often unfair) comparisons by national critics with Green Day, another punk trio with a more polished and slightly poppier style.
While no longer being updated, the Sicko web site is still up at Sicko.com.
On August 26, 2009, Red Scare Industries announced that they would be re-issuing the band's catalog.

USS Guardoqui (IX-218)

USS "Gardoqui" (IX-218), an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for USS "Gardoqui", a Spanish gunboat captured during the Spanish-American War. Her name was misspelled when she was christened. "Gardoqui" was named for the commercial house of Joseph Gardoqui and Sons of Bilbao, Spain, which represented the American Colonies in the Spanish court during the American Revolution. Her keel was laid down in 1921 by the Federal Shipbuilding Company, in Kearny, New Jersey. She was acquired from the War Shipping Administration and commissioned at Pearl Harbor on 23 June 1945 with Lieutenant Harold L. Tysinger in command.
A tanker originally intended for use as Mobile Floating Storage, "Gardoqui" departed Pearl Harbor for Eniwetok 27 July 1945. Reaching her destination 12 August, she discharged her cargo of fuel and lube oil to navy and merchant ships for almost a month. "Gardoqui" departed Eniwetok 7 September and put in at Tokyo on 21 September to discharge more lube and fuel oil.
Departing Tokyo 7 November, she transited the Panama Canal via Pearl Harbor 28 December and came to anchor off Mobile, Alabama, on 6 January 1946. "Gardoqui" decommissioned at Mobile 13 February 1946 and was returned to the War Shipping Administration. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 April 1946 and she was sold to her previous owner, E. T. Bedford, 28 January 1947.

Elmer McCollum

Elmer Verner McCollum ForMemRS (March 3, 1879 – November 15, 1967) was an American biochemist known for his work on the influence of diet on health.
Life and education.
McCollum was born on a farm near Fort Scott, Kansas, where he spent his first seventeen years. He worked at odd jobs to finish high school and college, graduating from the University of Kansas in 1903 and earning his doctorate at Yale University in 1906. McCollum got his Ph.D. from Yale in 2 years, but stayed at Yale for another year working with T. Osborne and L. B. Mendel on problems of plant protein composition and diet. This deeply influenced Mccollum's future career. Mendel helped McCollum secure a faculty position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Career.
As a faculty member in agricultural chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, he established the nation's first colony of white lab rats to use for his nutrition experiments.
McCollum first proposed that the nutritive failure of certain diets was due to a lack of "palatability." He proposed that if a diet could be made to taste good, and the animals ate larger quantities of food, the diets would be adequate. This hypothesis, and the supporting data, were criticized by both Osborne and Mendel, who demonstrated that plant protein diets were not adequate unless protein-free milk was added as a supplement. In some of their papers, Mendel and Osborne suggested that McCollum had been careless in some of his experiments. McCollum acknowledged this error and rededicated himself to more careful analyses including an analysis of the growth-promoting factors in protein-free milk, which then led to the isolation of the first known fat-soluble vitamin which he later called Vitamin A.
His experiments with the diets of small animals also led to the discovery of the water-soluble vitamin B. He later showed that B is not a single compound, but a complex. McCollum and biochemist-in-training Marguerite Davis gave the "factors" letter names, because their structures had not yet been determined to give them proper chemical names. He showed that vitamin D prevents rickets, a bone disease. Other sources, such as Patricia Swan's article in The Journal of Nutrition (1994 American Institute of Nutrition.J. Nutrition 124: 455-460.), and a McCollum biography by Simoni, R. D. and Vaughan, M. (2002) "Nutritional biochemistry and the discovery of vitamins. The work of Elmer Verner McCollum". J. Biol. Chem. 277(19) ascribe the first use of letter names for vitamins to Cornelia Kennedy, who used them in her master's thesis for the University of Wisconsin in 1916, citing research published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry (McCollum and Kennedy 1916).
McCollum opposed Casimir Funk's 1912 name "vitamines" (from "vital amines") because he thought they were no more "vital" than other nutrients and because they are not true amines. The name was changed to its current spelling in 1920.
In 1917 Johns Hopkins University recruited McCollum as the first chair and professor in the newly established Department of Chemical Hygiene, although he almost didn't get the job. At 6 feet and just 127 pounds, the nutritionist looked "frail" to the faculty members who interviewed him.
He published 150 papers at Johns Hopkins, reporting research work on tooth decay, vitamins D and E, and the role of trace minerals in nutrition, including aluminum, calcium, cobalt, fluorine, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, sodium, strontium and zinc. McCollum worked with Herbert Hoover's U.S. Food Administration to alleviate starvation in Europe in the aftermath of World War I. His classic textbook The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition went through multiple editions.
McCollum's book "The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition" (1918) influenced many dietitians.
After his 1946 retirement, he wrote "The History of Nutrition" and an autobiography. McCollum received many awards, honors and medals in his life and died in 1967 rich in rewards. His home in Baltimore is a National Historic Landmark, and the American Society for Nutrition sponsors a McCollum lecture and gives the E.V. McCollum Award each year to "a clinical investigator who is perceived currently as a major creative force, actively generating new concepts in nutrition."
McCollum was a great believer in nutrition through food. To his dying day, McCollum regarded drugstore vitamin pills and supplements as snake-oil quackery. He died on November 15, 1967, at the age of 88. Shortly before his death, he remarked: "I have had an exceptionally pleasant life and am thankful."

The Razor's Edge (1984 film)

"The Razor's Edge" is the second film version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel. The film was released in 1984 and stars Bill Murray, Theresa Russell, Catherine Hicks, Denholm Elliott, Brian Doyle-Murray and James Keach. It was directed by John Byrum.
The previous version, made in 1946, starred Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney.
According to an interview with director John Byrum published on August 8, 2006 in the "San Francisco Bay Guardian", he had wanted to film an adaptation of Maugham's book in the early 1980s. The director brought a copy of the book to his friend Margaret "Mickey" Kelley who was in the hospital after giving birth. Byrum remembers getting a call the next day at four AM, "and it was Mickey's husband, Bill He said, 'This is Larry, Larry Darrell.'"
Byrum and Murray drove across America while writing the screenplay. What they had written did not resemble the previous film version. Murray included a farewell speech to his recently deceased friend John Belushi in the script; this appears as Larry Darrell's farewell speech to Piedmont, a fellow ambulance driver in World War I. While Murray was attached to the project, Byrum had trouble finding a studio to finance it.
Dan Aykroyd suggested that Murray could appear in "Ghostbusters" for Columbia Pictures in exchange for the studio greenlighting "The Razor's Edge." Murray agreed and a deal was made with Columbia. For the next year and half, cast and crew shot on location in France, Switzerland and India with a $12 million budget. After the last day of principal photography, Murray left to make "Ghostbusters."
This marked Murray's first starring role in a dramatic film, though Murray did inject some of his dry wit into the script. The film grossed $6.6 million at the box office; 
In this version, the book's epigraph is dramatized as advice given to Darrell by a Tibetan monk: "The path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as a razor's edge."
Plot.
The film opens in Illinois at a fair planned to raise money to support Gray Maturin and Larry Darrell who are joining World War 1 as ambulance drivers. During their service they witness deaths and are nearly killed themselves at one point. After serving in the war Larry Darrell returns to America with the realization that his life plans will not make him happy, so he puts off his engagement to Isabel and travels to Paris in an effort to find meaning in his life. 
Instead of following his uncle Elliott's suggestions of staying at first class hotels and wining and dining with the aristocracy he lives a simple life reading philosophy books in a cheap hotel and eventually gets a job as a coal miner. After saving the life of a coworker by pushing him out of the way of an out of control mine car he has a conversation about books with the elder miner. After discussing their choice in books the miner suggests a Russian magician's book and follows that with a suggestion to travel to India to gain a different perspective. 
Larry then travels to India where he eventually joins a Buddhist monastery. As an exercise he hikes to the top of a snow covered mountain and meditates alone. After running out of firewood he starts to burn books that he brought along with him. Once he is finished on the mountain he travels back to the monastery and promptly leaves to go back to Paris. 
Returning to Paris Larry discovers that many things have changed: His former fiance Isabel has married Gray and they have had two children. The great depression bankrupted Gray's livelihood and forced he and Isabel to move to Paris with Elliott Templeton. The formerly married Sophie has lost her husband and child in an accident and has turned to alcohol, opium, and prostitution. 
Larry immediately attempts to reform Sophie and after a period of time where things have gone smoothly they become engaged. Upon sharing the news with Gray, Elliott, and Isabel, Isabel insists that she will buy Sophie a wedding dress as a gift. Before Isabel and Sophie can go dress shopping they have a conversation where Isabel admits she still loves Larry and condemns Sophie labeling her a burden on Larry. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call and Isabel is called elsewhere leaving Sophie alone with a bottle of liquor. 
Larry attempts to track Sophie down and finds her at an opium den with her former pimp. After a confrontation Larry is left bleeding in the street while Sophie stays in the establishment. The next morning Larry is awoken by two men at the door and brought to the morgue to identify Sophie's body. Larry then goes to Elliott's house to try and figure out what went wrong the previous day. Upon his arrival he is alerted to the fact that Elliott has had a stroke and has been given his last rites. Larry confronts Isabel about what happened but is interrupted by the final moments of Elliott's life. Larry does a good deed for Elliott by convincing him that the Parisian aristocrats have not forgotten about him. After Elliott passes he has a final confrontation with Isabel and says his goodbye to Gray. He states his intention to depart for home, which prompts the question 'Where is home?' to which he replies America.

Reception.
The film was a commercial and critical failure. Typical of reviews was Janet Maslin's in "The New York Times" where she characterized it as "disjointed", describing it as "slow, overlong and ridiculously overproduced." Roger Ebert judged the movie "flawed" and pointed to the hero as "too passive, too contained, too rich in self-irony, to really sweep us along in his quest." He placed the blame on Murray's shoulders, saying he "plays the hero as if fate is a comedian and he is the straight man."

Willie Stevenson

William "Willie" Stevenson (born 26 October 1939) is a Scottish former professional football player and manager. He played for Rangers, Liverpool, Stoke City and Tranmere Rovers.
Career.
Stevenson was born in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. He played for Edina Hearts, Dalkeith Thistle and Rangers before Bill Shankly paid £20,000 to bring him to Liverpool in October 1962. He made his debut in the 2–1 home league defeat to Burnley on 3 November 1962, he scored his first goal in a 5–0 victory over Leyton Orient at Anfield, Stevenson managed to hit the net in the 35th minute, Roger Hunt with a hat-trick and Ian St John scored the others. Willie had just lost his place to Jim Baxter in the Rangers side and was just settling down in Australia when both Liverpool and Preston North End put in bids to sign him, Liverpool got their man out bidding Preston in doing so. Stevenson helped the Reds gain the 1963–64 First Division title in only their 2nd season back in the top flight of English football, he featured in 38 of the 42 league games thus cementing a starting role on the left of the Reds midfield.
Willie played a major role in winning of Liverpool's first ever FA Cup in 1965, he played in all of the ties and scored the all important 2nd goal from the penalty spot in the 2–0 semi-final victory over Chelsea at Villa Park. Leeds United stood in Shankly's team's way and after a hard fought 0–0 draw in 90 minutes, goals from Hunt and St John were enough to beat the Elland Road club by 2 goals to 1 and see the famous trophy go to Anfield after a 72 year wait. The following campaign, again, saw silverware head North-West to Merseyside as the Reds took the league title once more, Stevenson missed just the one fixture and scored five times as Liverpool topped the table by a comfortable 6 points over Leeds. Willie also tasted disappointment, however, as Borussia Dortmund beat Liverpool 2–1 in the European Cup Winners Cup final at Hampden Park, the 1st European final the Anfield club had reached. Shankly had bought the 19 year old Emlyn Hughes from Blackpool in the February 1967 and selected him ahead of Stevenson at the beginning of the 1967–68 season, this proved to be turning point in Stevenson's career, he got the nod just once in the league and three times in the Fairs Cup. By the December of 1967 he was on his way leaving for Stoke City.
Stoke manager Tony Waddington paid £30,000 for Stevenson as a replacement for the departed Calvin Palmer. He played 20 games in 1967–68 and 34 times in 1968–69 as Stoke had two poor seasons narrowly avoiding relegation. A much improved 1969–70 campaign saw Stevenson play 23 games as Stoke finished in 9th. He played six matches at the start of 1970–71 before injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season. He played 25 games in 1971–72 and just three in 1972–73. At the end of the season he left the Victoria Ground after making 111 appearances scoring seven goals, for Third Division Tranmere Rovers whre he made 27 appearances.
In 1974, Willie travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia, to join the Vancouver Whitecaps in the newly formed North American Soccer League (NASL). He played in Vancouver for one season before ending his career. In 1975 he acted as assistant coach before returning to the UK in 1976. Willie is now retired, after his retirement in spent time as a publican and then ran a contract cleaning company in Macclesfield where he still lives.

Avar Khanate

The Avar Khanate was a long-lived Muslim state which controlled Western Dagestan from the early 13th century to the 19th century.
Following the fall of the Christian kingdom of Sarir in the early 12th century, the Caucasian Avars underwent a process of Islamization. Military tensions escalated in 1222, when the region was invaded by the pagan Mongols under Subutai. Although the Avars pledged their support to Muhammad II of Khwarezm in his struggle against the Mongols, there is no documentation for the Mongol invasion of the Avar lands. As historical clues are so scarce, it is probably fruitless to speculate whether the Avars were the agents of the Mongol influence in the Caucasus and whether they were entrusted with the task of levying tribute for the khan, as modern historian Murad Magomedov suggests.
The rise of Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh following the disintegration of the Golden Horde was at once a symptom and a cause of the khans' diminished influence during the 15th and 16th centuries. At that time, the khanate was a loosely structured state, sometimes forced to seek the Tsar's protection against its powerful enemies, while many mountainous communities ("djamaats") obtained a considerable degree of autonomy from the khan.
In the 18th century, the steady weakening of shamkhals fostered the ambitions of the Avar khans, whose greatest coup was the defeat of the 100,000-strong army of Nadir Shah in September 1741. In the wake of this success, Avar sovereigns managed to expand their territory at the expense of free communities in Dagestan and Chechnya. The reign of Umma-Khan in 1775–1801 marked the zenith of the Avar ascendancy in the Caucasus. Among the potentates who paid tribute to Umma-Khan were the rulers of Shaki, Quba, and Shirvan.
Within two years after Umma-Khan's death, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority. Yet the Russian administration disappointed and embittered freedom-loving highlanders. The institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses, electrified the Avar population into rising under the aegis of the Muslim Imamate, led by Ghazi Mohammed (1828–32), Gamzat-bek (1832–34) and Imam Shamil (1834–59). This Caucasian War raged until 1864, when the Avar Khanate was abolished and the Avar District was instituted instead.

Reginald Spencer Ellery

Dr Reginald Spencer Ellery (1897 - 1955), was a pioneer in the practice of psychiatry in Melbourne, Australia. He was also noted as an autobiographer, memoirist, communist, and poet.
Under Dr J. K. Adey's supervision at Sunbury, Ellery developed a greater understanding of psychiatry; together they were responsible in 1925 for the first successful application in Australia of Wagner-Jauregg's malarial-fever treatment for general paralysis of the insane.
A member of the British Psychological Society, from 1938 Ellery allied himself with a group of progressive psychiatrists led by Dr Paul Dane. In establishing the Melbourne Institute for Psycho-Analysis in October 1940, the group encountered opposition from both the Federal government and the local branch of the British Medical Association.
Although he never became a party member, Ellery was attracted to communism. During the early 1940s he published several pamphlets and books which prescribed communism as a panacea for mental and social ills.
From the start of his career when he reluctantly became a medical officer at Kew Asylum in 1923, Ellery had a progressive and provocative approach to his career. The following year, he became the subject of a Royal Commission into claims of misconduct and cruelty to patients, from which he was exonerated. When he went to Sunbury Asylum, he introduced malariotherapy, the first successful treatment, into Australia in 1925. He later had a leading role in the biological therapies, such as insulin coma and convulsive therapy.
Throughout his career, he continued to lobby for the rights of psychiatric patients, socialised medicine and for a more progressive understanding of the psychological nature of crime. In regard to the latter, he went public a number of times to say that he considered all judges biased.
He was involved in a number of criminal cases as a specialist psychiatric witness, most notably that of Arnold Sodeman. Despite Ellery's finding that he was not guilty due to insanity, Sodeman was hanged.
Ellery associated with members of the Heide set, influencing artists such as Sidney Nolan and Albert Tucker. He wrote articles for the Angry Penguins journal and spoke for the defence of Max Harris at the Ern Malley pornography trial.

Ken Walsh

Kenneth Marshall Walsh (born February 11, 1945) is an American former competition swimmer, two-time Olympic gold medalist, and former world record-holder.
Walsh was born in Orange, New Jersey, and grew up in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. He attended Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, where he swam for coach Charles McCaffree's Michigan State Spartans swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1965 to 1967. During his three-year college career, he received twelve All-American honors, and won Big Ten Conference championships in the 100-meter freestyle (1965, 1967), 200-meter freestyle (1967), and 4x100-meter freestyle relay (1967). As a college senior in 1967, he won the NCAA national championship in the 100-yard freestyle. Later that same year, he set a new world record (52.6 seconds) in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1967 Pan American Games.
At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Walsh won two gold medals in relay events and a silver medal in individual competition. He won the first of his two gold medals by swimming the anchor leg for the winning U.S. team in the men's 4x100-meter freestyle relay, together with teammates Zac Zorn, Stephen Rerych and Mark Spitz. He won his second gold medal by swimming the final freestyle leg for the first-place U.S. team in the men's 4x100-meter medley relay, together with teammates Charlie Hickcox (backstroke), Don McKenzie (breaststroke), and Doug Russell (butterfly). The two U.S. relay teams set new world records in both events. Walsh also captured a silver medal for his second-place performance (52.8 seconds) in the men's 100-meter freestyle event, finishing six tenths (0.60) of a second behind winner Mike Wenden of Australia, and two tenths (0.20) of a second ahead of fellow American Mark Spitz. Wenden set a new world record in the event, eclipsing Walsh's previous mark from 1967.

Walk Tall

"Walk Tall" is a song written by John Mellencamp which protests the Bush administration's policies. It can be found on his 2004 compilation "".
There are two versions of the song. The album version has the lyrics "So be careful of those killing in Jesus' name/ He don't believe in killing at all." The single version that was released to radio replaces those lines with: "And I wish you all a long sightline/ And the strength to walk tall." Mellencamp said the record company asked him to provide less controversial lyrics for the version sent out to radio stations to give the song a better chance of getting airplay. "'Walk Tall" was produced by Babyface, who also plays guitar and provides backing vocals on the song. 
In 2004, Mellencamp spoke to CMT about his inspiration for writing the song: "'Walk Tall' really was written ... you know, I heard Woody Guthrie say in some kind of documentary that it was important for him to write songs about people and try to make them feel good about themselves. He said, 'I ain't gonna write no more songs that would make anybody feel bad about themselves.' And I always kind of took that with me as a songwriter. I didn't always do that, but in today's world where there seems to be so much ... I don't know ... fear and hatred toward each other, it seemed like, 'If you can write an inspirational song, John, you should probably try to do it,' you know? So that's where that came from. That's how that song was written."
During a concert in July, 2006, former vice president Dan Quayle walked out as Mellencamp performed the song after he introduced it as being for "those being ignored by the current administration."

1911 Liverpool general transport strike

The 1911 Liverpool General Transport Strike involved dockers, railway workers and sailors, as well people from other trades. It paralysed Liverpool commerce for most of the summer of 1911. It also transformed trade unionism on Merseyside. For the first time, general trade unions were able to establish themselves on a permanent footing and become genuine mass organisations of the working class.
Strike action began on 14 June when the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union announced a nation-wide merchant seamen's strike. Solidarity action in support of the seamen led to other sections of workers coming out on strike. A strike committee - chaired by syndicalist Tom Mann - was formed to represent all the workers in dispute.
Many meetings were held on St. George's Plateau, next to St. George’s Hall on Lime Street, including the rally on 13 August where police baton charged a crowd of 85,000 people, who had gathered to hear Tom Mann speak. This became known as "Bloody Sunday". In the police charges and subsequent unrest that carried on through the following night, over 350 people were injured. 3,500 British troops were stationed in the city by this time. Two days later, soldiers of the 18th Hussars opened fire on a crowd on Vauxhall Road, injuring fifteen, two fatally: John Sutcliffe, a 19-year old Catholic carter, was shot twice in the head, and Michael Prendergast, a 30-year old Catholic docker, was shot twice in the chest. An inquest into their deaths later brought in a verdict of 'justifiable homicide'. .

2000 class railcar

The 2000/2100 class are a class of diesel railcars operated by TransAdelaide. They were built by Comeng, Granville in 1979/80.
History.
The 2000/2100 class are self-propelled diesel railcars operated by TransAdelaide on the Adelaide metropolitan rail network. The body shell design was based on the Budd SPV-2000, Metroliner and Amfleet cars but the 2000 class railcars have a slightly different curve to the Amfleet. The bodyshells were built by Comeng, Granville before they were railed to Adelaide for fitting out. They entered service in 1980. They acquired the nickname "Jumbos" due to the raised driving cab, similar to that of the Boeing 747. This raised cab was designed so that two passengers could sit at the front or rear window.
Twelve 2000 powercars and eighteen trailer cars were built. The powercars were originally powered by V12 turbocharged MAN engines that have since been replaced by two turbocharged 6 cylinder Cummins engines under the floor driving a Voith hydraulic transmission. They usually operate in 2-car (power-trailer) or 3-car (trailer-power-trailer) configurations.
As of 23 February 2014, these cars no longer run on the Belair and Seaford lines due to the electrification of the latter line. Today they only operate on the Gawler, Outer Harbor & Grange lines, with 29 of the original 30 railcars still in service.

Mike Burton (swimmer)

Michael Jay Burton (born July 3, 1947) is an American former swimmer, three-time Olympic champion, and former world record-holder who specialized in freestyle events.
When he was an eighth grader he was hit by a furniture truck while riding a bicycle with a friend. The accident caused injuries that made him have to quit contact sports. He loved to play football and basketball, but the accident made him want to be the best swimmer in the world. 
Burton graduated from El Camino Fundamental High School. At the 1967 University Games swimming competition in Tokyo, Japan, he won a gold medal in the 1,500-meter freestyle, ahead of Russian Semyon Belits-Geiman.
Burton won two gold medals in individual events at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City: the men's 400-meter freestyle and men's 1,500-meter freestyle. Four years later at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he became the only American ever to repeat as the 1,500-meter freestyle gold medalist, and he also recaptured the world record in the process. Burton's repeat proved a stunning win: in the spring of 1972, Burton had been diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, and at the U.S. Olympic Trials had barely made the Olympic Team, qualifying eighth for the final and then finishing third to make the team (at the time, a country could enter up to three athletes per event in swimming). 
The celebration in Munich of his historic repeat, however, was overshadowed by Mark Spitz's performance at those Games and by the terrorist attack on the Olympic Village, which occurred the day after his race. 
Burton coached the Seahawks in Billings, Montana at the local YMCA. His daughter Loni, embarked on a her own successful swimming career. She is one of just two swimmers in NCAA history to win twelve individual titles. She was able to perform the feat in just three years as Division II swimmers are eligible to participate in four individual events versus three in Division I and III.

Soda Stereo

Soda Stereo were an Argentine rock band, considered by critics to be the most important and influential Iberoamerican band of all time. This power trio, made up of Gustavo Cerati (lead vocals, guitars) Héctor "Zeta" Bosio (bass, backing vocals), and Charly Alberti (drums, percussion), achieved international success throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Soda Stereo was the first Latin rock group to achieve success throughout South and Central America, playing a key role in the popularization of the Rock en Español, Ibero-American rock, and Latin rock genres to a mainstream audience.
In their active 14-year career, Soda Stereo sold over 7 million albums in Latin America alone, this number continuing to increase after the separation of the band. In 2002 Soda Stereo was awarded the Legend Prize by MTV Latin America, the first prize of its kind to be awarded. Four of their albums were included on a list of the 250 Best Iberoamerican Albums of all time: "Canción Animal" (Nº 2), "Comfort y Música Para Volar" (Nº 15), "Signos" (Nº 40) and "Sueño Stereo" (Nº 41). Also, Rolling Stone has named "Sueño Stereo" the 4th greatest album in Latin rock history.
Soda's early sound was influenced by new wave bands such as Virus, The Police, Elvis Costello and post-punk bands such as Television. The band gradually evolved into a heavier sounding alternative rock band, eventually drawing influences from classic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, neo-psychedelia, britpop, and electronic music. In 1997, the band split due to personal and artistic differences among its members; the band, inactive for ten years, announced their mid-2007 return to make a single continental tour called "Gira Me Verás Volver" ("You Will See Me Return" Tour - referencing a lyric in the Doble Vida hit, "De Música Ligera"), in which more than one million fans gathered, the tour breaking several records for attendance and concert numbers in the process.
History.
Formation and early years: From "Los Estereotipos" to Soda Stereo (1982-1984).
In the summer of 1982 Gustavo Cerati, at 22 years of age, and Hector Zeta Bosio, at 23 years of age, collided at Punta del Este, Uruguay. At the time, both men were part of rock bands, Cerati with his group "Sauvage" and Bosio with "The Morgan", a band he shared with Sandra Baylac, Hugo Dop, Christian Hansen, Pablo Rodriguez,(of Los Auténticos Decadentes), Charly Amato, Osvaldo Kaplan, and Andres Calamaro. Cerati and Bosio, each drawn together by the other's musical tastes, established a friendship and a musical bond that encouraged them to start playing together. Cerati first joined Bosio's group "The Morgan", then formed "Stress" with Charly Amato and drummer Pablo Guadalupe, also working on the project "Erekto" with fellow bandmate Andres Calamaro. Both projects did not meet Cerati's expectations, however, and both fell through.
At the time, Carlos Ficcichia (who would later become known as Charly Alberti) would incessantly call Cerati's house asking for Maria Laura Cerati, Gustavo's sister. Alberti wanted to ask her out, but she thought he was too "pesado" (stiff) and did not want to go out with him. In one instance when Gustavo answered the phone, he entered a lengthy conservation about music with Alberti, who then mentioned that he was a drummer, and the son of the famous jazz drummer, Tito Alberti, known to many as the songwriter of a well known Argentine children's song, "El Elefante Trompita" (lit. ""Little Trunk Elephant""). After hearing Alberti play, Cerati and Bosio asked him to join the band, but first he had to cut his hair.
After a few experiments (Aerosol, Side Car) the three adopted the name "Los Estereotipos" (The Stereotypes), the name referencing a song by The Specials which they had passionately been listening to for several months. During this time period they would record a demo, with Richard Coleman on guitars. Soda initially recruited Coleman to "beef up" the guitar sound, but Coleman recognized that the band sounded better without him and quit on good terms, leaving the definitive trio of Gustavo Cerati, Zeta Bosio, and Charly Alberti. The songs recorded were, "Porque No Puedo Ser Del Jet Set?" (Why Can't I be Part of the Jet Set?), "Dime Sebastian" (Tell Me Sebastian), and "Debo Soñar" (Must Dream) by Ulises Butrón, in which Ulises Butrón played guitars and Daniel Melero played keyboards. 
The band, regretting using cliches in their band name (claiming that "Los" in a rock-band name was overused), would often brainstorm random words and write them down, an university pastime for Cerati and Bosio; humorously, the word "soda" was written down, as Cerati would often drink copious amounts of soda during band rehearsals. Eventually, the word "Stereo" was also written down, and the two were joined together to form "Soda Stereo".
Regarding the meaning and use of the word "soda:"
Stereo has said that they make music with bubbles. But instead of referring to luxurious champagne bubbles, they affirm that they assume the representative ordinary and popular Sifón, or carbonated soft drinks
The first show under the name "Soda Stereo" occurred on December 1982. The occasion was Alfredo Lois birthday party. Lois was Cerati and Bosio's university classmate. He would go on to become Soda's video director as well as their visual and stylistic guru. Lois was later recognized by Cerati himself as "the fourth Soda".
In July 1983 the band made their debut at the discothèque Airport in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Belgrano. According to the band:
Our debut was at a fashion show at the Disco Airport, which was close to where we practiced in Buenos Aires. Nobody gave us a nod. The three of us played on a very deficient sound system. But we were happy, even though no one paid attention. We really looked like a punk group, we didn't know how to play and the sound was loud, even though it was just that
Following that gig, Soda Stereo began to play the underground circuit of Buenos Aires, making a name for themselves alongside other emerging bands of the time, such as "Sumo", "Los Twist", "Los Encargados" (with Daniel Melero), and other bands. Soda took up residency at the traditional and deteriorated Cabaret Marabú, located at Maipú 359. In those early shows, Soda would play songs like "Héroes de la Serie" (Heroe of the series), "La Vi Parada Alli" (I saw her standing there), and "Vamos a La Playa" (Let's go to the beach), along with other songs that appeared on their second demo. On one occasion at the Café Einstein, Luca Prodan approached Cerati, whom he considered "a chetito," and joined Soda in a cover of a Police song.
The band began to attract a bit of notoriety. One night they were called to a pub to substitute for the group Nylon. There began a period of constant shows which concluded at Bar Zero, a place that excluded the Porteño underground, along with Café Einstein. On their third show, Horacio Martinez, a historic Argentine rock producer and "talent hunter" heard them and quickly took them to record for CBS. This came to fruition in 1984 when Soda signed to the Rodríguez Ares agency.
At the time Soda Stereo was already known as being a band that worked hard on their image and long before the recording of their first album they decided to film a video clip, which they financed with their own money. was in charge of the visuals and the graphic designs featured on the fliers and posters for their live performances. It was Alfredo who decided to edit a video clip before the release of the album, something that is quite common today but totally unusual for the time. The song chosen was "Dietético" (Dietetic). The filming was realized with "borrowed" equipment from Cablevision, where Zeta Bosio worked as a production assistant.
First Album and Chateau Rock '85 (1984-1985).
Soda Stereo recorded their debut during the second half of 1984. The album was produced by Federico Moura, vocalist for Virus. By that time, Moura and Cerati had developed a fruitful artistic relationship. The recording took place in the defunct studios of CBS on Paraguay street. The end result was cooler sound than of the live shows, which the bands were pleased with. The trio was aided by Daniel Melero on keys and Gonzo Palacios on sax. Both were listed as "guest musicians," a practice which would become common for Soda throughout their career. Such guest musicians would be recognized by the public as the "fourth Sodas".
The attention garnered by Soda was manifested in their playing of larger and larger venues. First was "La Esquina Del Sol" in Palermo. "El Recital De Los Lagos" on the 1st and 2 December was their first multi-headlining show with top Argentine acts . The show was hosted by Argentinean Television personality Juan Alberto Badía.
Soda Stereo presented their debut album at El Teatro Astros on 14 December 1984, it was their first show there. The stage was designed by Alfredo Lois, who for the occasion located 26 television sets in the background. The TV's were turned on and out of sync with each other - the theme of "Sobredosis de TV" (TV Overdose). The TV's, together with a large amount of smoke, created an unusual but captivating visual effect
On 26 January 1985 Soda played the Rock in Bali festival in Argentine port city of Mar del Plata. On the 17th of March they played the Festival Chateu Rock '85 at the Estadio Olímpico Chateau Carreras in Córdoba Province. The official biography of the band attach great importance to this appearance indicating that the band played for 15 thousand people and that they were the revelation of the festival.
However, Córdoba media outlets claim that, "only half the number of people actually showed up and that Soda were hardly noticed because their first record had was just released a few months earlier." They also added "Raul Porchetto was the biggest draw of the night". Regardless, their presence at Chateau sparked a personal relationship between the band the youth of Córdoba, it marked the moment that the band began to take flight toward national stardom.
The success of the band began at a very pecuiliar time, related, on the one hand with the return of democracy to Argentina (December 10, 1983), and on the other hand, with increasing notions of postmodernism, particularly in the way the '80s youth created their role in a newly democratic society, one that had just emerged from bloody Dictatorship and War.
Years later, Zeta Bosio would reflect on this juncture:
The democracy produced the adrenalin of something new, something was occurring, I knew I was going to make changes without knowing how. There was more air for us to make things and to wander, and we were a band of kids that wanted to make trouble. Our attention was on punk and on trying to show that there was something else that was more direct
On the 13th of October of that year, Soda played in front of a large audience in Buenos Aires as part of the third night of the Festival of Rock and Pop Held at the José Amalfitani Stadium home of the soccer club Velez Sarsfield . They shared the stage with INXS, Nina Hagen, Charly García, Virus, and Sumo, among others. By then Fabian "Vön" Quintero and Gonzo Palacios were "stable guests."
Nada Personal and Obras 1985-1986.
Soda's second álbum Nada Personal was edited on October 1985. During the summer the group toured the touristic centers of Argentina, playing in Mar de Plata, Villa Gesell, and Pinamar. Finalizing the tour with a consecrating concert at the Festival De la Falda in Córdoba, which featured Andres Calamaro and Charly García on keyboards on "Jet Set."
In April the band decided to officially present the album at a concert at the Estadio Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires. There they did four shows with a total attendance of 20,000 spectators. Footage from the first show was edited into a long play video, the noted music critic and founder of the groundbreaking Rock & Pop Radio in Buenos Aires, thus ending his chronicle of the concert, had this to say:
"We are facing the most powerful group in the country ... The best parameter to measure this presentation is that it was short, it seemed to have lasted ten minutes or so and people were left wanting more. The outpouring of the stadium was a general murmur of the songs from Soda Stereo. The rain, the traffic on Avenida del Libertador was cluttered by those entering and leaving. The last hot dog of the night and a healthy sense of well being, leave no room for existential questions. I then put my jaw back in place and went singing softly "Estoy Azulado" between the rain on Libertador. "
After these concerts records sales began to increase at an accelerated rate, quickly passing the Gold certification that they had achieved during the summer, platinum certification, and finally double platinum in the following months. Without abandoning the danceable rhythms, the second LP resulted in more depth in the lyrics and a melodical maturity. The album marked the definitive consecration of Soda Stereo to the Argentine public.
The Conquest of Latin America (1986-1989).
In 1986 Soda Stereo realized their first Latin American tour, called Signos - still touring with the Nada Personal record. The band played in Colombia, Costa Rica Peru, and Chile with considerable success. In Chile they realized four shows in Santiago, on the 21,22,24, and 25 November, and one in Valparaíso on the 22nd of November of 86 In November 1986 Soda arrived in Peru for the first time and revolutionized the market. Their album sales were enormous and their three shows at the Amauta Coliseum were unforgettable.
At that time Latin Rock was not that popular with the youth of Latin America (with the exceptions of Argentina and Uruguay) and bands were not accustomed to international tours.
On 10 November 1986 the band released their third album "Signos". "Signos" with its lead single "Persiana Americana" (American Blinds) was a key step for Soda Stereo who by now had come under a great deal of stress due to ever increasing factors: sales expectations, external pressures, the risk of failure, and internal tensions. The band was joined in the studio by Fabián Vön Quintiero on keys, Richard Coleman on guitar and Celsa Mel Gowland on back up vocals. Signos became the first Argentine Rock album to be released on Compact Disc. It was manufactured in the Netherlands and distributed throughout Latin America.
On the 3rd of December Soda made their first appearance in Ecuador. In early 1987 Soda returned to Chile, this time to the Viña del Mar International Song Festival where they won the prize "Antorcha de Plata" (Silver Torch). The festival was broadcast via television to many Latin American countries, expanding the band's fame throughout the continent. It did not take long to transform itself into a massive unconditional following which was called "Sodamania".
On 23 April 1987, Soda broke records for ticket sales in Paraguay with their show at the Yacht Club. Meanwhile "Signos" reached Platinum status in Argentina, triple platinum in Perú and double platinum in Chile. Soda's first show in Mexico occurred on the 4th of August in 1987 at the Magic Circus in Mexico City.
The Signos tour was a milestone for Soda as they played 22 concerts in 17 cities to almost 350,000 fans, in the process opening up the idea that Latin Rock can transcend the nationalities of the bands, something that would come to fruition in the upcoming decade. With live recordings from different shows, a live album Ruido Blanco was compiled in 1987. Mixed in Barbados, it was considered by Rolling Stone (Argentina) to be one of the top 5 live albums of Argentine Rock
In late 1988 Soda began to work on a new album alongside Puerto Rican producer Carlos Alomar. Alomar had worked with David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Simple Minds, Iggy Pop, and Paul McCartney, among others. "Doble Vida" (Double Life) was recorded and mixed in New York City. It was the first record by an Argentine band to be completely recorded abroad.
The album produced four singles, "Picnic en el 4B" (Picnic in Room 4b), "En la Ciudad de la Furia" (In the City of Fury), and "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)" (That Which Bleeds (The Dome), and "Corazon Delator" (Tell-Tale Heart). The video for "En La Ciudad de La Furia" was a finalist for an MTV Video Award in the category of best foreign video (there was no Latin MTV at the time).
After more than a year without playing in Buenos Aires, Soda showcased "Doble Vida" at the hockey field at Obras in front of 25,000 fans. To top of a stellar year, Soda headlined the Three Days for Democracy Festival, which took place in Buenos Aires on the intersection of Avenida del Libertador and 9 de Julio. The show was attended by 150,000 people and Soda shared the stage with Luis Alberto Spinetta Fito Páez, Los Ratones Paranoicos, Man Ray, and others.
With sales of a million copies of "Doble Vida" under their belt, Soda began a massive tour in early 1989. The tour began with 30 shows in Argentina, covering most of the country, which were attended by nearly 270,000 thousand fans. These shows were followed by a new Latin American tour (their third), which cemented a massive following in Mexico.
Near the end of 1989 Soda records a new version of "Languis" (from "Doble Vida") and a new song titled "Mundo de Quimeras" (World of Chimeras). Both songs were released in the EP Languis (1989) along with remixes of "En El Borde" and "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)". Following the release of Languis Soda played two sold out shows at The Palace in Los Angeles, becoming the second Rock en Español to play in the United States, following Miguel Mateos.
The Consecration: Canción animal (1990-1991).
In early 1990 the band co-headlined a show for 32,000 people with British new wave band Tears for Fears at the Jose Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires.
Soda Stereo then traveled to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida to begin work on their fifth album. They would enlist the help of Daniel Melero, Andrea Álvarez, and Tweety González (all very important figures in the Argentine rock scene of the time.
The resulting album "Canción Animal"(1990) is considered to be one of the best albums in the history of Latin rock. It contains their best known song "De Música Ligera" (Of Light Music), as well as other classics such as "Cancion Animal" (Animal Song), "Un Million de Años Luz" (A Million Light Years), "En el Septimo Dia" (On the Seventh Day), and "Te Para Tres" (Tea For Three). These songs are considered to be the band's strongest and at the same time are their most popular. Overall, the album is considered as the most consistent work by the band, along with "Signos".
Their Massive Tour "Animal" (1990–1991) included 30 Argentine cities, many which had not been visited by a band with the reach of Soda Stereo. The cities visited in Argentina were: San Juan, Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz, Junín, Clorinda, Puerto Iguazú, Trelew, Neuquén, Santa Rosa, Trenque Lauquen Mendoza, Córdoba, Río Cuarto, Santiago del Estero, San Miguel de Tucumán, Salta, Rosario, Buenos Aires, Olavarria, Pergamino. International cities included: Santiago de Chile, Asunción, Punta del Este, Barquisimeto, Caracas, Valencia, Mérida, San Cristóbal, Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Mexicali, and Tijuana.
The Tour "Animal" finished with 14 consecutive shows at the Grand Rex Theater in Buenos Aires. With a 3,300 person capacity, this was a noticeable achievement at the time. Some of the Grand Rex shows would appear on the live EP "Rex Mix" (1991), which included remixed versions of a new song, "No Necesito Verte (Para Saberlo)" (I don't Need to See You - To Know).
By late 1991 Soda's continental success brought the band to the attention of MTV News Europe who began to take notice of what was taking place in Latin America, particularly with Rock en Español. MTV unconditionally dedicated a whole show to Soda - a first for non English singing band.
In May 1992 Soda embarked on a tour of Spain with shows in Madrid, Oviedo, Sevilla, Valencia, and Barcelona.The lackluster results of the Spanish tour, compared to the fervor they were accustomed to in Latin America, left a sour taste in their mouths. Nevertheless, it did serve as a valid experience, specifically in bringing the band back to earth. To put it bluntly: Spain was in no way a failure, but was far from the success that Soda had been used to in Latin America, in the end it was a good learning experience.
The Experimentation: Dynamo (1992-1994).
After that moment, Soda came to the realization that they were at the center of the scene. Therefore, they decided to give some space to the musical experimentation and openly propel what would be known as "La Movida Sonica" (The Sonic Movement). Nearing the end of 1992 Soda released their sixth studio album "Dynamo". "Dynamo" was christened with six concerts at Obras. Each show featured a different band as support, Babasónicos, Juana La Loca, Martes Menta and Tia Newton, The Sonic Movement of which Demonios de Tasmania and los Brujos would also be part of. This would be derivative of something called "El Nuevo Rock Argentino" (The New Argentine Rock). Massacre, and El Otro Yo were also considered part of the movement. The band also showcased the album in its entirety in a local talk-show, "Fax". This was the first stereophonic TV transmission in Argentina.
According to Gustavo Cerati, "Dynamo" consisted of taking "Canción Animal" and destroying it." Cerati explains, "It is as if we took "Canción Animal" and put it under water. And, at a sonic level, we wanted to produce that, the songs had more to do with something hypnotic. The idea was to remix it, to mix it with something more dance and include something more trance in our music. I know that those who understood that record loved it and it is the same with me.
According to AllMusic "Dynamo",was Soda's least popular album and at the same time their most experimental work. Dynamo did not sell as expected, in large part because the band decided to change record company immediately after recording it. Sony at the time, had no intentions of promoting a group that had just emigrated from BMG and BMG could not promote another foreign product.
In January 1993 Soda began their sixth tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico] Chile, Paraguay, and Venezuela. During the middle of the tour, the trio decided to take a long rest which fueled rumors of a break up. There had been talk of dates in the United States, Spain and other countries, but diverse factors during late 1993 and early 1994 forced the group to take a "rest" from Soda Stereo.
1994 was the worst year for Soda. On the 4th of July, Zeta's young son died in an absurd transit accident in Argentina. This event would deeply affect Zeta on both a personal and professional level. By unanimous decision Soda decided to distance themselves from the myth for a while and at the same time to evaluate the possibility of a definitive separation.
During this hiatus, Gustavo released his first solo project: "Amor Amarillo" (Yellow Love), (ironically, Gustavo had mentioned that he had no interest in a solo career). Zeta dedicated himself to the production of other bands (Peligrosos Gorriones and Aguirre). Charly disappeared from the music scene to focus on personal projects.
At the end of 1994 "Zona de Promesas", a compilation of remixes and classic Soda songs, including the unreleased song that gave the album its name, was released,
Sueño Stereo (Stereo Dream) (1995-1997).
After a three year absence, on 29 June 1995, Soda release Sueño Stereo (Stereo Dream), their 7th and final studio album. The album was an instant hit quickly reaching platinum disc in Argentina 15 days after its release. The album was powered by the radio hit "Zoom" and the promotional video for "Ella usó mi cabeza como un revólver" (She Used My Head Like a Revolver), which in 1996 won the viewers choice award presented by MTV Latin America. This was a maximum accolade given that this award at the time, since the actual award would not be established until 2002 for Latin MTV.
According to Cerati:
Sueño Stereo took two years to conceive. It would be illogical to say that this was Soda's masterpiece, but it was the most real expression by the group at the time, because we were stripped of the need of having a group in the future, or of being the best for another ten years. We had already passed through a lot of things and the band itself felt classic. On the other hand, we were very proud of what Dynamo had promoted and its subsequent interpretation. Then, Sueño Stereo had the pressure of not pressuring us. The band had to deliver something important, it couldn't be a little record. Besides, we had to find ourselves again after a while and allow the music to flow, without thinking too much about taking or step or something like that. In the end, Sueño Stereo is one of the most innovative records of our career, without us trying to make it so -because of its sonic combinations, its lyrics, and because of its sound.
The record became the catalyst for the extensive Gira Sueño Stereo (Sueño Stereo Tour), which began on September 8 in Buenos Aires, at the Grand Rex Theater. It went to Venezuela, Colombia, Perú, Panama, México and the United States (Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Miami). The tour ended on 24 April 1996 at the Teatro Teletón in Santiago de Chile.
In mid 1996 Soda was invited to Miami by MTV to record a session for MTV's acoustic show, MTV Unplugged. After a few refusals by the band, Soda was able to convince the network to accept an offer where the band would play plugged in, but with modifications such as orchestration including new arrangements of some of their classic songs. The result was an eclectic mix of music, some electric, some acoustic, but all bearing the Soda Signature style. A highlight of the album was a soaring rendition of "En La Ciudad De La Furia." where the chorus was sung by Andrea Echeverri of the Colombian Rock en Español band Aterciopelados. Other songs recorded were, "Un Misil en Mi Placard" (re-arranged in a style that directly palgiarised the 1992 track 'Chrome Waves' by English band Ride) "Entre Canibales", "Cuando pase el temblor", Té Para Tres","Angel Electrico", "Terapia de Amor Intensiva", "Disco Eterno", "Ella usó mi cabeza como un revólver", "Paseando Por Roma" and "Génesis" (A cover of Vox Dei). The recording of the MTV show were partially released on the album "Comfort y Música Para Volar" (Comfort and Music to Fly By) (1996), and in its entirety in a new version of Comfort released in 2007. The album cointained 4 new tracks from the Sueño Stereo sessions as well as an interactive cd-rom with pictures and videos from the show.
On 30 October 1996 Soda Stereo became the first Latin American band to transmit a live concert via the internet, via the Argentine radio program Cuál Es? (Which is?). The show was conducted by Mario Pergolini on Argentina Rock & Pop radio. The band played live from the music store Promúsica in BuenoS Aires.
Band Breakup and El Último Concierto (1997).
A long silence preceded the final farewell, except for band's participation on a Rock En Español Tribute album, Tribute a Queen: Los Grandes del Rock en Español. Soda covered "Someday One Day," from Queen's 1974 album, Queen II, and sung it in Spanish, as "Algun Dia."
Finally, in May 1997 Soda officially announced their separation through a press release. The following day, Argentinie newspapers echoed the news. The Argentine daily Clarín devoted a large front page spread to the breakup. The following day, Gustavo Cerati's farewell note was published on the Clarín supplement for juveniles "Yes." The farewell letter read:
These lines were inspired from what I have seen on the street these days, fans who have approached me, the people around me, and from my own personal experience. I share the sadness that has been created in many by our separation. I, myself, am immersed in that state because few things have been so important to me in my life as Soda Stereo. Everyone knows that it is impossible to lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the battle of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did. But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium. At that juncture, excuses are generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in as we did in the past. To end for the health of the band is, in its redundancy, to enforce value to our mental health and above all to show respect for all of our fans who followed us for such a long time. Goodbye.
The band carried on with a farewell tour, making stops in Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile. Their last concert took place on 20 September at the River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires was recorded and released in two parts, "El Último Concierto" A and B. A DVD of the farewell show was released in 2005. The show ended with the song "De Musica Ligera" and a memorable farewell by Cerati,
"¡No solo no hubiéramos sido nada sin ustedes, sino con toda la gente que estuvo a nuestro alrededor desde el comienzo; algunos siguen hasta hoy! ¡Gracias totales!"
"Not only we would not have been anything without you, but without all of the people that were around us since the beginning; some continue till this day! Thanks a lot!"
A compilation CD was released later that year titled "Chau Soda" ("Bye Soda"); it contains the most elaborated version of "Signos".
Post Soda.
Regardless of the constant rumors of a reunion, which ironically started shortly after the breakup, little was heard regarding Soda, except for a TV special on "El Ultimo Concierto" (The Last Concert) produced by HBO and an MTV documentary titled Soda Stereo: La Leyenda (Soda Stereo: The Legend). Finally, in 2002 the trio was reunited at the MTV Latin Music Video Awards where they were awarded the Legend award in honor of their musical and visual trajectory.
Seven years after the breakup and the absence of any new official releases seemed odd. Near the end of 2003 Sony Music announced the release of the first DVD by Soda Stereo, on that contained much unreleased material from compiled by Gustavo, Zeta, Charly, and people close to the band.
The finished product arrived on the streets on November 2004. It was titled, Soda Stereo: Una Parte de La Euforia (1983–1997) (Soda Stereo: A Part of the Euphoria (1983–1997)). On September 20, 2005 an Argentine DVD of Soda's last concert, which took place exactly 8 years before at River Plate stadium was released. It was titled El Ultimo Concierto (En Vivo) (The Last Concert – Live). The DVD, in contrast to the HBO production, featured a 5.1 audio and included two songs that were not aired on the HBO concert, "Juego de Seduccion" and "Sobredosis de TV." It also included a multi camera option for a soundcheck of "Primavera 0" and a 25 minute documentary about the tour featuring footage of sound checks and concerts in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina. It also featured an interview with the long lost "fourth Soda" Alfredo Lois, the director of the DVD, one his last works before his death.
Me Verás Volver (2007).
The reunification of Soda stereo was a mandatory topic for journalists whenever faced with a former member. So much so, that Zeta Bosio once declared:
One day I dreamed that I was not going to be asked about a Soda reunion!.
In 2007, ten years after the breakup, the band decides to reunite for one time with the goal of accomplishing a grand continental tour. On 6 June 2007, the official news came out: Soda Stereo will return to the stage with a sole American tour called "Me Veras Volver" (You Will See Me Return), a phrase that's emblematic of their song "En La Ciudad de la Furia"
In early July Sony/BMG released a new compilation album titled "Me Verás Volver (Hits & +)". The CD contained 18 studio recordings remastered in 2007. The CD did not contain any new material but it did contain a code to receive exclusive web footage such as live versions. The album reached number one in Argentina and Chile.
On the September 20, 2007, exactly 10 years since their final concert, Soda Stereo gave a long awaited press conference at the Club Museum in Peru St., Buenos Aires, in a historical building designed at the turn of the century by the famous French architect and structural engineer Gustave Eiffel. This was the same building which years before was used as the location for their video of "En La Ciudad De La Furia". They surprised those there with a mini concert of two songs, "Sobredosis de TV" and "En La Ciudad de La Furia," played in their original form. The song were played solely by the three of them. During the press conference the trio clarified that after the tour they intend on resuming their individual pursuits.
The tour was scheduled to begin on October 19 at River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires, and originally only two concerts were scheduled as well as performances in several American countries. However, from the time the tickets went on sale it became apparent that the original program would be completely overwhelmed and that the band was faced with a huge continent-wide cultural event. The first two shows sold out in only 24 hours (a total of 90,000 tickets). The band quickly added one more show to the schedule, and after three days, the tickets for the first three shows were sold out, so two more shows were added.
Finally on 19 October 2007, the time came for the triumphant return of Soda Stereo at the River Plate Stadium in Argentina. A massive banner that contained a large sentence with the name of their songs intertwined was unveiled.
The band was accompanied by one of the main "fourth Soda's" Tweety Gonzalez (keyboards), as well as Leandro Fresco (keyboards, percussion, and backing vocals), and Leo Garcia on guitars and backing vocals. The concert lasted more than three hours. Soda played a total of 28 songs. The show opened with a recording of "Algun Dia" their cover of Queen's "Someday One Day" meanwhile images of the history of Soda Stereo appeared in the background.
The expected amount of fans attending the five shows was more than 300,000, making Soda Stereo one of the most watched public events in the history of Argentina. Soda became the only band to play more than five times in the Estadio Monumental in Argentina in a single tour. Me Verás Volver featured 22 concerts throughout America including three shows in the US -all but two were sold out.
In October 2007 Sony/BMG released Comfort Y Música Para Volar on DVD. The DVD included all of the songs recorded for the MTV unplugged session.
On 21 December 2007 the last concert was held at the River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires. Three extra songs were played for this show, "Si No Fuera Por," "Terapia de Amor Intensiva," and "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)." The band was joined by Andrea Álvarez for "Picnic en el 4B", Richard Coleman for "No Existes", Fabián "Zorrito Vön" Quintiero for "Danza Rota" and "Profugos", Carlos Alomar for "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)" and "Terapia de Amor Intensiva," and Gillespie for "Signos" and "Fue." Cerati returned to use his famous expression "gracias totales," and after playing "De Musica Ligera." Finally, Cerati played the riff of "Sueles Dejarme Solo" and smashed his guitar.
Influences.
The main influence that Soda Stereo received during their career was of British rock. Among the most influential artists for the band sound are The Beatles and solo careers of George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon; The Police, The Cure, Television, Talking Heads, Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Virus, XTC, The Specials, Squeeze, Pink Floyd, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Queen (in 1997 band recorded tribute song "Algún día"), My Bloody Valentine and Cocteau Twins.
Legacy.
Soda Stereo has been repeatedly considered the legendary Latin rock band. It was the first band to come out strongly in the local limits of their country of origin and to consider Latin America as a unified cultural space for the language, including the U.S.. The result was a popular and widespread identification of Latino youth, above countries, which was made for the Anglo-Saxon rock, but not for the Latin rock, rock in Spanish and Latin American rock, different variants the same cultural-musical phenomenon.
In Argentina, a country with a long tradition of Spanish rock mass with a strong local identity (which is called "rock nacional"(national rock)), Soda Stereo was the beginning of a globalization that incorporated local musicians in a great continental power rock up point lead to local analysts to wonder whether "Does it make sense to keep talking about "rock nacional"?". In many parts of Latin America, including Colombia, ""Soda Stereo said musicality and poise of a new generation, sought to differentiate themselves from the 'thirties eighties' who liked the Dominican merengue, to begin to listen and sing rock in Spanish."" In Chile, Soda not only marked a whole generation with his look, his lyrics and music but the intense emotional relationship developed between the band and its fans, was a decisive factor for "de-nationalize" the group and make it an expression, and not only young people in a particular country, but youth as a sector uniform social issues and common languages, something that rock and roll had not been achieved so far in the Spanish-speaking countries due to language barrier.
Carlos Polimeni told the reporter in an interview: "I was on tour with them. I saw them as heroes disembark and whites were singing in Castilian. " Something which, however, he stressed, did not prevent the first major success was obtained continental "Cuando pase el temblor", a huayno–carnavalito in Andean rock line.
Something similar happened in Peru and Ecuador where the cultural impact of the band has been regarded as "the most important event in the history of rock from those countries placing the band in the collective memory of Latin American music. A similar effect in Nicaragua said that "no one doubts that Soda Stereo is the cornerstone of rock history in Latin America ...» In 1988, Zeta Bosio and the phenomenon commented in a press conference in Venezuela:
"We went to Argentina and started going to Chile, Peru, started climbing and in some countries it happened, we got us and had never been a rock band. They told us that here was a thing of another world and it would not work ... Now is a joy to see what works and what is his own power".
But the multiplier effect of Soda Stereo, beyond their own individual success, as the Latin rock original myth as such, would be concentrated mainly in Mexico. Polimeni is the Argentine who said:
"(It was Soda Stereo) that aroused the Mexican rock. Dozens of groups reacted Mexican: Why do not we do this that come to the Argentine groups? And that erupted in mid 80's in rock, in my view, is the richest and settled across the continent".
Of course the musical-cultural phenomenon that expressed Soda Stereo in Latin America exceeds the band and is inserted into the underlying reasons related to youth identity, that have made rock and roll a global cultural movement, as well as conditions Latin American cultural youth from the decade of the 80 (out of dictatorships, globalization, postmodernism, information society, exacerbating social inequalities.) When Soda Stereo starred in continental Latin rock explosion, every country in Latin America was a breeding ground, made of a new movement of bands ", as it is called in Venezuela.
In the manner of The Beatles and "Beatlemania", Soda Stereo was the band that made it just at the right time, creating aesthetic-linguistic bridges to connect Spanish-speaking youth with the global phenomenon of rock and roll. For this reason the term "sodamanía", used repeatedly to describe the effect of soda on young Latinos, is not inappropriate.
The decisive influence of Soda Stereo Latin rock music on the decades of 90 and early twenty-first century has been reflected in the opinion of the leading musicians of the continent:
In 2002 he created the MTV Latin Awards, a milestone that reflected the identity and the international level reached by the Latin American music, after two decades of growth. As reviewed Latin American press "the most memorable moment of the night was when the Legend Award was awarded to Soda Stereo, the most important and influential band of Rock in Spanish of all time".
Solo work.
Gustavo Cerati.
Cerati worked with Daniel Melero in the 1992 album "Colores Santos", he co-wrote and produced most of the songs and although the album was never formally presented, two singles were released, "Vuelta por el Universo" and "Hoy Ya No Soy Yo". Cerati's second solo album was "Amor Amarillo" (1993), it contained collaborations by Zeta Bosio and Cerati's (then) wife Cecilia Amenábar.
After Soda's separation, Cerati released the studio albums "Amor Amarillo" (1993), "Bocanada" (1999), "+Bien" (2001) and "Siempre Es Hoy" (2002). In 2002 he released "11 Episodios Sinfónicos" that contained some Soda Stereo and solo songs played live with a symphony orchestra. Cerati also released electronic music as Plan V, and other projects. "Ahí Vamos!" (2006), is considered as a back-to-basics return. His last album to date is Fuerza Natural (2009), which changes several things about his previous albums and has been very well received by fans and critics. In May 2010, Cerati suffered an aneurysm/brain damage, and unfortunately his career has been paused up to now (2014).
He also produced albums for other artists, such as Nicole, Leo García and Altocamet, as well as for the band Friccion, in which he was a guitarist in the 1980s. Cerati was also featured in Shakira's songs "The Day and the Time" and "No" in 2005.
Zeta Bosio.
Bosio has had a low profile over the years. He is working with Proyecto Under, an online portal for musicians, and performing as a DJ. He also produced albums with many bands, such as Aguirre and Peligrosos Gorriones. In a recent interview, he declared that he has no interest to play in a band. He is also the artistic director of an independent label, Alerta Records.
In 1997 he produced "Nacion Hip Hop", a CD compilation of local underground rap artists that is considered the founding stone of Argentine's hip hop scene. He also worked closely with hip hop act Tumbas (who opened for Soda Stereo in their last concert) and DJ Tortuga, who later became part of the experimental hip hop trio Koxmoz.
Charly Alberti.
Alberti released one studio album without Soda Stereo in 1994, "Plum", along with his then girlfriend, supermodel Deborah de Corral, and since 1997 Alberti became interested in informatics, he was involved in running his company Cybrel Digital Entertainment, that aimed at generating and implementing content based technologies. He was named an Applemaster for his contributions to the music world.
In 1998, he started two new projects, URL Magazine, a culture magazine, and URL Records, a discographic label. He is also the founder of YeYeYe and Musike, two portals about music and entertainment.
Alberti recently formed another rock band with his brother, Andrés Alberti, and recorded their first album named as the band, "MOLE". Alberti stated that he does not want Mole's sound to sound like Soda Stereo, he wants "Mole to live by itself."

Handsworth Rugby Union Football Club

Handsworth Rugby Football Club is a junior rugby club formed in 1887, originally in the area of Birmingham known as Handsworth but with its ground now in nearby Walsall.
History.
The exact origins of Handsworth Rugby Club are unclear. However, according to old newspapers, reported statements and speeches it seems certain that Handsworth Football Club (Rugby Rules) existed in 1870, a year before the founding of the Rugby Union. They played on a field in Heathfield Road, Handsworth and had regular fixtures with Moseley and Gloucester. During 1874-75, Handsworth appears on the fixture card of Coventry RFC. The club then went through a lean period, before a more settled club was formed during 1886 and the Club Captain was Charlie Greener.
In 1887, the club secured a piece of land at Brownes Green in Handsworth and the members laid the pitch and converted scaffold poles into goal posts. The changing rooms were situated at the Lamp Tavern Public House, Hamstead Road. The first President was Mr W.G.Griffiths.
During the 1887/88 season, George Wade joined the Club. In June 1891 he made his first professional stage appearance as George Robey. George was to become one of the most successful comedians of the music hall stage, securing the nickname of The Prime Minister of Mirth.
During the 1880s, Handsworth was still part of Staffordshire, hence the adoption of the Staffordshire Knot on the club tie. The club's playing shirt and colours were formally adopted at the AGM on 15 September 1905, although the records show that the players had been using red and white hooped shirts since 1894.
In December 1904, Handsworth became involved in a national scandal that became known as The Parsons Affair. The club was fined £5 plus expenses of £8 19s 8d, for playing A T Parsons who was ineligible to play rugby union as he had previously represented Hull Kingston Rovers,a rugby league team, under the name of Robinson.
In 1905, T B Batchelor joined as a holiday member, and was the club's only England International, playing against France before of a crowd of 6,000 at Richmond, with England winning 41 to 13.
In the 1912 season, J.M.C. 'Clem' Lewis played for the club against Moseley, inspiring a rare victory against illustrious rivals. Clem, described as "one of the finest players who ever wore a Handsworth jersey", played for Wales against England on 20 January 1912 (lost 8-0). In the 1913 international, he played against Scotland (won 8-0) scoring one try and kicking one conversion; France (won 11-8) scoring one try and kicking one conversion; Ireland (won 16-3). In 1914, England (lost 9-10), Scotland (won 24-5), France (won 31-0), Ireland (won 11-3) kicking one conversion and scoring one drop goal. In 1923, he captained Wales for two matches against England (lost 7-3) and Scotland (11-8).
Following World War I, the club moved grounds several times looking for a permanent home, including: Brownes Green, Worlds End Lane, a piece of land at the bottom of Hampstead Hill (changing rooms at The Beaufort Arms Public House) and Perry Barr Stadium. This period of instability lasted until after the Second World War, when the club was offered the opportunity to purchase a field next to the Birmingham Road, Walsall. The Birmingham Road land was eventually bought in January 1948, and the first changing rooms were ex-army huts, soon to be known as George Lewis Erection after the purchaser of said huts. The first game at the new ground was on 11 September 1948 against Standard Motors of Coventry. Handsworth lost 3-19. The first home victory was on 16 October 1948 against Hinckley, 8-3.
In March 1973, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council finally gave planning permission for a new Club House to be built. Work began on 5 February 1974 and the building was finally opened on 15 September 1974.
On 26 September 1986, the club celebrated its centenary with a Centenary Dinner at the Grand Hotel, Birmingham. The club was honoured by the presence of A A Grimsdale, President Rugby Football Union, Mike Gibson, Ireland, P G D Robbins, England and Barbarians, two members of the Romanian touring team and representatives from 32 clubs.

<doc id="6001035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001035" title="Teen Missions International">
Teen Missions International

Teen Missions International, or TMI, is an interdenominational Christian mission organization specializing in running short-term mission trips for youth, teenager, and adult participation. The organization was started in 1970 in Ohio and was later moved to Florida.
The Lord's Boot Camp.
TMI's main, and longest running, Boot Camp is based out of Merritt Island Florida. Boot Camp is a two week training period in which teams learn basic construction and evangelism skills, as well as cooperation and teamwork. The idea is to present a simulation of the circumstances they may encounter overseas. Boot Camp has to be as primitive as the most primitive teams. The aim of Teen Missions is to train tomorrows missionaries today and provide teenagers with a way to serve God now.
Mission Trip Age Groups & Program Focus.
Teen Missions International teams and mission trips are divided up into five different age groups.
TEEN Mission Trips (Ages 13–19 years)
The largest and most popular of these groups is the Teen Boot Camp teams. On average there can be up to 500-600 teens shared between the two Super and Early Boot Camps, which each run for two weeks (with two days of overlap). Teen mission trips focus on spiritual and character development in addition to offering work and evangelism assistance to the host mission on the field. The length of Teen mission trips vary slightly depending on location, but they average between 6 to 8 weeks.
PRETEEN Mission Trips (Ages 10–13 years)
Preteen teams are the second most popular group. Preteen teams have a separate Boot Camp training schedule and also run the Obstacle Course (which is slightly modified for their smaller size). The Preteen program focuses on character building and control of attitudes and actions. Preteens receive classes such as Bible Timeline, personal evangelism, music, drama and puppets. Control classes at Boot Camp include canoeing and bike riding. A typical Preteen trip runs around 4–5 weeks. Trip locations, like teens, are all over the world.
PEANUT Boot Camp (Ages 7–9 years)
The Peanut Boot Camp runs for about 10 days at Teen Missions' Boot Camp. Peanut campers form teams and sleep in tents. They run a miniature Obstacle Course, receive Bible Story lessons and learn about other countries and cultures from Teen Missions' Missionaries and visiting national staff members. Peanut teams learn basic skills building skills in addition to classes in music, puppets and coloring. Peanuts enjoy swimming in Teen Missions pool and visits to the playground.
MUSTARD SEED Boot Camp (Ages 4–6 years)
The youngest of Teen Missions Boot Camps allows the team members to go through the program together with their parent or legal guardian. Like the other Boot Camps, Mustard seed campers participate in group Bible devotions and learn about other countries. They run on the children's obstacle course and learn Bible verses. This camp runs for about four days.
ADULT Mission Trips
Teen Missions also organizes Adult mission trips that travel at various times of the year, most trips run between January and April. Adult trips normally last for about two weeks and most serve at an established Teen Missions base overseas. Projects include community development projects (sewing school uniforms, building grinding mills, granaries, and drinking water wells).
Special Blessings Training (SBs).
Teen Missions is known for their strict Boot Camp training and well disciplined teams. An aspect unique to TMI is their form of discipline, referred to as Special Blessings Training (SBs to staff and team members). Team members serve an SB by serving on an assigned work project during their free time.
Special Blessings can be given for Obstacle Course disqualifications, when late to class or for other policy violations. SBs are given to help team members learn that their actions are important to effective team work and unity during training and on the mission field. A unified and well disciplined team will be safer during travel and at their assigned project.
Obstacle Course (The OC).
Teen Missions believes that it is important to send out well trained and unified teams. Therefore, as part of boot camp (usually lasting about 2 weeks) teams run a vigorous course of obstacles to help promote team building, sense of accomplishment, and reliance on others. Obstacles include Mount Sinai, a very large tire mountain, Jacobs Ladder, a large cargo net ladder, The Slough of Despond, a rope swing over a usually muddy pool of water and the Wall, a twelve foot wall that each member must go over using only teamwork (there are steps on the back for coming down). Obstacles are carefully monitored by staff. Team members learn to run together and to encourage anyone who is struggling.
New Mission Trips.
Teen Missions usually announces the new year's locations in the November–December period. Ex. The 2008 Summer Teams would be announced sometime in November–December 2007. Then the 2009 Summer Teams would be announced in November–December 2008, and so on.
Number of available teams varies from age group to age group.
As to be expected, Teen Teams have the largest variety, followed by Preteen, and so on.
Please note that just because a team is offered, that does not mean that it will happen. Teams can be canceled at any moment, for any reason. These reasons usually consist of either lack of interest or changes in the host country or with the host mission.
Most teams serve in work and evangelism, but some team projects are exclusively evangelistic (i.e. Drama, Choir or Sports teams). Work teams go to project locations to do a construction or landscaping project for the host ministry or Teen Missions Overseas Base they will be staying. The work can include masonry, carpentry, landscaping, painting, plumbing, etc. Work teams do evangelism programs mainly on the weekends when they don't need to do the work project. Evangelism can include singing, drama, puppets and sermons/testimonies. On Sundays teams will take part in the worship service of a local church. Evangelism teams will focus mainly on doing evangelistic presentations. These will also include singing, drama, puppets and sermons/ testimonies; but may be specialized. There are some special mission trips which have a unique ministry focus in ministry or method such as backpack, boat, motorcycle, sports, film or clowning teams.
Overseas Boot Camps (OBCs).
TMI trains missionaries in various locations worldwide, they run 38 Boot Camps in 21 countries overseas. In some of these locations they also maintain relief missions such as the AIDS orphans center in Africa.
Missionaries to America (MTAs).
This program came about as a result of the work of the OBCs in training indigenous missionaries, by bringing those national youth into the US in order to show the remarkable results of their training and to evangelize through cultural performances. The program has done evangelism in most of the US by visiting churches, prisons, schools, hospitals, universities, nursing homes, parks, etc.
Because of recent difficulties with visa procurement process for foreign missionaries from developing countries coming to America, a new program of Missionaries to Canada has been started.

Sarir

Sarir or Serir was a medieval Christian state lasting from the 5th century to the 12th century in the mountainous regions of modern-day Dagestan. Its name is derived from the Arabic word for "throne" and refers to a golden throne that was viewed as a symbol of royal authority.
Origin.
Sarir was first documented as a political entity in the 5th century AD. The memory of its foundation was transmitted orally among the Caucasian Avars. According to one legend, the kingdom was established by a Persian general who was sent to control the Caucasus by a Sassanian king. This legend is corroborated by the names of local kings, which are normally of Persian or even Syrian etymology. 
On the other hand, the 10th-century Arab historian Ibn Rustah names the king of Sarir as "Auhar", i.e., "Avar". Based on this evidence, Omeljan Pritsak favours another theory, which postulates that the ruling dynasty of Sarir was of Avar origin.
Sarir bordered the Khazars to the north, the Nakhs (called Dzurdzuks by Georgians) to the west and northwest, the Georgians and Derbent to the south. As the state was Christian, Arab historians erroneously viewed it as a dependency of the Byzantine Empire. The capital of Sarir was the city of Humraj, tentatively identified with the modern-day village Khunzakh. The king resided in a remote fortress at the top of a mountain.
History.
During the Arab–Khazar wars of the 7th and 8th centuries, the kings of Sarir allied themselves with the Khazars. Following the victorious campaign of Merwan ibn Muhammad in 737–739, Sarir was pressed into submitting to the Caliph's authority. It paid tribute and provided men for the Arab garrison of Derbent until the ninth century, when, emboldened by the shift in momentum in the south, Sarir asserted sovereignty over large portions of the Caucasus, including Gumik, Filan and parts of Arran. 
As the hegemony of the Caliphate crumbled, Sarir found itself continually at war with its successor states, such as Derbent and Shirvan. In these wars it was generally victorious and allowed Sarir to manipulate the politics of Derbent. Concomitantly, the kings of Sarir shifted away from the Khazar alliance and mounted several incursions into the Khazarian steppes. The pattern of intermarriage between the royal houses of Sarir and Alania cemented the anti-Khazar alliance of the two Christian states.
Disintegration.
Alarmed by the growing Christian supremacy in the Caucasus, the Muslim powers of the region pledged mutual assistance against Sarir. Their economic and military pressure, coupled with internal discord, led to the state's disintegration in the early 12th century. After another century of Muslim ascendancy, Islam emerged as the dominant religion in the region. In the 13th century, the Caucasian Avars formed a new Muslim state, traditionally known as Avaristan.

Festa del Redentore

The Festa del Redentore is an event held in Venice in July where the fireworks play an important role. In 2012, it was held on 14th and 15th.
The Redentore began as a feast - held on the day of the Feast of the Most Holy Redeemer - to give thanks for the end of the terrible plague of 1576, which killed 50,000 people, including the great painter Tiziano Vecellio (Titian). The Doge Alvise I Mocenigo promised to build a magnificent church if the plague ended. Andrea Palladio was commissioned, assisted by Da Ponte, to build a majestic church on the Island of Giudecca. The church, known as Il Redentore, was consecrated in 1592, and is one of the most important examples of Palladian religious architecture. After the foundation stone was laid, a small wooden church was temporarily built, along with temporary bridge of barges from the Zattere, so that the Doge Sebastian Venier could walk in procession as far as the tabernacle. Afterwards, the Doge made a pilgrimage to the Church of Redentore every year. 
On Saturday, the eve of the festival, fireworks are let off. Preparations begin early in the morning when people begin to decorate their boats, or the small wooden terraces on rooftops from where they can admire the fireworks. At sunset, Saint Mark's basin begins to fill with up with boats of all kinds, festooned with balloons and garlands, and thousands of Venetians await the fireworks while dining on the boats. Around 10 o'clock at night, from pontoons placed nearby the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, the fireworks begin and Saint Mark's basin becomes one of the most atmospheric stages in the world. The fireworks last for around 45 to 60 minutes, illuminating the night and arousing intense emotions in both Venetians and visitors. Once the fireworks are over, the young people of the city head off to the Lido, where they sit on the sand and wait for dawn. 
A bridge of barges is built connecting Giudecca to the rest of Venice. Sunday is devoted to religious celebrations. 
The 2006 festival celebrated the victory of the Italian national soccer team in the World Cup and fireworks in the colours of the Italian flag were let off.

Inverhuron, Ontario

Inverhuron is a community located within the Municipality of Kincardine in the Canadian province of Ontario. The community includes approximately 200 permanent residents and 400 seasonal cottagers.
Inverhuron is located on the shore of Lake Huron, at the west end of County Road 15, just west of Highway 21 and the town of Tiverton. The village is located about halfway between Port Elgin and the town of Kincardine.
History.
Inverhuron was first settled in the early 1840s. In 1851 Superintendent of Schools of Bruce County, William Gunn opened a general store and post office. Gunn quickly followed with a school and library. By the end of the decade Inverhuron boasted lime kilns, saw and grist mills, a quarry, numerous tradesmen including carpenters,and a blacksmith shop. During this time, Inverhuron had a peak population of around 500 people. A major shipping centre with three large grain warehouses was established in the 1870s.
The Inverhuron Fire.
Inverhuron's days of success came to an abrupt stop on April 13, 1882 when fire struck the grain warehouses and the pier. The community experienced a devastating financial loss and many of the businesses shut down or relocated elsewhere. Another fire struck the community again in 1887. After the second fire, Inverhuron was finished financially and physically.
Inverhuron Today.
The village is home to the Inverhuron Provincial Park, which in 2005 reopened its doors to overnight camping with over 125 new campsites. Prior to the reopening, the park was a day-use only site catering to hikers and naturalists.

<doc id="6001086" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001086" title="Clan Cranstoun">
Clan Cranstoun

Clan Cranstoun is a Lowland Scottish clan.
History.
Origins of the clan.
The name Cranstoun is of territorial origin and comes from the lands and barony of Cranstoun in Midlothian. The lands might have been named after the Anglo-Saxon for "place of the crane". A crane being a bird which appears on both the shield and crest of the Clan Cranstoun. It has also been suggested that the lands were named after the "dwelling place" of the Cran or Cren, which are both Saxon forenames.
Elfrick de Cranstoun witnessed a charter from William the Lion to Holyrood Abbey. In about 1170 Elfrick also appears in a deed between Roger de Quincy and the Abbot of Newbattle. During the reign of Alexander II of Scotland, Thomas de Craystoun is recorded as making a donation of lands to the Church that were near Paiston in East Lothian. This was for the welfare of his soul and those of his ancestors and successors.
In 1296 Hugh de Cranstoun appears on the Ragman Rolls swearing fealty to Edward I of England. In 1338 Randolphus de Cranstoun made a donation to the Abbey of Newbattle. David II of Scotland granted a charter to Thomas de Cranston for all the lands of Cranston.
16th and 17th centuries.
The Clan Cranstoun prospered up to the late 16th century when they became involved in the volatile political situation of the time. In 1592 Thomas and John Cranstoun, both relatives of the chiefly family were among those accused of treason for assisting Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell in his attack on Holyrood Palace.
In June 1600 Sir John Cranstoun of that Ilk was indicted for harbouring traitors who were his kinsmen and only on the intervention of the king did he obtain a stay of the proceedings against him. In August 1600 Sir John's brother, Thomas Cranstoun was executed in Perth for his involvement in the Gowrie Conspiracy, which intended to kidnap James VI of Scotland. However, later in 1609, Sir John Cranstoun of Morristoun who was captain of the Guard to James VI, was raised to the peerage and given the title Lord Cranstoun. At about the same time, William Cranstoun, a staunch Presbyterian who was minister of Kettle in Fife, resisted attempts by the king to bring bishops into the Scottish Church. As a result the minister fell into disfavour with the authorities and the king's commissioners ordered him to stop preaching but he did not and was formally put to the horn and declared an outlaw.
Civil War.
During the Civil War the third Lord Cranstoun was captured at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He was kept prisoner in the Tower of London where he languished, and his estates were sequestrated apart from a small portion that his wife and four children were allowed to keep.
18th and 19th centuries.
William Cranstoun, the fifth Lord Cranstoun sat in the last Scottish Parliament and supported the Treaty of Union. One of his descendants, George Cranstoun, was an eminent lawyer and judge, who became an advocate and Dean of the Faculty of Advocates in 1823. He was also a friend of Walter Scott who he had studied with at the University of Edinburgh.
James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun was a distinguished officer of the Royal Navy who commanded HMS Bellerophon (1786) and was involved in a battle where seven British ships defeated an entire French fleet in June 1795. He died of lead poisoning in 1796 and the peerage became extinct in 1813.
20th Century.
In 1950 Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Cranstoun of Corehouse was recognised as chief of Clan Cranstoun. He died in 1990. The current chief succeeded his uncle, who died with no issue. The family is still predominantly based in Midlothian.

<doc id="6001095" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001095" title="Mineral Revolution">
Mineral Revolution

The Mineral Revolution is a term used by historians to refer to the rapid industrialisation and economic changes which occurred in South Africa from the 1870s onwards. The Mineral Revolution was largely driven by the need to create a permanent workforce to work in the mining industry, and saw South Africa transformed from a patchwork of agrarian states to a unified, industrial nation. In political terms, the Mineral Revolution had a significant impact on diplomacy and military affairs. Finally, the policies and events of the Mineral Revolution had an increasingly negative impact on race relations in South Africa, and formed the basis of the apartheid system, which dominated South African society for a century.
South Africa before the Mineral Revolution.
By the mid-nineteenth century, South Africa was not a unified state, but was divided between provinces of the British Empire, states formed by Afrikaner settlers, and various native African states. The British provinces, Cape Colony and Natal, were both fairly prosperous colonies, with the majority of black and white settlers living in rural areas and employed in sharecropping or the production of cash crops. To the north, the two Afrikaner states of Orange Free State and Transvaal were less densely populated and in a state of constant economic rivalry with the wealthier British provinces. Surrounding the British and Afrikaner states were a number of native African polities such as Zululand. These states were independent of white control and their populations were largely involved in animal husbandry. Some, such as Pediland, acted as buffer states between the Afrikaner and British polities. 
The overall population of the South Africa region was predominantly employed in agricultural occupations, either tending cattle, or as in the British colonies, cultivating cash crops such as sugar and coffee. Urban areas were small in number and size, and provided only a small contribution to the Afrikaner and British economies, mainly via the production of consumer goods and wine. Regional economies differed – while the Afrikaner and native African states were concerned with developing and maintaining self-sufficiency, the Cape Colony was more focused on Britain's colonial economy, fulfilling a role as a producer of raw agricultural produce and a few luxury goods such as wine, and as a consumer of manufactured goods from Britain.
Economy.
Mining.
The Mineral Revolution began with the discovery of diamonds at the town of Kimberley in 1867. The discovery of diamonds led to a rush of prospectors descending on the town, whose population skyrocketed as increasing numbers of prospectors arrived to seek their fortune. As more diggers arrived in Kimberley, diamond-mining increased in scale, focusing in open-pit mining of three main sites. As surface deposits of diamonds were excavated, deeper pits had to be dug, propelling the Mineral Revolution into a new phase.
To excavate deep deposits of diamonds, diggers needed machinery (particularly steam engines), credit, and a large labour force. These were unavailable to ordinary diggers, and the diamond mines were quickly taken over by the "mining capitalists" – large corporations with access to credit, machinery, and labour. 
The discovery of gold at the Witwatersrand orefields in 1886 triggered a gold rush which greatly escalated this continuing trend. The orefields, which overlapped British and Afrikaner territory, were quickly excavated of all surface deposits and a similar pattern to Kimberley emerged – small diggers were bought out by large corporations. At Kimberley, the diamond mines fell under the monopoly of De Beers, while at the Rand orefields, land was bought up by Wernher, Breit & Eckstein, Consolidated Gold Mines Inc., and a number of smaller companies. 
The emergence of industrial-scale mining forced major demographic shifts in South Africa's population. During the early stages of mining, labour had been primarily provided by young men from the African states, primarily Pedi men. The young men would travel to the mines during the summer to provide temporary labour and earn enough wages to buy status symbols, such as cattle or guns, before returning home. This system, though, was too unreliable to provide a permanent labour force and was not acceptable to the mining corporations. Young men arriving at the mines were often exhausted from their journey and had to be given two weeks' rest, at company expense, before they were fit to work in the mines. Workers who were not paid on time or did not like their living conditions (which were often very harsh due to bad food and disease) tended to drift away, and workers were at risk of being recalled to their own countries, as happened in 1876 when the chief of Pediland recalled all Pedi men at the mines to fight in a war against the Transvaal. The need to create a fixed, permanent labour force at Kimberley and on the Rand became the primary objective of the mining corporations and the colonial government.
The increasing scale of mining operations prompted the corporations to offer very low wages. Extracting diamonds from rocks, and processing the low-quality gold ore at the Rand, was very labour-intensive and required armies of workers. To offset the cost of employing so many workers, and to compensate for the high salaries offered to machine supervisors and administrators, the companies offered very low wages to ordinary labourers, resulting in falling living standards in urban areas.
Urbanisation.
The need to create a fixed labour force resulted in the colonial government, and the mining corporations, introducing a variety of schemes to keep workers on-site for lengthy periods of time. Corporate agents travelled to African states, offering fixed contracts and prearranged wages to attract young African men to the mines. 
At the mine sites, corporations introduced various schemes to keep workers on-site. This was partially motivated in Kimberley by the corporation's fear that workers were stealing diamonds and selling them on the black market. To counteract this assumed threat, De Beers introduced strip searching, whereby workers leaving the mines at the end of a shift would be undressed and searched for diamonds. A more extreme measure was taken in the early 1880s by De Beers, when the company introduced corporate compounds. These enclosed compounds were built in the style of open-air prisons, where workers were required to live by the terms of their contract, in exchange for food, accommodation, and cheap beer provided by the company. In reality, workers had to pay for things out of their paltry wages, while the compounds themselves were notorious for disease, malnutrition, and death. In 1886 white workers at the De Beers compound in Kimberley elected a local member of parliament who successfully campaigned for white employees to live in the town, but black workers, who had no vote, were forced to remain on the compounds. 
Agriculture.
The growth of towns and cities across South Africa prompted changes in rural areas, as farms lost labourers to the mines and demand for food and agricultural produce increased. By the 1870s, "agrarian capitalism" had emerged, with large commercial farms buying up smallholdings and producing commercial goods for sale in the towns. This resulted in tens of thousands of black and white farmers losing their jobs, and being forced to work as wage-labourers on commercial farms or migrate to the cities in search of work. These changes greatly increased South Africa's agricultural output as commercial farms were more efficient and had greater access to farming machinery than small farms, and saw social changes in rural areas. The peasantry effectively disappeared, and a new class, the "rural gentry", emerged. These middle-class farmers, midway between the large commercial farms and smallholdings, were able to significantly increase their earnings by producing cash crops such as coffee, tobacco, sugar, and grapes, which were not labour-intensive and which fetched high prices at urban markets. Animal husbandry also increased, with increasingly large swathes of land being turned over to sheep and cattle farming.
Infrastructure.
Mass migration to towns, urban growth, and the increasing urban demand for rural produce prompted the development of South Africa's transport and communications infrastructure. Railways were greatly expanded to link towns to each other and to the countryside, and ports such as Durban and Cape Town were expanded to cope with increasing immigration and commercial activity, greatly stimulating development in South Africa
Politics.
The Mineral Revolution had a major impact on political developments in South Africa. Cape Colony required armies of workers for the mines and support industries, and to secure a regular flow of workers to the mines, the colonial government began a series of annexations of neighbouring African states, such as Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Pediland. In the newly-annexed territories, the colonial government introduced laws such as the Hut tax, which demanded that inhabitants pay an annual tax on their dwellings, paid in British cash. As the only way to earn British currency was via employment in the mines, this created a steady flow of workers as young men travelled to the mines to earn money, which they sent back to their families to pay the tax. 
The 1879 Anglo-Zulu War also had roots in the Mineral Revolution, specifically as Cape Colony wished to neutralise any potential threats to the mines. In the aftermath of the war, thousands of young Zulu men migrated to the mines in search of work, driving down wages and exacerbating the already cramped conditions in the compounds.
The 1899–1902 Second Anglo-Boer War can be traced to the Mineral Revolution. Britain's desire to control the entire Rand region (which overlapped neighbouring Transvaal), remove potential threats to the mines, and encourage industrial expansion by replacing the slow and inexperienced Afrikaner bureaucracy with British laws and regulations led to increasing tension between the British colonies and the Afrikaner states, resulting in the outbreak of war in 1899. The Second Anglo-Boer War united South Africa as a single state (initially British, but granted independence in 1910) and marked the beginning of the British Empire's decline.
Environmental Impact.
Mining operations at the Rand and at Kimberley caused severe environmental damage. Open-pit mining was not only dangerous for the workers, but created deep pits which grew wider during rainfall. Urban growth placed increasing strains on water supplies and led to increasing pollution of rivers. In rural areas, commercial farming led to a steady degradation in soil quality, while increasing animal husbandry led to severe soil erosion in many places, as cattle drank scarce water supplies and pulled up the grass holding the soil together. Mechanised farming and over-grazing led by 1910 to the appearance of immense "dongas" in the countryside, which carried away soil and scarred the landscape, and contributed to dustbowls across South Africa in the early decades of the twentieth century.

Draycott, Somerset

Draycott is a village in Somerset, England, neighbouring the village of Cheddar on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is within the parish of Rodney Stoke.
History.
There is some evidence of occupation of the site in the Iron Age including an unfinished earthwork enclosure on the hill above Draycott.
The village was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as "Draicote", meaning 'The dray shelter' from the Old English "dragan" and "cot". Another derivation is from the Brythonic from Tre meaning settlement and Coet meanings woods.
Geography.
Close to the village is the Draycott Sleights nature reserve which has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
Halesland Airfield is situated just to the north of the village and is home to the Mendip Gliding Club. Draycott is still a major strawberry producer and the now-disused railway line that ran through the village was called the Strawberry Line. The pub located opposite the old railway station is called "The Strawberry Special".
The A371 road runs north to south through the village's longest axis. Despite being classified as an A-road, it significantly narrows at certain points along the southern part of the village and has been the cause of congestion during times of increased traffic flow such as during the summer tourist season.
Church.
The church of St Peter was built in 1861 by the architect C.E. Giles. It is a Grade II listed building. The majority of the stonework is that known locally as 'Draycott Marble', a dolomitic conglomerate with a pronounced pinkish tinge, that was quarried quite close by at Draycott quarry. Notable interior features are the stained glass east windows, the fine wrought-iron rood screen (1894), and the neo-Norman font by William Burges.
Controversially, in 2006, the church attempted to sell the font for £110,000. The Rev. Stanley Price contended that the sale was essential to meet a repair and restoration bill of an estimated £170,000. The sale was initially approved by the Chancellor of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, Timothy J Briden but permission was subsequently refused when the Victorian Society appealed to the Court of Arches, one of the Church of England's highest courts. The court found "no compelling need to dispose of the font had been demonstrated" and concluded that, if allowed, "much of which adorns and adds interest, both historically and architecturally, to our churches would be lost to future generations."

Advertising Self-Regulatory Council

The Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (ASRC) the American advertising industry's self-regulatory body. Formerly the National Advertising Review Council, or NARC, the organization changed its name in 2012.
NARC was established in 1971 by the American Advertising Federation (AAF), the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA)and the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB). In 2009, the NARC Board of Directors was expanded to include the chief executive officers of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), Electronic Retailing Association (ERA), and Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The 11-member Board sets policies and procedures for advertising industry self-regulation. The CBBB provides third-party oversight of the self-regulatory system.
Self-Regulatory Units.
The self-regulatory system includes the following investigative, enforcement and appellate units:
The self-regulatory system also includes a special program – The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative – developed in 2006 to examine food advertising directed to children.
Parties may appeal decisions reached by NAD and CARU to NARB, the appellate body. Decisions reached by the self-regulatory system’s investigative and appellate units are publicly reported through a press release. In addition, the decisions reported by NAD and CARU also are compiled 10 times each year into the “NAD/CARU Case Reports.” As of 2010, more than 5,000 self-regulatory decisions are included in the NARC Online Archive. The case reports and archive are not public, however; access to the archive is $6900.00 a year, even though procedures state that final case decisions are public.
National Advertising Division (NAD).
The National Advertising Division (NAD) is charged with monitoring and evaluating truth and accuracy in national advertising. The NAD examines and evaluates a wide range of advertising claims, including puffery, consumer surveys, product testing and product demonstrations, taste tests, pricing claims and disclosures. Through its unique window on the marketplace, NAD identifies hot issues in advertising and promotion. NAD’s decisions assist advertisers in anticipating and responding to the challenges that new products and new media can pose.
Since its inception, NAD has examined advertising claims for a wide range of products, including:
In cooperation with the Council for Responsible Nutrition, NAD has expanded its review of advertising for dietary supplements, a nearly $25 billion industry that is frequently criticized for misleading advertising. To date, the program has issued nearly 100 decisions concerning claims made in dietary supplement advertising. On average, the NAD opens 150 cases each year and more than 95 percent of the advertisers that appear before NAD voluntarily comply with NAD's decisions.
NAD cases often originate through a challenge filed by one advertiser against the advertising claims made by a competing advertiser.
In addition, NAD monitors national advertising and investigates complaints filed by consumers and advocacy groups or referred by local Better Business Bureaus. The course of NAD review proceedings is detailed in The Advertising Industry’s Process of Self-Regulation, Policies and Procedures by the National Advertising Review Council (Procedures) The "Procedures" describe and explain the filing deadlines and requirements for submissions from challengers and advertisers. NAD examines advertising to determine whether the evidence provided by the advertiser fully supports the advertising claims at issue in an NAD review.
The NAD can be expected to make one of three determinations for every claim at issue.
Should an advertiser refuse to participate, NAD will to refer the advertiser to the appropriate regulatory agency.
NAD’s findings are detailed in the final decision and outlined in a press release. In addition, NAD regularly monitors closed cases to ensure that advertisers comply with NAD decisions. If the NAD determines the advertiser made a reasonable attempt to comply, but there are still concerns outstanding, the NAD will work with the advertiser to address those concerns. Should the NAD determine that no effort was made to comply, or that the advertisers is unwilling to make further modifications NAD deems necessary, the "Procedures" allow the NAD to refer the advertiser to the appropriate regulatory agency.
NAD cases are closely watched by national advertisers and by the advertising industry.
Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU).
CARU was established in 1974 by NARC for the promotion of responsible advertising to children under the age of 12 in all media. CARU reviews and evaluates advertising for truth, accuracy, appropriateness and sensitivity to children’s still developing cognitive abilities in accordance with its Self-Regulatory Program for Children's Advertising (the Guidelines), which hold advertisers to strict standards. CARU routinely monitors advertisements found in broadcast and cable TV, radio, children’s magazines, comic books, the Internet and mobile services for compliance with its Guidelines. When ads are found to be misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent with its Guidelines, CARU initiates an inquiry and examines the advertising to ensure compliance with the Guidelines. If an ad is found to be non-compliant, CARU seeks discontinuance or correction. The results of CARU inquiries are publicly recorded in the NAD/CARU Case Reports. CARU also handles advertiser challenges and consumer complaints. In 1996, CARU added a section to its Guidelines that highlight issues that are unique to the Internet including Websites directed at children under age 13 for online privacy. In January 2001, CARU's self-regulatory program became the first Federal Trade Commission-approved Safe Harbor under the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Participants who adhere to CARU's Guidelines are deemed in compliance with COPPA and essentially insulated from FTC enforcement action as long as they comply with program requirements.
CARU’S Guidelines.
CARU's Self-Regulatory Guidelines are deliberately subjective, going beyond the issues of truthfulness and accuracy to take into account the uniquely impressionable and vulnerable child audience.
The Guidelines are based upon the following core principles:
Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program.
ERSP was developed by NARC at the request of the Electronic Retailing Association in 2004. The program provides a forum of the self-regulation of direct response advertising. ERSP was created in part to demonstrate the industry’s commitment to self-regulation and to provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile advertising (such as weight-loss advertising). The direct response industry includes long-form (infomercial) productions, short-form commercials, live home shopping channels, print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, broadband channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-800 number, email, or website is within ERSP’s purview.
Core claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:
Participants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:
ERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate regulatory agency if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.
National Advertising Review Board.
NARB is the NARC appeals board. When an advertiser or challenger disagrees with an NAD or CARU recommendation, they may appeal the decision to the NARB for additional review. NARB is made up of 70 professionals from three different categories: National Advertisers Advertising Agencies and Public members made up of academics and former members of the public sector. NARB members are nominated for their stature and experience in their respective fields. If an NAD or CARU decision is appealed, a five-member NARB panel is chosen to review the decisions. All NARB decisions are published.
The Online Interest-Based Advertising Accountability Program.
The Accountability Program – the most recent self-regulatory program – was developed at the urging of a cross-industry coalition of trade associations. The Accountability Program reviews compliance with the industry-accepted principles for online behavioral advertising (OBA), focuses on transparency and consumer-control issues and monitors companies that may be engaged in OBA.
History.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new consumer-protection movement had found its voice and legislators and regulators were listening. In his academic monograph, “The National Advertising Review Board, 1971-1976,” detailed the troubled commercial climate of the times: “Public opinion surveys of attitudes toward consumerism, business and advertising in the 1960s showed that early in the decade, the majority of studies reflected either positive or mixed attitudes toward advertising. In contrast, studies later in the 1960s and early 1970s reflected more negative attitudes toward advertising and a growing interest in consumerism. “During the same period, Congress passed a host of consumer minded bills, including ‘truth-in-packaging’ legislation, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act that banned cigarette advertising from the broadcast media. “The executive branch of government was active as well. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon all sent consumer messages to Congress. The position of special assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs, the Office of Consumer Affairs, the Consumer Advisory Council and the Committee on Consumer Interests were all established in that period.” Noted Zanot, “the sheer amount of consumer protection activity at the federal level during the 1960s and 1970s far surpassed that of any other period in U.S. history.” Leaders within the advertising industry were urging the development of a self-regulatory mechanism that could help calm what Zanot described as “a gathering storm of consumerism.”
In his monograph, Zanot reported that Howard Bell, then-president of the AAF American Advertising Federation and current chairman of the NARB, “became a catalyst in the development of new self-regulatory measures.”
Zanot also excerpted a speech delivered in September 1970 by the late Victor Elting, Jr., then-chairman of the AAF, at a meeting of the Chicago Advertising Club. “There are ticking sounds that we hear in all the pressure groups, congressional hearings and other forums that are meeting to decide our fate. Let’s defuse them by having the strength and courage to determine our fate for ourselves,” Elting said. Eight months later, on May 13, 1971, Elting announced that the AAF, 4A’s, ANA, and CBBB has formed the NARC. NARC was charged with setting policies for the NAD and NARB.
By 1972, the NAD had received or initiated 444 complaints and was struggling against a continuing tide of criticism. By 1973, though, that criticism had begun to abate. As Zanot reported, the organization received an “unexpected boost” when FTC Commissioner Mary Gardiner Jones, a consumer advocate, declared the system to be “a self-regulatory effort of truly historic proportions.”
In 2012, the National Advertising Review Council (NARC), rebranded as the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (ASRC). The new name and new brand were designed to offer an explicit statement about the mission and purpose of the organization—to advance the self-regulation of the advertising industry.

Bobby Graham (footballer)

Bobby Graham (born 22 November 1944) is a former professional footballer who played for Liverpool during the 1960s.
Life and playing career.
Born in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, Graham played for Motherwell Bridge Works as an amateur before Bill Shankly signed him for Liverpool as 17 year old in the November 1961.
A striker, Graham scored on his full debut, the 6-1 thumping of KR Reykjavik on the 14 September 1964 in a European Cup preliminary round 2nd leg tie at Anfield, he scored a hat-trick in his first league game against Aston Villa 12 days later on the 26th, the game finished 5-1 to the Reds with Bobby's goals coming in the 6th, 64th and 86th minutes.
Graham was at Liverpool at an unfortunate time for himself as he found it almost impossible to dislodge the successful strike partnership of Ian St John and Roger Hunt and found first team appearances hard to come by. Such was the dominance of both St John and Hunt he missed out on FA Cup glory in 1965 and only made 1 appearance during the Reds run to the league title the following season, obviously, not enough to gain him a medal.
The 1969/70 season was the most successful for him in a red shirt, with Hunt and St John both pensioned off he made 54 (ever present) first-team appearances and scored 21 goals which included a stunning strike in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, the same game that saw Everton's Sandy Brown scored 'that' infamous own goal. Shortly afterwards, though, 2 new strikers arrived in the form of Kevin Keegan from Scunthorpe United and John Toshack from Cardiff City, Graham lost his place once again.
In March 1972 he was allowed to leave Anfield and moved to Highfield Road and Coventry City where he linked up with former team-mate St John once more, again he struggled to get 1st team recognistion, even going out on loan to Tranmere Rovers, when St John was in charge, for 10 games. Bobby ended his short association with the Sky Blues and moved to his home town club Motherwell.
Ian St John was certainly a fan of Graham's as it was he who again signed Bobby for the Fir Park club and by the end of his first season he had shown why 'The Saint' had shown such faith, he finished top scorer. A young Willie Pettigrew was added to the side the following season and the pair formed a lethal partnership that terrorised Scottish defences for 4 seasons. When Crawford Boyd was later interviewed for the Queen of the South F.C. website, Boyd listed Bobby Graham as the best player that he played against in his time at Queens.
After 132 games and 37 goals Graham joined Hamilton Academical in 1977 for a, then, record transfer fee of £15,000, he, again, made over 100 appearances scoring 42 times. Graham ended his career at Shotts Bon Accord in the Scottish junior football scene.

<doc id="6001150" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001150" title="Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota">
Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota

The Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota is a twin-engine helicopter with a single, four-bladed main rotor. The UH-72 is a militarized version of the Eurocopter EC145 and is built by American Eurocopter division of EADS North America. Initially marketed as the UH-145, the helicopter was selected as the winner of the United States Army's Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) program on 30 June 2006. In October 2006, American Eurocopter was awarded a production contract for 345 aircraft to replace aging UH-1H/V and OH-58A/C helicopters in the U.S. Army and Army National Guard fleets.
Development.
Background.
The U.S. Army's "LHX" program began in the early 1980s, proposing two helicopter designs with a high percentage of commonality of dynamic components. One was a light utility version ("LHX-U") for assault and tactical movement of troops and supplies, the other was a light scout/attack version ("LHX-SCAT") to complement the growing development of the AH-64 Apache. As the program was developed, the light utility version was dropped and focus was placed on the light attack reconnaissance version, which eventually became the RAH-66 Comanche.
In 2004, the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army made the decision to terminate the RAH-66 program. As part of the termination, the service was allowed to keep the future years' funding programmed for the Comanche. To replace the capability that the Comanche was supposed to offer, the U.S. Army planned several programs, including three new aircraft. The Army Staff decided that these three aircraft, the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH), the "Light Utility Helicopter (LUH)", and the Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) (later renamed Joint Cargo Aircraft, or JCA), were to be existing, in-production commercial aircraft modified for Army service.
LUH Program and UH-145.
The "LUH" program was initiated in early 2004, with an initial stated requirement for 322 helicopters to conduct homeland security, administrative, logistic, medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and support of the army test and training centers missions. The LUH contract was released in late July 2005. At least five proposals were received. The competitors included the Bell 210 and Bell 412, MD Explorer and AW139. EADS North America (EADS NA) marketed the "UH-145" variant of the EC 145 for the program.
On 30 June 2006, the U.S. Army announced that the EADS NA entry as the winner of the $3 billion LUH contract. In August, the UH-145 was officially designated by the Department of Defense as the "UH-72A". The award was confirmed in October 2006 following protests from losing bidders. Despite a four-month delay due to the protests, the first UH-72 was delivered on time in December, at which time the name "Lakota" was also formally announced for the type, following the service's tradition of giving its helicopters Native American names. The LUH marked EADS NA's largest DoD contract to date.
On 23 August 2007, the UH-72A received full-rate production (FRP) approval, allowing the procurement of a planned fleet of 345 aircraft through 2017 as of June 2008. The UH-72A is produced at American Eurocopter's facility in Columbus, Mississippi; production transitioned from local assembly of kits received from Eurocopter Deutschland to full local production in 2009. In December 2009, the service ordered 45 more UH-72As. The 100th Lakota was delivered in March 2010, the 250th UH-72 was delivered in April 2013. That month, the U.S. Army opted to halt procurement after 2014 due to budget cuts; at this point, a total of 312 Lakotas were on order by the service. In January 2014, Congress gave the Army $171 million to procure 20 additional UH-72As. The 300th UH-72 was delivered to the Army in May 2014.
In May 2013, Congress questioned why the UH-72 had not been considered for the armed scout role. The Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno stated that the UH-72A was developed for domestic operations and is not considered to be operationally deployable to combat zones. The UH-72 is employed by the U.S. Army National Guard in a utility role in the U.S., releasing UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to deploy overseas. On 21 June 2013, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall stated in a letter to Congress that UH-72 combat modifications were "presently unaffordable." Fleet-wide combat modifications would reportedly cost $780 million and add of weight per helicopter; changes would include passive and active survivability systems, hardened engines and drive train, external lighting and communications upgrades.
As of December 2013, the U.S. Army is considering retiring its OH-58 Kiowa fleet and transferring all National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve AH-64 Apaches to the active Army to serve as scout helicopters. All 100 active Army UH-72s along with 104 Army National Guard UH-72s would be transferred to use as training helicopters, replacing the TH-67 Creek at the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker. Some active Army UH-60 Black Hawks would be transferred to Army Reserve and Army National Guard units for homeland defense and disaster response missions. The proposals aim to retire older helicopters to substantially reduce costs while retaining crucial capabilities. With the prospect of most UH-72s being repurposed as training helicopters, the Army is requesting funds to buy 100 more Lakotas to add to the training fleet. The FY 2015 budget would cover 55 helicopters, and FY 2016 funds would complete the purchase.
Armed Aerial Scout.
The Armed Scout 645 (EC645) was a proposed armed version of the UH-72 for the U.S. Army's Armed Aerial Scout OH-58D replacement program offered by EADS and Lockheed Martin. The companies announced a teaming agreement for the Armed Scout 645 on 4 May 2009. Three flight demonstrator aircraft named "AAS-72X" were built in 2010. They began flight testing in late 2010. In September 2012, EADS began voluntary flight demonstrations of the aircraft. Over the next two weeks they flew an AAS-72X and an EC145 T2 at high altitudes. Flying took place from September 24 to October 3, and the aircraft met performance requirements. Two versions of the aircraft were being offered for the program: the AAS-72X, an armed version of the UH-72; and the AAS-72X+, an armed military version of EADS subsidiary Eurocopter's civilian EC-145T2. The Army ended the AAS program in late 2013.
CVLSP.
In May 2012, the UH-72A was entered as a candidate in the U.S. Air Force's Common Vertical Life Support Platform (CVLSP) program to replace the UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter. As with the U.S. Army, the Lakota can operate in permissive environments, such as ICBM site support and security under the Air Force Global Strike Command and personnel transport in the National Capital Region by the Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing. Advantages over the UH-1N include 30 percent more speed, range, and loiter time, enhanced reliability and crashworthiness, night vision compatibility, modern avionics, and being cheaper to operate. In August 2013, the Air Force said it planned to sustain the UH-1N for six to ten years. On 16 September 2013, acting Air Force Secretary Eric Fanning received a letter from the chairman and CEO of EADS North America, arguing that to refit and maintain the Hueys would cost more than acquiring and operating the UH-72A; the letter also urged the Air Force to act soon, as Army orders were almost complete and the production line was winding down. The air service said they have little money and can risk using the Hueys for some years, EADS North America stated that the Lakota "will lower the risk to the U.S. Air Force nuclear enterprise, and will save taxpayers the considerable cost of future recapitalization." Reportedly buying Lakotas would cost as much as upgrading 62 Hueys, the long-term operating costs would be much lower.
Design.
The UH-72 is designed to take on a range of missions, from general support and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) to personnel recovery and counter-narcotics operations. They are planned to replace the UH-1 and OH-58A/C, which are older light utility helicopters, and supplant other types in domestic use, primarily those in Army National Guard service. The UH-72 is being procured as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, which simplifies logistics support of the fleet. EADS NA has teamed with Sikorsky to provide Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the UH-72, through its Helicopter Support, Inc. (HSI)/Sikorsky Aerospace Maintenance. (SAM) subsidiaries.
The basic UH-72A is simply a commercial EC145 helicopter that has a U.S. Army color scheme and is fitted with an AN/ARC-231 radio. Other than utility transport, the Lakota can be configured for medical evacuation, VIP transport, security and support, and opposing forces training. It is described as the best military aircraft in the inventory for domestic operations, used by the Army National Guard for state support, disaster relief, and homeland defense and by non-deployed active units for MEDEVAC and training. Compared to the previous UH-1 Huey used in those roles, the twin-engine Lakota flies faster ( versus ), has an external hoist system, and has a fully integrated computerized cockpit. The Huey has an advantage in the MEDEVAC role, being able to carry three patients compared to the Lakota's two-patient load, but an average evacuation typically deals with two or less patients. The Security & Support Mission Equipment Package (S&S MEP) is a version of the UH-72A for homeland security, counter drug, and border patrol missions. It is equipped with an electro-optical/infrared sensor and laser pointer turret, moving map system and touch-screen displays, video management system, digital video recorded and datalink, searchlight, and rescue hoist from the MEDEVAC package.
Operational history.
The first aircraft was delivered to the U.S. Army on 11 December 2006 in Columbus, Mississippi. On 12 December 2006, General Richard A. Cody, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, and Joe Red Cloud, a chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Lakota nation, accepted the first UH-72A in an official ceremony. The service estimated that delivery of the planned 345 aircraft would continue until 2017.
The first production helicopters were sent to the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California for medical evacuation missions in January 2007. On 20 June 2007, the NTC's U.S. Army Air Ambulance Detachment (USAAAD) became the first operational unit to field the Lakota. On 10 July 2007, the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Flight Detachment at Fort Eustis, Virginia became the second U.S. Army unit fielded with the UH-72A.
A report published in August 2007 by the Operational Test and Evaluation Directorate (DOT&E) noted that although the Lakota "...is effective in the performance of light utility missions," it was prone to overheating during operations in the desert conditions of Fort Irwin when not equipped with air conditioning systems. In response, vents were added in the doors to increase cabin air flow; air conditioning has been installed on some Medical and VIP versions, as well as added air conditioning units for crew comfort.
The Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) located at Fort Polk, Louisiana received their first aircraft on 7 September 2007. On 16 January 2009, the United States Military Academy received two UH-72As, replacing two UH-1H helicopters for VIP transport to and from the academy. The helicopters also support the cadet parachute team and cadet training missions. The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School received the first of five UH-72As in September 2009. The UH-72A replaced the TH-6B Cayuse as the prime training aircraft for the test pilot school's helicopter curriculum.
By March 2010, the Lakota entered service in Puerto Rico, Kwajalein Atoll, and the U.S. Army’s missile test range in Germany. On 20 December 2010, a UH-72A assigned to the Puerto Rico Army National Guard became the first UH-72A to experience a fatal accident. The aircraft crashed at sea off the coast of Puerto Rico and all six personnel aboard were killed.
On 18 July 2012, the U.S. Army's Aviation Flight Test Directorate received three UH-72As at Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama; they are used for general support and as chase aircraft to support aviation development testing. With this delivery, the service has received over 200 UH-72As. On 22 September 2012, the Oregon Army National Guard's Detachment 1, C Company, 1-112 Aviation, received the first of four UH-72A helicopters during a roll-out ceremony at Camp Rilea in Warrenton, Oregon.
Export.
On 7 June 2013, Thailand requested the sale of six UH-72A Lakotas with associated equipment, training, and support for an estimated cost of $77 million. On 9 October 2013, the Thai government approved $55 million in funds to support the Royal Thai Army's acquisition of six UH-72A helicopters from 2013 to 2015. On 28 March 2014, the Thai Army awarded a $34 million contract to Airbus Helicopter for six UH-72As, they are to be fitted with a mission equipment package including the AN/ARC-231 airborne radio terminal; deliveries are to begin by April 2015.

<doc id="6001157" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001157" title="Paul Moore, Jr.">
Paul Moore, Jr.

Paul Moore, Jr. (November 15, 1919 – May 1, 2003) was a bishop of the Episcopal Church and served as the 13th Bishop of New York from 1972 to 1989. During his lifetime, he was perhaps the best known Episcopal cleric in the United States, and among the best known of Christian clergy in any denomination.
Career.
Paul Moore was a graduate of St. Paul's School and Yale University, where, like his father, he was a member of Wolf's Head Society. He had been president of the Berkeley Association, the Episcopal student group, and a Boy Scout leader at Yale. He was a member of one of America's richest families. Moore was senior fellow on the Yale Corporation from the mid-1960s through the administration of George H.W. Bush.
Moore joined the Marine Corps in 1941. He was a highly decorated Marine Corps captain, a veteran of the Guadalcanal Campaign during World War II earning the Navy Cross, a Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Returning home after the War, Moore was ordained in 1949 after graduating from the General Theological Seminary in New York City. Moore was named rector of Grace Church Van Vorst, an inner city parish in Jersey City, New Jersey, in the former township of Van Vorst, where he served from 1949 to 1957. There he began his career as a social activist, protesting inner city housing conditions and racial discrimination. He and his colleagues reinvigorated their inner city parish and were celebrated in the Church for their efforts.
In 1957, he was named Dean of Christ Church Cathedral in Indianapolis, Indiana. Moore introduced the conservative Midwestern capital to social activism through his work in the inner city. Moore served in Indianapolis until he was elected Suffragan Bishop of Washington, D.C., in 1964.
During his time in Washington he became nationally known as an advocate of civil rights and an opponent of the Vietnam War. He knew Martin Luther King, Jr., and marched with him in Selma and elsewhere. In 1970, he was elected as coadjutor and successor to Bishop Horace Donegan in New York City. He was installed as Bishop of the Diocese of New York in 1972 and held that position until 1989.
Moore was widely known for his liberal activism. Throughout his career he spoke out against homelessness and racism. He was an effective advocate of the interests of cities, once calling the corporations abandoning New York "rats leaving a sinking ship". He was the first Episcopal bishop to ordain an openly homosexual woman as a priest in the church. In his book, "Take a Bishop Like Me" (1979), he defended his position by arguing that many priests were homosexuals but few had the courage to acknowledge it. His liberal political views were coupled with fierce traditionalism when it came to the liturgy and even the creed. In his writings and sermons he sometimes described himself as "born again", referring to his awakening to a fervent Christocentric faith as a boarding school student.
By birth, by inherited wealth, by friendships and career success, Moore was an acknowledged member of what was often called the "Liberal Establishment", a group that included Kingman Brewster and Cyrus Vance, along with many other graduates of Yale College. He wrote three books: "The Church Reclaims the City" (1965), "Take a Bishop Like Me" (1979), and, after his retirement, "Presences: A Bishop's Life in the City" (1997), a memoir of his life.
Personal life.
In 1944, while in the Marine Corps, Moore married Jenny McKean, a daughter of Bohemian privilege reared on the North Shore of Boston and educated at Madeira School, Vassar College and Barnard College. (Her mother was Margarett Sargent McKean, a noted painter in the Ashcan School and a follower of George Luks.) Together they had nine children (and, at his death, many grandchildren). Jenny McKean Moore published a well reviewed account of their decade together in the slums of Jersey City under the title "The People on Second Street" (1968). During that time the family lived in the tenement-like rectory of Grace van Vorst Church on Second Street in Jersey City (now called in his honor, Bishop Paul Moore Place).
Jenny McKean Moore died of colon cancer in 1973. Eighteen months later Moore married Brenda Hughes Eagle, a childless widow twenty two years his junior. She died of alcoholism in 1999. It was she who discovered his bisexual infidelity, around 1990, and made it known to his children, who kept the secret, as he had asked them to, until Honor Moore's revelations in 2008.
Honor Moore, the oldest of the Moore children and a bisexual, revealed that her father was himself bisexual with a history of gay affairs in a story she wrote about him in the March 3, 2008 issue of "The New Yorker" and in the book "The Bishop's Daughter: A Memoir" (W.

Jesse Hawley (American football)

Jesse Barnum Hawley (March 25, 1887 – March 21, 1946) was an American football coach. He served as the head coach at the University of Iowa from 1910 to 1915 and at Dartmouth College from 1923 to 1928, compiling a career college football record of 63–28–1. Hawley was the tenth head coach in Iowa football history and led Dartmouth to a national championship in 1925.
Coaching career.
Iowa.
Hawley was hired by the University of Iowa as its tenth head football coach in 1910. Iowa had not won the conference title in a decade, and Hawkeye fans were hoping Hawley could turn Iowa's fortunes around. School officials also hired Nelson A. Kellogg in 1910 to be Iowa's athletic director. Supervision of intercollegiate athletics at Iowa had, since 1900, also been the responsibility of the head coach. Hawley, however, could focus solely on coaching the football team.
Hawley's Hawkeyes had a 5–2 record in 1910. The most notable game that season was a loss to Missouri. Before traveling to Columbia for the game, Hawley was warned not to take Archie Alexander, Iowa's talented black tackle, along for the game. Fearing troubles similar to what Frank Holbrook, Iowa's first black football player, encountered in a game against Missouri in 1896, Hawley agreed to leave Alexander behind. When the Iowa team arrived in Columbia, a mob of local townspeople met the team to ensure that Alexander was not with them. In view of the racial incidents as well as the unsportsmanlike treatment Hawkeye players received during the game, Hawley vowed that Iowa would never again play Missouri in football as long as he was the coach. It has been longer than that. The two neighboring state universities did not meet again until the Insight Bowl in 2010.
A 1–3 start was cause for concern in 1911, but Iowa finished the year strong and had a solid 4–3 record in 1912. The biggest win of the 1912 season was a 20–7 victory over Iowa State, the last Iowa State team to win a conference title. It was also the final loss in the coaching career of Clyde Williams, a former Iowa football star.
Hawley was poised to field his best Iowa team in 1913. The 1913 Hawkeyes had a 5–2 record and easily led the nation in scoring. Only a loss to Chicago kept Iowa from the Western Conference title. However, Iowa responded the following week with a 78–6 victory over Northwestern, the team that cost Iowa a share of the Western Conference title in 1910. Iowa's 78 points is the most ever surrendered by a Northwestern team, and the 72 point loss is the second largest defeat in Northwestern school history. The Hawkeyes also defeated Cornell College, 76–0, and Indiana, 60–0. Iowa's 45–7 win over Iowa State was the most lopsided in series history at the time and was Iowa's first Homecoming win.
Iowa defeated Northern Iowa, 95–0, to open the 1914 season under Hawley. It is the largest margin of victory in Iowa history and easily Northern Iowa's biggest loss. However, many fans were critical of Iowa's win, stating that winning 95–0 did little to prepare Iowa for the rest of the season. They may have been correct; Iowa lost consecutive conference games by 7–0 scores to knock the Hawkeyes from the conference race yet again.
Iowa started 3–0 in 1915, but Iowa lost the final four games of the season, and criticism of Hawley mounted. Specifically, eleven of the best players in the Western Conference were Iowans playing for other member schools. Undefeated Minnesota started four Iowans, Chicago and Northwestern each started three, and the star of the 1915 Wisconsin team was an Iowan as well. Five Iowans earned all-conference honors in 1915, and only one played for Iowa. In addition, Hawley only coached and lived in Iowa City during the season, and many Hawkeye fans felt the program needed a "full-time" coach. As a result, Hawley resigned after the 1915 season.
Hawley had a 24–18 record at Iowa. He was a quiet, reserved coach who believed in fundamentals and attention to detail. He was also a brilliant offensive coach who guided Iowa to some of the most lopsided wins in school history.
Dartmouth.
When Hawley resigned at Iowa, he stated that he wanted to spend more time with his investment business. He was a successful investor and businessman before he arrived at Iowa. Hawley, a Dartmouth College graduate, returned to Hanover and continued his business after leaving Iowa in 1915.
In 1923, Dartmouth's football team needed a head coach, and Hawley took the job and stayed for six years. Successful in private enterprise, he volunteered his services and coached his alma mater for free.
Under Hawley, Dartmouth went 22 games without a loss from 1923 to 1926. Hawley reached the pinnacle of success in 1925, when he led Dartmouth to an undefeated 8–0 season, for which Dartmouth claims the national championship. Other than two national titles claimed by Princeton in the 1930s under Fritz Crisler, the 1925 Dartmouth national title is the last claimed by an Ivy League school.

Detroit Techno Militia

Detroit Techno Militia is a grass roots collective of DJ's and producers located in Detroit, MI on a mission to promote Detroit Techno around the world. They compare their mission to restoring an old building. Musically, they believe that Detroit has a lot to offer, and they want to make sure the rest of the world knows about it.
After years of incorporation, in early 2007 Detroit Techno Militia formally launched their record label with a distribution deal from Cratesavers Muzik. After three very successful 12" vinyl EP releases, DTM001, DTM002, and DTM003, they amicably split with Cratesavers and took all of the responsibilities in-house. Their next two 12" vinyl EPs, DTM004, and DTM005 were independently released and distributed. Today, the Detroit Techno Militia continues to release music on their own vinyl label, their digital label: "DTM Digital", and several other internationally distributed record labels.
The Detroit Techno Militia also features ensemble acts with multiple DJs performing on multiple turntables at the same time. In the summer of 2007, the DTM 5x5 was formed. The DTM 5x5 was the first group in the Techno genre to feature five DJs (Darkcube, T.Linder, DJ Seoul, Neil V. and DJ Psycho) performing together on five analog turntables. On April 17, 2010, at The Fillmore Detroit, Detroit Techno Militia won the Detroit Music Awards Electronic/Dance Category: Outstanding Electronic Music Group, following in the footstep of previous winners and Detroit legends: Carl Craig & Amp Fiddler. Their groundbreaking performance on the Made In Detroit Stage at the 2011 Movement: Detroit Electronic Music Festival stands out as one of the most memorable sets at the three day festival.
In 2013, Detroit Techno Militia launched their first internet podcast called The Grid. The two hour show is broadcast on Burst Radio in Detroit.

Jesse Hawley (merchant)

Jesse Hawley was a flour merchant in Geneva, New York who became an early and major proponent of building of the Erie Canal.
Struggling to receive shipments and make deliveries over the wretched roadways of the era, Hawley imagined the canal as early as 1805. Eventually, in 1807, Hawley's difficulties in securing reasonably priced transportation drove him to debtors' prison for twenty months. While in prison, writing under the name "Hercules", he published fourteen essays on the idea of the canal from the Hudson river to Lake Erie; they appeared in the "Genesee Messenger".
Considering his modest education and lack of formal training as an engineer or surveyor, Hawley's writing was remarkable; he pulled together a wealth of information necessary to the project, provided detailed analysis of the problems to be solved, and wrote with great eloquence and foresight on the importance the canal would have to the state and to the nation. Though they were deemed the ravings of a madman by some, Hawley's essays were to prove immensely influential on the development of the canal. 
Hawley was a member of the New York State Assembly (Genesee Co.) in 1820-21.
His continued interest in the Erie Canal is evidenced in an 1840 essay, "An Essay on the Enlargement of the Erie Canal". 
He was buried at the Cold Springs Cemetery in Lockport, New York.

International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos

The International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos is an international agreement signed in Geneva on July 23, 1962 between 14 states and Laos. It was a result of the International Conference on the Settlement of the Laotian Question which lasted from May 16, 1961 to July 23, 1962.
Burma, Cambodia, Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, India, Poland, the Republic of Vietnam, Thailand, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed a Declaration which together with the statement of neutrality by the Royal Government of Laos of July 9, 1962, entered into force as an international agreement on the date of signature July 23, 1962.
The 14 signatories pledged to respect Laotian neutrality, to refrain from interference — direct or indirect — in the internal affairs of Laos, and to refrain from drawing Laos into military alliance or to establish military bases in Laotian territory. The Laotian government pledged to promulgate constitutionally its commitments which would have the force of law.
However, the agreement was violated in when the Democratic Republic of Vietnam established a supply line through "neutral" Laotian territory for supplying the Viet Cong insurgency against the government of South Vietnam.
More specifically, during the Second Indochina War the North Vietnamese obtained the cooperation of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (Pathet Lao) in constructing and maintaining the Ho Chi Minh Trail which passed through the length of Laos. Thousands of Vietnamese troops were stationed in Laos to maintain the road network and provide for its security. Vietnamese military personnel also fought beside the Pathet Lao in its struggle to overthrow Laos' neutralist government. Cooperation persisted after the war and the Lao communist victory.

José Francisco Cevallos

José Francisco Cevallos Villavicencio (born April 17, 1971 in Ancón, Santa Elena Province) is an Ecuadorian retired football goalkeeper and current Minister of Sports in Ecuador. Nicknamed "Las Manos del Ecuador" (), Cevallos is considered by many to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of Ecuadorian football. He has won three national titles (1991, 1995, 1997) with Guayaquil based club Barcelona, with whom he has spent the majority of his professional career. As the goalkeeper for LDU Quito, he was a key figure in the team's 2008 Copa Libertadores title, where he saved three penalties in the deciding penalty shoot-out.

Enantiornis

Enantiornis is a genus of enantiornithine birds. The type and only currently accepted species "E. leali" is from Late Cretaceous rocks at El Brete, Argentina.
They are among the largest enantiornithine birds discovered to date, with a length in life of around one meter (excluding tail) and its ecological niche resembled that of a mid-sized vulture or eagle.
"E. leali" was possibly fairly closely related to "Avisaurus", another genus of probably carnivorous enantiornithines, though its exact relationship is unclear. It is placed in a family of its own, Enantiornithidae.
Other species from Asia that were previously placed in this genus are now split off. The former "Enantiornis martini" is now placed in "Incolornis", while the former "Enantiornis walkeri" is now tentatively assigned to "Explorornis". The reasons for this are that these birds were described when the diversity of enantiornithine birds was underestimated.

Fanny Duberly

Frances Isabella ("Fanny") Duberly (27 September 1829 – January 1903) was an English soldier’s wife who published a journal of her experiences on campaign in the Crimean War and the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Her husband, Captain Henry Duberly, was paymaster to the 8th Royal Irish Hussars, part of the British light cavalry that took part in the Charge of the Light Brigade. Duberley's journal of her time in the Crimea was published as "Journal Kept During the Russian War." It not only includes eye-witness accounts, but is also a record of gossip and rumours circulating in the British Army.
Early history.
Born Frances Isabella Locke in 1829, the daughter of Wadham Locke, a Wiltshire banker, Duberly has been described as "a splendid rider, witty, ambitious, daring, lively, loquacious and gregarious." She seemed to possess the physical requirements and tough attitude required of her surroundings, saying that she "was awoke by the reveille at half-past two; rose, packed our bedding and tent, got a stale egg and a mouthful of brandy, and was in my saddle by half-past five."
After the death of her mother in 1838, she moved to live with her eldest brother (also Wadham Locke) at Ashton Gifford House in Wiltshire. She left Ashton Gifford on her marriage in 1845, which took place shortly after her brother had married for a second time.
Crimea.
Duberly travelled with her husband to the Crimea in 1854 and stayed with him throughout his time there, despite the protests of commanders such as Lord Lucan. As the only officer's wife at the front, she was a centre of attention. She was told of planned attacks ahead of time, giving her the opportunity to be in a good position to witness them. Such was the case at the Battle of Balaclava, where her journey from camp to meet up with Henry and watch the battle took her quite close to the enemy. Though her husband survived the day (being away on staff duties), many of her friends did not: "Even my closed eyelids were filled with the ruddy glare of blood." Being so close to the front line in one of the first "modern" wars, Mrs Duberly differed from many of her compatriots back home in comprehending the reality of war. When her husband asked if she wanted to view the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman, she told him she could not as "the thought of it made me shutter and turn sick."
Duberly’s adventures did not always sit well with society. She was pointedly snubbed at the Royal review of her husband’s regiment after the war. The journal she published after the war had originally been intended to have a dedication to Queen Victoria, but this was refused, much to her dismay. Nonetheless she was popular with the troops (who nicknamed her "Mrs. Jubilee") and many people in England. Her published journal met with some success and prints of a photo of her taken by Roger Fenton sold quite well.
India.
Duberly again accompanied her husband when the 8th Hussars were sent to India in 1856. She stayed with him throughout the final months of the Sepoy Mutiny. She was adamant about accompanying the troops on campaign and told her sister that she would "stain my face and hands and adopt the Hindoo caftan and turban," refusing to stay behind. At Gwalior in 1858, while watching the start of a cavalry charge, her horse ran after the rest and, instead of holding back, she told her husband "I must go!" and galloped away.
Married life.
The Duberlys had no children. She was a great friend and supporter of her husband, who never seemed to be jealous of his wife as the centre of attention in the all-male environment of the British Army in the field. She described her husband as "a friend I am obliged to support." He was ill when the time came to go ashore in the Crimea and she told her sister that "Lord Cardigan intends him to land with the troops, but I don’t intend him to do so." The Duberlys had their differences of opinion on the nature of military service. When orders came from Lucan that she must be put ashore at Constantinople, she wrote that "Henry looks upon the order as a soldier; I as a woman, and laugh at it."
Later life.
The Duberlys returned to England in 1864. She retained her campaign memories but, when asked to reminisce about what she had witnessed, she replied that "those days are best forgotten." Nevertheless, she retained her adventurous spirit and complained to a nephew in 1896 that "I cannot stand dullness for long, and life gets duller and duller as one gets older." She died at Cheltenham in 1903, aged 73.
Fiction.
Fanny Duberly was played by Jill Bennett in the 1968 film "The Charge of the Light Brigade". In this, she was wrongly depicted as having a sexual relationship with Cardigan, played by Trevor Howard.
She featured in two books about Harry Flashman by George MacDonald Fraser: "Flash for Freedom!" and "Flashman at the Charge". In both of these, particularly the former, she is a target for Flashman's lust but he fails in his attempted seduction of her. Fraser introduces her, still Fanny Locke, as "a damned handsome eighteen with the shape of a well-developed matron." He remarks on her prettiness, fair hair and blue eyes as well as complimenting her on her riding skills: "she could ride, that girl." Flashman desires to have sex with her, opportunity allowing, and laments not being able to do so or at least to "give her tits a squeeze." Fraser has Flashman jealous of Duberly's husband, describing him in Flashman's words as a "muff" who, when on guard duty, sits outside the room "like a blasted water bailiff."
Mrs Duberly is mentioned in "Queen Victoria's Bomb" by Ronald Clark (1967). The story consists of the memoirs of Professor Franklin Huxtable whose invention of an ultimate weapon in the 1850s was supposed to make warfare impossible. The bomb is trialled in a remote part of India and resulted in the vaporising some unfortunate horses whose shadows were left as a permanent record burnt on the landscape.

Bachelor Father (UK TV series)

Bachelor Father is a British sitcom starring Ian Carmichael that aired for two series from 1970 to 1971. It was written by Richard Waring.
Background.
"Bachelor Father" is loosely based on the life of Peter Lloyd Jeffock. Jeffock was a bachelor who had fostered twelve children. He later wrote an autobiography called "Only Uncle". Richard Waring, who wrote "Bachelor Father", based some of the plots on incidents told in "Only Uncle". Waring said that he would have kept more to "Only Uncle", but many of the true stories were so far-fetched, he thought the public wouldn't believe them.
Plot.
Peter Lamb is a rich man who has always wanted a family, but failed to sustain any relationships. In the first episode, he decides to foster children. He then fosters a variety of diverse children
Episodes.
22 episodes in total were produced; because of the BBC's wiping policy of the 1970s, only one original filmed episode exists (the first one). All of the episodes of series 2 were later recovered on 16mm film prints, but 10 out of 13 episodes of series 1 is still missing from the archives.
Archival status.
As of 2012, A total of only around 12 episodes remain within the BBC TV archives, (11 of the 12 remaining episodes now only exist on black-and-white, 2 of the 3 surviving episodes from the first along with all nine episodes from the second now (though made originally in colour) only exist in black-and-white, leaving the very first episode (Family Feeling) the only episode of Bachelor Father to still exist within colour.

WIZE

WIZE (1340 AM) — branded WIZE AM 1340 — is a commercial radio station in Springfield, Ohio owned by Clear Channel Communications as part of their Dayton cluster. The station's main format is classic country targeted towards Springfield, and their transmitter - and former studios - are also located in Springfield.
Prior to April 22, 2011, WIZE operated as a near 24-hour simulcast of WONE 980-AM, most recently, with sports talk programming from Fox Sports Radio, in addition to "The Jim Rome Show".
History.
The station took the air on November 1, 1940, and was very active in the community. Its founder and first owner was The Radio Voice of Springfield Inc.
In the station's early days, nationally known comedian Jonathan Winters had a program on WIZE. However, in the mid 1960s, WIZE adopted a Top 40 format, increasing its popularity and revenue. Under the leadership of Station Manager Steve Joos, listenership (and advertising revenues) grew to the point that WIZE was the most profitable station in the Great Trails Broadcasting chain. WING in Dayton, WCOL in Columbus and WGTZ, Eaton (formerly WJAI) were also owned by Great Trails.
The station was moved from its downtown location on West High Street to a location on Miracle Mile. In order to comply with zoning regulations, the building had to be set back from the road and had to look like a residence. As a result, WIZE's studios had a country setting while remaining in the city. Among the list of past employees include Jim Baldridge(later of WHIO-TV), Duke Rollins, Sonny Palmer, Paul Carman, Ron Allen (now with ESPN International),the late John Hall (John Stalder), Johnny Walker (DJ born 1942) (later of WKEF-TV), Lee Brenner (Lee Aufdenkampe), John King (F. John Damewood), Geoff Davis, Jerry "T" Tritle, and Pat Barry (who achieved more recognition as a TV weatherman in Cincinnati). WIZE was also the home to news and sports director Gerry Allen (Gerry Pavelka) and notable news reporters Karen Anderson and Darryl Bauer (now of WHIO-AM).
In 1982, Joos left WIZE to accept a position in Columbus. He was replaced as General Manager by Joe Taylor who instituted numerous changes in the station. He brought in two new staff members (Sandy Alexander and Dennis Carter) and changed the format to a unique middle-of-the-road type format. This was at a time when FM radio was becoming more popular and AM stations were having problems attracting listeners and advertising revenues. Taylor thus instituted an all-out sales push, selling commercials for as little as a dollar. As a result, the station was oversold, often running as much as 40 minutes of commercial material each hour.
Taylor only lasted a few years as General Manager, and was replaced by George Wymer (son of WING, Dayton, radio legend Jack Wymer) with the intention of purchasing the station from Great Trails. He was unable to make the purchase and left the station.
The next General Manager was Jerry Staggs, who eventually did purchase the station. Under Staggs' watch, WIZE associated with the former WBLY, the predecessor of WULM as part of a local marketing agreement with owner RAY (Ronald A. Yontz) Broadcasting. By this time, both stations operated in the same building. Staggs sold the station in 1990 to WONE's then-owner, DKM Broadcasting, which dropped all local programming for a simulcast of WONE, effectively ending any and all relationship with Springfield.
After a stint as a country music station, WONE/WIZE changed to Adult Standards on November 29, 1994. It adopted its present sports talk format (as "Sports ONE") on December 8, 2003, competing with Radio One-owned WING. This eventually became a near-total simulcast of then "1360 Homer" in Cincinnati, which continues even as the "Homer" format itself moved from WSAI to WCKY 1530-AM on July 2006. This simulcast with WCKY would eventually be severed in 2007, when WONE/WIZE would start to air local sports talk in the afternoon, as well as clearing Fox Sports Radio in the morning hours (which eventually led to a clearance of Dayton native Dan Patrick's late morning show.)
WIZE continued to relay WONE until April 22, 2011, when it broke away to carry a country oldies music format. WULM's usage of the former WIZE studios at the WIZE transmitter site ended in June 2010 (when after being sold to Radio Maria Inc. as a repeater of originating station KJMJ in the spring of 2008), the WULM studio equipment was moved to the Father Boyle Center near St. Bernard Parish at 920 Lagonda Avenue which will feed local live programs to originator KJMJ and its repeater network...as a result,the WIZE studio building now sits nearly vacant as WIZE programming is fed from Dayton.

Thai Airways Flight 365

Thai Airways Flight 365 was a Thai Airways Company Boeing 737-2P5 with registration number HS-TBC. Flight 365 was on a scheduled flight from Hat Yai International Airport to Phuket International Airport (both in Thailand) on 31 August 1987. On this flight there were a total of 83 people: 74 passengers and 9 crew. 
The Boeing 737 was delivered to Thai Airways in 1980 and had no previous adverse incident history.
The meteorological conditions were good as Flight 365 approached Phuket International Airport. As they prepared to land, the flight crew of Flight 365 expressed concern about a Dragonair Boeing 737 that was also landing at the airport but behind and below their aircraft. A lapse in concentration by the flight crew occurred allowing the speed of Flight 365 to fall below the minimum limit. The aircraft stalled and plunged into the water before the flight crew was able to make a recovery. Everyone on board the aircraft was killed.
Investigation.
The probable cause for the crash of Flight 365 was determined to be "The pilot slowed the aircraft and it stalled while the pilot prepared to be number one on landing as advised by Phuket approach control. It appears that he was worrying and not sure whether he could make number one landing because the pilot of number two aircraft in sequence gave warning that the number one aircraft ahead was above him and could not descend passing through his level. The pilot added power and raised the gear after stick shaker activated but didn't execute a recovery before hitting the sea." In addition to pilot error, the air traffic controller was blamed for failing to keep Flight 365 and the Dragonair 737 adequately separated.

Teupitz

Teupitz () is a small town in the Dahme-Spreewald district, in Brandenburg, Germany. It is the administrative seat of the Schenkenländchen municipal association ("Amt").
Geography.
The town is situated on the southern shore of Teupitzer See lake, northwest of the district capital Lübben, and about south of Berlin centre. The municipal area comprises the subdivisions of Egsdorf, Neuendorf and Tornow.
It has access to the Bundesautobahn 13, part of the European route E55, at the nearby Teupitz junction.
Demography.
Detailed data sources are to be found in the Wikimedia Commons.
History.
Teupitz probably arose from a medieval Slavic settlement during the "Ostsiedlung" of German peasants and craftsmen. A "Tupcz" fortification was first mentioned in a 1307 deed, issued by Margrave Herman of Brandenburg at Spandau. The Ascanian rulers of Margraviate of Brandenburg had just acquired the estates in the former March of Lusatia from Margrave Dietrich IV of Wettin. 
The castle, located on a peninsula, from about 1330 served as a seat of the Schenk von Landsberg noble family. In 1411 one Albert Schenk von Landsberg, Lord of Teupitz and of Seyda in Saxe-Wittenberg, served as the Saxon representative at the (second) election of King Sigismund. The dynasty flourished for about four centuries until its extinction in 1721, leaving the local water castle as well as further residences in Königs Wusterhausen and Groß Leuthen. They also had the Brick Gothic Holy Ghost parish church erected and in 1437 on their own authority elevated Teupitz to the status of a town.
From 1717 the remnants of the castle were acquired by the Prussian state and served as the seat of the local Prussian "Amt" administration until 1812, when it was purchased as a private "Rittergut" manor. The town privileges were acknowledged in the 1808 Prussian reforms and a town hall was erected in 1830. After Theodor Fontane had published his "Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg" travelogue in 1880, Teupitz due to its picturesque setting became a popular destination for daytrippers from the Berlin agglomeration. In 1910 the Prussian Province of Brandenburg opened a sanatorium and in 1930 the former castle was again rebuilt as a hotel, which after World War II was used as a recreation centre by the East German Communist Party (SED).

Solesmes Abbey

Solesmes Abbey or St. Peter's Abbey, Solesmes ("Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes") is a Benedictine monastery in Solesmes (Sarthe, France), famous as the source of the restoration of Benedictine monastic life in the country under Dom Prosper Guéranger after the French Revolution. The current abbot is the Right Reverend Dom Philippe Dupont, O.S.B.
Priory.
It was originally founded in 1010 as a priory of the Benedictine Le Mans abbey. Its history was largely uneventful. It suffered considerably during the Hundred Years' War but was afterwards restored. From the 17th century it underwent a slow decline under a series of commendatory priors. It was dissolved in 1791 in the course of the French Revolution.
Abbey.
In 1831 the remaining buildings, which had escaped demolition in the Revolution but were threatened with destruction for want of a buyer, came to the attention of the locally born priest Prosper Guéranger, who, inspired by the vision of a restored monastic life in France, acquired them for the home of a new Benedictine community, which moved in on 11 July 1833. Against all expectation the new community flourished and in 1837 not only received Papal approval, but was elevated to the rank of an abbey and made the head of the newly created French Benedictine Congregation, now the Solesmes Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation.
In 1866 a convent, St. Cecilia's Abbey, Solesmes, was also founded at Solesmes, by Mother Cécile Bruyère (the first abbess) with the support of Dom Guéranger, which was the first house of the nuns of the Solesmes Congregation.
The abbey was closed several times by French legislation, and between 1901 and 1922 the monks were forced into exile in England. They settled on the Isle of Wight and built the present Quarr Abbey. The community survived those trials and those of two World Wars and is still at Solesmes.
As part of its mission of monastic revival the abbey has been the mother house of numerous other monastic foundations, most notably in recent years the monastery at Palendriai in Lithuania.
The abbey is noted for its crucial contribution to the advancement of the Roman Catholic liturgy and the revival of Gregorian chant. A documentary film on life at Solesmes was made in 2009 and focuses on the tradition of the chant at the monastery.

36th Academy Awards

The 36th Academy Awards, honoring the best in film for 1963, were held on April 13, 1964 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California. They were hosted by Jack Lemmon.
Best Picture winner "Tom Jones" became the only film in history to garner three Best Supporting Actress nominations; it also tied the Oscar record of five unsuccessful acting nomination, set by "Peyton Place" at the 30th Academy Awards.
This year's winner for Best Actress category was unique. Although playing a supporting role and having a relatively small amount on the screen, Patricia Neal won the Best Actress category for her lead (or supporting) role in "Hud". The movie also won for Best Supporting Actor for Melvyn Douglas and Best Cinematography – Black and White. It was the second and, to date, last film to win two acting awards without being nominated for Best Picture (the other being "The Miracle Worker").
At age 71 Margaret Rutherford set a then record for the oldest winner for Best Supporting Actress. Coincidentally, the year before Patty Duke set a then record for the youngest winner ever. Rutherford was also only the 2nd Oscar winner to be over the age of 70 at the time of her win. The other was Edmund Gwenn.
This was the first time an African American won in the category Best Actor, and the first time a winning film ("An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge") had been aired on network television prior to the ceremony.
Best Sound Editing was introduced this year, with "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" winning the award.

Multiple nominations and awards.
These films had multiple nominations:
The following films received multiple awards.
Sidney Poiter's Achievement for Being the First African American to win an Academy Award for Best Male Actor in a Leading Role.
Sidney Poitier's performance in the Lilies of the Field as Homer Smith earned him an award for Best Male Actor in a Leading Role. This would mark the first time an African American male would win a competitive oscar. This win would come five years after his nomination for Best Actor in the 1958 feature film, The Defiant Ones, for which he was passed over for David Nivens' performance in the film Separate Tables. Another African American male would not win the award for Best Male Actor in a leading role until 33 years later with Denzel Washington, for his portrayal of Alonzo Harris in the 2001 feature film Training Day. However, it should be noted that this occurrence is not the first time an African American has won an Academy Award. Hattie McDaniel won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting role in 1939 for her portrayal of Mammie in the highly acclaimed feature film Gone with the Wind. By doing so, she was also the first African American to be nominated for acting, the first African American woman to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and be the oldest African American actress to ever receive an Academy Award at the age of 44. An African American woman would not win the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role until 2001, for Halle Berry's portrayal of Leticia Musgrove in the feature film, Monsters Ball.

<doc id="6001371" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001371" title="Super Expander 64">
Super Expander 64

The Super Expander 64 was a cartridge-based extension to the built in BASIC V2 interpreter of the then immensely popular Commodore 64 home computer: Since the 64 was developed in a hurry, Commodore simply adapted the BASIC V2 from the PET line of computers and the VIC 20 for their new machine, with no support for the advanced sound and graphics capabilities of the 64. To make use of the advanced hardware, BASIC programmers needed to memorize hardware addresses and "POKE" commands directly to the memory-mapped devices. Later 8-bit systems from Commodore had BASIC interpreters enhanced to support the special hardware, and with the Super Expander 64 cartridge, Commodore 64 users could "retrofit" their machine with a BASIC to match the hardware capabilities.
The extra code was mapped into the "lower cartridge" 8 kilobytes area at $8000-$9FFF, thus reducing the 38911 bytes for user programs by said 8K.
Graphics.
After initializing the screen for "high-resolution" (320 × 200 monochrome pixels) or multicolor (160 wide × 200 pixels in four colors) graphics with the GRAPHIC command, one could draw lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, boxes and more using the DRAW, CIRCLE, and BOX commands. PAINT would "flood-fill" an area enclosed by lines, e.g. the interior of a CIRCLE or BOX. A CHAR command was used to "print" characters from the character generator ROM onto the bitmap graphics screen. SSHAPE and GSHAPE would store the contents of a rectangular area of the high-res graphics into a string variable, and GSHAPE would "stamp" it back onto the screen at arbitrary locations. Such "graphics-in-a-string" could also be used to transfer something drawn on the hi-res screen into one of the eight sprite patterns.
Sprites.
Besides a range of commands to initialize, position and move sprites (or Movable Object Blocks as Commodore called them; hardware-supported graphic elements that could move freely on the screen independently of other graphics and text on the screen), Super Expander had a built in tool to edit the pattern of 8 sprites (called upon with the SPRDEF command), either in high-res (24 × 21 pixels) or multicolor (12 wide × 21 pixels) mode.
There was even a way of implementing "interrupts" in the BASIC program if two sprites collided, if a sprite collided with other graphics and/or text on the screen, or if an attached light pen was activated. A COLINT command set up the interrupt, pointing to the beginning BASIC line number of the "interrupt handler", which had to end in a RETURN statement (part of standard, unexpanded BASIC) in order to transfer control back to the interrupted, "mainline" part of the program.
Sound.
Playing a sequence of musical notes was hooked onto the standard BASIC "PRINT" command by the use of a special "control character", much like the cursor control, color changes and other control characters. E.g. PRINT CHR$(6);"CDEFGAB" played a rising scale. Commands like TEMPO and TUNE was used to set the playback tempo and the timbre of the note sequence.
A "quirk" of this feature is that by typing the special control character (by pressing CTRL + F) along with a quote mark, then deleting the quote mark, the machine would "play" whatever was typed while editing the program; hit the G key, and the machine played a "Pling!" with the pitch of a G note...!
Hardware I/O.
Functions like RJOY, RPEN and RPOT would read the state of a connected joystick, light pen, or analog "paddle". In combination with the sprite-motion-related commands, it only took a single line of BASIC code to make a sprite move in the direction indicated by a connected joystick.
Miscellaneous.
A KEY command was available, which would set up the four function keys on the 64's keyboard to "enter" an arbitrary string. By default, these keys were set up to type commands like RUN, LIST, SPRDEF, GRAPHICS and others, but the user could change this using the KEY command in either direct mode or under program control.
Technical issues.
All the versions of BASIC on Commodore's 8-bit machines used a scheme of replacing BASIC keywords with single-byte code -- e.g. the word "PRINT" would be substituted by a single byte value, or "token", rather than the five ASCII-codes for the five letters in the word. Super Expander added more commands than this system could accommodate, so a system of two-byte tokens for the new commands was implemented.
Because of a quirk in the BASIC interpreter (the handling of the "THEN-part" of an IF/THEN construct didn't jump through a vector in RAM but instead took a direct JuMP to the standard, unexpanded BASIC command decoding routine), IF/THEN statements needed to have an extra colon (:) inserted right after the THEN keyword, if the following command was one of Super Expander's non-standard BASIC keywords. For instance, IF (condition) THEN DRAW ... would yield a ?SYNTAX ERROR message — one had to write it like IF (condition) THEN:DRAW ... — note the colon between THEN and the Super Expander-added command DRAW.

European Cultural Route

A European Cultural Route is a title awarded to cultural routes recognised as significant throughout Europe by the Council of Europe. The European Institute of Cultural Routes is the body established to help the Council of Europe co-ordinate the development of these routes. Some are developed as scenic roads for motorists.
The first route awarded "European Cultural Route" status was the Way of St. James route (The French Way) to Santiago de Compostela in Spain in 1987.
History and goal.
The "cultural routes of the Council of Europe" are tools of the European cultural cooperation implemented by the Council of Europe with the "European cultural convention" in 1954. The programme of the “cultural routes of the Council of Europe" was officially created in 1987 and is managed by an executive agency of the Council of Europe in Luxembourg since 1998: The European Institute of Cultural Routes. The programme is ruled by a resolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The "cultural routes of the Council of Europe" aims at the protection, the valorisation and the transmission of the European cultural heritage as well as the cultural diversity of Europe. They also aim at the development of the intercultural dialogue.
List of European Cultural Routes.
There are two titles awarded: "Major Cultural Route of the Council of Europe" and "Cultural Route of the Council of Europe".

Least count

Least count is the highest degree of accuracy of measurement that can be achieved. For example the least count of a voltmeter is the minimum change that can be discerned. The formula is - Range/number of divisions.
Every measuring instrument has error when readings are taken. The "least count", "uncertainty" or "maximum possible error" characterize such errors.
Instruments' errors can be compared by calculating the percentage of uncertainty of their readings. The instrument with the least uncertainty is taken to measure objects, as all measurements consider accuracy. The percentage uncertainty is calculated with the following formula:
The smaller the measurement, the larger the percentage uncertainty. The least count of an instrument is inversely proportional to the precision of the instrument.
A Vernier scale is constructed by taking 49 main scale divisions dividing them into 50 divisions
Least count error.
The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count. Measured values are good only up to this value. The least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument.
For example, a vernier caliper's least count is 0.02 mm while a micrometer may have least count of 0.01,spherometer may have a least count of 0.002 mm. Least count error belongs to the category of random errors but within a limited scale; it occurs with both systematic and random errors. If we use a metre scale for measurement of length, it may have graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or interval.
Instruments of higher precision, improving experimental techniques, etc., can reduce the least count error. Repeating the observations and taking the arithmetic mean of the result, the mean value would be very close to the true value of the measured quantity.
Least count is the least unit that a measuring instrument can measure. 
It is given by value of smallest division on main scale divided by total number
of divisions on vernier scale.

European Institute of Cultural Routes

The European Institute of Cultural Routes is a non-profit association based in Luxembourg whose aim is to help the Council of Europe, as a technical body, in the establishment of European Cultural Routes.
It was established in 1998 and its role is:
The Council of Europe:
The European Institute of Cultural Routes
The European Institute of Cultural Routes (EICR) was established as a European public service and technical body as part of a political agreement between the Council of Europe and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (Ministry of Culture, Further Education and Research). Since 1988 the Institute has worked in close collaboration with the Council of Europe in carrying out its responsibilities, namely to ensure the continuity and development of the programme of the Cultural Routes in the 51 signatory countries of the European Cultural Convention and, depending on the geographical and historical requirements of the themes, in those countries which have had and continue to have close relations with Europe.
The EICR resides in the Centre Culturel de Rencontre – Abbaye de Neumünster, in Luxembourg. It retains all relevant documentation and maintains a specialist library on the routes. The Institute regularly welcomes those in charge of the networks of the routes as well as project managers, researchers, students and members of the general public. The EICR is also charged with participating in European training, research and analysis programmes concerning cultural tourism, for the European Commission and various governments and project managers. The Institute organises themed symposiums and specialist training, collaborates in the setting up and running of the Routes, and participates in specialist exhibitions while promoting a greater awareness of the links between culture, tourism and the environment.
From 2004 to 2006 the Institute managed the visibility and communication work of the European research programme PICTURE (Proactive management of the impact of cultural tourism on urban resources and economies).
In 2008 the European Commission (Directorate-General Education and Culture) named the EICR as a body active on a European level in the field of Culture, in recognition for its essential role in creating a coherent programme of sustainable cultural tourism initiatives promoting the “Destination Europe” and encouraging Europeans to discover their common roots and history through travel and the exploration of material and immaterial heritage.
The Institute is a member of NECSTOUR, an association of European regions working to develop competitive and sustainable tourism, and has signed an agreement with the Cité de la Culture et du Tourisme durable to provide distance-learning and to study the sustainability of introducing tourism to the cultural routes. The Institute is currently working with the Council of Europe and the Tourism Unit of the European Commission on a study into the impact of the cultural routes on small and medium businesses.
In 2011 the Institute should welcome a Partial Agreement aimed at combining the voluntary contributions of those member countries of the Council of Europe who wish to increase the funds available to the cultural routes.
Since the opening up of Europe to the East, the Cultural Routes have enabled, and continue to enable (particularly by expanding to include the Southern Caucasus), the creation of a real dialogue between Eastern and Western Europeans. The opening of a resource centre for the Cultural Routes in Sibiu, in the Casa Luxembourg, in liaison with the European Institute of Cultural Routes in Luxembourg and the Mioritics Association is testament to this.

Ib Mossin

Ib Mossin (3 July 1933 – 17 December 2004) was a Danish actor, singer and director best known for his role as heartthrob Peter of the hugely popular "Far til Fire" film series. He had his breakthrough as the apprentice Egon in 1953's Farlig Ungdom ("Dangerous Youth"), a stark drama about the crime scene in Copenhagen among adolescents. He also had roles in fourteen of the eighteen Danish films based on novels by Morten Korch. Later in his life he travelled his home country talking about his experiences as an actor and celebrity. In 1999 he published his memoirs "Filmhelt til Tiden" ("Moviehero on Time").
Biography.
Ib Mossin was born in Frederiksberg. He was son of Erik Otto Mossin, the proprietor of a larger company in Copenhagen. He spend his early years with his mother and stepfather living in Vangså in Thy. He got a job on a fishing boat in Thyborøn and later on another boat. When his stepfather died in 1951 he moved to Copenhagen where he studied acting under Danish actor Ejnar Juhl. After this brief period he got a job on a third ship where he worked for some time. Then his film career started. At that point he was still largely unknown in the Danish film scene but he still managed to get chosen for a role in the film "Farlig Ungdom" (1953) which would become a classic of its time. As he went on to even bigger roles, especially as Peter in all eight original "Far til Fire" films, he became one of the most beloved big screen actors of his time in the Danish film scene.
At the peak of his career he received 150 fan letters each day, which was considered a great accomplishment in Denmark at the time. He immortalized several songs he sang in films, among those the well known “Bornholm, Bornholm, Bornholm,” “Du er min Øjesten” (duet with Peter Malberg), and “Spil en Polka, Spillemand.” As one of the most established and popular actors in Denmark, he started directing films together with Alice O’Fredericks in 1964 and later directed the fisherman's drama "Stormvarsel" (1968) on his own. It turned out to be a box-office failure, alas same fate as most of the films he would later direct. It was also the first of three films he directed starring actress and wife Anne-Marie Juhl. From 1961 to 1968 he owned the fishing boat "EMI". Even though he usually played one of the good guys in his starring films, he took part in the Danish hit series "Matador" about Denmark during World War II in the role as a Nazi, proving his versatility as an actor. He spend his last years as a lecturer, travelling Denmark. He published his memoirs "Filmhelt til Tiden" five years before his death. He is remembered mostly for his parts in the "Far til Fire" film series and in the Morten Korch films.

<doc id="6001442" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001442" title="Sidney Lanier High School">
Sidney Lanier High School

Sidney Lanier High School is a public high school located in Montgomery, Alabama, United States.
History.
Established in 1910 on the southern outskirts of downtown Montgomery, Alabama, the school was named for a Southern poet, Sidney Lanier, who lived in Montgomery during 1866–67.
The high school moved to new facilities in 1929 further to the south. The late Gothic Revival building was constructed 1928–1929 to consolidate the original Lanier (then in a building now known as Baldwin Magnet School, formerly Baldwin Junior High School) and Montgomery County High School (now the Cloverdale campus of Huntingdon College, formerly Cloverdale Junior High School).
The name of the new school was decided by the outcome of a football game between the two schools in the fall of 1928, which Lanier won. 
Frederick Ausfeld was the architect, and Algernon Blair the contractor. The building opened for class in September 1929 and was dubbed "The Million Dollar School" due to its approximate cost.
Notable alumni.
The school claims several famous students, including Bart Starr of professional football fame and Toni Tennille of the popular 1970s singing group “Captain and Tennille.” Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, wife of famous author F. Scott Fitzgerald, and known in her own right, was part of the graduating class of 1918. NFL stars Tommy Neville, Johnny Davis [http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/DaviJo01.htm], Reggie Barlow and Tarvaris Jackson attended Lanier. Longtime Montgomery Mayor Emory Folmar was also a Poet. Hank Williams attended Lanier briefly in 1939 at the age of sixteen before he quit school to pursue his singing career full-time.
World-class hurdler and star football player at the University of Tennessee, and son of the Alabama Attorney General at the time, Richmond Flowers [http://www.tshf.net/inductees/2005Flowers.htm][http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=Flowers_Richmond] wore the Poet blue and white in the mid-1960s. Jimmy Sharpe, a Poet in the late 1950s, was a long-time assistant coach under the legendary Paul "Bear" Bryant at the University of Alabama and was head coach at Virginia Tech University in the middle 1970s. Astronaut Kathryn Thornton and state politician George C. Wallace, III (son of Governor George C. Wallace, Jr., and Governor Lurleen Wallace) were members of the Class of 1970. The late Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., of Florida is another Sidney Lanier alumnus. Alfred Goldthwaite, a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1958 to 1966 and a chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, graduated from Sidney Lanier in 1940. 
Other poets include one time United States Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Carl Mundy, Southern Poverty Law Center C.E.O. Morris Dees, Donell Taylor of the N.B.A.'s Washington Wizards, former Golden State Warriors basketball player Orlando Graham, former Boston Celtics player Marcus Webb, Buckmasters founder Jackie Bushman, former Carolina Panthers football player Jeno James, and Alabama high school basketball coach Bill Joiner. In 1968, Arlam Carr, Jr., son of civil rights figure, Mrs. Johnnie Carr, became the school's first African-American graduate. Carr would later become news director of WSFA, an NBC television affiliate. Broadway star Felicia Boswell also graduated from Lanier. Actor Hosea Chanchez plays Malik Wright on "The Game"
Academics.
As late as the 1960s the student population of Lanier was all white. In 2004, the student population included only six white students. Besides white flight, another factor influencing this change can be found in the neighborhood schools concept adopted by the Montgomery Board of Education. The zoned neighborhood surrounding Lanier - once all white - is now almost completely African-American.
Lanier’s focus is now on four academies: Leadership, Business, Health, and Arts. 
In 2006, Lanier was the only traditional public high school in Montgomery to meet federally mandated No Child Left Behind standards.
Athletics.
Lanier High School has excelled in athletics from its inception through the 1960s, winning state championships in all high school sports. In 1966, Lanier was triple state champs, winning top honors in football, basketball, and track and field. 1966 was the first of three successive state championships in football, with the school’s last state championship occurring in 1968.[http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/specialreports/175anniversary/storyV5lanier_exp.htm][http://www.ahsaasports.com/football/paststatechampions.asp]
Coaches Bobby Wilson (football) and Bill Joiner (basketball)dominated high school football and basketball in the state for most of the 1960s, winning six football (Wilson) and four basketball (Joiner) state championships in the large high school category. [http://www.ahsaa.com/hall_of_fame/2004/ 
Wilson led Lanier to state championships in 1957, 1961, 1964, 1966, 1967, and 1968. Joiner led Lanier to state championships in 1962, 1963, 1965, and 1967, and he played on the first Lanier state championship team in basketball in 1949. His teams were state runners-up twice.
Lanier-Lee rivalry.
The Lee-Lanier rivalry in Montgomery was unmatched in the state in the late 1950s and through the 1960s. For years, Sidney Lanier was the only public school for white students in segregated Montgomery. As Montgomery’s population began to increase, another school for whites was built in 1955 - Robert E. Lee High. Its arrival gave birth to one of the state’s great high school football rivalries.
At one time they were the two largest high schools in the state. All the white students in Montgomery went to one school or the other, and when they played football against each other it was the “only show in town.” 25,000 paying fans came out every time they played.
The Poets won the next two Class 4A titles as well (1967, 1968), proving at the time that truly “The Pen is Mightier than the Sword.” The Generals ascended to the throne in 1969 and 1970. After 1970, Montgomery schools would win state championships again, but never again would Montgomery dominate football in Alabama like it did in the 1960s. Racial integration and the emergence of Jeff Davis High School as a football power in 1970 diminished the Lee-Lanier rivalry.
The Lanier dynasty.
Lanier started its tradition of winning State Championships in prep football in 1920, winning the first recognized state championship in Alabama. Lanier was champion again in 1922 and 1939. Later, in the mid-1950s, came the "Wilson Era" in Lanier football.
Bobby Wilson had a distinguished football career as a player, especially in college at the University of Alabama, where in 1953 he was Captain of the Crimson Tide’s 1953 Orange Bowl championship team. He also ranked third in the nation in punting that season, and he ended his collegiate career as a member of the College All-Stars that played the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field in Chicago.
But what he did as head football coach at Lanier was even more remarkable. He arrived at Lanier in 1956 as an assistant, moved up to head coach the next year, and turned the Poets into a dynasty. During his 13 years at the helm, the Poets won six state championships and compiled a 92-24-6 record, including a 33-game win streak in the mid-late 1960s, one of the longest in Alabama high school football history. 
Wilson’s first three titles – in 1957, 1961, and 1964 – were determined in various newspaper polls throughout the state, but the next three – 1966, 1967, and 1968 – were decided on the field, representing the first three years of Alabama High School Athletic Association state playoff system.
Lanier also achieved a sustained dynasty in basketball, playing in more state championship games and winning more state championships in the large high school category than any other high school from the 1920s through its most recent championship in 2001. In the early 1950s Sidney Lanier High School won the state championship in baseball 6 years in a row (1950–1955).
Famous players.
Famous players at Lanier abound, but two stand out in particular: Bart Starr and Richmond Flowers, Jr. 
Bryan Bartlett Starr was a Sidney Lanier athlete in the early 1950s. It would be in the NFL where Starr would make his mark. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 17th round in 1956, arguably the best bargain in NFL draft history. Playing under legendary coach Vince Lombardi, Starr guided the Packers to six Western Division titles, five world titles, and two Super Bowl victories. He played for Green Bay until retiring in 1971. Six years later, Starr was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. He served as the Packers’ head coach from 1975 to 1983. In 1976, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.
Richmond Flowers, Jr. was the original “Super Recruit.” Flowers attracted the attention of college coaches from California to Maine. He earned All-America football honors at the University of Tennessee and was drafted out of college by the Dallas Cowboys in 1970. He was a member of Dallas’ Super Bowl V team. In 1999, he was named one of the top 25 collegiate receivers of the 20th Century by “Athlon Magazine".
As a track star, he was unparalleled in Alabama prep history. 
The focus of a national recruiting battle boiled down to Louisiana State University, Alabama, and Tennessee. He landed at Tennessee where he went on to become an NCAA track champion and Southeastern Conference football star. He was an NCAA hurdles champion and was chosen All-SEC by his sophomore year in football.
It was at Lanier where the legend began. Young Flowers was a great hurdler – the greatest high school hurdler of his time – owning the fastest times in the nation in the 120-yard and 180-yard hurdles. His father, Richmond Flowers Sr., was the state’s attorney general at the time and a bitter political foe of then-popular governor, George C. Wallace. That conflict – and young Richmond’s rise to stardom – was later documented in a movie entitled, “Unconquered.”
In addition to Starr and Flowers, Johnny Davis (San Francisco 49ers), Reggie Barlow (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), and Jeno James (Carolina Panthers) have also represented Lanier in Super Bowls; all except James were on winning teams. Current Minnesota Vikings quarterback, Tarvaris Jackson graduated from Lanier in 2001.
Athletics after the Wilson era.
Coach Bobby Wilson retired after the 1968 season and was replaced by Bill Joiner. One of Coach Joiner's most successful teams was the 1971 team led by future University of Alabama All-State Kicker Bucky Berry, who kicked the game winning field goal in the Poets' 24-23 upset of Jeff Davis in 1971. The 1972 team was led by future University of Alabama All-SEC running back Johnny Davis. The first African American from Lanier who received an NCAA Division I scholarship, Davis went on to star with the Cleveland Browns in the NFL. Coach Joiner retired from his football coaching duties after the 1973 season.
Joiner's replacement was Cliff Little, former head coach at Montgomery Catholic High. Coach Little's 1977 and 1978 teams reached the state semifinals and won the Region 4 Class 4A titles. The overall record for those two teams was an excellent 21-5. The 1977 squad was eliminated by Berry Birmingham (Hoover), and the 1978 team was eliminated by Jeff Davis in a hard fought 14-6 game. Both Berry and Jeff Davis went on to win the state title games with relative ease.
Coach Little resigned after the 1979 season, and his replacement was long time GW Carver defensive coordinator Charles Sikes. Coach Sikes' teams showed steady improvement for the first 3 seasons, posting a combined record of 17-13. His best team was the 1987 squad who finished with a 7-4 mark. 
Coach Sikes relinquished his coaching duties after the 1989 season. His replacement, after much controversy, was long time Lanier assistant coach, Robert Fuller. Coach Fuller's first 4 seasons marked the worst 4-year span in school history with a total of 9 wins. But the 1995 squad was much improved. 
The most notable game of the 1995 season came on a fall night in Cramton Bowl between an undefeated Sidney Lanier team and cross town rival Jeff Davis. Lanier had lost 21 consecutive games to Jeff Davis, but that streak came to a halt in '95 with Lanier led by team captains Carlos Locklyn, Chrysanthus Chukwuma, Corey Walker and Ali Dobson. The Poets managed grueling game to beat Jeff Davis in a hard-fought slugfest. The Poets then possessed a 7-0 record and Number 4 ranking in the state. The Poets would later face Prattville High School, losing a tough battle on the road 34-13 falling to 8-1. After Hurricane Opal obliterated Cramton Bowl field, the Poets were forced to play Robert E. Lee, at the unwillingness of both school's Head coaches, due to a super-saturated field; the Poets fell to cross town rival and costing them a shot at a state championship. Opposing head coaches across the State including city rivals, argued Lanier deserved at least a #4 playoff seed, the Sidney Lanier Poets were left out, thus finishing 8-2 in 1995 (5 All-State 1st Team/Honorable Mentioned Players).
Coach Fuller's 1999 and 2000 teams, led by Keldrick Williams, Rod Sharpe, Tavaris Jackson, and Nigel Eldridge. The 1999 squad with Rod Sharpe anchoring the defensive line, and the hardest hitting defense in Alabama won the 6A Area 6 Championship by upsetting Robert E. Lee in the season finale, and went on to record 3 playoff wins, setting up a rematch with Archrival Robert E. Lee. The Generals won the rematch in a slugfest 14-12. The 2000 squad entered the season finale at 9-0 and Ranked No. 2 in the state against Robert E. Lee. But, reflecting the unpredictability of this fierce rivalry dating back almost 50 years, Lee upset Lanier. The Poets still made the playoffs, but the Poets were eventually eliminated by Daphne. Coach Fuller resigned after the 2004 season.
His replacement, Richard Moncrief, was effective and focused on character building as much as football. Under his leadership, the team participated in a number of community service projects, including street cleaning and reading literacy. He also established tutorial and life skills programs for the team. Consequently, a number of players signed college scholarships, with one eventually playing in the NFL. Moncrief left to coach at the collegiate level in 2005.
He was replaced by former Alabama State Head Coach, L. C. Cole, who engineered one of the more remarkable turnarounds in the program's storied history. After struggling to a 1-3 record in the first 4 games, the Poets upset Jeff Davis, continued to win games, and advanced to the playoffs as area runner up. After a first round playoff victory over Theodore, the Poets went on the road and upset highly ranked and defending state runner-up Daphne, before being eliminated in the quarterfinals by Opelika. During his brief 2-year tenure, Coach Cole won 2 City Championships, never losing to the other Montgomery schools. In 2008, Coach Cole Left Lanier to become the defensive coordinator at Texas Southern University after having restored Lanier to its place as Montgomery's high school football powerhouse.
On April 28, 2008, after a long and tiring search, Lanier found its new head coach was already working at the school. Former Jeff Davis and Tennessee State University standout tight end Steve Holloway, a long time assistant to 3 previous head coaches, finally got the call to lead the Poets.
In other sports, Lanier won the 2001 boys' basketball state championship (coached by Floyd Matthews) and the 2005 girls' basketball state championship (coached by the aforementioned Steve Holloway).
Cross Country 
Lanier also has a cross country team, there are two teams: the boys' 7th graders and 8th graders and the girls' 7th and 8th graders. Each team is directed by a different coach and have different practice times. The Girls' Cross Country team have run and placed year after year with help of the coach. The boys have mostly gotten first and second for the past years.
Track
Lanier usually wins the track as well. The events that they do are as follows. 100,200,400,1200(7th graders only)1600(8th graders only), 4 by 100, 4 by 200, 4 by 400, shotput, long jump, high jump, triple jump and 200 hurtles. The track team usually places in district as well as in their zone.
