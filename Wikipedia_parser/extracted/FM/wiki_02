TÜV Rheinland

TÜV Rheinland () is a global provider of technical, safety, and certification services. Originally called the Dampfkessel-Überwachungs-Verein ("Steam Boiler Inspectorate"), TÜV Rheinland was founded in 1872 and has its headquarters in Cologne, Germany. Renamed the TÜV Rheinland ("Technical Inspections Organization") group in 1936, it employs more than 16,000 people in 500 locations in 65 countries and generates annual revenues of € 1.42 billion (48% outside of Germany). The group's guiding principle is to achieve sustained development of safety and quality in order to meet the challenges arising from the interaction between man, technology and the environment (thus the triangular logo).
Key business areas.
TÜV Rheinland has bundled its more than 2.500 services into a portfolio of 42 global business fields. These are again combined into 6 business streams: Industrial Services (TÜV Rheinland Industrie Service), Mobility (TÜV Rheinland Mobilität), Products (TÜV Rheinland Produkte), Life Care (TÜV Rheinland Leben und Gesundheit), Training and Consulting (TÜV Rheinland Bildung und Consulting) and Systems (Systeme). The areas of testing include motor vehicles, industrial facilities and plants as well as consumer goods. Consumer goods for example can be tested and certified according to the German GS Mark by TÜV Rheinland. Today TÜV Rheinland is a global leader in the areas of toy- and furniture testing as well as in the assessment and certification of Photovoltaics.
Other services include the certification of management systems (according to ISO 9000 / ISO 9001) or market access services (which streamlines the importation and exportation of products) as an example.
History.
The history of the TÜV Rheinland Group is the story of its growth from a regional testing organisation into an international provider of technical services. Today, the corporate group is active in 62 countries and in 42 Business Fields.
The companies history can be traced back to 1872, when a group of entrepreneurs founded the "Dampfkessel-Überwachungs-Vereine" (DÜV) or "Steam Boiler Inspectorate". The aim of DÜV was to ensure technical safety of steam boilers, an immanent issue at that time.
1872
Entrepreneurs found the “Verein zur Überwachung der Dampfkessel” (an organization to inspect steam boilers) - the predecessor of TÜV Rheinland Group - in the districts of Elberfeld and Barmen, Germany to ensure the safety of their production facilities.

Ghost (Gackt song)

"Ghost" (stylized as "GHOST") is the twenty-ninth single by Japanese musical artist Gackt.
Summary.
"Ghost" continues the concept from the "Requiem et Reminiscence II 2008-2009" tour and the "Asakura Report", began by the release of single "Jesus". The song is used as the theme to the Japanese broadcast of "".
A limited edition version with a PV was released on January 21, 2009 for members of Gackt's official fanclub, "Dears", and the regular edition was released on January 28, 2009.
Music video.
There are two versions of the music video that exist, one of which features clips from "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles".
The video starts off in a darkened locker room where shards of glass and metal lie on the floor. A male Caucasian janitor arrives with a mop and bucket and starts cleaning up the debris. Afterward, he moves on to the next room, which is a laboratory also in a mess, switches on a light and continues cleaning, unaware that there are five shadowy figures standing in the background, each with glowing red eyes. The janitor gets his iPod Touch out to select some music to listen to while cleaning up the mess and whilst mopping, he accidentally hits a button that causes the ceiling light to send out blasts of electricity, which hits and shatters some glasses and zaps the figures, revealing them to be Gackt and his backup dancers, who are androids. As a result of the electricity's impact, they come to life and the janitor stops what he is doing and looks on in shock.
Close-up shots of Gackt singing the lyrics are shown and he has metallic scars on his face, giving him the appearance of a damaged android.

Taiping Clubs

With the growth of the European community in Taiping and other immigrants such as Chinese, Indians, Arabians and Indonesians, the demand for sport and recreation clubs. These are the clubs that were established during the 1880s.
History.
Perak Club (Old Club).
The Perak Club was the premier social institution of Taiping and was the senior club in the Malay States. Colonel Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker was in large measure responsible for its formation and development in 1881. Among the early patrons were Sir Hugh Low, formerly British Resident of Perak, Mr. William Edward Maxwell, Assistant Resident, and Major Paul Swinburne. The capacious club-house was erected by the Government, and is still kept in repair by the Public Works Department. In front of the building is a playing-field, which is used for cricket, football, hockey, and tennis. The athletics section of the club is known as the Cricket and Recreation Club, and is the leading sporting club of the Federated Malay States. It arranged the first inter-State matches in Malaya. Many European residents of Larut, Matang, Krian, and Upper Perak are members of the club, and as is usual with most Federated Malay States clubs, ladies are admitted to its privileges gratis.
New Club.
The leading social institution in the capital of Perak is the New Club, formed in 1892. the chief promoters of it were the late Dr. Shepherd and Messrs. Lefroy, Mais, Gray, and Aylesbury. During the first year of its existence the club house was sold to the Sultan of Perak, and the present structure, built on a site granted by the Perak Government and H.M. Sultan Sir Idris Shah from plans prepared by Mr. Lefroy in 1893, was opened in the following year. The building scheme was financed by the issue of debentures to the value of 10,000 dollars, nearly the whole of which has now been paid off. The clubhouse overlooks the cricket and football grounds, and affords a magnificent view of the Taiping Hills. It contains reading billiard and card rooms, a large dining room, and five residential chambers. To the rear of the club building there is a croquet ground. The Taiping Golf Club has its headquarters in the New Club house. The membership numbers 270.

Perak Turf Club.
The Perak Turf Club was established in 1884; it was the first exclusive turf club ever built in Perak. The establishment of the Perak Turf Club at Taiping was the idea of Sir Frank Swettenham, who was passionate about horse racing. The new race course was located at Waterfall Road, later changed to Race Course Road, near the Lake Gardens. It held ordinary racing in the Federated Malay States—the major tournaments held at Penang, Selangor or Singapore. In 1906, it had a membership of about 250.
The present course is at Waterfall Road, Taiping, which is 7 furlongs in length. There was an old course, situated about three miles away from Taiping, at which the current races were then run. In 1886, Burma ponies provided most of the racing and the meetings were primarily social functions. The turf club was the only club that attracted people of all classes, especially the Chinese, to mingle around, because of the sweepstakes and lotteries, as they preferred to gamble as their favourite pastime. Sir E.W. Birch, a racing enthusiast, would travel to distant Turf Clubs just to join the major tournament, and was crucial to developing racing interest in the area. In 1934, when the importance of Taiping had declined below that of Ipoh, the club was shifted to Ipoh, still bearing the same name.
Taiping Swimming Club.
The club was formed in 1914 and shared a building with the New Club. At the beginning, the club’s activities were carried out at the waterfall site near the foothill of Maxwell Hill. However, in 1929, a swimming pool was built near the Maxwell Hill to accommodate the growth in membership.
Perak Golf Club.
The Perak Golf Club was established in 1894 and housed at the New Club buildings. The golf club claimed the first golf club formed in Federated Malay States. This nine-hole golf course was reserved exclusively for New Club members. The golf field was originally located near the Taiping Goal.
Ladies’ Rifle Association.
It is not surprising that in a country like the Federated Malay States, where shooting is one of the most popular sports, ladies should share the enthusiasm for it. The Ladies' Rifle Association was formed in 1903.

Briarwood Christian School

Briarwood Christian School is a school in Birmingham, Alabama. It was started by Briarwood Presbyterian Church in 1965. In 1977, the school had its own dedicated facilities constructed on Highway 119, about 15 miles south of the current church campus. Elementary school classes are still held at the main church building.
Briarwood Christian School is now a SACS-accredited K-12 school with 1,900 students. It operates in four sections: Early Childhood, Elementary, Junior High, and Senior High.
Athletics.
Briarwood High School has won 34 AHSAA
State Athletic Championships since 1990.
Varsity Football.
The Briarwood football team has won four state titles and is currently coached by Fred Yancey. Yancey is second on the list of all-time winningest Alabama high school head coaches. His staff includes fellow former Alabama players David Hannah, Chris Donnelly, and Ernest Carroll. Former Alabama teammates under Bear Bryant, Jeremiah Castille (Super Bowl competitor) and Joey Jones (current University of South Alabama head coach) as well as former Alabama defensive back Sam Shade have also served as assistant coaches at the school. Former Briarwood players include NFL players Tim and Simeon Castille, as well as Barrett Trotter, former Auburn starting quarterback and St. Louis Rams football operations assistant. Former Briarwood quarterback and offensive coordinator Joe Craddock is currently on the football coaching staff at Clemson University.
Other Varsity Sports.
Olympic gold medalist Cat Reddick played soccer at the school before joining the United States women's national soccer team.
Discipline.
Minor cases of student misconduct are punished with detention. Where this proves ineffective, and for any significant offenses, a spanking is administered. Spanking is usually administered only in elementary and junior high school. The school believes the Bible teaches the use of corporal punishment in the discipline of young people. Staff are instructed to use the paddle whenever necessary. Spanking is not carried out in the presence of other students. Serious misconduct leads to suspension.

Oedemerinae

Oedemerinae are a subfamily of the false blister beetles (family Oedemeridae), also known as pollen-feeding beetles. The Nacerdinae are sometimes merged here.
The phylogeny of this family is not robustly deduced in detail. While traditionally three tribes are accepted, two of them are treated as monotypic by many if not by most modern authors; some however accept more genera, typically separating "Oncomera" from "Oedemera" for example. Though this may well be warranted in some way, the evolutionary relationships the Oedemerinae are generally in need of review, particularly considering the number of genera treated as basal or of entirely uncertain placement. Hence, a more conservative approach is adopted here until genus limits can be better defined in the entire subfamily.

Homeokinetics

Homeokinetics is the study of self-organizing, complex systems. Standard physics studies systems at separate levels, such as atomic physics, nuclear physics, biophysics, social physics, and galactic physics. Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists Harry Soodak and Arthur Iberall. Complex systems are universes, galaxies, social systems, people, or even those that seem as simple as gases. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.
History.
Arthur Iberall,Warren McCulloch and the late Harry Soodak, developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics. It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA exobiology program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of UCLA, where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems' systems of nature, life, human, mind, and society.
Self-organizing Complex Systems.
A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities. The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair-by-pair interactions, internal actions such as vibrations, rotations, and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large—in time—cycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‘engaged’ for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing Aristotle as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic-metalogic for physics, e.g., metaphysics, then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe.
Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics.
Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels. Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

Church of Saint Porphyrius

The Church of Saint Porphyrius (or St. Porphyrius Church, ) is the Orthodox Christian church of Gaza, and the oldest active church in the city. Located in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City, it is named after the 5th century bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, whose tomb is situated in the northeastern corner of the church.
History.
Original construction of the Church of Saint Porphyrius dates back to the beginning of the 5th century, however the modern construction was undertaken by the Crusaders in the 1150s or 1160s and they dedicated it St. Porphyrius. Records from the 15th century show that dedication of the church was also attested to the Virgin Mary. In 1856, it was renovated. There are some cornices and bases that date back to the Crusader period, but much of the other portions are later additions.
The church was one of the targets of attacks in the Palestinian Territories in the wake of Pope Benedict XVI's remarks citing a Byzantine scholar's critical position on Islam. It may be the church was targeted for the reason of the Byzantine link, or just being a convenient Christian shrine, even though there is no connection between the church and the Vatican.
Architecture.
The Church of Saint Porphyrius has a rectangular shape, ending with a half-domed roofed temple. Its pavement below ground level in its southern part, and below ground level at the northern end, suggesting that the present building was built atop of an earlier church structure.The church consists of a single aisle made up of two groin-vaulted bays, with a projecting semi-circular apse preceded by a barrel-vaulted presbytery. Internally, the building measures by , including the apse. It has architectural and constructional similarities with the former Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (currently the Great Mosque of Gaza).
There are three entrances for the church: the western one has a portico with three marble columns supporting two pointed arches. The bases of the marbles date from the Crusader era. The church can also be entered from its façade or from a side door which opens onto a modern gallery, equipped with stairs for going down to the level of the pavement. Its colossal walls are supported by horizontal marble and granite columns and pilasters.

Chris Sáenz

Christopher Andrew Sáenz (born August 8, 1981 in Tucson, Arizona) is a former professional baseball pitcher. Sáenz appeared in one Major League Baseball game with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2004.
Sáenz was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 28th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft. From 2001-02, he pitched mostly in relief, but became a starting pitcher in 2003. He began 2004 in Double-A with Huntsville and went 5-5 with a 4.13 ERA and 84 strikeouts in 85 innings pitched. He was called up to make a spot start on April 24 and got the win after pitching six scoreless innings. He was sent back to Double-A after this start where he spent the rest of the season.
Sáenz was granted free agency at the end of the season and re-signed with the Brewers in January 2005, but missed all of the 2005 and 2006 seasons after undergoing elbow surgery.
In 2007, Sáenz signed with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and was assigned to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers. However, he struggled with his control, walking 31 in 46 innings, and was released. He signed with the independent Reno Silver Sox of the Golden Baseball League, but did not fare any better. He went 0-4 and had an 8.10 ERA in five games. In 2008, he signed with the Schaumburg Flyers of the Northern League, but had an 8.42 ERA in 19 games, all in relief.
He is only the fourth pitcher, and the first since 1899 to start in his only major league game, give up no runs (earned or unearned) with at least six innings pitched, and record the win. His lifetime MLB record is 1-0 with an ERA of 0.00

There was an iron fountain donated by Mr Ng Boo Bee that originally stood in front of the market, in many years later it was removed and replaced with a simple concrete clock tower. These markets served two different functions, one as a dry market and the other as a wet market. During the heyday, these markets were stocked with fresh vegetables, fishes and meats, almost everything made available from here. The price for all goods was controlled by the government according to a report made by Sir Frank Swettenham when he served as the Acting Resident of Perak in 1884 until 1886. Sir Frank Swettenham also acted as the man who responsible for the establishment of the markets, he suggested to the then British Resident of Perak, Sir Hugh Low that a market was indeed as the population of the town growth was drastically. Eventually the proposal was granted, in Sir Hugh Low’s journal written that, ""the town has a good model for others, with a well maintained market for the public use"".

Don Bosco College, Canlubang

Don Bosco College, Canlubang is a private Catholic educational institution owned and operated by the Salesians of Don Bosco. It was established in 1963 at Canlubang, Laguna, Philippines. In 1967, the Philippine government recognized that the courses in the institution were valid for Bachelor degrees in Secondary Education (BSEd). Two years later, the school's curriculum for the course in Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIEd) was approved. In 1972, the institution started an outreach program called Manpower Training Department (MTD) for low-income students. In 1995, DBC opened the college to extern (non-seminarian) students. A year after, the population of extern students increased as the Bachelor of Science in Technical Education course was recognized by the DECS.
In 1996 two communities in Canlubang were formed due to restructuring — the Post Novitiate Community and Don Bosco College — the former focusing on the formation of young Salesians and the latter on education and on formation of young aspirants to religious life.
Don Bosco accepted its first batch of high school students in 1998. Its first batch composed of 47 young men graduated in 2002. It is in this year that the college department began accepting female students.
In 2008 the Canlubang Community was again restructured; the Carreño House of Formation (seminary community) and the Don Bosco College (school community) were formed. This means that to date, three Salesian communities are nestled in Canlubang.
Starting 2009, DBC opens its grade school department exclusive for boys.
History.
Don Bosco College was originally known as Don Bosco Seminary-College (DBSC). This institution bears the name of St. John Bosco, father, teacher, and a friend of the youth. Faithful to the ideals of the founder, DBSC was established in 1963 to respond to the need of training qualified religious personnel to take care of the Don Bosco institutions in the Philippines.
In 1967, the government recognized the courses offered at DBSC as valid for Bachelor degrees in Secondary Education (BSEd). Two years later, the curriculum for the course of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIEd) was approved.
In answer to the growing need for qualified industrial workers, the college opened an outreach program known as the Manpower Training Department (MTD) in 1972. This program caters to the need of giving quality education for the poor young people of the area.
Putting up the high school department in the compound of the Don Bosco College was a dream come true, not only for the residents within the vicinity, but also for the Salesians of Don Bosco in the Northern Philippine Province. Since 1967, the members of the Salesian community were able to make their presence felt among the youth in the area through their regular Sunday oratory and through catechism classes in the secluded barrios of Canlubang Sugar Estate and at Rizal Institute, a privately owned high school for boys located one kilometer away. However, due to factors such as time and distance, among others, their presence was limited and irregular. A school for boys in the Salesian compound answerrf the need to minister to the young on a more sustainable and regular basis because the young people would then be in the academic setting. Hence, the establishment of the high school department in 1998 provided a stronger impetus for the Salesians to revitalize their mission and vision, particularly in their calling to evangelize the young.
Thus, in the school year of 1998-1999, the High School Department of the Don Bosco College officially started its operation with only 47 students. The implementation of putting up the school was a pursuance of the institution's mission and vission. At the same time, it was a timely response to the pressing needs of the community where the school is.
After ten years since its opening, in 2008-2009, the high school department has grown to 10 sections (with three sections each in the first and second year, and two each in the third and fourth year) with 407 students.
And in school year 2009-2010, the institution opened the Grade School Department with the preparatory course and grade one to grade four and grade eleven.

About Dadhich Rishi
The Nature of helping others is a great virtue. There are many who gave away their wealth, flesh & energy to up hold this great virtue. But perhaps no one has done as much as Dadhichi Maharshi, who gave away his life for this great cause. The following is the story of Dadhichi. 
Dadhichi waited for a long time for Devatas to return and collect their ammunitions. Finally, one day, with his divine powers, he put all the weapons in his sacred water pot and mixed them in the water and drank it. He was now free and could continue his regular penance undisturbed. 
A short while after this, the Devatas returned and asked Dadhichi for their weapons. The Maharshi said "I waited for so long. I reckoned that you would never turn up. So I drank them away. They are all in my body as bones and flesh. To get them out now is very difficult." 
Dadhichi's wife Swarcha was watching all this from a distance. Dadhichi sent her away into their house on some pretext. He then created a huge fire by his will power and entered into it and reduced himself to ashes, leaving behind only his bones. 
Much before Devatas realised what was happening, Lord Brahma suddenly appeared and converted each of the bones into various powerful weapons and gave them to the Devatas. Dadhihi's back bone was given as Vajrayudha to Indra with which he brought an end to the most powerful Rakshasas like Vruthasura. Devatas went on pleading "Maharshi, we are now in a position to fight with Rakshasas. If we do not have our weapons, we will not be in a position to fight with them and to save Dharma and the universe". Dadhichi thought about it calmly and was convinced that Devatas deserved help. Their weapons were now more powerful than before. He said to Devatas "Alright, take your weapons back by killing me . They are presently in the form of my bones". Devatas refused to do so and said "We certainly do not want to commit the sin of killing a great Rishi like you. We can not afford to do this cruel thing" Dadhichi could not reply them as well. Determination to make a great sacrifice is one of the qualities of great saints like Dadhichi. Dadhichi not only protected the weapons of the Devatas, but also, enhanced their power by converting them into lethal weapons with the power of his penance. He also saw to it that Devatas did not commit the sin of killing the saint by reducing himself to ashes.

History.
VFS Global is the world’s largest outsourcing and technology services specialist for governments and their diplomatic missions worldwide. The company manages visa and passport issuance-related administrative and non-judgmental tasks for its client governments, which enables diplomatic missions of its client governments to focus on the important judgmental part of the visa issuance process.
VFS Global’s business model was created in India in 2001, and back then, like now, governments and their diplomatic missions were beginning to find it difficult to cope with the combination of growing demand for travel with stricter controls, improved security and all the implications these factors had for visa processing. The idea that VFS Global’s management had in 2001 was that it could offer to take on the tedious administrative part of the visa issuance process. This would relieve the missions of this very time consuming administrative task and allow them to focus on the key decision making task – i.e. whether an applicant should or should not be granted a visa.
Its global operations are certified with ISO 9001:2008 for Quality Management System, ISO 27001:2005 for Information Security Management System, and ISO 14001:2004 for Environment Management System.
Processing visa applications requires a very high standard of security and quality. Over the last 13 years, VFS Global has invested in cutting-edge data security and quality assurance technology. As a result, it can also process passports of all types. Thanks to its state-of-the-art technology the company can even deal with biometric passports. Processing visa applications involves working with highly sensitive personal data. VFS Global complies with the very highest standards in this regard, and in recent years has won various awards for the strength of its data protection. The very high priority it gives to security has been further highlighted by its investment in a state-of-the-art monitoring system.
Zubin Karkaria conceptualized and launched VFS Global in 2001, and subsequently led VFS Global to become a global company. Karkaria joined Kuoni in 1991 in India and was appointed as the CEO of VFS Global and Managing Director of Kuoni India. In March 2013, Karkaria was appointed to the executive board of Kuoni Group.
Milestones.
Over the years since its inception in 2001, VFS Global has evolved into the leader in the visa and consular industry and developed significant expertise in alternative strategies including innovations in Visa application services.

Controversy.
In May 2007 it was reported that the company's online UK visa application system was flawed. It was also reported that the security flaw had affected online applications from India, Nigeria and Russia. The VFS site was immediately shut down after the technical problem was brought to the attention of the UK media and an independent government investigation was launched by the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO). The security breach was first reported by an Indian applicant in December 2005 after which no effective remedial action was taken by either VFS nor UKvisas, the joint Home Office and Foreign & Commonwealth Office unit which runs the UK's visa service through British diplomatic posts overseas. The same applicant went public in May 2007 after he noticed that his earlier warnings were ignored. It is estimated that this security breach had resulted in approximately 50,000 applicants' identities having been possibly compromised until its May 2007 closure, following the media outcry.
The report of the investigation by the Independent Investigator, Linda Costelloe Baker highlighted "organisational failures" by both VFS and UKvisas. The report also recommended that the VFS online visa applications not be resumed for applications from India. This has since been replaced by the secure online applications made available directly at the Visa4UK official government website of the UK Border Agency.
Baker also mentioned in the report that following this incident, UKvisas conducted extensive testing and found no evidence that data had been stolen or misused. VFS underestimated what was necessary in order to protect personal data to the levels expected by the UK Data Protections Act. After this incident, several visa application level checks were put in place. Technical processes were also upgraded later to check the records of the online application site.
In November 2007, the UK Information Commissioner's Office announced that it had found the Foreign Office in breach of its obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. The Information Commissioner's Office required the Foreign Office to sign a statement that it would comply with the Data Protection Act and would not reopen the VFS UK visa online facility. It has been reported by "The Guardian" that as a result of this ruling, the Foreign Office would review its relationship with VFS and seek to significantly reduce its outsourced work, especially in the area of IT. Consequently, applicants from India today need to apply directly at the Visa4UK official government website for online visa applications.
After the report was issued, VFS introduced various measures to ensure safe and secure business environment. One of them was to make all its centres ISO compliant.
However, since this incident several governments have been critical of VFS Global's abilities and have raised concerns over security. ""There's the accountability issue, the privacy issue and why are we outsourcing to a for-profit entity something that belongs in the security mandate?"" asked Victor Wong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council. Liam Clifford of global visas, a migration advice company, told The Sunday Telegraph: ""Once you put this work in the hands of private companies overseas, you no longer have the same protection.""
The controversy over information disclosure was particularly difficult for the British Government which was still recovering from the NHS Medical Training Application Service scandal, an online service that had to be suspended following reports of a similar security breach.
Organisation, Monopoly and Dominance.
VFS Global is cited as an organisation established and running from Mumbai, India under kuoni group. The shareholding or governance structure of VFS Global is not made public as of yet by Kuoni. 
Various sources cite VFS Global as an example of a monopoly company operating globally in the visa processing outsourcing sector under the ownership of Kuoni group. This means lack of competition, processing standards and administerial dubiousness in this sector has caused a range of confusion for policy makers globally while administering and awarding government contracts through tendering. This has lead to problems in visa application pricings, and also caused concerns in the areas of centralised document handling and content security, though VFS claims a streamlined application submission process in all its centres.
It is reported in south east Asia that VFS own staff at its collection offices attempts to abuse its dominant status by making their own rules with visa applicants. This includes entry criteria to the VFS centres and also level of assistance offered to applicants.

Richard, Count of Évreux

Richard, Count of Évreux († 1067) was a powerful member of the Norman aristocracy during the early and later reign of William, Duke of Normandy.
Life.
Richard was the eldest son of Robert II Archbishop of Rouen and Count of Évreux and Herleva. 
Richard, son of the Archbishop Robert, donated a mill at Evreux to the abbey of Jumièges by charter dated Mar 1038/14 Apr 1039. He is mentioned in a charter of King William I confirming Richard as having been a benefactor to that abbey. Richard and his wife, Godechildis, founded Saint-Sauveur d´Evreux. He, as Count of Evreux, donated the church of Gravigny to Sainte-Trinité de Rouen, dated [1052/66]. Richard donated the tithe of a town to the abbey of Saint-Taurin.
Some scholars report him as taking part in the battle of Hastings on 14 Oct 1066, but it is unlikely due to his advanced age and death the next year. His son, William, was one of the few known Companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. William contributed 80 ships to the invasion of England in 1066 as Count of Évreux. 
Richard died in 1067.

Earth and Fire

"Not to be confused with Earth, Wind, and Fire"
Earth and Fire were a pop group formed in the Netherlands by brothers Chris and Gerard Koerts. Most popular in the 1970s when fronted by singer Jerney Kaagman, Earth and Fire had many chart topping hits in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, though they never gained much popularity in England or the Americas. Their biggest international hit was "Weekend", number one in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and Portugal.
History.
Early history: The Singing Twins and The Swinging Strings.
Earth and Fire originated with the brothers Chris and Gerard Koerts from Voorschoten. As "The Singing Twins" they made music for family and friends since 1960, achieving a breakthrough of sorts at a talent show in 1962, at which future bass player Hans Ziech was present--Ziech, at the time, was already interested in rock and roll and thought The Singing Twins a bit on the mild side, Jan & Kjeld-like. In 1963, influenced by beat music, they joined a local beat band, playing mostly instrumental music until early 1965; the Koerts brothers were remembered as musical perfectionists even at an early age. They changed their name to The Swinging Strings in 1965 and began singing, covering hits by the Beatles, the Byrds, and others. They played regularly and saved enough money to buy equipment and add three dancers, girls in Audrey Hepburn-like outfits. While they played all over the provinces of North and South Holland, they rarely performed in their own area--The Hague had its own scene of beat bands. By the end of 1966, however, they had won a few talent shows near their home town, had a fan club with over 250 members, and had drawn the attention of radio DJ Joost den Draaijer.
Opus Gainfull, transition to Earth and Fire.
By 1967 the Koerts brothers were dissatisfied with playing cover music and were looking to increase the technical level of their music. Somewhat abruptly, according to the other members, they broke up the Strings and renamed the band Opus Gainfull, and were looking for a rhythm section. They found a bass player in Hans Ziech (born 1943) of the local band The Soul, and also picked up that band's drummer, Cees Kalis. The Soul's guitar player, Eric Wenink, also joined, for a couple of years. Throughout 1968 and 1969 the band practiced new music, while listening to the music of Jimi Hendrix, Moby Grape, Jefferson Airplane. The decision was made to look for a singer, and Manuela Berloth joined them. Meanwhile their music continued to evolve, with ideas for concept albums brought in from the US West Coast and improvisational practice sessions. In 1968, before a show in Beverwijk, the band's name was changed to Earth and Fire. The band recorded two songs as the prize for winning a talent show in 1969, but were not offered a record contract; by the end of the year, Berloth, who in Gerard Koerts' words "was not a rock 'n roll woman", left. The Koerts brothers, who were graduating school at the time, took over on vocals, and the band continued touring, opening for established beat band Golden Earring. In September 1969 they met and hired Jerney Kaagman.
The band's first album, "Earth and Fire" (1970), produced three hits: "Seasons" reached no. 2 in the Dutch charts, with an estimated 60,000 copies sold; the second single, "Ruby is the one" (later covered by the Claw Boys Claw for "Hitkillers") reached no. 4 and sold 40,000 copies.
In 1977, after four successful singles and nine hits, the band found the Dutch musical atmosphere changed considerably: new bands, influenced by disco, punk, and new wave, threatened to render many of the previously popular Dutch groups obsolete. 1977's "Gate to Infinity" received a cool reception and the album's lead single, "7 8th Avenue", failed to break into the Dutch top 10. Drummer Ton van der Kleij left in August 1978, followed a few months later by bass player Theo Hurts. Despite rumors that Kaagman would go solo or take a job at "TopPop", a popular music television show, she stayed with the Koerts brothers, who quickly found another drummer, Ab Tamboer, and another bass player, Bert Ruiter (Kaagman's male companion and formerly with Focus). By 1980 Chris Koerts left, feeling that he had achieved everything he wanted with the band.

Ledson Marsh

Ledson Marsh is a freshwater marsh in Annadel State Park east of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California, United States. Located on the east flank of Bennett Mountain, it drains into Schultz Creek, a tributary of Yulupa Creek.
Earthen dam.
The marsh was formed by an earthen embankment dam about long, constructed in 1930 by a former landowner. The dam is about high and wide at its crest. Over the years, the dam deteriorated, allowing water to seep through it and causing the marsh to dry out in the autumn and refill during the winter rains. The deterioration was partly due to rodent holes and partly due to stumps left by the felling of eucalyptus trees that were planted on both sides of the embankment.
There was concern over the dam's safety. A catastrophic dam failure would destroy the marsh habitat and clog various Sonoma Creek tributaries with sediment. The California Department of Parks and Recreation therefore repaired the dam in such a way as to preserve the marsh's seasonality. 
Because of its seasonality, the marsh was colonized by California Red-legged Frogs, a federal and state listed threatened species. Government agencies grew concerned that if the marsh did not dry out every year, bullfrogs might establish themselves in the marsh, displacing the red-legged frogs. 
Recreation.
The marsh is a picnicking and bird-watching spot, and also a landmark for mountain bicyclists, hikers, joggers, and equestrians.

Allergies in dogs

There is a wide variety of allergies that dogs can suffer from. While they typically become visible through skin conditions, there are a number of other symptoms and warning signs to look for.
Dog allergies can happen just like in their human companions. These allergies usually manifest themselves as skin conditions. What this will do is provoke the immune system of the dog to overreact in the form of a number of different symptoms, most notably a skin irritation. Unfortunately, allergies are becoming more common every day just as they are with humans.
Skin irritation from allergies is fairly easy to identify. Some of the symptoms are redness, itching, hair loss and recurring skin infections from the irritation. The dog may begin to scratch himself more thus bringing on the skin problems.
When looking for symptoms, there are various things that can help to identify if the dog is suffering from allergies. Sometimes, cigar shaped mites will appear on the dog’s skin. These mites are located in the hair follicle and oil glands of the skin. While it is possible to identify what type of allergies the dog is suffering from, it is best to seek attention from a veterinarian to identify the best treatment possible.
There are a number of different kinds of dog allergies dogs may be suffering from. The five main allergies include food allergies, flea allergies, bacteria, contact, and atopy allergies. 
Allergies.
Food.
The common symptoms of food allergies consist of skin irritation, excessive itching, hair loss, and hot spots. In addition, they can cause the dog to have loose bowel movements and even cause them to throw up from time to time.
There are a number of causes for food allergies including a built-up intolerance to beef, dairy products, chicken, corn and soy. Dog food allergies can develop over time making it all the more important to be aware of these symptoms. The easiest solution is to change to a different dry dog food and see if the skin problem clears up. If this is not the answer, a visit at the veterinarian is necessary for further assistance.
Flea.
Much like food allergies, the dog will develop redness to the skin, become itchy, and may begin chewing in spots. The primary cause of dog fleas is the saliva of fleas that irritates dog’s skin. Similar to mosquitoes, fleas suck the blood out of the dog. Possible treatment is giving the dog a bath in cool water with a shampoo designed for fleas. If the dog has chewed his own skin, antibiotics will be sometimes needed, depending on the severity of the problem. 
Diagnosis of Flea Allergies can be difficult at times due to the symptoms being similar to those of other allergies. However, it may be possible to spot some black specks on the dog's skin which are flea faeces. 
Bacteria.
Bacterial allergies can be identified by red blotches, pus pockets, hair loss and skin formation that looks like ringworm. Typically, bacteria allergies are secondary to other problems the dog may have such as parasitism or hormonal disorders. It is vital to get a blood test to see what the actual problem is.
Contact.
The symptoms of contact allergies are very similar to flea and bacteria allergies symptoms. The cause for contact allergies is the dog coming into contact with any kinds of allergens. Anything from the bedding, chemicals, plants, or household cleaning products can bring on contact allergies. There are several different treatment methods including using a certain kind of shampoo, a prescribed oral form of steroids, or any natural treatments like omega-3.
Atopy.
Atopy allergies start with itching, biting, hair loss and face rubbing. Other symptoms may be papules, which are small red bumps, or pustules, which are small pimple-like lesions. Atopy allergies are typically caused by fleas, but can also be caused by airborne, chemical, and by many of the common products found in your home.

Local Committee of China Democracy Party

Local Committee of China Democracy Party (LCCDP) () is special committee of China Democracy Party (see List of Political Party) with the aim to start democratic reform from local government in the People's Republic of China. The party was banned by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The Local Committee of CDP was established by Zheng Cunzhu, a former student leader in Anhui province in 1989 and a secret CDP member in China since 2001.
History.
Foundation of CDP.
While the earliest date listed for the founding to be June 25, 1998, the group registered the party on June 28, 1998 when Bill Clinton was visiting China. Wang Youcai, one of the main activists during the 1989 Tiananmen protest along with Wang Donghai and Lin Hui went to the Civil Public Affair Hall of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province to officially register this party. The registration was declined.
Communist Party response.
The next day on June 29, 1998, Wang was arrested by the state police at his own home in front of his family members. He was charged with creating opposition against the Chinese government. His trial began on December 18, he had no lawyer defense, his trial lasted only a few hours. He was quickly sentenced on December 21, 1998 to 11 years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of political rights for subversion. 
On the same day, Xu Wenli, a 55 year old member was also sentenced to 13 years for overthrowing the Communist party.
On December 22, 1998, Qing Yongmin was sentenced to 12 years to prison for harming state security.
Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at the time proclaimed, "If a group is designed to negate the leadership of the Communist Party, then it will not be allowed to exist."
The Communist party declared the CDP an "illegal organization", followed by a crackdown in Beijing in 1998. After the sentencing on December 23, 1998, the Supreme People's Court then declared that, "anyone who knowingly publishes, prints, copies, or distributes material containing incitement to overthrow state power and the socialist system or split the country" could be tried for crimes. Such charges could result in life sentences for film directors, computer software developers, writers and artists, and media and publishing personnel, all of whom are subject to the new directive.
Crackdown on other members.
There were hundreds of CDP members that were detained, arrested, and sentenced to prison. Liu Xianbin, Wu Yilong, Gao Hongmin, Zha Jianguo, Mao Qinxiang, Zhu Yufu, Zhuzhengming, Liu Shizhun, Xu Guang, She Wanbao, Chen Shuqing, are some of the members of the party. Cyber dissident He Depu was also arrested in a correction facility.
Disunion of CDP.
Two different ways.
There were two main ways to establish the China Democracy Party in 1998, one was represented by the founder Wang Youcai and the other Xu Wenli. Wang Youcai tried to register the party according to the constitution which protects freedom of association, but Xu Wenli just proclaimed the establishment of the party without registration. Wang Youcai is the leader of rational way while Xu Wenli the radical.
First organization of China Democracy Party in the USA.
Most of the CDP founders in 1989 were arrested but Mr. Xie Wanjun, the founder of the Party in Shandong province fled to the USA and later established China Democracy Party Foundation in New York. Two new groups were established later by Mr. Wang Jun and Mr. Liu Dongxing who worked together with Xie Wanjun before they built their own CDP groups.
CDP Overseas Headquarter.
Later Xu Wenli was exiled to the US on December 24, 2002. Without discussing with Xie Wanjun to build a united Party, Xu Wenli established a new group: CDP Oversea Headquarter and his party did not collaborate with Xie Wanjun's party. This was the start of dissociation of CDP.
Coordinative Service Platform of China Democracy Party.
Wang Youcai was exiled to the USA on March 4, 2004. He established China Democracy Party Coordinative Service Platform which supported by the members of China Democracy Party members who are in China, overseas students, and exiled China Democracy Party Members.
No United Central Committee of CDP.
Because there was no chance for CDP founders to have a meeting for the establishment of united Central Committee of China Democracy Party in 1998, because there were two different ways at the beginning, because the founders in exile could not collaborate in the USA, China Democracy Party can not be established as a united party. There exist several parties claiming to be the "headquarters" or "Central Committee", but actually they do not control each other but develop independently.
Local Committee of China Democracy Party.
In January 2008, party member Zheng Cunzhu established the Local Committee of China Democracy Party in Los Angeles. Zheng Cunzhu was a former student leader during 1989's pre-democratic movements in Anhui province, and he published an open letter to the leaders of China to advocate the restarting of political reform.
The Local Committee of CDP will try to establish China Democracy Party in the local cities and prefer the local practice of democracy. There are two cities in California: Los Angeles and San Francisco having an office of LCCDP.

Anuppan

Anuppan is a community of Kannada,Tamil -speaking Hindu farmers who reside in the southern districts of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
Etymology and Origin.
The 1891 Madras Census report describes Anuppans as "a small caste of Canarese farmers chiefly found in the districts of Madura, Tinnevely and Coimbatore. Their original home appears to Mysore or South Canara, probably the former."
Local traditions at the Kambam region of Madura where Anuppans predominate indicate that they were prevalent in extensive numbers in the region during ancient times. However, there was a feud with the Kappiliyans and in this quarrel, Ramachcha Kavundan, the chief of the Kappiliyans was killed. On his deatrh bed, Ramachcha Kavundan supposedly cursed the Anuppans that they would never prosper in life.
Subdivisions.
The Anuppans were divided into Saivites and Vaishnavites. The most important sub-division of the Anuppans was Allikulam or the "lilly clan". Vaishnavite Anuppans employed Brahmins as priests. All Anuppans practised widow-remarriage.
Anuppans are also subdivided into six territorial groups or Medus depending on their village of origin. There are three Medus in Madura district and three in Tinnevelly district. The three Medus in Madura are further subdivided into eighteen "kilais" or "branches" the members of whom do not intermarry with people ofr the same "kilai". 
Each of the Medus are headed by a headman called Periyadanakkaran. The three Medus based in Madura also have a spiritual head or "Guru" who resides at Sirupalai near Madurai.
Traditions and rituals.
The customs and practices of the Anuppans are similar to those of the Kappiliyans and Tottiyans.

Charles Bridges

Charles Bridges, MA (1794 - 1869), was a preacher and theologian in the Church of England, and a leader of that denomination's Evangelical Party. As a preacher he was well regarded by his contemporaries, but is remembered today for his literary contributions.
Education and ministry.
Educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, he was ordained in 1817 and served from 1823 to 1849 as vicar of Old Newton, Suffolk. Thomas Chalmers wrote,
'My excellent friend, the Rev. Charles Bridges, of Old Newton, Suffolk, finds, I am sure, most ample occupation among those six hundred people whom he may be said to have domesticated into one parochial family; and, were it not for his still more important services to the Christian church at large, would show, by his incessant labours, how possible it were to make out a most beneficial expenditure of all his strength and all his time amongst them.'
In 1849, he became vicar of Weymouth, Dorset, later serving as vicar of Hinton Martell, Dorset (c. 1857). Bridges participated (with J. C. Ryle) in the Clerical Conference at Weston-super-Mare of 1858, and also participated in the consecration of the Bishop of Carlisle in York Minster in 1860.
Personal life.
Bridges was married to Harriet Torlesse, with whom he had at least two sons, the second of whom was physician John Henry Bridges, BA BM Oxon FRCP (1832–1906).
Literary works.
At least twenty-four editions of Bridges' "Exposition of Psalm 119" (1827) were published in his lifetime. C. H. Spurgeon considered the commentary to be 'worth its weight in gold'. Spurgeon also pronounced Bridges' "Exposition of Proverbs" (1840) 'The best work on the Proverbs'.

Rumpler C.VII

The Rumpler C.VII was a military reconnaissance aircraft built in Germany during World War I. It was developed from the C.IV and optimised for high-altitude missions that would allow it to operate at heights that would render it immune to interception by enemy fighters. Work on the C.VII took place after a similar attempt to develop the C.III into a high-altitude machine as the C.V failed. 
Design and development.
The most significant difference between the C.IV and C.VII was the choice of the Maybach Mb IVa engine to replace the Mercedes D.IV. Although the Maybach engine was around 8% less powerful than the Mercedes (when measured at the sea level), it could continue to provide most of its power output while at altitude, where power from the Mercedes engine decreased more rapidly as height increased. Other changes included wings of slightly greater area and an airscrew of larger diameter. The crew were provided with oxygen generators and electrically-heated flight suits. 
Rumpler produced the C.VII in two versions: a standard radio-equipped reconnaissance machine, and a photographic version named the Rubild (or "Rubilt") ("Bild" means "picture" in German).
Operational history.
The two versions of the Rumpler C.VII were in service simultaneously. The "standard" C.VII was used for "armed" long-distance reconnaissance. The armament was one fixed and one manually operated 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun at the observer/gunner's rear position (the observer also operated a radio). The "Rubild" was a "stripped-down" version that dispensed with the forward gun and eliminated all other extraneous equipment in order to carry specialized cameras. 
The Rubild was capable of operating as high as 7,300 m (24,000 ft), and could maintain 160 km/h (100 mph) at 6,100 m (20,000 ft). The high-altitude version proved practically invulnerable to interception above 5,500 m (18,000 ft).
Allied combat reports most often featured the high-flying Rubild which could operate regularly at altitudes above 6,100 m (20,000 ft). The type was particularly difficult to intercept, as the Allied fighters were seldom able even to climb to such altitude:
At the end of the war, at least one Rumpler C.VII was captured and sent to the United States.

Sedelnikovsky District

Sedelnikovsky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the thirty-two in Omsk Oblast, Russia. It is located in the east of the oblast. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a "selo") of Sedelnikovo. Population: 10,943 (2010 Census); The population of Sedelnikovo accounts for 48.6% of the district's total population.
Geography.
The district is situated in the taiga, although logging has denuded much of the forest. The biggest rivers flowing through the district are the tributaries of the Irtysh, including the Uy, the Shaytanka, the Shish, and the Maly Shish.
History.
Prior to 1582, the area of what is now Sedelnikovsky District was a part of the Khanate of Sibir. That year Cossack ataman Yermak Timofeyevich defeated Kuchum Khan at the Battle of Chuvash Cape. Although Yermak was eventually killed after sacking Qashliq to the east, the Russian Empire retained control of the region. The area was secured in 1594 when Prince Andrey Yeletsky established a permanent garrison at Tara to the southwest.
The first settlement in the area was the village of Sedelnikovo, founded in 1785 by Sedelnikov brothers, who moved here from the village of Ostrovnaya.
The modern district was established in 1924.
Administrative and municipal divisions.
Administratively, the district is divided into eleven rural okrugs (Bakinsky, Golubovsky, Keyzessky, Kukarsky, Novouysky, Ragozinsky, Saratovsky, Sedelnikovsky, Unarsky, Yevlansky, and Yelnichny) comprising thirty-four rural localities. Municipally, the district is incorporated as Sedelnikovsky Municipal District and divided into eleven rural settlements (which correspond to the administrative rural okrugs).

Palaemon serratus

Palaemon serratus, also called the common prawn, is a species of shrimp found in the Atlantic Ocean from Denmark to Mauritania, and in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea.
Ecology.
Individuals live for 3–5 years in groups in rocky crevices at depths of up to . Females grow faster than males, and the population is highly seasonal, with a pronounced peak in the autumn. They are preyed upon by a variety of fish, including species of Mullidae, Moronidae, Sparidae and Batrachoididae.
Description.
"P. serratus" may be distinguished from other species of shrimp by the rostrum, which curves upwards, is bifurcated at the tip and has 6–7 along its upper edge, and 4–5 teeth on the lower edge. Other speciesmay have a slightly curved rostrum, but then the teeth on its dorsal surface continue into the distal third, which is untoothed in "P. serratus". "P. serratus" is pinkish brown, with reddish patterns, and is typically long, making it the largest of the native shrimp and prawns around the British Isles.
"P. serratus" is one of the few invertebrates to have its hearing studied in detail; it is sensitive to frequencies between 100 Hz and 3kHz, with an acuity similar to that of generalist fish. While the hearing range of a "P. serrratus" individual changes as it grows, all are capable of hearing tones at 500 Hz.
Fisheries.
A small commercial fishery exists for "P. serratus" on the west coast of Great Britain, chiefly in West Wales (Cemaes Head to the Llŷn Peninsula), but extending increasingly far north to include parts of Scotland. In Ireland, fishing for "P. serratus" began at Baltimore, County Cork in the 1970s and subsequently expanded. A peak landing of 548 t was recorded in 1999, and four counties account for over 90% of the catch — Galway, Kerry, Cork and Waterford. There is now concern that the current levels of exploitation may represent overfishing, and measures are being considered to limit the catch, such as a minimum landing size.

The Beetle and Wedge Boathouse is a restaurant set on the site of the original Moulsford ferry service, on the banks of the River Thames on Ferry Lane in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, England. The restaurant has a riverside setting on the very same stretch of river immortalised in "The Wind in the Willows", and also Jerome K Jerome's chronicles of the escapades of his friends in "Three Men in a Boat." The unusual name refers to a "beetle", an old term for a maul (or hammer) used with a wedge to split wood.
In 2005 the restaurant played host to Griff Rhys Jones, Dara Ó Briain and Rory McGrath, and a dog called Loli, during the filming of "Three Men in a Boat" – a film broadcast and commissioned by the BBC as a modern-day reinterpretation of the travelogue by Jerome K Jerome.
The restaurant is also listed amongst Britain's 250 Best Restaurants in the Harper's Bazaar 2009 "Going Out Guide".
The building that houses the restaurant was once a working boathouse and was last used for the ferry in 1967, when the last ferrywoman retired and the service was discontinued. The boathouse retains much of its original fittings and sits on the water's edge with the original slipway still in place. The building actually dates back to before 1860 when it was a trading inn.

Presto (UK supermarket)

Presto Foodmarkets was a chain of supermarkets and convenience stores in Great Britain, which first appeared in the early 1960s. While the fate of most of the chain's stores was conversion to Safeway, the final stores still trading as Presto were either closed or sold during 1998.
History.
Early years.
The company was established in the north of England and in Scotland in the early 1960s where its primary base remained but for some years Presto did have a nationwide presence. According to the Institute of Grocery Distribution the name derives from the town of Prestonpans, the location in which the first Presto store was opened. A store also opened around the same time in the Preston Grange Estate in Preston, Tyne and Wear.
Presto was a division of Allied Suppliers which also operated 500 Lipton supermarkets in England and Wales as well as the brands Galbraith and R & J Templeton with around 85 supermarkets in Scotland. Allied also operated a discount chain, Lo-Cost as well as Cordon Bleu, a chain of freezer centres. Presto was the most significant brand, operating primarily large supermarkets and superstores throughout the country.
Acquisition by Argyll Foods.
In 1982, Presto and its 136 stores transferred, together with the rest of Allied Suppliers to Argyll Foods Ltd. Allied Suppliers was sold by its then owner James Goldsmith for £101 million. For some time Argyll continued to operate the brands as it had acquired them.
The brand re-launch.
In 1985, Argyll began a major re-organisation of its food store division. In Scotland and Northern England, the Hintons, Lipton, Galbraith and Templeton stores were either re-branded as Presto stores or closed. For some time, Hintons' direct marketing magazine ""Going Shopping"" continued with the Presto name including the headline ""Presto - Our Heart's in the North"". Liptons stores in the rest of England and Wales were either closed or converted to Presto (larger stores) or Lo-Cost (smaller stores).
Argyll also launched a new slogan in 1985 moving from ""for the best, best go to Presto"" to ""You'll be impressed in Presto"". To complement the new slogan, a new logo was also launched featuring yellow, blue and red as well as, for a short time, a shopping basket. The new logo was used on all converted stores while original Presto stores retained the old logo on their exterior signage throughout their life. A number of new Presto Superstores were also opened featuring the new logo.
In 1986, the conversion programme was complete and Argyll was set for expansion and new Presto regional distribution centres in Bristol, Wakefield, Bathgate and Welwyn Garden City were planned.
Initial conversion to Safeway.
In 1987, Argyll Foods purchased Safeway (UK), which resulted in seven Presto stores (including Farnham, Morden and Chandlers Wharf, Stockton-on-Tees) being converted to Safeway on a trial basis. In 1988 a further 57 Presto stores (including the store at Sedgley, West Midlands, which had opened only a year earlier) had been converted to Safeway. Argyll began phasing out Presto's own brand range, replacing it with the Safeway own-brands throughout the estate. Some Presto brands remained however, pre-packed bread continued to be sold as a Presto own brand in Presto stores.
While most (but not all) of the Presto superstores were converted to Safeway during this period, the smaller stores located in Scotland and the north of England continued to trade as Presto.
Revival of Presto.
The first new Presto store to open since 1987 opened in Kirkwall (Orkney) in 1991. This was shortly followed by another new store in Lockerbie.
In March 1993, Argyll split its retail operations into two divisions, Safeway Stores, and Presto and Lo-Cost Stores. Super Marketing reported that Sir Alistair Grant stated in a memo, "The creation of Presto and Lo-Cost divisions is an important move which signifies our commitment to these important businesses and our wish that their direction and management should be given a strong specific focus." When Argyll had acquired Safeway, it had planned to phase out Presto, but these stores were expanded because of strong customer loyalty in the north.
In 1993 Argyll also acquired 4 supermarkets from Norco in Scotland. Three of these stores were converted to Presto (in Banchory, Ellon, and Westhill) and one larger store was converted to Safeway.
More new stores opened over the next couple of years as well as replacements for existing Presto stores such as the new build Presto store at Springfield in Stokesley, North Yorkshire which replaced an older former Hintons location. 
A limited range of Presto own-label products was also re-introduced on more popular lines as can be seen on the image on this page. Safeway brands continued to be used on other lines.
Disappearance.
In 1996 Argyll announced it was changing its name to Safeway and would be converting the remaining 110 Presto stores to Safeway. While Presto branded products, and even carrier bags, were quickly replaced with Safeway, the conversion of the stores was not complete until mid-1998 when the final Presto (mainly smaller) stores which were not to be converted to Safeway were sold on to other retailers including convenience operator Bells Stores.

Helen J. Neville, Ph.D., is an internationally renowned psychologist and neuroscientist. Neville is currently the Robert and Beverly Lewis Endowed Chair and Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, Director of the Brain Development Lab, and Director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Oregon. 
Neville is known for her research in the field of human brain development, specializing in cerebral specialization, neuroplasticity of the brain in childhood and adulthood, the roles of biological constraints and experience, and neurolinguistics. In order to investigate these topics, Neville uses a variety of methods, including behavioral measures, event-related potentials (ERPs), and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Her research has helped to distinguish between the brain systems and functions that are largely fixed from those which are modifiable by experience, and with all her work she aims to make a positive, tangible difference in society. She is involved in a number of outreach programs and charities in addition to scientific research. 
Neville received a B.A. from the University of British Columbia, an M.A. from Simon Fraser University, and a Ph.D. from Cornell University, and she also completed a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego. She has been employed as Director of the Laboratory for Neuropsychology at the Salk Institute and as a professor in the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD before joining the faculty at the University of Oregon in 1995, where she has remained since.
Research and Publications.
Neville has been published extensively, in journals including "Nature", "Nature Neuroscience", "Journal of Neuroscience", "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "Cerebral Cortex" and "Brain Research". 
Recent topics of research she has been involved in include the neural mechanisms of grammar acquisition in adults, attentional control mechanisms as they relate to working memory, as well as various types of attention and learning mechanisms in young children. 
Neville and the Brain Development Lab were also responsible for creating "Changing Brains", a program of video segments aimed at non-scientists to describe what research has revealed the effects of experience on human brain development. The series aims to inform parents, teachers and policymakers on how to help children develop to their full potential. Neurologist Oliver Sacks said the program was "...fascinating and very original in form and presentation - and exactly the way to present (brain) science to non-scientists."
She is the author of the book "Temperament tools: working with your child's inborn traits" (1998)
Honors and Awards.
Neville has won grants from the U.S. Department of Education and National Institutes of Health for her work in neurocognitive development.

AMZ Żubr

The AMZ Żubr is an infantry mobility vehicle produced by AMZ-Kutno which is used by the Polish military. "Żubr" is also the Polish word for wisent. It was designed by AMZ-Kutno and began production in 2008. The standard Żubr variant, the Żubr MRAP, is based on the Iveco EuroCargo vehicle, which is produced in Poland.
The Żubr was designed for enhanced protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices. The vehicle's hull is V-shaped to deflect blasts. The Żubr is armored against 12.7-mm armor-piercing rounds and features a remotely controlled weapons station. The Żubr can carry 2000–5000 kg within the vehicle and can tow an additional 1500 kg. The vehicle is all wheel drive. It was designed to and is capable of being transported by the C-130 Hercules.

Domenico Martinelli

Domenico Martinelli (November 30, 1650 – September 11, 1718) was an Italian architect who worked for Carlo Fontana during 1678. He was an evident figure in the shaping of Baroque style in the North Alps. In 2010 a musical tribute called "Project Martinelli" was performed to him in Munich.
Biography.
He was born in Lucca, Tuscany and ordained a priest in his hometown. He studied at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome where he taught architecture and prospective. In his time he traveled much of Europe, spanning from within Italy, to Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Poland and the Netherlands. Not as well known as his contemporaries, he often worked with Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt.
His influence on the Baroque style was notable in his work Stadtpalais Liechtenstein (Town Palace), in Vienna (1692–1705), which glorifies an elaborate staircase, derived from Bernini's Chigi-Odescalchi Palace, in Rome. He designed the Palais Harrach, Gartenpalais (Garden Palace), and the Kaunitz Palace, in Slavkov (Austerlitz). He introduced the cour d'honneur in the latter. In his later years after teaching at San Luca Academy, he struggled with illness and returned to his home town of Lucca where he died.

Oscar Conti (Oski)

Oscar "Oski" Conti (191430 October 1979) was a prominent Argentine cartoonist and humorist.
Life and work.
Oscar Esteban Conti was born in Buenos Aires in 1914. Enrolling at the National Fine Arts School, he helped finance his studies by creating caricatures for local advertisers. Following graduation, he studied scenography at the Buenos Aires Academy for Higher Studies.
Despite his distaste for the medium, Conti was hired by "Cascabel" Magazine as a catoonist in 1942; at "Cascabel", he first began signing his work as "Oski." Creating his only comic strip character, "Amarroto" (loosely translated as "Miser") for "Rico Tipo" in 1944 (one of the best-selling satirical weeklies in Argentina at the time), he was enlisted by humorist Carlos Warnes ("César Bruto") to illustrate his irreverent "Versos y notisias", a weekly satire of current events in which photos of the news were replaced by Oski's mocking caricatures. His work was in growing demand during subsequent years, and his elongated human characters and featherless birds fixtures in a number of popular mainstream magazines and in "Clarín", the most-widely circulated news daily in Argentina and Latin America. 
His work brought him to the attention of French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who had Oski create the backdrop for the Buenos Aires performance of his play, "The Polite Prostitute" in 1947. Irish writer George Bernard Shaw also turned to him for the Argentine premiere of his play, "Androcles and the Lion", which played in 1953. Oski had an anthology of his work published in 1952, as well as an animated film, "The First Foundation of Buenos Aires", in 1959. Made in an era in which such historical events were treated as sacrosanct epics by the State and much of the media, "First Foundation" was a slapstick look at the imposing Spanish Conquistadores and their conflict with retaliating indigenous peoples. A similar theme prevailed is his satirical comic book, "The True History of the Indies", in 1968. He also illustrated unconventional editions of Argentine literary epics, such a University of Buenos Aires edition of Estanislao del Campo's "Fausto" (an adaptation of the traditional tale - here protagonized by a Gaucho). Sought-after internationally, he relocated to Santiago, Chile in 1970, partly out of support for President Salvador Allende. There, he illustrated "Cabrochico" Magazine until returning to Argentina in 1972. 
Oski contributed to the left-wing "Satiricón" Magazine in Buenos Aires. He illustrated the best-selling "True History of Sports" in 1973 and published another anthology, "Oski in His Own Ink". "Satiricón"'s closure by executive order in 1974, however, led Oski to begin eschewing political subject matter, instead working with César Bruto in "The Brutoski Medicinal Handbook" (a would-be Medical school textbook) and their unique version of the seminal Salerno School of Medicine's medieval compendium.
The worsening climate of political violence and repression in Argentina during 1975 led Oski to move to Barcelona, Spain late that year, where he briefly worked for Lumen Publishing. Relocating to Rome in 1976, he illustrated a number of left-leaning periodicals such as Italy's "L'Unità", though his declining health and a certain loosening of restrictions by Argentina's dictatorship in 1979 led him to return. Contributing a segment in a public television mockumentary of the 1978 FIFA World Cup (won by Argentina), Oski died on October 30, 1979, at 65. Numerous posthumous anthologies of his work have been published since, notably "El Maestroski" in 1989.

Ocean of Definitive Meaning

Ocean of Definitive Meaning: A Teaching for the Mountain Hermit ("Ri chos nges don rgya mtsho"), written in the first half of the 14th century, is considered the "magnum opus" of Dölpopa Sherap Gyaltsen (1292–1361).
The "Ocean of Definitive Meaning" is a hermeneutical text on the issue of the doctrine of the three turnings of the Dharmacakra, which was first codified in the "Sutra Unravelling the Thought" ("Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra").
The "Ocean of Definitive Meaning" conveys a specific reading, understanding and interpretation of Śūnyatā and Tathāgata-garbha, of the second and third turnings of the wheel respectively. Both Śūnyatā and Tathāgata-garbha are central and key principles of Mahayana Buddhism. This specific reading of Śūnyatā and Tathāgata-garbha and the philosophical view behind it, became known as Zhentong, the key tenet of the Jonangpa. Dölpopa’s thought in this work is a hermeneutics of the Mahayana Buddhist texts and develops teachings of Maitreya and Yogacara masters Asanga (4th century) and his brother Vasubandhu (4th century).
For 150 years prior to the sacking of the Jonang monasteries by the Gelugpa, the "Ocean of Definitive Meaning" was banned within the grounds of Gelugpa monasteries.
English translations.
Jeffrey Hopkins (translator) and Kevin Vose (editor) rendered the "Ocean of Definitive Meaning" into English as "Mountain Doctrine", published by Snow Lion, Ithaca in 2006 .
A second English rendering of "The Ocean of Definitive Meaning" entitled "Ocean of Definitive Meaning: A Teaching for the Mountain Hermit" is numbered volume seven of The Library of Tibetan Classics, a thirty-two volume series covering Tibet’s classical literary heritage, published by Wisdom Publications.
Influence.
The influence of Dölpopa’s Shentong view extends beyond the Jonang school and is discernable

Best Imitation of Myself (song)

"Best Imitation of Myself" is a song from Ben Folds Five's 1995 self-titled debut album. It was written by Ben Folds. The song is a lyrical essay of sorts on expectations and the preconceived notions of a person by others.
History.
In the early 1990s, Ben Folds was shopping his talents as both musician and songwriter to various record labels, eventually signing a publishing contract with Sony Music. During this time, Folds came to find a trend with a number of the record executives he'd meet: they had a notion of Folds' personality and songwriting style based on demos and live performances. These executives expected him to live up to this notion with no deviation and to market him accordingly. Folds wrote this song in response. A similar attitude appears in the song "One Down".
Additional versions.
The song was written by Folds and recorded as a demo during studio sessions in Nashville, Tennessee in the fall of 1990, prior to forming Ben Folds Five. The demo version is roughly similar to the version that would appear on the band's debut album. The significant differences are more sparse instrumentation and Folds providing both main and backing vocals. Timing and certain phrasing are different as well, with the demo version stretched a bit longer and slower than the eventual album version.
A live version of the song, recorded at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on June 13, 2002, appears on the 2002 album "Ben Folds Live".
Singles.
The song has not been released as a single and does not appear in a studio or live version as an additional track on any other single release.
Compilations and soundtracks.
No versions of the song appear on any non-Ben Folds compilation album or soundtrack.

Giulio Cesare Cortese

Giulio Cesare Cortese (Naples, Italy 1570 – Naples, 1640) was an Italian author and poet.
Life.
Born to a well-to-do family, nothing is known of Cortese's early life, though it is thought that he was a schoolmate of Giambattista Basile. Receiving a degree in law, he tried life as a courtier in Spain and Florence, without any great success. Cortese apparently had some success in the Medici court as he was sent in 1599 to Spain as a member of a Medici delegation for the marriage of Philip III of Spain with Margherita of Austria. In his "Tuscan" rhymes there is a fruitless attempt to catch the attention of the Counts of Lemos, the foremost representatives of the Spanish crown in Naples.
He was a close friend of Luigi Caponaro, who he frequently cites in his work.
Regardless of his commemoration by Basile in 1627, it is generally believed, due to several handwritten manuscripts, that Cortese lived at least until 1640 and it is consequently believed that he attended and perhaps participated in his own funeral. 
Cortese is very important for Baroque and dialectical literature, in that, with Basile, he laid the foundations for the artistic and literary dignity of the Neapolitan language as opposed to the Tuscan dialect in which Cortese had also produced a number of largely laudatory works.
Works.
The Vaiasseide.
A mock-heroic poem in five cantos, where the lyric meter and the heroic themes are lowered to the level of the protagonists: a group of "vaiasse", common Neapolitan women who express themselves in dialect. Its writing is comic and transgressive, where much importance is given to the participation of the plebeian choir in the mechanics of the action.
<br>The reader is literally catapulted into the day-to-day life of the "vaiasse" where the main element is the investigation of the world through which Cortese makes into a world which is not his own and which he describes with irony and tragedy.
The Voyage in Parnassus.
This work, in dialect, is a diagnosis of the condition of literature and of people of letters, with a variety of autobiographical allusions, filled with bitterness and pessimism.
<br>The whole thing is situated in Parnassus where Apollo and his Muses reside and where the poet can set forth the sins of poetry, carried out in a degraded society, where the order of the day is the crime of plagiarism. The whole resolves itself with a fairytale ending and the bitter disillusionment of the poet who see all of his ambitions coming to naught.

Life.
He graduated B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1567, and M.A. in 1570.
He became Dean of Gloucester in 1584, and Bishop of St. David's in 1594. In 1596 he preached a celebrated sermon before Elizabeth I at Richmond Palace, in which he made extensive allusions to her approaching old age (she was 63 in 1596, and he made play of this as the astrology, on his text “O teach us to number our days”) and physical signs of it. Thomas Fuller in his "Church History of Britain" claims that this sermon, and a later one in 1602, offended the Queen, one of his sources being Sir John Harrington's account. Anecdotally John Whitgift is supposed to have led Rudd on to preach plainly, and Rudd lost the succession as Archbishop of Canterbury by so doing, but Whitgift survived Elizabeth in any case.
He attended the Hampton Court Conference of 1604; he was sympathetic to Puritanism.
He is buried in the church at Llangathen, where his wife erected a “bedstead” tomb. Rudd had acquired adjacent property at Aberglasney.

The early English comedy Misogonus has been attributed to him, without complete certainty. It was acted at Trinity College between 1568 and 1574.

Karl Winfrid Eikenberry (born 1951) is a retired United States Army lieutenant general and former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan. He is currently the Frank E. and Arthur W. Payne Distinguished Lecturer at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.
Early life and education.
Eikenberry was born in 1951 and graduated from Goldsboro High School in Goldsboro, North Carolina, in 1969 and then attended West Point, where he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant upon graduation in 1973.
He received an M.A. in East Asian Studies from Harvard University, where he would later return as a National Security Fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He also earned an M.A. in political science from Stanford University, where he was also a Ph.D. candidate. In addition, Eikenberry has studied in Hong Kong at the UK Ministry of Defence Chinese Language School, earning the Foreign Office's Interpreter’s Certificate for Mandarin Chinese, and Nanjing University, earning an advanced degree in Chinese history.
Military career.
In the Army, Eikenberry commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 87th Infantry Regiment (Light) in the 10th Mountain Division, and commanded and held staff positions in airborne, ranger, and mechanized infantry units in the United States, Korea, and Europe. He also served as an assistant Army attache in the American Embassy in the People's Republic of China, and then as division chief with the Strategy, Plans and Policy Directorate of the United States Department of the Army Staff in Washington, D.C.
Eikenberry served two tours of duty in the war in Afghanistan. His first tour in Afghanistan, from September 2002 to September 2003, he filled two positions—his primary duty was as the U.S. Security Coordinator for Afghanistan and the second position was the Chief of the Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A). As the Security Coordinator he worked closely with Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Pakistan Lakhdar Brahimi to forge a unified international effort to build a cohesive security sector.
Security sector reform (SSR) followed a lead-nation approach agreed upon in January 2002, in which the G8 nations would each lead a specific sector—the United States reformed the Afghan National Army; Germany, the Afghan Police; UK, counter-narcotics; Italy, judicial reform; and Japan and the United Nations took on the task of disarming, demobilizing, and reintegrating the militias. In his role as Chief of the OMC-A he was the chief architect of the strategy that built and fielded the first Afghan Army Corps.
During his second tour he was Commander of the Combined Forces Command for 18 months, leaving in 2007 to become the Deputy Chairman of the NATO Military Committee.
Ambassador.
On January 29, 2009, the "New York Times" reported that President Barack Obama had chosen Eikenberry to be the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, replacing William Braucher Wood. The choice of a career army officer for the sensitive post was described by "The Times" as "highly unusual". On April 3, 2009, the Senate confirmed Eikenberry's nomination, and on April 29, 2009, he was sworn in as the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. The official announcement of his nomination was made on March 11. Following his confirmation as ambassador, he retired from the U.S. military with the rank of Lieutenant General on April 28, 2009.
Leak of classified cables.
In November 2009, Eikenberry sent two classified cables to his superiors in which he assessed the proposed U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. A description of the content of the cables was leaked soon after. In January 2010, the "New York Times" obtained and published the cables, which "show just how strongly the current ambassador feels about President Hamid Karzai and the Afghan government, the state of its military, and the chances that a troop buildup will actually hurt the war effort by making the Karzai government too dependent on the United States". In June 2010, General McChrystal was described in a "Rolling Stone" profile as feeling blindsided by Eikenberry's statements in the leaked cables. On the other hand, Eikenberry is described elsewhere as being frank and vocal about his concerns about the Karzai government as being a reliable or unreliable partner for the United States in its efforts in Afghanistan.
Awards and decorations.
Personal decorations and badges.
Eikenberry's personal decorations include:

In August 2007 Eikenberry was given the key to the city of Goldsboro, North Carolina by the mayor.

Kamaru is from Kangema, Muranga District. In 1957 he moved to Nairobi where he got a cleaning job. He started pursuing music in 1965.
Kamaru made his first breakthrough in 1967 with "Celina". The height of his musical career was between 1975-1985. In the late 80's he was the first Kenyan artist to play at the Carnivore Restaurant, then only hosting foreign artists. According to Martin Dunford, the owner of the restaurant, Kamaru's vibrant performance opened doors for other Kenyan artist to perform at the venue.
Many of his songs were political, either praising or criticising the government. Initially he had a good relationships with president Jomo Kenyatta, but after writing a song condemning the murder of Josiah Mwangi Kariuki in 1975 Kamaru fell out with him. After Kenyatta died, the next president Daniel arap Moi was close to the artist. In 1980 Kamaru toured Japan as a part of President Moi's entourage. After the visit he composed "Safari ya Japan" praising the president. But the President was not pleased with Kamaru's support for multiparty democracy in the late 80's.
In 1993 he turned from secular music to gospel music and disbanded his previous group, the Kamaru Supersounds. The change saw a plunge in his record sales.
Kamaru is the chairman of the Kenya Association of Phonographic Industries (KAPI), and owns a church ministry in Nairobi. He also runs two record stores in Nairobi.

Atlas SLV-3

The Atlas SLV-3, or SLV-3 Atlas was an American expendable launch system derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile. It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets, and was used for three suborbital tests of X-23 Prime re-entry vehicles. Two orbital launches were also conducted, both of which failed.
The Atlas SLV-3 was a stage and a half rocket, built as a standardised replacement for earlier Atlas launch systems, which had been derived from the various Atlas missiles. A Burner upper stage was flown on the final flight to increase payload.
It is most well known for launching the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA), a backup for the Gemini Agena Target Vehicle which was to be used by Gemini 9 after its GATV failed to reach orbit. The launch was conducted on 1 June 1966, and was the first flight of the Atlas SLV-3 as an independent vehicle. It was only discovered after Gemini 9 had rendezvoused with it that the launch had itself failed, as the payload fairing had not separated.
The Atlas SLV-3 was also used as the first stage of several Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur variants.

KXSS-FM

KXSS-FM (96.9 FM, "96.9 KISS-FM") is a Top 40 (CHR) formatted radio station serving the Amarillo, Texas, market. KXSS-FM is owned by Townsquare Media.
The station primarily competes with Cumulus Media's KQIZ in the Top 40 format (KQIZ, by the way, offers a rhythmic direction). Coincidentally, both stations transmit from the same tower site, which is highly unusual.
The 96.9 frequency was, until 2008, home to a country music format as "96.9 KMML," under the ownership of Clear Channel Communications, however it was one of close to 450 radio stations sold by Clear Channel in the process of privatization, beginning in 2007. KXSS, along with its sister stations KPRF-FM, KATP-FM, KMXJ-FM, and KIXZ-AM, was acquired along with approximately fifty other stations by Gap Broadcasting for a total price of $139M. What eventually became Gap Central Broadcasting (following the formation of GapWest Broadcasting) was folded into Townsquare Media on August 13, 2010.
The KMML call sign has been reissued to a radio station in Cimarron, Kansas.

<doc id="21349762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21349762" title="Holborn Circus">
Holborn Circus

Holborn Circus is a junction of six highways in the City of London, on the boundary between Holborn and Smithfield. It was designed by the engineer William Haywood and opened in 1867. The term "circus" denotes a junction where several roads converge.
Holborn Circus was described in Charles Dickens' "Dictionary of London" (1879) as "perhaps... the finest piece of street architecture in the City".
Roads.
High Holborn (part of the A40 road) links Holborn Circus to the West End. To the east, Holborn Viaduct leads into the City of London financial district. Charterhouse Street and London's jewellery trade district of Hatton Garden exit Holborn Circus to the north. The district of Clerkenwell is to the north-east. New Fetter Lane (the start of the A4 road) and Shoe Lane exit to the south.
Layout changes.
Holborn Circus is notorious for being an accident blackspot, topping a list of the worst accident locations in 2012. In May 2012 funding was secured for a £4.4 million improvement project to the junction to reduce its high accident rate. Works will include the relocation of the statue from the centre of the junction where it obstructs drivers' sight lines to a nearby position on High Holborn.
Surrounding buildings.
On one side lies the church of St Andrew, Holborn, an ancient guild church that survived the Great Fire of London. However, the parochial authority decided, nevertheless, to commission Christopher Wren to rebuild it. Although the nave was destroyed in the Blitz, the reconstruction was faithful to Wren's original. Many other buildings surrounding Holborn Circus were severely damaged during the Blitz. After the end of the Second World War, many were demolished.
The junction is also the headquarters of the supermarket Sainsbury's.
Prince Albert statue.
In the middle of Holborn Circus there is an equestrian statue of Prince Albert by Charles Bacon (1874) which is the City of London's official monument to him. 
The statue features the prince consort in a field marshal's uniform raising his hat. The sculpture sits on an oblong plinth displaying plaques of Britannia, Albert and bronze figures representing commerce and peace.
It was presented by Charles Oppenheim, of the diamond trading company De Beers, whose headquarters is on nearby Charterhouse Street.

Denmark–Syria relations

Denmark–Syria relations are foreign relations between Denmark and Syria. Both countries established diplomatic relations on August 29, 1992. Denmark is represented in Syria through its embassy in Damascus. Following the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and subsequent attack on the Danish embassy in 2006, relations between the two countries were greatly strained.
Reaction to Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons and violence against Danish Embassy.
Following the publication of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, relations between the two countries were greatly strained. On 4 February 2006, the Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Damascus were torched by protestors. They waved portraits of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, leather-bound copies of the Quran, and the flags of Hamas and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
Danish Government response.
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the governments of Iran and Syria had intentionally inflamed Muslim protests against a Danish newspaper's publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad to distract attention from their own diplomatic crises. He said "Syria and Iran have taken advantage of the situation because both countries are under international pressure," Rasmussen also said he would "not exclude the possibility" that Syria had also been involved in violent protests in Beirut, Lebanon referring to the fact that similar violence against the Danish Embassy in Beirut occurred the following day after the attacks in Damascus.
Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said that "Syria failed in its duty. It is completely unacceptable that the embassy was not protected by the Syrians". Stig Moeller said his government had also asked the European Union to condemn events in Damascus. Shortly after the attack, the Danish government told its nationals to leave Syria immediately. Danish diplomatic staff also left Syria and temporarily closed its embassy stating that staff "have provisionally left Syria because Syrian authorities reduced their protection to an unacceptably low level".
Syrian response.
A day after the attacks, Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement expressing "its regret over the acts of violence which accompanied the protests." The Syrian Government denied any role in the attacks and blamed Denmark for the violence and an editorial in Syria's state-run daily newspaper said that "Denmark's government could have avoided reaching this point simply by issuing a sincere apology". Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the cartoons as an offence to Muslims and Arabs and demanded the Danish government punish the offending paper.
Syria recalled its ambassador from Denmark. Danish goods including Lego and Bang & Olufsen were boycotted in Syria.
Response from others.
The governments of the United States and Norway placed the blame for the rioting squarely on the Syrian government for failing to protect the embassies. The US Government said it was "inexcusable" for such damage to be inflicted on diplomatic missions. US President George W Bush condemned the violence against Danish embassies and spoke about this incident in a phone call to the Danish Prime Minister. Bush also said "I call upon the governments around the world to stop the violence, to be respectful, to protect property, protect the lives of innocent diplomats who are serving their countries overseas." Scott McClellan, the White House Press Secretary said “We hold Syria responsible for such violent demonstrations since they do not take place in that country without government knowledge and support,”
Ensuing relations.
On the 27 February, Denmark's ambassador to Syria, Ole Egberg Mikkelsen, returned to Damascus, where he had a meeting with the Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister, Ahmad Arnous They discussed how to enhance bilateral relations through dialogue and mutual understanding and Minister Arnous stressed Syria's keenness to continue relations with Denmark. The Syrian Government said it would compensate for the damages made in these incidents to embassies. However, by February 2007, it was reported Denmark had received no compensation from the Syrian Government for the damage.
In January 2007, Danish embassy staff including the ambassador evacuated the country following security concerns.
Cultural relations.
The Danish government has also a Danish Institute based in Bayt al-Aqqad in Damascus which opened in 2000.

Brad R. Smith

Brad R. Smith (born 3 December 1948) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1970s. He also had a long career in the West Australian National Football League (WANFL) where he played for East Perth and coached East Fremantle.
Smith was a late comer to VFL football as he had spent eight years at East Perth before joining North Melbourne. He was a member of East Perth's 1972 and 1978 premiership teams and a back pocket player in the North Melbourne side which lost the 1974 VFL Grand Final.
His stint in Victoria lasted just two seasons and in 1976 he returned to East Perth and ended up with 222 WANFL games. During this time he also represented Western Australia in six interstate matches. Smith was appointed coach of East Fremantle in 1979 and promptly steered them to the premiership. Although he was recruited as a non-playing coach to East Fremantle, he also took the field for two games in 1979 and three games in 1980, thus finishing with 227 WANFL/WAFL games in his career. Despite a successful first year as coach, the 1980 season was a struggle and East Fremantle only narrowly avoided the wooden spoon. In response to their poor season, East Fremantle decided to appoint a full-time coach for the 1981 season (all previous coaching appointments were part-time) and Smith left to join East Perth as an assistant coach under Grant Dorrington. As the reigning premiership coach, Smith coached the WA state side in four matches in 1980, including the 1980 Australian Football Carnival, held in Adelaide in October.
In 2006 Smith was named on the interchange bench in East Perth's official 'Post-war Team of the Century' (1945 to 2005).

Thomas Vernon (lawyer)

Thomas Vernon (25 November 1654 – 5 February 1721) was an English chancery lawyer, and Whig MP for Worcester.
Early life.
Thomas Vernon was the great grandson of Rev Richard Vernon, and was descended from the Vernons of Whatcroft, who were related to the medieval Barons Vernon of Shipbrook, Cheshire.
Rev Richard Vernon was born in Audley, Staffordshire, and was presented to the living of Hanbury, Worcestershire, in 1580. It was a rich living, and Richard married well, and by the time of the death of his grandson, another Richard, in 1679, they had built up some landholdings in Hanbury and the surrounding parishes.
Richard Vernon (1615–79) studied in the Middle Temple, and may have practised as a lawyer in London in the civil war period, and in 1672 sent his eldest surviving son Thomas to study there as well, and he completed his legal studies in 1679 when he was called to the bar. When a student, Thomas was fortunate to have caught the eye of one of the leading chancery lawyers of the day, Sir Anthony Keck.
Born in 1630, Keck had been called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1659, and was elected a bencher (a member of the governing body) in 1677. On 4 March 1689 he was named a commissioner of the great seal with Sir John Maynard and Serjeant Rawlinson by the new King William III – these commissioners replaced the notorious Lord Jefferys as Lord Chancellor, who fled as James II left the country. Knighted the next day, Keck held office till 14 May 1690. He also served as MP for Tiverton from 1691, and he died in his house in Bell Yard, off The Strand in December 1695. Keck died a very rich man, and had had to provide for no less than nine daughters, and on 5 January 1680 one of them, Mary, was married to the young Thomas Vernon.
Chancery Lawyer.
Thomas and Mary had no children, and instead Thomas concentrated on his legal career. No doubt with the help of his father in law, he soon established himself as a successful lawyer in the court of chancery. The family’s two residences in Hanbury – Astwood and Spernall Hall – were occupied by other members of the family, so Thomas and Mary spent their early years in London in his house at Bell Yard, opposite the entrance to the Middle Temple. But in 1692 his unmarried uncle John Vernon died in Spernall Hall, and from thence forth Thomas used it as his Hanbury residence. There is some evidence in the will of his uncle that rebuilding was already taking place, but it was not for another 10 years that Thomas Vernon started the main rebuilding campaign that resulted in building of Hanbury Hall, an elegant brick mansion that still stands today.
Successful Chancery lawyers could command high fees, and Thomas Vernon was as successful as anyone in this field, and his success was also mirrored in the position in The Middle Temple. In 1703 he was elected a bencher, and in 1706 'reader' a post that by then had become mainly symbolic, but carried a great deal of prestige. Finally in 1717 he was elected treasurer for the year, effectively the leader of the Inn.
Properties, investments and expenses.
Within five years of being called to the bar Vernon had enough spare money to start investing in property, and later in life he left a list of his purchases. These start in 1685 with properties in and around Hanbury as he tried to enlarge his existing family estates, but some were further afield. In 1700 the manor of Shrawley, a parish to the west of the county just across the River Severn, came up for sale by the Cliffe family, and after investigating the prospects, which included timber from Shrawley Great Wood of over , he managed to acquire it for £13,000. Shrawley remained an important Vernon possession through to modern times, and the heir to the last member of the Vernon family lived in Shrawley Woodhouse till she died in 1980.
Only two of Thomas’s eight siblings married, and one was his sister Elizabeth who married another lawyer, Roger Acherley of the Inner Temple in 1692. Unlike Thomas Vernon, Acherley seems to have been in constant financial trouble, and in 1717 his brother in law paid him £8,650 for an estate in Shropshire that he had bought earlier. But Thomas’s greatest achievement was the building of Hanbury Hall. No building accounts survive and it is not even known who the architect was. A carved stone pediment above the main entrance has the date 1701, but this is believed to be a nineteenth-century addition, and a study of all the evidence leads to the conclusion that a completion date of around 1706 is more probable. For one thing, the extensive murals in the hall and staircase were painted by Sir James Thornhill and were completed in 1710 (as shown by a representation of Dr Sacheverell), and it seems unlikely that Vernon would have waited nine years to finish the interior decoration.
Hanbury Hall was later criticized by the family friend Dr Treadway Nash as being of an outmoded form of architecture with many small rooms, and substantial alterations were undertaken inside by a later occupant Henry Cecil, who had married the heiress Emma Vernon in 1776. The main effect of these was to increase the size of the interior rooms, but the outside of the hall has been little altered, and is today very much like its original form over 300 years ago.
Towards the end of his life Vernon boasted that he had kept a careful note of all his legal fees, and that these amounted to over £120,000. But buying land was difficult in those days – estates only came on the market if the owner’s succession failed or if he was in financial difficulties, and on Thomas’s death in February 1721 he left over £20,000 in cash for his executors to buy land in and around Hanbury if and when it came available.
MP for Worcestershire in 1715 and death in 1721.
Thomas Vernon capped his career in 1715 by being elected Whig MP for Worcestershire in the first parliament of George I. But there is no evidence he played any significant role in parliament, probably because he continued his legal practice until his death in 1721.
Estate left to Bowater Vernon.
In his will he left his second cousin Bowater Vernon as heir to his landed estates, but a dispute developed as his brother-in-law Roger Acherley felt that as his closest relative and heir at law he should have benefited. Acherley challenged Vernon’s will on a number of counts, mainly on the basis of technical errors in the codicil which was drafted on Vernon’s death bed. Although it is true that it was not well drafted (ironic in view of Vernon’s career), the Court of Chancery dismissed the case on the grounds that the testator’s wishes were clear even if there were some irregularities in the wording. But Acherley was reluctant to give up, and took the case to the House of Lords in 1726, but with a similar result, thus leaving Bowater Vernon free to enjoy his magnificent inheritance.

Delhi Golf Club

The Delhi Golf Club (DGC) is Delhi's oldest, and most prestigious golf club. It has very restrictive membership, with waiting period of over 30 years. It is located on 220 acres of prime real estate on lease from the government, on Dr. Zakir Hussain Road, in the New Delhi Municipal Council area of New Delhi. It is close to Delhi's top tourist sites of India Gate, Humayun's Tomb, Delhi Zoo, and Lodhi Gardens. DGC comprises 18 hole course which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and a shorter 9 hole Course, and sprawling club house with swimming pool. 
History.
The original course, called the Lodhi Golf Club, laid out in the 1930s by the then Chief of the Horticultural Department, was much larger than the present walled area, and included parts of present Golf Links, and Kaka Nagar. The Lodhi Golf Club, however, had few members, and was barely sustainable, except for a brief period during World War 2, when Delhi was awash with allied officers, who patronized the club. In 1948, the club had 80 members, and in 1951, when it became the Delhi Golf Club (DGC), its membership was no more than 120, and was barely sustainable. The Club was saved from dissolution by Indian officers belonging to the Indian Civil Service, including Dharma Vira, founder member of the DGC, who petitioned J N Nehru, India's Prime Minister, to lease the government land to the club at a low annual rent for 30 years. Every since the Government of India, has favored the DGC with very permissive lease terms, with low annual rents that have had no relationship to the actual value of the land. The DGC has evolved as a favorite watering hole for senior Civil Servants, Police Officers, and the business and social elite. The walled are of the club includes large number of interesting Mughal archeological remains, such as the famous Lal Bangla. 
Course.
The course, comprises the championship 18-hole "Lodhi Course", which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and the shorter 9-hole "Peacock Course". The latter came into being when the course was re-designed by Peter Thomson in 1976-77.The DGC hosts various tournaments and cups such as the Indian Open.
Status of DGC.
The DGC was founded as a municipal course. After 1947, it mutated into corporate entity on 24th February 1950. Since 1956, it has been registered as a company under the provisions of the Companies Act 1956. On August 30, 2013, the Information Commissioner M.L. Sharma, in response to a RTI petition, disagreed with the president of the DGC that the DGC was a company. He ruled that that DGC was a 'public authority',under section 2(h)(d)(i) of the RTI Act, as it receives "indirect financing" from the central Government, and has many senior government officers in the DGC management committee. It was thus "answerable to members of the public". 
Government and the DGC.
Subsidy.
The Delhi Golf Club, has an area of 220 acres, the market value of which is estimated between Rupees 47000 crores and 60,000 crores or about USD 8 to 10 billion at Rs 60 to a dollar. The DGC club house, including the course, is on government land. The lease for the land is periodically renewed by the government at a rate which has no relationship to the market value of the land. The current annual rent that the club pays to the government is just Rs 5.82 lakh per year(approximately USD 9700 at Rs 60 to a dollar). In 2012, eight years before the lease was due for renewal Kamal Nath, the Minister of Urban Development, in the United Progressive Alliance Government, approved extension of the lease till 2050. The DGC has about 4000 members, majority of whom are serving or retired members of the Indian Civil Services, judges, and politicians. The annual subsidy by the Government to every member is estimated to be approximately Rs 1.5 crores (USD 250,000). It is little wonder that there is considerable clamor to gain membership of the club.
Central government Nominees.
DGC management Committee has three nominees from the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation (MUD & PA) as 'A' category members for a term of two years. Additionally, according to the DGC Rules, every fifth member of the committee, is a government nominee with full voting rights.
Reserved membership for Civil servants, Judges, lawyers, and Politicians.
The majority of DGC members are former or serving civil servants, and high officials. In addition to these permanent members Ministry of Urban Development (MUD) and Poverty Alleviation, Government of India, has according to the DGC rules, the right to nominate 150 civil servants posted in Delhi with the pay grade of Joint Secretary and above as tenure members. This is in addition to the 20 members that Chief Justice of India and Chief Justice of Delhi High Court have the right to nominate ; and 5 senior law officers that the Law Ministry nominates.
Membership for "Rich-and-Famous".
In 2012, after the Government renewed the lease of DGC, the Ministry of Urban Development (MUD) recommended 18 persons for DGC membership. These included a "famous fashion designer, a junior Central minister, the son of the chief minister of a northern Congress- ruled state, a couple of high-profile lawyers, and a senior bureaucrat". The MUD in a letter to the DGC management informed that "it would nominate a total of 25 people under the 'Limited Playing Rights (LPR) regular membership category' and 15 under 'Out of Turn Regular membership category' over a period of time".
Management Committee.
The DGC management committee consists of President, a Course Captain, and 12 general committee members, excluding Government nominated members. Posts on the management committee are filled through election. These are usually held in September. 
President of the DGC.
The post of President of the DGC is much sort after for its power and prestige. Senior politician, diplomats, bureaucrats and well heeled businessmen, clamor after it. To get elected to the post, expense and effort is not spared. In 2012 election, held in September, the three contender were Vir Singh Juneja, retired Indian Revenue Service officer, Rajesh Dhingra, IRS , and Rajan Rathore, retired Indian Foreign Service. The three contenders spent vast sums of money on the elections, hosting parties at some of the most expensive five star hotels. One member disappointed with the unseemly clamor and expense to seek member's votes, commenting on the politicization of the election process, lamented, “The honorable members now behave like members of Parliament". In the 2012 Vir Singh Juneja, was elected President of the club. In 2013, he was again a candidate for president. 
Captain.
Kapil Channa has been appointed as the captain (CEO) for 2012-2013.
Club Amenities.
The DGC has a large Bungalow style club house with extensive lawns, gazebos, several in door and outdoor bars, restaurants, gym, sauna, pro shop, and a large parking.
Air Quality.
The DGC, despite its many acres, has not escaped Delhi's poor air quality. In the evening illumination, and early morning sun, "the shroud of carcinogenic particles hovering above the bunkers and greens" are very visible.

Road Records

Road Records was an independent record store in Dublin, Ireland. Extensive media coverage followed its closure in January 2009 but it had relaunched by April with the support of the Irish music community. It was often used by people outside Ireland to purchase Irish music, such as The Cake Sale's charity album for Oxfam.
On 16 July 2010, it was announced that Road Records would close for a second time, because of unsuccessful sales. Business stopped on the 24th of July.
Closure.
Hailed as part of the cultural identity of the city and lauded as being one of the city's best known independent music stores, its closure after eleven years of existence as part of the global credit crunch in early 2009 came to the attention of the national media when its owner, Dave Kennedy, highlighted the difficulties facing his store and the music industry in general on the store's website, difficulties which included being priced out of the market, the rise of illegal file sharing on the internet, the changing leisure pursuits of modern teenagers, the spiralling costs of running a business in Ireland and the rapid decrease in the number of people visiting Dublin. Kennedy stated: We don't see any young people in the shop any more; so as we lose older customers, we don't gain any new ones.
The store was a popular topic amongst the Irish blogging community and its closure was greeted with posts expressing much disappointment. ThrillPier's blog had the post: "Road was the place to go for decent indie stuff. I especially loved the photos from local gigs that were up on the walls. Everyone from the White Horse generation of punk/indie fans will lament the passing of this great shop. Where will I get my Burning Love Jumpsuit CDs now?".
"Hot Press" praised Road's willingness to sell the sort of music "not readily available" in other stores, describing it as "a much-loved fixture" in the Dublin music scene. "The Irish Times" described Road Records as "to Irish independent music what Richard and Judy are to new authors", referencing the British television presenters' renowned bookclub and pointing out that, even after having won an Academy Award, Glen Hansard regularly visited the store when he was at home in Dublin.
Relaunch.
Road Records relaunched on 18 April 2009 following assistance from the Irish music community. Irish musicians, Paul Noonan, Lisa Hannigan, Conor O'Brien of Villagers, Neil Hannon and Jape, played acoustic sets at the reopening of the store.
Second Closure.
On 16 July 2010, it was announced that Road Records would close again, this time for good. Despite the support received, business was still failing. All records were sold at 25% off and other store items such as cash registers and turntables were put up for sale. The shop closed its doors on 24 July 2010.

Herbert Harvey Spencer

Herbert Harvey Spencer (1869 – 23 February 1926) was an English stuff manufacturer and trader and Liberal Party politician.
Family.
Spencer was married and had three sons. Tragically two died during the First World War and the third was killed in a mountaineering accident in Canada.
Career.
By profession Spencer was a cotton merchant and worsted manufacturer and in 1925 he gave evidence to the Board of Trade safeguarding enquiry into the worsted trade. He was sometime secretary to the Bradford and District Manufacturers’ Association and connected to the Association of Chambers of Commerce Spencer also spent some time in Australia engaged in farming and land development.
Politics.
1901-1918.
Spencer was described as a fierce defender of Liberalism and was a self-declared warrior against what he called the fallacies of socialism. In 1901 he was elected as a member of Bradford Town Council. In 1913 he was adopted to fight the next election as Liberal candidate in Preston. However come the 1918 general election Spencer did not fight Preston. The two member constituency was fought and won by two Conservatives for the Lloyd George Coalition, who had presumably received the Coalition Coupon. Against them stood one Labour and one Independent Asquithian candidate, Lieutenant J J O'Neill.
1922-1923.
Spencer was however elected to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election as an Independent Liberal at Bradford South. He faced no Lloyd George National Liberal opponent but was involved in a tight three-cornered contest with Labour and Conservative adversaries. He gained the seat from the Conservatives by the margin of 906 votes over Labour, with the Tories in third place. Spencer held his seat at the 1923 general election in a similar three-party contest, despite being unwell and unable to campaign in person. This time he held on by 675 votes over Labour.
1924.
By the timem of the 1924 general election the tide was turning against the Liberals in the aftermath of the first Labour government. During the 1924 Parliament the Liberals had often been divided over support for the government of Ramsay MacDonald. Even on the initial vote to bring down the government of Stanley Baldwin and install Labour’s minority administration, ten Liberal MPs voted with the Conservatives. Spencer also defied the party whip in this period voting against the Labour government and with the Conservatives on the Evictions Bill (i.e. evictions under the Rent Restriction Act) and twice on the Housing (Financial Provisions) Bill. The sort of difficulties which beset the Liberal Party in Parliament were apparent nationally at the 1924 general election. The Liberals were finding it difficult to define their political position in relation to the Labour and Conservative parties and electorally, as the third party in a two party system, they were being targeted and squeezed by the others. These electoral currents proved too strong for Spencer and in another three-cornered fight in Bradford South he lost to Labour’s William Hirst, even falling to the bottom of the poll behind the Conservatives.
Appointments.
In 1924, Spencer was appointed to sit on a Board of Trade committee to look into bankruptcy law. He was a strong adherent of Free Trade and land value taxation.
Golf.
Spencer was a keen golfer and played in many tournaments. He also played for the House of Commons and was sometime member of the Golf Championship Committee.
Death.
Spencer died in London on 23 February 1926 aged 56.

Atlas-Able

The Atlas-Able was an American expendable launch system derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile. It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets, and was used to launch several Pioneer spacecraft towards the Moon. Of the five Atlas-Able rockets built, two failed during static firings, and the other three failed to reach orbit.
The Atlas-Able was a three and a half stage rocket, with a stage and a half Atlas missile as the first stage, an Able second stage, and an Altair third stage. The first Atlas-Able used an Atlas C as the first stage, but this exploded during a static fire test.
The remaining launches used Atlas D missiles. Launches were conducted from Launch Complexes 12 and 14 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. One launch was planned from Launch Complex 13; this became the second Atlas-Able to be destroyed during a static firing, and hence never launched.

Wish (charity)

Wish (formerly Women in Secure Hospitals) is a mental health charity in England and Wales. It was founded in 1987. 
Wish's mission is to provide long-term, gender-sensitive support and services to women with mental health needs in their journey through the prison and secure hospital system and into the community, and to make women's voices heard at policy level.
It has two regional offices. The head office is based in London and serves the London and South region. The second office is based in Liverpool and serves the North and Midlands region, including Wales.
Wish is a member led organisation and offers free membership to women with personal experience of mental distress, or of the mental health or prison system.
The charity currently works with over 1000 women, but is building organisational capacity to reach the estimated 3000 women who are currently detained within the secure psychiatric system.
History.
Wish is a national charity that was founded in 1987 by Prue Stevenson, Terri Simpson and Kimberley Andrews. At the time, Prue was working in the Education Department at HMP Holloway in London. She became concerned about the high number of women whose mental health deteriorated to such an extent that they were transferred to the High Secure Hospitals, then known as Special Hospitals (Broadmoor Hospital, Rampton Secure Hospital and Ashworth Hospital). Terri and Kim were former patients who had spent many years in High Secure hospitals. Female patients in these hospitals were often subjected to appalling and degrading conditions, and many didn't require such a high level of security. The three women got together to form Wish with the aim of supporting women still in Special Hospitals and prison psychiatric units, and to campaign to change policy and attitudes. 
The charity was originally called Women in Special Hospitals and Prison Psychiatric Units. This was later shortened to Women in Secure Hospitals as the charity moved towards supporting women in medium and low secure units as well as the three High Secure Hospitals. In 2008 following a consultation with members, the charity changed its name to Wish, with the tagline A voice for women's mental health to reflect its status as the only national organisation for women's mental health and its increasing work with women in the community.
The first office was based in London, initially serving Broadmoor and HMP Holloway, and over time branches were set up in the Midlands to serve Rampton and in the North to serve Ashworth. The women's services at Ashworth and Broadmoor have since closed, resulting in more women being moved to lower, more appropriate, levels of security. Wish's work to emphasise the importance of gender and the different needs of women contributed to the Department of Health strategy for women's mental health, titled Into the Mainstream.
Today, Wish works with women at all levels of security, as well as in prisons and in the community. Over two decades after it was founded, Wish is now returning to its campaigning roots, as well as continuing to provide independent advocacy and emotional support to women with mental health needs in secure settings and in the community.

Laurence Womock

Laurence Womock (also Lawrence Womach or Womack) (1612–1686) was an English bishop. He is best known for his controversial writings, some of which were signed Tilenus, after Daniel Tilenus, expressing his hostility to Calvinism in general, and the Synod of Dort in particular.
Life.
Lawrence Womack, a namesake of his grandfather was born May 12, 1612 at Lopham, in County Norfolk, where his father, Charles Womack, was rector. Lawrence's brother William became estranged from the family and migrated to Virginia in the 1630s where he became a Quaker.
Lawrence graduated B.A. from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1632, and M.A. in 1636. He became chaplain to William Paget, 5th Baron Paget.
Lawrence had benefice in west of England, where he attained fame by his preaching. A benefice is church office endowed with fixed capital assets that provide a living through the revenue from such assets.
He was published by the royalist printer Richard Royston. With Thomas Pierce and Jeremy Taylor, he was one of the Arminian clerics attacked by Edward Bagshaw the younger and Henry Hickman.
Little known of him from 1648 to 1660. This corresponds to a revolutionary period in England that included the overthrow of the monarchy, the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648, followed by the execution of King Charles I in 1649, and the short-lived Commonwealth of England. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy. King Charles II restored the crown in 1660. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England.
At this point, Lawrence Womack returned to prominence, and obtained a prebend in Hereford Cathedral in 1660. A prebend is a stipend drawn from the endowment or revenues of an Anglican cathedral or church by a presiding member of the clergy. in 1660, he became Archdeacon of Suffolk;
On the Restoration of 1660 he was made Archdeacon of Suffolk on Dec. 8th, Prebendary of Ely, and Doctor of Divinity in 1661.
Like his grandfather of the same name, Lawrence Womack was a Rector in the Church of England and in 1683 was consecrated Bishop of St. David's. Was noted for his publications supporting the liturgy, etc. Had a fine collection of books. He replied to Edmund Calamy's 1662 sermon "Eli trembling for fear of the Ark".
He became Bishop of St David's in 1683.
Lawrence married, three times. By first marriage, Lawrence had at least one son, Edward. The second marriage, in West Bradford, Nov. 18, 1668, to Anne, daughter of John Hill and widow of Edward Alymer, of Claydon County, Suffolk. Ann was buried at Horringer Suffolk, 1665. Next he married at Brideford on 18 November 1668 a woman called Anne Aylmer of Bury and they had a daughter, Anne, who died in 1685. Third marriage, at St. Bartholomew, the Less, London, on April 25, 1670, was to Katherine Corbett, of Norwick, aged 40. She was still living in 1697. Lawrence Womack and Katherine Corbett had a son named John Richard Womack born in 1670 in Suffolk, England. John Richard Womack migrated to America and died in 1738 in Prince Edward County, Virginia.
Lawrence Womack died in Westminster, Nov. 7, 1685; buried at St. Margaret's Church, London, where there is a tablet to his memory. 
The Anglican church of St. Margaret is situated in the grounds of Westminster Abbey on Parliament Square next to the “Big Ben” clock tower, and is known affectionately as the parish church of the Houses of Commons. When Elizabeth I re-founded the Abbey as a collegiate church in 1560 she maintained its exemption from episcopal authority and made her new foundation a ‘royal peculiar’, subject to the authority of the Sovereign as Visitor.
Lawrence left his books and property to his nephew, Lawrence Womack, Rector of Castor, of Yarmouth.

Alastair Mars

Lieutenant Commander Alastair Campbell Gillespie Mars, DSO, DSC and Bar (1 January 1915 – 12 March 1985) was a Royal Navy World War II submarine commander. In 1952 he was court martialled and dismissed from the service under controversial circumstances and pursued a career as an author.
Early career.
Mars joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1932, and was assigned to the cruiser . Promoted to midshipman in 1933 he was further promoted to acting sub-lieutenant in January 1936. In December he was appointed to the submarine HMS "Grampus" which was then building, and in April 1937 to HMS Swordfish. He was promoted to lieutenant on his assignment to HMS "Medway", the submarine depot ship of the China Station. In April 1938 he has appointed to HMS "Regulus".
World War II.
After spending a short period on HMS "H44", in November 1941 he was appointed as commanding officer of HMS "Unbroken", which he served on until June 1943 on operations in the Mediterranean. From August 1943 until December 1943 he was a staff officer at HMS "Dolphin" submarine base in Portsmouth. In December he was placed in command of HMS "Thule" in the Far East, remaining there until November 1945.
Postwar.
After the war he was posted 1946 to HMS "Dolphin" but was eventually assigned to a post in New Zealand, where Mars' pay of $39 per week as a lieutenant commander proved inadequate to support him, his wife and his two children. The Royal Navy spent four years arguing over an extra living allowance before it was paid. With a sick wife, he was then assigned to Hong Kong where he was unable to afford even the single hotel room he rented. Becoming ill himself and heavily in debt, he returned to the United Kingdom and hospital. On his discharge he requested leave to try to put his finances in order but this was refused. He was ordered to report to Portsmouth but he wrote from his home in London to the Navy refusing to do so and requesting his retirement. He commented in his letter that "I do not wish to plague My Lords with a mass of detail mainly repugnant to them, It should be sufficient to say that I have lost faith in the present governmental hierarchy and all that goes with it".
He was arrested and court martialled for insubordination and absence without leave, which resulted in his dismissal from the Navy in June 1952. The controversy over his dismissal was the subject of a parliamentary question the following month, when the future prime minister James Callaghan asked the then First Lord of the Admiralty whether Mars would receive his pension.
Author.
Following his dismissal he became a successful author, publishing several autobiographical works and novels. He died in Ipswich in 1985.

<doc id="21350273" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350273" title="Two-child policy">
Two-child policy

Two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It is used for some population groups in China, has previously been used in Vietnam, and has been discussed in the Philippines. Although not by law, in 1970s, citizens of Hong Kong were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit, and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies.
China.
During the 1970s, in Chinese citizens were encouraged to have two children. The ongoing Cultural Revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3. (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the "Total Fertility Rate" (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)
As China's youngest generation (born under the one-child policy, which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) is now of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, as of 2009 all provinces maintained that couples were allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves. In November 2013, the Chinese government announced that it will further relax the policy by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.
Moreover, in accordance with PRC's affirmative action policies towards ethnic minorities, all non-Han ethnic groups are subjected to different rules and are usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas. Han Chinese living in rural areas are often permitted to have two children, as exceptions exist if the first child is a daughter. Because of cases such as these, as well as urban couples who simply pay a fine (or "social maintenance fee") to have more children, the overall fertility rate of mainland China is, in fact, closer to two children per family than to one child per family (1.8).
Hong Kong.
In Hong Kong, the Eugenics League was found in 1936, which became The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong in 1950. The organisation provides family planning advice, sex education, birth control services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s, due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign, which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organisation, founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation with its counterparts in seven other countries.
The total fertility rate in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.
United Kingdom.
In July 2007, the think tank the Optimum Population Trust (now Population Matters) advocated what the Daily Mail described as a "'two-child' policy" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom. The article stated: 
"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combatted if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have."
In October 2012, the Conservative Party's proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy', and has been fronted by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and former leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith. The Conservative's coalition partners the Liberal Democrats are likely to block any attempts to implement the policy before the next general election.
Vietnam.
Vietnam had a two-child policy in the 1960s, which was used again in the 1990s. The movement has been proven to lower Vietnam's birth rate, which had previously been at nearly 4 children per woman. In 2003, the plan was discontinued. In 2008, it was announced that the government was considering reviving it.

2004 Konica Minolta V8 Supercar Series

The 2004 Konica Minolta V8 Supercar Series was an Australian touring car series held for V8 Supercars. It was the fifth series held for second tier V8 Supercar teams. The season began on 22 February 2004 at Wakefield Park and finished on 22 August at Mallala Motor Sport Park. The season consisted of six rounds held across four different states, returning to Queensland for the first time since 2001.
The tightest series in the history of the second-tier V8 Supercar competition saw the point score tied at the end of the final race. Brad Jones Racing Ford driver, Andrew Jones was adjudged the series champion on a countback as he won Winton Motor Raceway and Eastern Creek Raceway rounds whereas rival Supercheap Auto Racing Ford driver Luke Youlden did not have a round win to his credit. The pointscore underlined the necessity of consistency in race results, Dick Johnson Racing Ford driver Owen Kelly took the most race wins for the season, seven in total, but did not figure in the final points, losing too many through poor results. Jones had two wins, Youlden just one. The remaining wins were scattered between Alan Gurr, Mal Rose, Lee Holdsworth, Kurt Wimmer and Wayne Wakefield, most of those through the benefit of reverse grid races with Greg Ritter taking two wins and the final round in a guest drive of the Speed FX Racing Falcon Brad Tilley had driven all season. New Zealander Mark Porter had his best series result (and also the best Holden), finishing third, 68 points behind the top two after taking one second and a pair of third during the season. José Fernández finished fourth in the series despite never finishing higher than fourth in a race.
Teams and drivers.
The following teams and drivers have competed during the 2004 Konica Minolta V8 Supercar Series.
Results and standings.
The season consisted of six rounds across three different states. Rounds 1 and 3-6 consisted of three races. The second race of each weekend saw the finishing order of race 1 reversed to form the grid, a 'reverse grid' race. Round 2 consisted of a pair of races. Points were awarded for all cars who finished each race in finishing order. Points may have been offered beyond the 30th position but at no point during the season did more than 30 cars finish a race. Round 2's pair of races carried 50% more points than a single race elsewhere in the season.

Mariana Bridi Costa (June 18, 1988 – January 24, 2009), also known as Mari, was a Brazilian model.
Biography.
She began her career at the age of 14 and participated in competitions and fashion events. In 2006 she secured the fourth place in the "Miss World Brazil" 2006 beauty pageant. In 2007, she participated in the "Miss Bikini International" contest.
In the same year she participated in the "Face Of The Universe" held in South Africa and won the title for the fourth most beautiful face in the world. She was also a finalist in the Brazilian stage of the "Miss World 2008" beauty pageant and won fourth place.
Bridi became ill in December 2008 and was initially misdiagnosed as having kidney stones. By early January, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that worsened to become septic shock caused by a bacterial infection, probably "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", a difficult pathogen to treat because of its resistance to many antibiotics. "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" is an unusual agent to cause a urinary tract infection which appeared to have caused the sepsis.
Later in January, her sepsis worsened, causing tissue necrosis in her feet and hands, which were then amputated in an attempt to save her life. A part of her stomach was later removed during her final surgery.
Death.
She died on the morning of January 24, 2009, in a hospital in Espírito Santo as a result of complications of from necrotic septicemia resulting from the original infection.
The cause of death according to the hospital certificate was a severe sepsis, urinary infection and abdominal bleeding which led to the failure of multiple organs.
The case attracted attention around the world, and friends said they had received messages of support from all around the world.
Her funeral was followed by more than 1,000 people.

So You're a Man

So You're a Man were a five-man comedy troupe, who performed in the mid-90s in both New Zealand and Australia. Members were Bret McKenzie, Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, actor Carey Smith and theatre director David Lawrence. They met as members of the Drama Club at Victoria University of Wellington, (where Clement, Waititi and Lawrence were studying theatre and film, and McKenzie classics and music) and first appeared as a quintet in a segment of a show called 'Bodyplay', conceived and directed by Duncan Sarkies. 'So You're A Man' premiered at the Basement Theatre in Auckland in May 1996, played a sell-out season at BATS Theatre in Wellington in October/November 1996, and then a month at the Last Laugh in Melbourne, Australia in March/April 1997, with one-off performances and university Orientation gigs in between. The show was a 1950s-style mockumentary guide to coping with manhood, covering such topics as proper urinal ettiquete, interactions with women, facial hair, personal grooming and how to find the clitoris. The five actors performed in flesh-coloured 'nudie-suits' and all played the guitar.
This group was a precursor to both The Humourbeasts and Flight of the Conchords. The group has been mentioned in a number of media articles about the Flight of the Conchords, in both the New York Times and Sydney Morning Herald. After the Melbourne comedy festival, where they played on the same bill as Simon Pegg, Ed Byrne, Tommy Tiernan and Peepolykus, the group broke up to pursue other interests.

Nine Dead

Nine Dead is a 2009 horror thriller film, directed by Chris Shadley, produced by Paula Hart and written by Patrick Wehe Mahoney. Filming began on July 6, 2008 and ended on July 27, 2008. The film spent several months without a distributor but has now been picked up by New Line Cinema and it had its US limited release on November 6, 2009. The film had a March 9, 2010 DVD release.
Plot.
The nine characters are revealed to be: 1 — a petty criminal (Christian), 2 — a police officer (Jackson), 3 — an illegal gun seller (Leon), 4 — a strip club owner and loan shark (Sully), 5 — an Assistant District Attorney for LA County (Kelley), 6 — a pedophile and rapist (Coogan), 7 — a priest (Father Francis), 8 — a health insurance executive (Eddie), and 9 — a Chinese store owner who does not know English (Nhung Chan). 
After a string of kidnappings, these nine people are locked inside a room and handcuffed to pipes. Then a masked man enters and explains each of them are there for a reason, and to survive, they must figure out how they are all connected. He further explains that he will kill one of them every ten minutes until they figure it out. The shooter leaves and a countdown begins. The group begins introducing themselves, and a few early connections are made. Christian says he once borrowed money from Sully, but paid it back. Coogan mentions he has been in multiple prisons. Kelley and Jackson are former lovers. Just as the group begins to think it is all a hoax, the shooter enters and kills Christian. After the masked man leaves, Leon has Sully stomp on his hand until it breaks, freeing himself from his handcuffs. He attempts to escape, but is caught and brought back by the shooter. The shooter then kills Coogan, who has mentioned earlier that he is dying anyway. Before he shoots him he whispers the reason in Coogan's ear. Then Coogen attacks the masked man and is shot. The shooter tells Leon he will be the next to die. 
With seven people left, Mrs. Chan recognises Kelley as her former lawyer after Mrs. Chan's store was robbed two years earlier. The group begins to see connections between themselves and the robber, Wade Greeley. The shooter returns, but as the seven only know part of the story, he shoots Leon. With the theory in doubt, it becomes clear that Father Francis knows more than he is admitting, but refuses to give further information. Eventually, it is determined that Greeley did not rob the store; the real robber, Christian, confessed to Father Francis that he committed the robbery in order to gain enough money to pay back Sully. However, when shown a line-up, Mrs. Chan mistakenly identified Greeley as the robber, and Kelley prosecuted him. At this point, the shooter reenters, and since not all of the connections have been establish, he tries to kill Eddie, but Father Francis puts himself in the path of the bullet and is killed instead. When Kelley calls him Wade, he denies being Wade Greeley and leaves. Once the shooter leaves, Sully realizes that before Christian robbed Mrs. Chan's store, he didn't have a gun, and must have bought one from Leon. Mrs. Chan is the next to be shot. As she begs for her life however, he speaks to her in Chinese, and the father-son relationship between the Shooter and Wade Greeley is revealed to viewers who understand Chinese. Kelley begs to be let go to be with her son, but the shooter is visibly angry Kelley used her son as an excuse, and leaves, but not before hinting Jackson is the father of Kelley's baby.
Kelley confirms that Jackson is the father of her son, and also reveals she fabricated evidence to convict Greeley, saying she needed to win a case after many losses. She also reveals that Jackson unknowingly helped her falsify evidence, and that she once murdered a man who raped her, and swept it under the rug when the man's body was found. Eddie realizes the shooter must be Greeley's father, exacting revenge, and the remaining four begin to wonder what happened to Greeley after he went to prison. The shooter returns and kills Sully, who has no regret for his actions. With only Kelley, Jackson, and Eddie left, the three struggle to establish connections for Eddie and Coogan. Eddie supposes that Coogan was earlier referring to being infected with AIDS, and, as he has been in multiple prisons, could have raped Greeley and infected him. Then the final connection is made; Greeley applied for an experimental drug treatment (run by Eddie's company) for HIV, but Eddie would have had to reject him due to his criminal conviction. They explain this to the shooter, Greeley's father, who agrees to let them all go. Kelley is released, but, having slowly revealed her true nature, steals the shooter's gun and shoots Greeley's Father, Eddie, and Jackson. Greeley's father, who was wearing a kevlar vest, recovers momentarily to reveal that the whole time "everybody has been watching" and that they now know "who the real Kelley Murphy is". He is then shot in the head, and Kelley escapes as the police arrive.
Release.
The first stills from the film were released onto the film's official MySpace page on August 17, 2008. The poster was released onto the official website on March 3, 2009.

<doc id="21350485" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350485" title="Short Type 320">
Short Type 320

The Short Type 320, also known as the Short Admiralty Type 320, was a 1910s British two-seat reconnaissance, bombing and torpedo-carrying "folder" seaplane.
Design and development.
The Short Type 320 was designed to meet an official requirement for a seaplane to carry a Mark IX torpedo. It was larger than the earlier Short 184, and was a typical Short folder design of the time, with two-bay uneven span wings. Two prototypes were built, powered by a 310 hp Sunbeam Cossack engine, and initially known as the Short 310 Type A from the engine fitted to the prototypes. When the torpedo bomber went into production, it was powered by a 320 hp (238 kW) Cossack engine which was the origin of the name the Type 320.
At the same time as Shorts was designing the 310 Type A torpedo bomber, it produced a similar design for a patrol floatplane, powered by the same Cossack engine and using the same fuselage, but with equal span three-bay wings instead of the uneven span wings of the torpedo bomber, known as the Short 310 Type B or North Sea Scout, and two prototypes were ordered.
Priority was given to the torpedo bomber; the first was ready in July 1916, and the second in August that year, and the prototypes were rushed to the Adriatic. In September 1916, the first prototype patrol aircraft was finished, but it proved to be little better than the Short 184 already in service, and was not ordered into production. The second prototype Type B was completed as a type A torpedo bomber.
As with conventional biplane floatplanes, the torpedo was carried between the bottom of the fuselage and the floats. Unusually, the aircraft was flown from the rear cockpit, although this did cause a problem for an observer in the front seat. The observer had to stand on the coaming to use the machine-gun, which was level with the top wing. When a torpedo was carried, the aircraft could not fly with an observer at the same time.
The first order placed with Shorts was for 30 aircraft, followed by orders for a further 24 and 20 aircraft, together with orders for a further 30 and 20 placed at Sunbeam. Together with the three prototypes, this gave a total production of 127 Short Type 320s.
Operational history.
In February 1917, 25 aircraft were ordered, and before the end of April 1917, examples were delivered to the Royal Naval Air Service in Italy. Two accidents with the aircraft, when the fuselage collapsed after the torpedo was released, delayed its use on operations. The cause was later found to be the method of securing the fuselage bracing wires. 
The first operational use was on 2 September 1917, when six aircraft (five with torpedoes and one with bombs) were towed towed on rafts fifty miles south of Traste Bay to enable them to attack enemy submarines lying off Cattaro. They had to be towed into position as they could not carry enough fuel and a torpedo for the mission. The operation did not go well; with a gale force wind and heavy seas, two of the aircraft failed to take off, so the operation was abandoned. On the return journey, one aircraft was lost and the others were damaged. It appears that the Type 320 never launched a torpedo in action.
In February 1918, due to the lack of operational experience, four aircraft were operated from Calshot for experiments with launching the torpedoes. Forty drops were made, and proved a valuable source of information about torpedoes entering the water when dropped at different heights and speeds. The aircraft continued to be used as a reconnaissance seaplane until the end of the war.

White Lies discography

The discography of White Lies, a London-based indie rock band, consists of three studio albums, two extended plays and seven singles.
Formerly known as Fear of Flying, the group formed in Ealing in west London in 2002, whilst founding members Charles Cave and Jack Lawrence-Brown were both still at school. Harry McVeigh joined the band in 2004. They began as a "weekend project", before later releasing two 7-inch vinyls, ""Routemaster/Round Three" and "Three's a Crowd/Forget-Me-Nots".
White Lies' first release was a short extended play, titled "Unfinished Business". The release contained only two tracks and was limited to only 500 copies. They made their television debut on "Later... with Jools Holland" in May 2008, where they played "Unfinished Business" and "Death", the latter of which was released as a single later that year and reached number 52 in the United Kingdom. The band's second single, "To Lose My Life" was released in January 2009, and was their first single to break the top forty of the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 34. "To Lose My Life...", the band's debut album, was released one week later. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was the first debut album by a British band to do so in 2009. The album also charted in Ireland and the Netherlands, reaching peaks of 22 and 31 respectively. A third single from the album, "Farewell to the Fairground", was released on 23 March 2009. The release marked the band's most successful single to date, reaching number 33 in the UK and spending 5 weeks on the chart. "Death" was re-released on 29 June 2009. A music video was created for "Death" (Crystal Castles Remix).

The Jack Docherty Show

The Jack Docherty Show was a nightly comedy chat show which aired on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 1999. Presented by comedian Jack Docherty the programme was one of the first to air on the channel, doing so as part of its opening night schedule on 30 March 1997. The show was recorded at London's Whitehall Theatre during the early evening and would then be broadcast in a late-night slot. It featured a mixture of chat with celebrity guests, comedy, and music, and followed a similar format to shows such as NBC's "Late Night with David Letterman" in the United States.
Accompanying Docherty and guests was a house band, whose line-up changed from time to time. It was first briefly led by Pete Baikie, followed a few weeks later by Richard Allen. They named the studio band "Pete Baikie and the Peetles" and "Richard Allen and the Allenoids" respectively. In September 1997 a new house band, "Blair", fronted by Blair MacKichan took over the role and remained until the house band was dispensed with some time in 1998. MacKichan was better known for his appearance in the Oxo adverts during the 1980s, although he was also an accomplished musician.
Docherty was frequently absent from the programme, usually during school holidays, and when this happened the show was retitled "Not The Jack Docherty Show" and would be presented by a stand-in. Guest presenters included Phil Jupitus, Graham Norton, Fred McAulay, Carol McGiffin, Melinda Messenger, Rich Hall and Tim Vine. Ironically the role of guest host helped to launch Graham Norton's television career, and won him the award for best newcomer at the 1997 British Comedy Awards. Docherty – who was also attending the ceremony – had expected to win the award himself. Norton went on to front his own series on Channel 4 in 1998 titled "So Graham Norton".
Channel 5 had originally wanted to call the show "The Docherty Will See You Now", and when first on air it was broadcast five nights a week. However, as the series progressed numbers of episodes were reduced as the channel moved away from its original "stripped and stranded" scheduling format, and, in the first instance, because Docherty had requested that he do fewer shows. From September 1997 it dropped to four nights a week when the Friday edition was withdrawn from the schedule, then three in March 1998 after Monday's episode was also dropped. By September 1998 the series dropped to a Tuesday and Thursday airing, while the Wednesday slot was then taken up with the somewhat similar "Melinda's Big Night In", a chat show hosted by Melinda Messenger. One weekly episode of "The Jack Docherty Show" was aired during its last few months, before the final edition went out on 23 June 1999.
The decreasing number of weekly editions also had much to do with the show's poor viewing figures. Often these would be higher when Docherty was absent, with model Melinda Messenger achieving higher viewing figures when she stood in for him. The show was also panned by critics, particularly when, in 1998, Docherty decided not to renew his contract with Channel 5 when it expired at the end of that year. In November 1998 a television reviewer in "The Independent" observed: "In effect, The Jack Docherty Show (C5, Tue and Thur) is working out its notice. And boy, does it show. It's as if Docherty is perfunctorily doing his job even as the removal men are dismantling the show and packing it off to the archive. The house band has gone, the flats of the set have been taken down, and the script has been stowed at the bottom of a cardboard box file." This sentiment was echoed in the 19 February 1999 edition of "Private Eye", which claimed that Docherty had closed one episode with the words, "In line with Channel 5 policy, it's past eleven o'clock and time for some tatty pornography", and had then simulated fellatio on a pizza salesman. The scene was edited out before broadcast in what "Private Eye" suggested was a decision influenced by criticism of Channel 5, which at the time included soft-core pornography in its schedule. In January 2010, "The Guardian"'s Sam Leith wrote that "The Jack Docherty Show" had "died a death", musing: "I'm not sure even Jack Docherty remembers it very well." 
In March 1999, Docherty said of his departure that he felt the show had "burned out" and was running out of guests. In a 2008 interview he said the role of chat show host had not suited him, and that he had not enjoyed it. "You would be talking to people about what they were doing, and you actually wanted to be doing it yourself." However, the programme is notable for featuring some of the first television work of writers Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and writer/performers David Mitchell and Robert Webb, all of who have gone on to have successful comedy careers.

<doc id="21350626" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350626" title="Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory">
Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory

Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory ("Parque Nacional y Territorio Indígena Isiboro-Secure" or "Territorio Indígena y Parque Nacional Isiboro Secure, TIPNIS") is a protected area and Native Community Land in Bolivia situated between the north of the Cochabamba Department and the south of the Beni Department (Chapare, Moxos, and Marbán provinces). It protects part of the Bolivian Yungas ecoregion. The indigenous people living within the park belong to the Tsimané, Yuracaré, and Mojeño-Trinitario peoples. The southern portion of the park has been colonized by agricultural settlers, primarily coca farmers, since the 1970s. The Bolivian government estimates that 10% of the park has been deforested by their presence.
Establishment.
The park was made into a National Park by Supreme Decree 7401 on November 22, 1965 and recognized as an indigenous territory (formally as Native Community Land) through Supreme Decree 22610 on September 24, 1990, following pressure by local native peoples and the March for Territory and Dignity organized by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of the Bolivian East. Following clearing by the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA), operative collective title to the Isiboro Securé TCO, consisting of 1,091,656 hectares was awarded to the Subcentral TIPNIS on 13 June 2009. Some 124,000 hectares inside the park were adjudicated to agrarian colonists, most in the southern Polygon 7. Another 137,783 hectares are held by ranchers in the Beni department portion of the park.
Ecology.
The territory includes four major ecosystems:
It is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world. In Isiboro Secure is possible to find the full range of ecological zones that exist in the Amazon and Valles and this makes it one of the most diverse protected areas. In Isiboro Secure have registered 257 species of mammals, 219 species of reptiles, 572 fish and 1085 species birds.
Population.
TIPNIS is home to three indigenous peoples who have ancestrally lived in the region. At the 2001 census, there were 12,388 indigenous inhabitants, living in 64 communities: 1.809 from the Yuracaré people; 4,228 of the Trinitario-Mojeño people; and 6,351 of the Chimane people.
In the colonized zone of the south, there are some 20 thousand families belonging to 52 agrarian unions, which are organized into 8 "centrales" (or union federations). These unions are members of the Federation of the Tropic of Cochabamba (), itself one of the Six Federations, the Chapare coca growers' union organization.
Geography.
River basin.
The area is part of the Mamoré River drainage, portion of the Amazon Basin. The Sécure River is one of the principal tributaries of the Mamoré and the Isiboro River itself flows into the Sécure. Both the Sécure and Isiboro flow through TIPNIS, and are located in the north and south of the park, respectively. The Ichoa River, a tributary of the Isiboro, flows through the central part of the park and receives water from various smaller streams. The Sécure and Isiboro drainages correspond the Yungas Mountainous Humid Forest and Madeira Humid Forest bioregions.
The Isiboro, Sécure, and Ichoa rivers are the principal axes of transportation in the region, through which visitors reach the attractions of the park. They make up part of the landscape observed by visitors as well as the route for navigation. The rivers also are home to much of the fauna of the park, particularly the pink river dolphins.
Laguna Bolivia.
The Laguna Bolivia is a major site for observing wildlife. It is accessed by water, entering through the Black arroyo from the Sécure river during high water season, or by land on foot or horse from the communities of Dulce Nombre or Limoncito. The water route lacks a formal port from which tourists may embark. The land route is by way of the road through the southern colonized area of TIPNIS from Isinuta to Aroma.
Environmental threats.
Deforestation.
TIPNIS has experienced substantial deforestation, particularly in the region of the park outside the red line, known as Polygon 7, where agricultural colonization has taken place since the 1970s. Continuing colonization is expected to remove 43% of the forest cover in TIPNIS by 2030.
Planned highway.
The park was slated as the site of the Segment Two (of three) of the proposed Villa Tunari–San Ignacio de Moxos Highway, which would provide the first direct highway link between Cochabamba and Beni Departments. While the highway has been discussed for decades, a $332 million loan from Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), approved by Bolivia in 2011, will make construction possible. The project has an expected overall cost of $415 million and extends 306 kilometers, divided into three segments: Segment I from Villa Tunari to Isinuta (47 km), Segment II from Isinuta to Monte Grande (177 km), and Segment III from Monte Grande to San Ignacio de Moxos (82 km). In May 2010, the a meeting of TIPNIS Subcentral and corregidores throughout the territory stated their "overwhelming and unrenounceable opposition" to the project. In June 2011, President Evo Morales inaugurated the project with a ceremony at Villa Tunari. However, neither a final design nor environmental approval have been completed for Segment Two. In July 2011, the Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ announced they would participate in a national march from Villa Tunari to La Paz opposing the project.
A major concern about the impact of the road is its contribution to deforestion: "Empirical evidence has shown that highways are motors for deforestation" concluded a study of the project by the Program for Strategic Investigation in Bolivia (PIEB). The study projected that the road would markedly accelerate deforestation in the park, leaving up to 64% of TIPNIS deforested by 2030.
A technical report submitted by the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) established that the direct deforestation caused by the road itself would only be 0.03%; similarly, President Morales has spoken of a 180-hectare deforestation, an area equivalent to a rectangle 180 km long and 10 m wide.
Morales government officials claim 49 of the 64 communities of TIPNIS are now in favor of the construction of the road.
The Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ carried out a national march from Trinidad, Beni to La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on August 15, 2011. On September 25, a police raid on the march resulted in the detention of hundreds of marchers, who were later released. The march regrouped and arrived in La Paz on October 19 to a massive public welcome. During the march, other movements such as the Cochabamba campesino confederation and the "colonos" union in Yucumo mobilized in favor of the project. In early October, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly passed legislation authored by the MAS authorizing the road following a consultation process, but indigenous deputies and the indigenous movement opposed the bill. At the opening of negotiations with the protesters on October 21, Morales announced that he would veto the legislation and support the text proposed by the indigenous deputies. This text was passed by the Assembly and signed into law on October 24, effectively ending the conflict. Law 180 of 2011 declares TIPNIS an intangible zone and prohibits the construction of highways that cross it.
Oil development.
Significant portions of the Park are within oil and gas drilling concessions authorized by the government. The Chispani, Río Hondo, and Sécure (zones 19 and 20) concession blocks are partially or mostly located within the TIPNIS boundaries. The Sécure block, is controlled by Petroandina, a joint venture of Bolivia state oil company YPFB and Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, which has carried out aerial surveys in the early stages of oil exploration. The Río Hondo block is a joint venture of the Brazilian state company Petrobras, Total of France, and YPFB, authorized by Law 3672 on April 23, 2007. Two exploratory wells were previously drilled in the park, Villa Tunari X-1 A, which reached a 3,032-meter depth, and Villa Tunari X-1 A, llegó a 3.032 metros de profundidad y en 1999 se inició la perforación del segundo pozo, el Eva Eva X-1, which was drilled 5,830 meters deep between 1999 and 2001. The National Service for Protected Areas (SERNAP), which oversees Bolivia's national parks, has stated that oil exploration and extraction could cause serious damage to the rivers and ecosystems of TIPNIS.

Seshagiri Iyer was born in 1860 in a village Tircuhirapalli district. He had his early education in his village and studied law in Madras. He served as a member of the Madras Legislative Council.
Seshagiri Iyer was known for his public work.
Early life.
Seshagiri Iyer was born to Vaidyanatha Iyer in the village of Tiruchendurai in Tiruchirapalli district in 1860. He was one of Vaidyanatha Iyer's six children through his second wife, Komali, the other five being girls. Vaidynatha Iyer also had six sons namely, Mannarswamy, Ramu, Venkataraman and Subbaraman through another wife. Seshagiri Iyer's sisters were Sanamma, Seethalakshmi, Thailambal, Subbammal and Kalyani.

Legal career.
On completion of his studies, Seshagiri Iyer joined as an apprentice of the famous Madras lawyer of British origin, Eardley Norton. During this time, Seshagiri Iyer was responsible for the Hindu Transfers and Bequests Act of 1914. This act is now popularly known as the "Seshagiri Ayyar Act". Seshagiri Iyer served as a judge of the Madras High Court from 1914 to 1920.
His name was considered for Diwan Bahadurship but was ultimately rejected by the Governor in favor of K. Narayana Row.
Seshagiri Iyer also functioned as a member of the Senate of the University of Madras. In 1916, disappointed at the very tough nature of the Intermediate Examination and the fact that very few Indian candidates had passed the examination, Seshagiri Iyer moved a resolution in the senate demanding that the pass mark for English be reduced to 30 percent. He described the tough correction at the examination as "slaughter" of the candidates. However, there was staunch opposition to this resolution by British professors. One Rev. Macphail uttered: "You bring rickshaw-wallahs and jhutkawallahs to the examination hall, and when they fail, you complain of slaughter".
As Member of the Madras Legislative Council.
Seshagiri Iyer represented the University of Madras in the Madras Legislative Council from 1921 until his death in 1926. He presided over a number of conferences during this time.
Other public activities.
In 1917, Seshagiri Iyer was nominated Chairman of the Tamil Lexicon Committee. As the English Boat Club of Kodaikanal refused to offer membership, Seshagiri Iyer founded the Indian Boat Club in response to discrimination against Indians in 1915. Seshagiri Iyer was one of the first Indian to own a holiday home in Kodaikanal.
Seshagiri Iyer presided over the public meeting on January 7, 1926 at Soundarya Mahal in which the Madras Music Academy was formed.
Death.
Seshagiri Iyer died in February 1926.
Qualities.
Seshagiri Iyer was not as good a lawyer as some of the most prominent ones of the time. However, he was known for his public spirit. He possessed a "cutting tongue and an easy sarcasm". He was also regarded as a "frank" individual and was respected by both moderates and extremists alike.

Southern Bulgaria

Southern Bulgaria (, "Yuzhna Balgariya") is the southern half of the territory of Bulgaria, located to the south of the main ridge of the Balkan Mountains which conventionally separates the country into a northern and a southern part. Besides the Balkan Mountains, Southern Bulgaria borders Serbia to the west, the Republic of Macedonia to the southwest, Greece to the south, Turkey to the southeast and the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to the east.
Geographically, the terrain in Southern Bulgaria is much more varied than that of the north, with the Upper Thracian Plain stretching in the east, while the south and west are dominated by some of Bulgaria's highest mountains such as Rila, Pirin and the Rhodopes, as well as smaller and/or lower mountains and valleys in the west, such as Vitosha, Belasitsa, Osogovo, the Sofia Valley, the Sub-Balkan valleys and the Kraishte region. Southern Bulgaria covers an area of 62,414 square kilometres and has a population of 5,085,872 (63% of Bulgaria's entire population), with a population density of 81.5 people per km². The three largest cities are the national capital Sofia, the largest city in Thrace, Plovdiv, and the major Black Sea port of Burgas.
Administratively, Southern Bulgaria includes the following 14 Bulgarian provinces:
Historically, Southern Bulgaria covers the historical regions of Thrace and Macedonia (Pirin Macedonia). The Bulgarian South also has a number of often unclearly defined or overlapping sub-regions, particularly in the west and southwest, such as Chech, Shop region, Kraishte, Burel, Visok, Zabardie, Znepole, Graovo, Osogoviya, Piyanets, Podgorie, Razlog, Rupchos, Tamrash, etc. Southern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into Southwestern, Central Southern and Southeastern Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders. 
In Antiquity, the Jireček Line divided Latin (in the north) and Ancient Greek (in the south) language influence in the Balkans, with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia became the Principality of Bulgaria while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of Eastern Rumelia until the Bulgarian unification in 1885. Pirin Macedonia became part of Bulgaria after the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913, and the only Bulgarian gains by the otherwise catastrophic post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919 were two small strips of land in southern Sakar.

Nighthawks (TV series)

Nighthawks was an Irish television series broadcast on Network 2 (now known as RTÉ Two). It was hosted by Shay Healy. It was part of the major re-brand of RTÉ Two as Network 2 in 1988.
The programme, which began broadcasting in the late 1980s, was a three times-weekly, late-night series. "Nighthawks" was produced for its first two seasons by David Blake-Knox. In its third season the series producer was Anne Enright, later to become a Booker Prize-winning novelist. In its final season, it was produced by Briain Mac Lochlainn. The Irish Film and Television Awards-nominated director Charlie McCarthy and producers David McKenna and Philip Kampf also worked on the programme. The show's signature tune was composed by Ronan Johnston. It also featured several contributory sketches from Nuala Kelly, Joe Taylor, and Orla McGovern.
An early star of the series was Northern Irish comedian Kevin McAleer, who specialised in rambling but amusing monologues to camera. The Irish actor/comedian-turned British television presenter Graham Norton also appeared on "Nighthawks" early in his career.
"Nighthawks" was produced by RTÉ Raidió Teilifís Éireann. The programme was documented in the first episode of the 2008 RTÉ television series reviewing Irish comedy, "Boom! Boom! The Explosion of Irish Comedy". The Irish folk and contemporary singer Mary Black has remarked on her website on the programme's 1989 connection to her song "No Frontiers". When RTÉ Radio issued new rate cards covering the period from 20 December 1999 until 4 June 2000, it used the term "Nighthawks" to refer to the fourteen spot nighttime packages it was making available on RTÉ 2fm.
"Nighthawks" was broadcast three nights per week. The regular soap opera was originally written by David Blake-Knox, and started off as a two-hander between "Hay Healy",and Tanya (the comic creation of Joanne McAteer) They were later joined by burly Russian character Boris, played by Stanley Townsend. Lots of stand-ups, comedy actors and comedy writers wrote for the show but, from the second season, the late Gerry McNamara was the chief writer and script editor. Morgan Jones, Joe Taylor and Ann-Marie Hourihane were some of the regular "company" actors. Anne Marie Hourihane also wrote a number of skecthes and presented a weekly film review. "Nighthawks" was devised by David Blake Knox. John Comiskey created the shooting "grammar" of the series, and Shay Healy introduced the "4" Minute" Interview.
In 1992, Brian Mac Lochlainn won a Jacob's Award for his production of "Nighthawks".
In December 2012 a one off special called "Nighthawks Rehashed" was aired on RTE. The documentary took a look at the unique show that mixed comedy and current affairs with a compilation of vintage interviews from the series.

Don Van Patten

Don Van Patten is a former American politician.
He was born on February 19, 1966 in Spokane, Washington. Given up in a private adoption at birth, he continued to live in the Spokane area until his parents relocated the family to Everett, Washington at the age of three. At Everett High School, he was active in football and track, graduating in 1984. During his high school years his political views were heavily shaped by the career of Everett High School alumnus Henry M. Jackson. After high school, Van Patten moved to Tempe, Arizona, living and working as a tile and marble setter until returning to Seattle to attend Seattle Pacific University for two years. After leaving SPU, he gained employment at Allied-Signal Aerospace and transferred to Arizona State University to complete his education.
Professional career.
He has worked as a quality, process and application engineer in the printed circuit board industry since the early 1990s. In 1997 he relocated his family to New Hampshire, on behalf of the former Continental Circuits Corporation, to assume responsibilities for the New England sales office. Mr. Van Patten served in sales management for Toppan Electronics where he was responsible for the Eastern portion of North America and Europe. Currently, Mr. Van Patten is in sales management at Merix Corporation.
Political career.
He was a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Rockingham 8th District elected in 2008. Representative Van Patten was endorsed by the Republican Leadership Council and the New Hampshire Advantage Coalition for election to the New Hampshire General Court. He served as a member of the Science Technology and Energy committee. In addition to his role as a state legislator he also serves as an appointed member of the "ad hoc" Hampstead Wage & Salary Committee since 2006. In 2007, he was elected as a member of the Hampstead Budget Committee since 2007 for a three year term. The Hampstead Budget Committee is an advisory committee that is chartered with protecting the taxpayers interest in regard to the Hampstead town and school budgets.
In the 2009 session Representative Van Patten sponsored bill HB428-FN to remove the punitive taxation on local merchants that provided the New Hampshire Liquor Commission an undue tax advantage putting local small businesses and the subsequent jobs at risk.
Representative Van Patten has become a vocal advocate for the constituents of Rockingham's 8th district. Most notably by challenging what he viewed as inaccurate representation of the voters of Hampstead by U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen and inviting her to meet with the voters of Hampstead that she criticized as having 'trampled' on others rights. Representative Van Patten cited two videos taken on the day in question and statement from the Hampstead town administration to the Eagle-Tribune that they did not see anyone who was prevented from meeting with the Senator's staff as the Senator asserted. Senator Shaheen has failed to provide a public comment in response to the letter published in the Carriage Town News or a direct response to Representative Van Patten.
Representative Van Patten was the original prime sponsor of HB1643 -FN, 2010 session, titled relative to requiring submission of a reduced spending alternative as part of the biennial budget process. This bill is designed to remove the current legal requirement that state department heads provide bi-annual budgets that have zero or negative productivity growth through the maintenance budget process and to provide transparency to the budget process.
Representative Van Patten has announced that he plans on providing real time updates on the vote counts house of the Science, Technology & Energy Committee and the NH House or Representatives via Twitter. He is one of the few members of the New Hampshire General Court who openly invites constituents to contact him at his email address, on Twitter or on Facebook.
In addition to his legislative duties, he is a frequent contributor to The Advocates with Niel Young talk radio program Saturday mornings on WEZS 1350 AM based in Laconia, New Hampshire.
In October 2009, Representative Van Patten resigned from the New Hampshire General Court due to a change in his employer's ownership that affected his ability to represent his constituents. Representative Van Patten endorsed former General Court member Ken Weyler in the special election to fill his vacant seat.

Transit Transit

Transit Transit is the second album by Autolux, released on August 3, 2010, on TBD Records (USA) and ATP Recordings (outside of North America/Japan).
Background.
Transit Transit was released on August 3, 2010 on ATP Recordings & TBD Records.
The band produced Transit Transit themselves with guitarist/vocalist Greg Edwards serving as engineer. Most of the record was recorded - at Space 23, the bands makeshift studio in their rehearsal room near downtown Los Angeles. A few drum tracks - "Highchair", "Spots", and "The Science of Imaginary Solutions" - came from an earlier session with engineer John Goodmanson. The title track "Transit Transit" (the last song to be recorded) was recorded in Denmark by Edwards, using a virtually unplayable upright piano and a sample of a coffin-style freezer found in a nearby basement, and then finished back in Los Angeles. There is a notable sonic progression to Transit Transit: samples, vintage synthesizers, and manipulated ambience glue central song components together. there are a lot more vocal harmonies and piano driven songs, even a bit of trumpet. Vocal duties are shared by all three members throughout - their voices are more confident, strangely similar - but each having a definite emotional character. Bassist/ singer, Eugene Goreshter continues to innovate his bass style, effortlessly modernizing the instrument's melodic role on songs like "Census" and "Supertoys", while still providing an on-edge rawness and groove-filled momentum. Edwards' guitars serve to modulate the moods throughout the record, constantly evoking feelings found in the space between emotions. And Carla Azar's sturdy, creative drumming continues on record with plenty of hook beats - ferocious and orchestral, at once.
Note: "Audience No. 2" was self-released on May 21, 2008 to college radio while the band continued to write and record songs that would finally end up on the long-awaited Transit Transit. The single also included the instrumental track "Fat Kid", and a cover of The Beatles "Helter Skelter" as b-sides.

BSD checksum

The BSD checksum algorithm is a commonly used, legacy checksum algorithm. It has been implemented in BSD and is also available through the GNU sum command line utility.
Computation of the BSD checksum.
Below is the relevant part of the GNU sum source code (GPL licensed). It computes a 16-bit checksum by adding up all 16-bit chars of the input data stream. In order to avoid many of the weaknesses of simply adding the data, the checksum accumulator is circular rotated to the right by one bit at each step before the new char is added.
<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp">
FILE *fp; /* The file handle for input data */
int ch; /* Each character read. */
int checksum = 0; /* The checksum mod 2^16. */
while ((ch = getc (fp)) != EOF)
</syntaxhighlight>
Below is a sample java code that calculates an 8-bit checksum. It adds each byte from the input byte array after a circular rotation of the checksum.
<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
byte checksum(byte[] input) {
 checksum = (byte) ((checksum + cur_byte) & 0xFF); // Add the next chunk
</syntaxhighlight>
Description of the algorithm.
As mentioned above, this algorithm computes a checksum by segmenting the data and adding it to an accumulator that is circular right shifted between each summation. To keep the accumulator within return value bounds, bit-masking with 1's is done.
Example: 4-bit checksum using 4-bit sized segments (big-endian:Endianness)
Loop 1:
a) Circular shift checksum:
b) Add seg and bitmask:
Loop 2: 
a) Circular shift checksum:
b) Add seg and bitmask:
Loop 3:
a) Circular shift checksum:
b) Add seg and bitmask:
"Checksum:" 1000

MV Bute

MV "Bute" is a ferry owned by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited and operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, on the route between Wemyss Bay and Rothesay.
History.
She is the seventh Clyde ship to bear the name "Bute" and Calmac's first ferry built outside the UK since the MV Suilven in 1974. There was much dissent over the decision to order a new ferry from outside the UK. Launched in Poland, she sailed for Scotland, arriving in Gourock on 28 June 2005. After trials, she entered service on 1 August 2005.
Layout.
MV "Bute" has a semi-open car deck with a clearance height of 5.1m. Like the MV "Coruisk" before her, she has bow and stern access. In addition she has a starboard vehicle ramp aft which was used at Rothesay before the pier was converted to allow end-loading.
Passenger accommodation is on two levels: the first housing forward and aft lounges with a kiosk area and toilets between, while the second level is open deck space from the twin funnels to just forward of the bridge. The bridge sits on its own perch above the open deck. A single lift connects the car deck with the lounge.
"Bute" has Azipod units with electrically driven propellers mounted on a steerable pod, protruding beneath the hull. These made her harder to position at piers than her predecessors with Voith Schneider Propellers and led to delays in the first season.
Service.
MV "Bute" operates the route between Wemyss Bay and Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, along with her sister ship . Being more manoeuvrable than the new vessels, the streakers and returned to provide the service during work to build a new end-loading linkspan at Rothesay pier in 2007.

<doc id="21350772" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350772" title="Greenhouse gas">
Greenhouse gas

A greenhouse gas (sometimes abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Greenhouse gases greatly affect the temperature of the Earth; without them, Earth's surface would average about 33 °C colder, which is about 59 °F below the present average of .
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (taken as the year 1750), the burning of fossil fuels and extensive clearing of native forests has contributed to a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280 to 392.6 parts per million (ppm) in 2012. and has now reached 400 ppm in the northern hemisphere. This increase has occurred despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions by various natural "sinks" involved in the carbon cycle. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide () emissions (i.e., emissions produced by human activities) come from combustion of carbon-based fuels, principally wood, coal, oil, and natural gas. Under ongoing greenhouse gas emissions, available Earth System Models project that the Earth's surface temperature could exceed historical analogs as early as 2047 affecting most ecosystems on Earth and the livelihoods of over 3 billion people worldwide. Greenhouse gases also trigger ocean bio-geochemical changes with broad ramifications in marine systems.
In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect, though Titan's atmosphere has an anti-greenhouse effect which reduces the warming.
Gases in Earth's atmosphere.
Greenhouse gases.
Greenhouse gases are those that can absorb and emit infrared radiation, but not radiation in or near the visible spectrum. In order, the most abundant greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are:
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound). The proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the "Airborne fraction" (AF). More precisely, the annual AF is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year's total emissions. For the AF over the last 50 years (1956–2006) has been increasing at 0.25 ± 0.21%/year.
Non-greenhouse gases.
Although contributing to many other physical and chemical reactions, the major atmospheric constituents, nitrogen (), oxygen (), and argon (Ar), are not greenhouse gases. This is because molecules containing two atoms of the same element such as and and monatomic molecules such as argon (Ar) have no net change in their dipole moment when they vibrate and hence are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation. Although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) absorb IR, these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility. Because they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect, they are usually omitted when discussing greenhouse gases.
Indirect radiative effects.
Some gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are a greenhouse gas themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor; that will be considered below). Oxidation of CO to directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from the Earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of (667 cm−1). On the other hand, the single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much higher frequencies (2145 cm−1), where the ~300 K thermal emission of the surface is at least a factor of ten lower. On the other hand, oxidation of methane to which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous reduction, since is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane; but it has a longer lifetime. As described below this is not the whole story, since the oxidations of CO and are intertwined by both consuming OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing.
A second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases. For example, the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in the atmosphere can produce ozone. The size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted.
Methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming . Firstly, the main chemical which destroys methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical (OH). Methane reacts with OH and so more methane means that the concentration of OH goes down. Effectively, methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect. The second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone. Thirdly, as well as making the oxidation of methane produces water; this is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere which is otherwise very dry. CO and NMVOC also produce when they are oxidized. They remove OH from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane. The surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of CO is three times that of . The same process that converts NMVOC to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone. Halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone. Finally hydrogen can lead to ozone production and increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere.
Contribution of clouds to Earth's greenhouse effect.
The major non-gas contributor to the Earth's greenhouse effect, clouds, also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases. Clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.
Impacts on the overall greenhouse effect.
[[File:Attribution of individual atmospheric component contributions to the terrestrial greenhouse effect, separated into feedback and forcing categories (NASA).png|right|thumb|alt=refer to caption and adjacent text|Schmidt "et al." (2010) analysed how individual components of the atmosphere contribute to the total greenhouse effect. They estimated that water vapor accounts for about 50% of the Earth's greenhouse effect, with clouds contributing 25%, carbon dioxide 20%, and the minor greenhouse gases and aerosols accounting for the remaining 5%. In the study, the reference model atmosphere is for 1980 conditions. Image credit: NASA.]]
The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is affected by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation. Shindell "et al." (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.
When ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect, the most important are:
In addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (see IPCC list of greenhouse gases). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.
Proportion of direct effects at a given moment.
It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases. In addition, some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.
Atmospheric lifetime.
Aside from water vapor, which has a residence time of about nine days, major greenhouse gases are well-mixed, and take many years to leave the atmosphere. Although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere, there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases.
Jacob (1999) defines the lifetime formula_1 of an atmospheric species X in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of X remains in the box. Mathematically formula_1 can
be defined as the ratio of the mass formula_3 (in kg) of X in the box to its removal rate, which is the sum of the flow of X out of the box
(formula_4),
chemical loss of X
(formula_5),
and deposition of X
(all in kg/s):
formula_7.
If one stopped pouring any of this gas into the box, then after a time formula_1, its concentration would be about halved.
The atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime.
Carbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified precisely. The atmospheric lifetime of is estimated of the order of 30–95 years.
This figure accounts for molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean, photosynthesis, and other processes. However, this excludes the balancing fluxes of into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs, which have slower characteristic rates. While more than half of the emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20%) of emitted remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years. Similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases, many of which have longer mean lifetimes than . E.g., N2O has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years.
Radiative forcing.
The Earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun, reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat. The Earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy. If this energy balance is shifted, the Earth's surface could become warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of changes in global climate.
A number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in the Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from the Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect the Earth's energy balance over a long time period. Factors that influence Earth's energy balance can be quantified in terms of "radiative climate forcing." Positive radiative forcing indicates warming (for example, by increasing incoming energy or decreasing the amount of energy that escapes to space), while negative forcing is associated with cooling.
Global warming potential.
The global warming potential (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same mass of and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a gas has a high (positive) radiative forcing but also a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale. Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than its GWP will increase with the timescale considered. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.
Methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 ± 3 years and a GWP of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years. The decrease in GWP at longer times is because methane is degraded to water and through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.
Examples of the atmospheric lifetime and GWP relative to for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table:
The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties. The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds will be completed in 2030.
Natural and anthropogenic sources.
[[File:Diagram showing a simplified representation of the Earth's annual carbon cycle (US DOE).png|thumb|alt=refer to caption and image description|right|This diagram shows a simplified representation of the contemporary global carbon cycle. Changes are measured in gigatons of carbon per year (GtC/y). Canadell "et al." (2007) estimated the growth rate of global average atmospheric for 2000–2006 as 1.93 parts-per-million per year (4.1 petagrams of carbon per year).

Aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons, most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial Holocene, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant. In the industrial era, human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.
The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report compiled by the IPCC (AR4) noted that "changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system", and concluded that "increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century". In AR4, "most of" is defined as more than 50%.
"Abbreviations used in the two tables below: ppm = parts-per-million; ppb = parts-per-billion; ppt = parts-per-trillion; W/m2 = watts per square metre"
Removal from the atmosphere ("sinks").
Natural processes.
Greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes, as a consequence of:
Negative emissions.
A number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide air capture, or to the soil as in the case with biochar. The IPCC has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change.
History of scientific research.
Late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that and do not absorb infrared radiation (called, at that time, "dark radiation") while, on the contrary, water, both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds, as well as and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules, do absorb infrared radiation. It was recognized in the early 20th century that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made the Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them. During the late 20th century, a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system, with consequences for the environment and for human health.

History.
Turkdean was recorded as "Turcandene" in the 8th century and was listed as "Turchedene" or "Turghedene" in the Domesday Book of 1086. It derives from the Old English for "valley ("denu") of a river called "Turce"", with "Turce" or "Twrch" being a lost Celtic river name, possibly meaning boar.
Governance.
Turkdean is part of the Sandywell ward of the district of Cotswold, represented by Councillor Robin Hughes, a member of the Conservative Party. Turkdean is part of the constituency of Cotswold, represented at parliament by Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It is part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.
Geography.
Turkdean is in the county of Gloucestershire and lies within the Cotswolds, a range of hills designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is approximately 30 km (20 mi) to the east of Gloucester. It is approximately 21 km (13 mi) east of its post town Cheltenham and about 8 km (5 mi) south-west of Bourton-on-the-Water. The southeastern boundary follows the route of the Roman road the Fosse Way. Nearby villages include Cold Aston, Hazleton, Clapton, Farmington and Hampnett.
In popular culture.
In the 1981 film "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Harrison Ford's character, archaeologist Indiana Jones mentions the Barrow at Turkdean during a lecture.
The Channel 4 archaeological television series "Time Team" made two visits, in 1997 and 1998, to excavate a nearby Roman villa site.

Grobiņa Castle

Grobiņa Castle is a medieval castle located in the town of Grobiņa, Latvia, in western Courland. The ancient Curonian castle hill ("Skābāržu kalns") is located only 100 m from the castle. It is supposed to be the famous Seeburg, which is mentioned in Scandinavian sources already in ninth century.
History.
The Livonian Order erected the castle in 1253 to protect the roads from Livonia to Prussia. It was a square type building and was a three storey high living block in the southern aisle. It also had a gate tower in the middle of the western wall. The castle was built of bricks and crude stone. Once it had arched ceilings. It was a residence for the local viceroy of the Livonian Order from 1399 to 1590. As support base in south Courland it was many times rebuilt and fortified.
In the times of the Duchy of Courland, the castle was destroyed and rebuilt many times. In the sixteenth and seventeenth century sand walls were erected around the castle. They had a bastion in each of the four corners and a stockade. Later the castle was used as a residence for local German landlords. The castle was destroyed in the eighteenth century. 
Many famous people have visited the castle, for example: Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland, The King of Sweden, Carl XII and the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm III.
Castle ruins today.
In the 1970s major conservation jobs were made in the castle, so today the castle ruins are in a quite good condition. Most of the walls are still standing in three story height. Today's castle is a major tourist attraction and also a place for local gatherings and concerts.

Big Brother 1 (Albania)

Big Brother 1 (Albania) was the debut season of the Albanian series of the worldwide franchise of Big Brother. It launched on Saturday, 23 February 2008, with fourteen Housemates entering the House. The show ran for 100 days and the winner was Arbër Çepani. He received a €50,000 prize.
Big Brother 1 (Albania) aired on two cable channels 24 hours a day on the Digit-Alb cable network, as well as in two additional channels on Digitalb Mobile. Daily reviews were shown Monday thru Saturday on Top Channel at 17:55 CET. The elimination show aired Saturdays at 21:00 CET, while a weekly review closed off the week at 17:55 CET on Sunday afternoon.
The main host was Arbana Osmani, while Eno Popi received the contestants in and out of the house and conducted interviews with their families. A panel of opinionists was present on the Saturday night show. Mevlan Shanaj, a film director, and Armand Peza, a screenwriter, had permanent positions in this panel, while different singers, psychologists and relevant art figures were invited every week to give their insight. One of the most notable guests was singer Jonida Maliqi who became known for her tough debates with the eliminated contestants.
14 housemates entered as original members, while 4 others were introduced later in the game. The originals would receive the full prize if they were victorious, while the newcomers would only receive a proportional amount based on the days they spent inside the house if they were to win at the end. However, an original housemate won the show, therefore winning the full prize.
Each member cast 2 nominations every Saturday along with 2 valid reasons for each nomination. Valid reasons were mandatory. Three or more players faced the public vote. The public then had one week to vote off the person that they thought should be evicted. Five contestants made their way to the final where the public voted 35% for original housemate Arbër Çepani to win the grand prize.
The normal eviction procedure was dramatically interrupted in 3 occasions. The ammunition explosions in the village of Gërdec rocked the house of Big Brother which was situated 500 meters away from the scene, forcing the network to evacuate the housemates in a secluded hotel room and cancelling the normal Saturday show. The second interruption was due to the violent fight that exploded between the two newcomers Ilda and Mardiola. Mardiola walked off the show while Ilda was ejected by the Big Brother staff. The Saturday night eviction was canceled and the SMS money spent by the public was donated to charity. The third and final delay happened the last week of the show when Dritan Hoxha, president of Top Channel, died in a car accident. The network postponed the Saturday show, therefore changing the projected length of Big Brother Albania from 99 to 100 days.
The 10th round of evictions was also unusual, since the housemates were instructed to cast 2 secret nominations without a reason, and the three contestants with the most nominations would be up for a speedy eviction by the public at home. In 20 minutes of SMS voting, the public decided to vote off Besarta with 41% of the vote.
A reunion show called "Brënda Big Brother" "eng. Inside Big Brother" was held the week following the finale. The housemates received a series of prizes ranging from work offers abroad to vacation packages and other prizes. Juna, an aspiring singer, received a record deal for one song and a videoclip from an Albanian label company. Jonida on the other hand earned herself a gig as an anchor at Top Albania Radio.
Contestants.
Romina.
Romina is a 21-year-old student in the Social Sciences Faculty in Tirana. She likes soccer, literature and movies.

Ingrid.
Ingrid is a 29-year-old mother of two girls who works in an electrical supplies company. She likes to go out fishing as a way to relax, as well as horse riding. She used to love skiing and biking but has settled ever since she became a mother. Ingrid was first to be eliminated from the public vote.
Astrit.
Astrit is a 35-year-old family guy who lives in one of the villages near Tirana. He has a wife and son and although he owns a home in the city, he has chosen to live in a village because of the tranquility and freshness that it brings to his life. He also enjoys the good interaction within the community and works in a small bar which he owns, apart from the usual farm duties. Astrit is the 2nd runner-up of the first season of Big Brother Albania.
Arbër.
Arbër is a 21-year-old political sciences and international relations student at the University of Bari in Italy together with his girlfriend Maddalena. He has lived in Italy for more than 10 years. One of his biggest passions is nature and related community projects. He has helped expand green spaces in Tirana and has also participated in a project to re-build a school in an Albanian village. If he wins, he wants to donate the entire prize money to people that need it more than him. Arbër is the winner of the first season of Big Brother Albania. He also returned in Big Brother 5 (Albania) as a guest, showing the house around.

He has a hard time waking up in the morning and must spend a lot of time in front of the mirror every day. He handles many important activities, one of them is getting people to donate blood for children with thalassemia. In his free time he goes to different bars and also night clubs during the weekends. Prior to being evicted, Ervis made a joke about having worked as a gigolo. He blamed this joke for his elimination. Ervis was evicted on the 4th round of public voting.
Besarta.
Besarta is a 20-year-old girl from Kosovo who studies Economics at the FAMA College. She lives with her family and one of her hobbies is to design clothes. She also loves to hang out with her friends. Besarta was evicted on the 9th round of public voting. Besarta's eviction was different from the rest of the housemates. Her nomination came as a result of a secret ballot by the other contestants as part of a twist by Big Brother. The public had roughly 20 minutes to vote off one of three nominees instead of the usual full week voting period.
Mardiola.
Mardiola is a 25-year-old mother who attends a private law school and is very devoted to her studies. She also works part-time in an accounting firm. She has a 7 year old girl and a husband which she loves dearly. She likes running by the sea to relax from the busy day. Mardiola had a small scale fight with Julinda and wanted to walk off the show but the other guests convinced her to stay. Mardiola walked off the show before the staff could officially eject her after a fight she had with Ilda over a series of provocations from both sides. The girls threw glasses and plates at each other before the other housemates broke them up.
Ilda.
Ilda is a 22-year-old girl who has lived in Boston, Massachusetts for 11 years where she has studied finances and worked in a bank. She currently lives in Tirana.

Dorina is a 22-year-old girl who studies sociology at the Social Sciences Faculty in Tirana. Since her family lives in Korça she misses them a lot and tries to visit them as much as possible. She likes to cook, read and travel as well as go out in various pubs during the weekends. Dorina was evicted on the 10th round of public voting.
Highlights.
Days 1 - 15.
14 original housemates entered a spacious home in one of the wealthy villages of suburban Tirana after being secluded in hotel rooms without any contact with the outside world. The first verbal spars started between Romina and Shkëlqim as the opening show was still airing. An obvious struggle for "leader" status was taking place between the two, however this conflict remained dormant for several weeks as the attention quickly shifted to Juna and her heated debacles with many of the housemates. The house became split after the first real fight erupted between Juna and Romina over what Romina considered "irrational usage" of the food supply. Juna told her to "go get checked", words which fueled an ongoing rivalry between the two girls. Juna had another argument with Shkëlqim over his loud singing which she disliked, as well as with Astrit due to her irritation with some of his "rural" behavior.
Despite Juna's many animosities, the housemates were more ticked off at her friend Ingrid due to her overly sensitive nature. She took many of the things that the other housemates would tell her very personally, often responding rudely or by running to her room and crying. Shkëlqim dubbed her as "mentally sick" in a private conversation with some of the roommates.
The first week's activity was for all the housemates to split in two groups and make two paintings. They decided to paint the things that matter most to them in their lives. The paintings were put up for auction during the remainder of the season and were ultimately purchased for 1400 euros, money that went to the Red Cross.
They passed the first week's challenge, but failed the second one, therefore cutting their budget in half. Ingrid was eliminated with 50% of the vote. Most of the contestants were happy, except for Juna and Julinda who were closer to her. Meanwhile, Olsi was given a symbolic punishment by "Big Brother" for not helping in the kitchen and spending too much time with the girls. He was ordered to peel 2 sacks of potatoes and choose one of the other contestants to help him out. His choice was Juna. Unbeknown to him, his real life girlfriend Lusika had been watching the show very closely for the past two weeks and had come to the studio to get an explanation for his behaviour. The host did not inform Olsi about Lusi's presence in the studio, however she asked him to explain what he feels for his girlfriend and for Juna and Najada, another housemate he was close to. Olsi said that he feels relaxed with them, however "he will always love" his girlfriend. Lusi on the other hand admitted to the host that if he did anything with them, she would dump him.
Days 15 - 29.
Olsi started getting much closer to Najada, however he could not hide away his attraction to Juna either. Although she rejected him at first, they began to bond as the weeks progressed, a move that bothered Najada. The two girls had a negative attitude toward each other but managed to keep a distance. Privately, Najada complained about Juna's loud fits with all the housemates, while Juna complained about Najada showering four times a day, arguing that the hot water gets wasted and blaming it on the fact that "Najada does not sleep alone", an obvious swipe at her proximity with Olsi and the other guys. Romina and Najada became united against Juna, finding themselves in alignment with Ervis and Shkëlqim who considered her a "spoiled brat" and wanted her out.
Najada could not wait for Saturday to come, certain that a nominated Juna would be evicted by the public. However on Saturday, March 15, an extremely powerful ammunition dump blast took place in the village of Gërdec, 500 meters away from the Big Brother house. The housemates were shell shocked and terrified due to the high amount the pressure and noise that rocked the home, forcing the network to evacuate everyone for security concerns and postpone the show for one week. The contestants were sent to a secluded hotel room and returned after 24 hours. They immediately held a session to donate blood for the victims of the tragedy.
This unlikely time-out warmed up the relationships with former rivals. Romina and Juna held a little heart-to-heart, although differences remained. Meanwhile, the Gërdec tragedy made Julinda very emotional as she thought back at her family, who did not approve of her participation in a reality show. Ina and Pol warmed up considerably towards each other although no one was ready to commit to anything serious. Ervis on the other hand created a strong friendship with the two of them, becoming the strategic "trio" of the house. One night he decides to tell some of his roommates about having worked as a gigolo in the past, which he later dismissed as a joke. This joke however did not go well with the public at home.
Juna could not keep away from another fight, this time involving Astrit. The assigned weekly activity consisted on the housemates creating a theatrical play, with which they decided to depict the differences between rural and city people. Juna decides to dress as a "villager", but Astrit, who is a farmer himself, considered it a deep insult, claiming that gypsies dressed that way, not villagers. Shkëlqim tried to fuel the disagreement even further, causing Astrit to walk away angrily as Juna laughed it off.
The Saturday night eviction ceremony began badly as the contestants lost half their budget due to their inability to pass that week's challenge. However, the biggest drama unfolded as an unsuspecting Juna gets eliminated with 59% of the vote. She leaves the house in tears after a final meeting with Olsi. The troubles for Juna had only just begun as she still had to face the panel of opinionists. In a showdown with famous Albanian singer Jonida Maliqi, Juna is heavily questioned about her relationship with Olsi, especially about the ring that she carried on her finger. She said that it was a gift from Olsi and she was not going to take it off, even if her boyfriend at home asked her to. She later broke up with her boyfriend.
Later that night, Ina and Pol are treated to an exotic private date and Julinda is ordered to serve them because of her poor performance in the weekly challenge. On the other side, Olsi gets drunk and the network later revealed tapes of him and Najada engaging in a series of sexual movements under the covers. It was interpreted as sexual activity for the remainder of the season by the public and his girlfriend, however Olsi denied it during the finale.
Days 29 - 36.
Olsi's obsession with Juna grows bigger in the wake of the eviction eve. He tells Najada that he wants to sleep in Juna's bed because of her fresh smell still being there. She joking responds that she will "cut his face up". Later, Romina finds him wrapped around a pillow on Juna's bed in a very distressed mood. Astrit is ticked off at the other housemates as they continue to make jokes about how villagers cannot integrate with city life. He tells them to stop joking in his presence. The weekly activity assigned by Big Brother is to paint the walls of the hallway. Olsi decides to paint a portrait of Juna, angering Najada even further. In a private talk with Julinda and Romina she confessed that when she saw Olsi for the first time, she thought he was gay.
Elimination night begins by the housemates winning the weekly challenge, a quiz on Albania's cities and cultures. Later that night, Leonard is evicted, although there wasn't a major upset in the house as he had become very withdrawn.
Then, host Arbana Osmani announces to the public that someone had come to meet Olsi in the storage room. It was Olsi's girlfriend, Lusi, who had decided to pull the plug on their relationship. The two were separated by a glass wall as the showdown took place. Lusi told him that she could not forgive him for giving Juna the ring as well as the activity under the covers with Najada.
A final surprise awaited the housemates, as two new girls were introduced in the game, Mardiola and Ilda.
Days 36 - 43.
Shkëlqim and Ervis are enthusiastic with the way the evictions are going, confident that the public backs them up with their recommendations so far. However, Ervis finds himself in a hot spot after a very attractive Ilda uses him to infiltrate inside the friendship "trio" he had with Ina and Pol. She is very attracted to Pol and with little effort she is able to catch his attention, leaving Ina angry and in tears. Shkëlqim has focused his efforts on Romina and her strong character. After Juna's departure, the fight for leader status between the two resumed, often forcing Shkëlqim to offend Romina based on her weight and her rebellious nature, claiming that "no family would want to have her". Romina was not the only thorn in the plans he had to deal with, since an explosive and impulsive Mardiola was getting overly irritated by his desire to moderate everybody's behaviour. Romina now finds a new ally in Mardiola as her fight to evict the next "big fish" continues.
April Fool's Day comes knocking, and Big Brother has a funny warning for all the housemates. They are told that they have breached the regulations of the show, starting from foul language used, causing excessive censoring for the editing crew, as well as the poor maintenance of their rooms. Julinda and Pol, two of the most positive members of the house, are ordered to leave the show. The other contestants burst in tears, only to find out that it was all a joke, but a warning at the same time.
Saturday night, the housemates fail the challenge. A restricted budget has been causing tensions for some weeks now. Later, Mardiola's birthday is celebrated but the fun stops when a very uneasy Ervis is evicted with 48% of the vote. Shkëlqim, Ina and Pol realise that Romina has snatched away the public's support. Meanwhile, Ervis blames his elimination on the public and even appears on the nightly news to clear his record from the "gigolo joke".
The week closes off with Ilda and Astrit treated to an exotic massage from two Thai masseuses.
Days 43 - 50.
Trouble starts brewing as Ilda and Julinda fool around in the kitchen with some fake lesbian hugging and kissing, enabling Mardiola to spread a rumor that Ilda is a lesbian. Competition between the two newcomer girls has been tense. However Ilda denied being a lesbian. The lesbian rumor was only the tip of the iceberg, since Mardiola also admitted to spreading another rumor, claiming that Ilda had appeared in a Bluetooth cell phone tape circulating all over Albania, engaging in sexual activity with 5 men. The rumor was false but it only aggravated the relationship between the two girls. Ina cried in her bed for most of the week, as Pol and Ilda were enjoying each other's company. Tensions rose as Ilda claimed that Ina has been abusing her clothes in the closets and blamed it on her jealousy. Arbër found himself closer to Julinda and Besarta, however he started to challenge their intelligence by asking questions about the profession of the girls, which they couldn't answer.
A temporary boost of morale comes on Saturday as they win the karaoke challenge and a bigger budget. Big Brother also gives a canine friend to the remaining contestants called "Bigu". However, the biggest victory was reserved for Ilda as her rival Ina is evicted with 46% of the vote. Ilda said that her eviction was well deserved and called her fake. Back in the studio, Ina jokingly asked if she could break the big screen showing Ilda still inside the house.
After the show, Julinda tells Mardiola that she nominated her. Mardiola replies that Julinda likes to "suck up" to save herself from the nomination. Julinda calls her short and criticises her for being married too early, causing Mardiola to rush towards her. The other housemates stopped them from beating each other, however Mardiola said she wanted to leave. They were able to convince her to stay. Shkëlqim and Julinda, two former foes due to Julinda's affection for Juna and Ingrid, have now bonded over two common enemies, Mardiola and Romina.
Days 50–57.
The week kicks off as Romina decides to pull a prank on Olsi, letting him know that she is supposedly in love with him. Olsi becomes very confused, while Mardiola thinks that Romina really does feel something for him but is hiding behind a joke. Romina however sticks with the prank excuse.
Arbër decides to cook fish for the other housemates, in what turned out to be the wildest lunch they had in the Big Brother house. As they awaited the fish to be served, Mardiola and Ilda, who were facing each other, get in a verbal fight over Mardiola eating the salad from the bowl instead of taking it in her own plate. The argument escalates as Mardiola refuses to do so, claiming it tastes better from the "common bowl". Ilda is disgusted but Mardiola reiterates by telling Ilda not to let the wine get over her head too quickly. The conversation degenerates as Ilda bullies Mardiola over her 162 cm height; however, the conflict erupts when Ilda tells Mardiola that she's not giving a good example to her daughter by walking around in underwear and lying in bed with other men. Mardiola throws her glass of water on Ilda's plate and then empties the bowl of salad on her head. Ilda smashes her glass of wine on Mardiola's back, but Mardiola responds by throwing the fish plate at Ilda, barely missing her. All of the housemates separate and hold them back. After this Jerry Springer Show scenario, Mardiola decides to walk off the show, while Ilda remains inside. Four hours later, Ilda is given the news that the staff has decided to expel her. The eviction is canceled and the SMS voting money is donated to charity. On the Saturday night show, the girls shake hands with each other and apologize to the public and housemates for this incident. The girls were spotted singing together in a karaoke bar that same week.
The Saturday show shakes things up by allowing Juna to enter for 15 minutes in the house. A surprised and happy Olsi receives her, while Najada is not impressed. Juna thanks Olsi for his rendition of her on the wall, and asks for Astrit to greet her out of the house. The two dance their way to the door as Juna's song "Away" plays on the background.
Days 57 - 64.
Just when Astrit thought his troubles with his rural background ended with Juna, Shkëlqim begins to crack new jokes about Astrit's facial features. The housemates considered it an immature gesture and concluded that Shkëlqim enjoys provoking new conflicts. Meanwhile, Olsi and Najada formalise their new relationship with a romantic date which Olsi cooked for and prepared. Julinda engaged in a heated debate with Olsi over her sloppiness in the kitchen. Olsi wanted her to clean up after herself since she uses it the most but Julinda defended herself by saying that everyone should clean equally.
On eviction night, Big Brother decides to let Shkëlqim meet his two children for a few minutes. However, his new ally Julinda is evicted, bringing his fight against Romina at a crucial turning point. Romina had survived a high amount of nominations all throughout these weeks and had made it her goal to kick Shkëlqim out before she is evicted. After all of his allies took the fall, it was now time for one of them to go.
Finally, Big Brother decides to spice things up even further by sending in two new girls to join the contest, Jonida and Dorina.
Days 64 - 71.
Shkëlqim and Romina enganged in a heated debate, both being self-conscious that one of them would take the fall on Saturday's eviction. The other nominee was Olsi, but he was considered too unlikely to leave. Romina accuses Shkëlqim of gossiping and playing unfairly while he simply brushed her off.
Romina won her fight with Shkëlqim on the Saturday show as Shkëlqim was evicted with 54% of the vote. Shkëlqim chose Astrit to greet him out to the door, telling him that despite the disagreements he really valued him, leaving Astrit in an emotional state.
Afterwards, Pol is surprised by Ina in the storage room. They cannot stop hugging and kissing, expressing a desire to continue their relationship outside. In the studio, Ilda said that her relationship with Pol was innocent and she is happy for the two of them.
Days 71 - 78.
With Shkëlqim out of the picture, Olsi thinks ahead at the next eviction with his two main targets being Romina and Dorina. Dorina has been irritating the housemates for the past week with her perfectionist attitude which Olsi and Najada were more than ready to exploit. She has also been telling the housemates that she would like to try out many sexual experiences like orgies, men from different racial backgrounds and even women. Najada and Jonida laughed it off, however an overly conservative Astrit considered it a decadence of youth and dismissed her as not normal. Olsi shows his disappointment with Romina and points out her flip-flopping personality, mentioning many episodes when she had acted contrary to what she had anticipated.
Saturday night shocks Romina as she receives the news of her eviction. It was one of the lowest percentages to evict, only 33%, confirming her strength with the public at home. However, a second elimination is ordered by Big Brother; this time around it would be by secret ballot and the public would have less than half an hour to vote off one of the three nominees. Besarta is evicted with 41% of the vote. Najada had been arguing for weeks that Besarta only made it this far thanks to her support from the dedicated Kosovo voters and believed she would go to the final, however this surprise eviction changed the course of events. "Bigu", the small dog that Big Brother had introduced a few weeks ago, was also taken away from the home so that it would not become too attached with any housemate in particular.
Days 78 - 85.
Following Romina's and Besarta's evictions, Dorina finds herself alienated by the other housemates. Jonida and Arbër have been heating up their conversations in what was perceived by the housemates as flirting.
The eviction show was especially tense for Olsi and Najada, as Najada was up for eviction along with Dorina. Olsi was especially nervous as the fate of his love story with Najada hung on the balance, however the public decided to evict Dorina with 43% of the vote.
Later in the show, Arbër receives news that his girlfriend was very upset by his behavior in the show and would only talk to him once he left the house. Arbër was surprised by this development and assured her that she was the most important person in his life, promising to clear things up.
Days 85 - 94.
Arbër grows worried at the news he received about his girlfriend, while the other housemates jokingly push him to forget about her and make Jonida his new girlfriend. Jonida for her part was entertaining the idea by challenging Arbër and telling him that if she wanted to, she could get a kiss from him. He tells her that's not possible, but Jonida managed to get a friendly kiss in the cheek. However, Saturday morning the host enters the house in black clothes to let the housemates know that the normal show had been canceled because the president of the network, Dritan Hoxha, had been killed in a car accident. The housemates were speechless and expressed their condolences to his family.
The eviction show was moved on Monday with a much more subdued mood. Jonida was eliminated with 74% of the vote. The housemates were informed that they were the finalists of Big Brother Albania. Meanwhile the Saturday show was moved to Sunday, to complete the mourning week for the network.
Days 94 - 100.
Najada prides herself for being the last female in the finale while she suspects that Arbër might be a strong contender for the big prize. The housemates are mostly calm in this final week and anxious for everything to end.
The final begins by the housemates watching a live feed of the studio and the people waiting for them outside. Pol and Najada are eliminated first but before they leave the house, Big Brother decides to surprise them both. Ina awaits Pol on an air balloon hanging over the yard of the home, throwing rose petals at him. Najada meets her two sisters in the confession room. There is one last surprise for her as she is sent back to the studio by chariot, just like she had wanted. Ranking 3rd was Astrit who becomes part of a funny debate in the studio, teasing the eliminated contestants that even a villager ranked higher than them. Later that night, Olsi gets a visit by his father in the storage room which had been transformed to match his own living room. On the other hand, Arbër is surprised with a performance by his favorite Albanian folk group as well as his little niece coming to greet him. Soon after, the voting is closed and Arbër is declared the winner of the first season of Big Brother Albania.
Reunion show.
The 18 housemates met one last time in a reunion show which led to many debates as well as prizes. Juna and Najada said that they would not want to be friends outside the house, with Juna being skeptical of Najada's and Olsi's relationship in the future. Mardiola blamed Shkëlqim and Julinda for fueling her fight with Ilda, while Romina expressed her disappointment at the housemates, especially at Olsi, for a joke they made her by hiding away her glasses. Besarta, Romina and Najada engaged in a debate over Besarta's authenticity. Najada continued to claim that Besarta advanced in the game thanks to biased voting, while Besarta rejected the claims and told the girls that everyone has something different to offer. Arbër on the other hand declared his commitment to donate all the prize money to a public awareness campaign about the environment as well as providing more opportunities for rural children.

Bray v Ford

Bray v Ford AC 44 is an English defamation law case, which also concerns some principles of conflict of interest relevant for trusts and company law.
Facts.
Mr Bray was a governor of Yorkshire College. Mr Ford was the vice-chairman of the governors and had also been working as a solicitor for the college. Bray sent him a letter, and circulated it to others, saying,
“Sir, during last summer, as you are aware, it came to my knowledge that whilst holding the fiduciary position of vice-chairman of the Yorkshire College you were illegally and improperly, as you know, making profit as its paid solicitor.”
This was libelous by the jury at trial. But Cave J had directed the jury that the College’s articles did in fact allow for pay of services as a solicitor. The jury awarded £600 damages, and the question was whether the award could stand in the face of the misdirection.
The Court of Appeal (Lord Esher MR, Lopes LJ and Rigby LJ) held this was a misdirection, but that it was libel anyway, the misdirection was unsubstantial and the jury would have decided the same.
Judgment.
The House of Lords, composed of Lord Halsbury LC, Lord Watson, Lord Herschell, Lord Shand unanimously reversed the Court of Appeal’s decision, on the basis that the decision of whether a libel existed was peculiarly within the jury’s power to decide, and the misdirection did constitute a ‘substantial wrong or miscarriage’ requiring a new trial. Lord Herschell's opinion went as follows..

Tom Wigley is a climate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). He was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) for his major contributions to climate and carbon cycle modeling and to climate data analysis, and because he is "one of the world's foremost experts on climate change and one of the most highly cited scientists in the discipline." Wigley has argued in the popular media that the IPCC has been too optimistic about the prospect of averting harmful climate change by reducing greenhouse emissions, and that "the human-induced changes that are expected over the next 100 years are much, much greater than any changes that societies experienced in the past." In 2013, with other leading experts, he was co-author of an open letter to policy makers, which stated that "continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Dunwich

Dunwich is a village and civil parish in the English county of Suffolk. It is located in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB around north-east of London, south of Southwold and north of Leiston on the North Sea coast.
In the Anglo-Saxon period, Dunwich was the capital of Kingdom of the East Angles but the harbour and most of the town have since disappeared due to coastal erosion. At its height it was an international port similar in size to 14th-century London. Its decline began in 1286 when a storm surge hit the East Anglian coast, and it was eventually reduced in size to the village it is today. Its population at the 2001 census was 84.
History.
Since the 15th century, Dunwich has frequently been identified with Dommoc – the original seat of the Anglo-Saxon bishops of the Kingdom of East Anglia established by Sigeberht of East Anglia for Saint Felix in c. 629–31. Dommoc was the seat of the bishops of Dommoc until around 870, when the East Anglian kingdom was taken over by the initially pagan Danes. Years later antiquarians would even describe Dunwich as being the "former capital of East Anglia". However, many historians now prefer to locate Dummoc at Walton Castle, which was the site of a Saxon shore fort.
The Domesday Book of 1086 describes it as possessing three churches. At this time it had an estimated population of 3000.
The loss of 'a busy port to ... 14th century storms that swept whole parishes into the sea' is a classic (dis-)urban myth. It appears that the port developed as a sheltered harbour where the Dunwich River entered the North Sea. Coastal processes including storms caused the river to shift its exit 4 km north to Walberswick, at the River Blyth. The town of Dunwich lost its raison d'etre and was largely abandoned. Sea defences were not maintained, and coastal erosion progressively invaded the town.
On 1 January 1286 a storm surge reached the east edge of the town and destroyed buildings in it. Before that, most recorded damage to Dunwich was loss of land and damage to the harbour.
This was followed by two further surges the next year, the South England flood of February 1287 and St. Lucia's flood in December. A fierce storm in 1328also swept away the entire village of Newton, a few miles up the coast. Another large storm in 1347 swept some 400 houses into the sea. The Grote Mandrenke around 16 January 1362 finally destroyed much of the remainder of the town.
Most of the buildings that were present in the 13th century have disappeared, including all eight churches, and Dunwich is now a small coastal "village", though retaining its status as a town. The remains of a 13th-century Franciscan priory (Greyfriars) and the leper hospital of St James can still be seen. A popular local legend says that, at certain tides, church bells can still be heard from beneath the waves.
By the mid-19th century, the population had dwindled to 237 inhabitants and Dunwich was described as a "decayed and disfranchised borough". A new church, St James, was built in 1832, after the last of the old churches, All Saints, which had been without a rector since 1755, was abandoned. All Saints' church fell into the sea between 1904 and 1919, the last major portion of the tower succumbing on 12 November 1919. In 2005 historian Stuart Bacon stated that recent low tides had shown that shipbuilding had previously occurred in the town.
As a legacy of its previous significance, the parliamentary constituency of Dunwich retained the right to send two members to Parliament until the Reform Act 1832 and was one of Britain's most notorious rotten boroughs.
Marine archaeology.
The Dunwich 2008 project funded by English Heritage and the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation was intended to collate all reliable historic mapped data on the same coordinate system and combine this with aerial photography and an underwater survey. New digital maps were produced by Prof. David Sear of Southampton University, marine archaeologist Stuart Bacon and the Geodata Institute. The survey also used multibeam and sidescan sonar to map the seafloor across the entire area of the town. These surveys identified a series of ruins which were confirmed by divers who recovered stones with lime mortar still attached. The lime mortar matched nearly perfectly with medieval mortar in existing churches on the coast. In 2009 Wessex Archaeology working with Professor Sear, captured the highest resolution sidescan images of the town site including the ruins found in 2008. Further work in 2010 with BBC Oceans and the BBC One Show used novel acoustic imaging cameras (DIDSON) to film the ruins through the turbid water. These clearly showed the jumble of ruined blocks and worked stone associated with medieval church and chapel sites. A large survey and updating of the mapped data was commissioned by English Heritage in 2011 and reported in 2012. This compiled all previous survey data and enhanced the historical map and coastal pilot charts for the site. The results have produced the most comprehensive survey of the Dunwich town site - the largest medieval underwater site in Europe. Data from these surveys including maps and images explaining the different technologies are displayed in Dunwich Museum which is accredited by the Museum Archives Libraries Council. Details of Dunwich's 800 year battle to protect against coastal erosion are also displayed in the museum and it is hoped more work will be done in future. A database of references to Dunwich "designed to aid academic researchers, family historians and students" is available online.
In June 2011, at the invitation of Prof David Sear and the Dunwich Town Trust the Anglo-Saxon and medieval archaeology of Dunwich was the subject of an episode of archaeological television programme "Time Team".
Further work to explore new sites using DIDSON and diver surveys and a campaign of land based archaeology is scheduled for 2013-15 funded by the "Touching the Tide" Heritage Lottery Fund Landscape Partnership Scheme. This work hopes to confirm the date of the town ditches and roads and explore the record of environmental change in the marsh sediments. Altogether this work has identified the ruins of St Peter's and St Nicholas's churches, a chapel most probably St Katherine's, and ruins associated with Blackfriars friary and the town hall. The location of the Knight's Templar church and All Saints' church are known from the digital mapping but remain buried beneath an inner sandbank. The early town is buried under 1-3m of sand to the east of the ruins found by Bacon and these later surveys.
RAF Dunwich.
During the Second World War RAF Dunwich was one of the Chain Home Low stations which provided low level radar cover for the central East Anglian coast.

<doc id="21350938" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350938" title="Absolute (philosophy)">
Absolute (philosophy)

The Absolute is the concept of an unconditional reality which transcends limited, conditional, everyday existence. It is sometimes used as an alternate term for "God" or "the Divine" especially, but by no means exclusively, by those who feel that the term "God" lends itself too easily to anthropomorphic presumptions. The concept of The Absolute may or may not (depending on one's specific doctrine) possess discrete will, intelligence, awareness, or a personal nature. It is sometimes conceived of as the source through which all being emanates. It contrasts with finite things, considered individually, and known collectively as the relative. This is reflected in its Latin origin "absolūtus" which means "loosened from" or "unattached."
Similarities and differences in various traditions.
Examples of religions and philosophies which embrace the concept of the Absolute in one form or another include Hermeticism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Islam, some forms of Jewish philosophy, and existential or metaphysical forms of Christianity. Terms which serve to identify The Absolute among such beliefs include Wu Chi, Brahman, Adibuddha, Allah, Para Brahman, Tetragrammaton, the Karmic Loom, God, the Divine, and numerous other appellations. In East Asia, the concept of the Tao, and in South Asia, the concept of Nirvana is synonymous in description to the attributes of the Absolute as used in the West.
The human vital essence - soul, spirit, spark of awareness, is said to have originally derived in each case from the Absolute and to be indestructible after the nature of the Absolute, and to be capable of returning to its source. This returning is the goal of those Eastern religions that have such a concept.
The general commonalities between the various versions of the Absolute are: infinity, indescribability, formlessness, transcendence and immanence. An additional commonality is that one must renounce and/or transcend physical existence and its distractions, in some cases even to the point of extinguishing identity and individual awareness, in order to understand or co-exist with the Absolute. Uniformly, human passions and vices are regarded as barriers to spiritual advancement, and such virtues as humility, charity and righteousness or pacifism are felt to help pave the way to enlightenment.
Thing in itself.
Roughly, the Absolute may be distinguished from the following concepts, although there is debate of the synonymity between them:
However, rather than distinguishing from the "relative", the "thing in itself" is used to distinguish an actual object from phenomenon (the appearance of things-in-themselves to the senses).
The Absolute in philosophy.
Heraclitus concerned himself with the knowable portion of the Absolute with his Logos. Plotinus, a Neo-Platonic philosopher, saw all forms of existence as emanating from 'The One'. The One of Plotinus is a trans-sentient power or force. The concept of the Absolute was re-introduced into philosophy by Hegel, Schelling, and their followers; it is associated with various forms of philosophical idealism. The Absolute, either under that name, or as the "Ground of Being", or some similar concept, also figures in several of the attempted proofs of the existence of God, particularly the ontological argument and the cosmological argument. In scholastic philosophy the Absolute was regarded as Pure Act, unadulterated with remaining potential.
The concept was adopted into neo-Hegelian British idealism (though without Hegel's complex logical and dialectical apparatus), where it received an almost mystical exposition at the hands of F.H. Bradley. Bradley (followed by others including Timothy L.S. Sprigge) conceived the Absolute as a single all-encompassing experience, rather along the lines of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta. Likewise, Josiah Royce in the United States conceived the Absolute as a unitary Knower Whose experience constitutes what we know as the "external" world.
The mathematician Georg Cantor equated the mathematical concept of the Absolute Infinite with God.
However, the concept need not be taken to imply a universal unitary consciousness. American philosopher Brand Blanshard, for example, conceived the Absolute as a single overarching intelligible system but declined to characterize it in terms of consciousness or experience.
In eastern philosophy the Absolute is known as "Parabrahman" and to occult philosophy is known as the Void or Ever-Darkness. According to I. K. Taimni both the Vedas and the Upanishads contain indirect hints to an Ultimate Reality an unknowable principle. Taimni describes the Parabrahman as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry. Taimni wrote that:
Criticism.
From a Buddhist perspective, there is no text in which the Buddha explicitly argues that the universe lacks an essence; he instead critiques positions regarding an ultimate nature of reality — such as those found in the Upanishads — in the manner of later Prasangikas. The Buddha of the early texts does speak of experiencing "luminous consciousness" beyond the six sense media. Passages in which the Buddha criticizes those who talk about things not amenable to experience are quite common in the early texts. 
Nagarjuna, one of the most prominent philosophers of Mahayana Buddhism, was considered by early scholarship as propounding an absolutist doctrine with his development of the Buddhist concept of shunyata. This is criticized by many modern scholars as incorrect and not grounded on textual evidence. The consensus is that Nagarjuna defended the classical Buddhist emphasis on phenomena. For him shunyata is explicitly used as a middle way between eternalism and nihilism, and that is where its soteriological power lies. It does not refer specifically to an ultimate, universal, or absolute nature of reality. Holding up emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth without reference to that which is empty is the last thing either the Buddha or Nagarjuna would advocate. Nagarjuna criticized those who conceptualized shunyata: "The Victorious Ones have announced that emptiness is the relinquishing of all views. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible." By contrast, many schools of Mahayana Buddhism, particularly those in alignment with the Tathagatagarbha scriptures, affirmed some notions regarding a positive absolute, identifying it with the true or original substance or Self of the Buddha.
Quotations.
Kant questioned whether the absolute can be thought.
Nietzsche criticized Hegel's claims about the non-relative Absolute.

Sotin is a village in eastern Croatia, located a few kilometers southeast of Vukovar by the Danube. It is administratively part of the city of Vukovar, and its population is 969 (census 2001). The post code for Sotin is 32232 Sotin.
During the Croatian War of Independence, 32 residents of Sotin were killed and another 32 are missing . A mass grave containing three bodies was discovered near the village through information obtained by Serbian authorities conducting a criminal inquest of war crimes—killing of 16 Croatian civilians in Sotin—committed by the Croatian Serb militia and Territorial Defense Forces in late 1991. In April 2013, the second mass grave was found in the village. It contained ten bodies transferred from the mass grave containing the three other bodies to a village slaughterhouse pit where animal bones were disposed of at the time. The move was made in 1997 in order to hide the bodies better. All thirteen, whose remains were found in the two graves, were killed on 26 December 1991. Two other mass graves were found previously, one at the Catholic graveyard in the village and the other in nearby vineyards.

French Guiana

French Guiana (pronounced or , ; ; officially just Guiana, ) is an overseas department and region of France, on the north Atlantic coast of South America. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km2, with half of its 250,109 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is by far the largest overseas region of France. As an overseas region, it is inside the European Union, and its official currency is the Euro.
The addition of the adjective "French" in English comes from colonial times when five such colonies existed (The Guianas), namely from west to east: Spanish Guiana (now Guayana Region in Venezuela), British Guiana (now Guyana), Dutch Guiana (now Suriname), French Guiana, and Portuguese Guiana (now Amapá, a state in far northern Brazil). French Guiana and the two larger countries to the north and west, Guyana and Suriname, are still often collectively referred to as the Guianas and comprise one large shield landmass.
A large part of the department's economy derives from the presence of the Guiana Space Centre, now the European Space Agency's primary launch site near the equator.
History.
French Guiana was originally inhabited by indigenous people. The French tried to create a colony there in the 18th century in conjunction with its settlement of some other Caribbean islands.
Bill Marshall wrote:
Its infamous "Île du Diable" (Devil's Island) was the site of a small prison facility, part of a larger penal system by the same name, which consisted of prisons on three islands and three larger prisons on the mainland, and which was operated from 1852 to 1953. In addition, in the late nineteenth century, France began requiring forced residencies by prisoners who survived their hard labor. A Portuguese-British naval squadron took French Guiana for the Portuguese Empire in 1809. It was returned to France with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1814. Though the region was handed back to France, a Portuguese presence remained until 1817.
A border dispute with Brazil arose in the late 19th century over a vast area of jungle leading to the short-lived pro-French independent state of Counani in the disputed territory. There was some fighting between settlers. The dispute was resolved largely in favor of Brazil by the arbitration of the Swiss government.
The territory of Inini consisted of most of the interior of French Guiana when it was created in 1930. It was abolished in 1946, when French Guiana as a whole became an overseas department of France. During the 1970s, following the French withdrawal from Vietnam in the 1950s, France helped resettle Hmong refugees from Laos to French Guiana.
In 1964, French president Charles de Gaulle decided to construct a space-travel base in French Guiana. It was intended to replace the Sahara base in Algeria and stimulate economic growth in French Guiana. The department was considered particularly suitable for the purpose because it is near the equator and has extensive access to the ocean as a buffer zone. The Guiana Space Centre, located a short distance along the coast from Kourou, has grown considerably since the initial launches of the "Véronique" rockets. It is now part of the European space industry and has had commercial success with such launches as the Ariane 4 and Ariane 5.
Geography.
French Guiana lies between latitudes 2° and 6° N, and longitudes 51° and 53° W. It consists of two main geographical regions: a coastal strip where the majority of the people live, and dense, near-inaccessible rainforest which gradually rises to the modest peaks of the Tumuc-Humac mountains along the Brazilian frontier. French Guiana's highest peak is Bellevue de l'Inini in Maripasoula (). Other mountains include Mont Machalou (), Pic Coudreau () and Mont St Marcel (), Mont Favard () and Montagne du Mahury ().
Several small islands are found off the coast, the three Îles du Salut (Islands of Salvation) which include Devil's Island, and the isolated Îles du Connétable bird sanctuary further along the coast towards Brazil.
The Petit-Saut Dam, a hydroelectric dam in the north of French Guiana forms an artificial lake and provides hydroelectricity. There are many rivers in French Guiana, including the Waki River.
As of 2007, the Amazonian forest, located in the most remote part of the department, is protected as the Guiana Amazonian Park, one of the nine national parks of France. The territory of the park covers some upon the communes of Camopi, Maripasoula, Papaïchton, Saint-Élie and Saül.
Administrative divisions.
French Guiana is divided into 2 arrondissements, 19 cantons (not shown here), and 22 communes:
Arrondissement ofSaint-Laurent-du-Maroni
Arrondissement ofCayenne
Environment.
French Guiana is home to many unique and important ecosystems: tropical rainforests, coastal mangroves, savannahs, inselbergs and many types of wetlands. French Guiana has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in terms of both flora and fauna. This is due to the presence of old-growth forests (i.e., ancient/primary forests), which are biodiversity hotspots. The rainforests of French Guiana provide shelter for many species during dry periods and terrestrial glaciation. These forests are protected by a national park (the Guiana Amazonian Park) and six additional nature reserves. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the European Union (EU) have recommended special efforts to protect these areas.
Following the Grenelle Environment Round Table of 2007, the Grenelle Law II was proposed in 2009, under law number 2010-788. Article 49 of the law proposed the creation of a single organization responsible for environmental conservation in French Guiana. Article 64 proposes a "departmental plan of mining orientation" for French Guiana, which would promote mining (specifically of gold) that is compatible with requirements for environmental protection. The coastal environment along the N1 has historically experienced the most changes, but development is occurring locally along the N2, and also in western French Guiana due to gold mining.
5,500 plant species have been recorded, including more than a thousand trees, along with 700 species of birds, 177 species of mammals, over 500 species of fish including 45% of which are endemic and 109 species of amphibians. The micro-organisms would be much more numerous, especially in the north, which competes with the Brazilian Amazon, Borneo and Sumatra. This single French department has at least 98% of vertebrate fauna and 96% of vascular plants as found in all of France and its overseas territories.
The threats to the ecosystem are habitat fragmentation by the roads, which remains very limited compared to other forests of South America, impacts of immediate and deferred of EDF, of gold mining, poor control of hunting and poaching facilitated by the creation of many tracks, and the appearance of all-terrain vehicles. Logging remains moderate due to the lack of roads, on both the difficulty of climate and terrain. An ordinance of 28 July 2005 extended the Forest Code at French Guiana, but with important exceptions and modifications. In an approach that will be sustainable, concessions or free transfers may be granted by local authorities or other entities for use by persons traditionally deriving their livelihood from the forest, but the means no longer always used traditional means, and the Guianese ecosystem being vulnerable, the impacts of logging or hunting may be important.
The beaches of the natural reserve of the Amana, the joint Awala-Yalimapo in the west, is an exceptional marine turtle nesting site. This is one of the largest worldwide for the leatherback turtle.
Agriculture.
French Guiana has some of the poorest soils in the world. The soil is low in nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, potassium) and organic matter. Soil acidity is another cause of the poor soils, and it requires farmers to add lime to their fields. All of these soil characteristics have led to the use of slash and burn agriculture. The resulting ashes elevate soil pH (i.e., lower soil acidity), and contribute minerals and other nutrients to the soil. Sites of Terra preta (anthropogenic soils) have been discovered in French Guiana, particularly near the border with Brazil. Research is being actively pursued in multiple fields to determine how these enriched soils were historically created, and how this can be done in modern times.
Economy.
As an integral part of France, French Guiana is part of the European Union and the Eurozone; its currency is the euro. .gf is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for French Guiana, but .fr is generally used instead.
In 2012, the GDP of French Guiana at market exchange rates was US$4.90 billion (€3.81 billion), ranking as the largest economy in the Guianas, and the 11th largest in South America.
French Guiana is heavily dependent on mainland France for subsidies, trade, and goods. The main traditional industries are fishing (accounting for 5% exports in 2012), gold mining (accounting for 32% of exports in 2012) and timber (accounting for 1% of exports in 2012). In addition, the Guiana Space Centre has played a significant role in the local economy since it was established in Kourou in 1964: it accounted directly and indirectly for 16% of French Guiana's GDP in 2002 (down from 26% in 1994, as the French Guianese economy is becoming increasingly diversified). The Guiana Space Centre employed 1,659 people in 2012.
There is very little manufacturing. Agriculture is largely undeveloped and is mainly confined to the area near the coast and along the Maroni River. Sugar and bananas were traditionally two of the main cash crops grown for export but have almost completely disappeared. Today they have been replaced by livestock raising (essentially beef cattle and pigs) in the coastal savannas between Cayenne and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, and market gardening (fruits an vegetables) developed by the Hmong communities settled in French Guiana in the 1970s, both destined to the local market. A thriving rice production, developed on polders near Mana from the early 1980s to the late 2000s, has almost completely disappeared since 2011 due to marine erosion and new EU plant health rules which forbid the use of many pesticides and fertilizers. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is growing. Unemployment is a major problem, running at about 20% to 25% year in, year out (22.3% in 2012).
In 2012, the GDP per capita of French Guiana at market exchange rates, not at PPP, was US$19,828 (€15,416), the highest in South America, but only 49% of metropolitan France's average GDP per capita that year, and 57.5% of the metropolitan French regions outside the Paris Region.
Demographics.
French Guiana's population of 250,109 (January 2013 est.), most of whom live along the coast, is very ethnically diverse. At the 2010 census, 56.8% of the inhabitants of French Guiana were born in French Guiana, 9.3% were born in Metropolitan France, 3.0% were born in the French Caribbean "départements" (Guadeloupe and Martinique), and 30.8% were born in foreign countries (primarily Suriname, Haiti, and Brazil).
Estimates of the percentages of French Guiana ethnic composition vary, a situation compounded by the large proportion of immigrants.
Creoles, or Mulattoes (people of mixed African and French ancestry), are the largest ethnic group, though estimates vary as to the exact percentage, depending upon whether the large Haitian community is included as well. Generally the Creole population is judged to be about 60 to 70% of the total population if Haitians (comprising roughly one-third of Creoles) are included, and 30 to 50% without.
Roughly 14% of the population is of European ancestry. The vast majority of these are of French heritage, though there are also people of Dutch, British, Spanish and Portuguese ancestry.
The main Asian communities are the Chinese (about 3-4%, primarily from Zhejiang province in mainland China and Hong Kong) and Hmong from Laos (1-2%). There are also smaller groups from various Caribbean islands, mainly Saint Lucia as well as Dominica. Other Asian groups include East Indians, Lebanese and Vietnamese.
The main groups living in the interior are the Maroons (formerly called "Bush Negroes") who are from African descent, and Amerindians. The Maroons, descendants of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the Maroni River. The main Maroon groups are the Saramaca, Aucan (both of whom also live in Suriname), and Boni (Aluku).
The main Amerindian groups (forming about 3%–4% of the population) are the Arawak, Carib, Emerillon, Galibi (now called the Kaliña), Palikur, Wayampi and Wayana. As of the late 1990s, there was evidence of an uncontacted group of Wayampi.
The dominant religion of French Guiana is Roman Catholicism; the Maroons and some Amerindian people maintain their own religions. The Hmong people are also mainly Catholic owing to the influence of missionaries who helped bring them to French Guiana.
Fertility.
The total fertility rate in French Guiana has remained high and is today considerably higher than in metropolitan France, and also higher than the average of the French overseas departments. It is largely responsible for the high population growth of French Guiana.
Languages.
The official language of French Guiana is French, and it is the predominant language of the department, spoken by most residents as a first or second language. In addition, a number of other local languages exist. Regional languages include French Guianese Creole, six Amerindian languages (Arawak, Palijur, Kali'na, Wayana, Wayampi, Emerillon), four Maroon dialects (Saramaka, Paramaccan, Aluku, Ndyuka), as well as Hmong Njua. Other languages spoken include Portuguese, Hakka, Haitian Creole, Spanish, Dutch and English.
Politics.
French Guiana, as part of France, is part of the European Union, the largest landmass for an area outside of Europe (since Greenland left the European Community in 1985), with one of the longest EU external boundaries. Along with the Spanish Autonomous Cities in Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, it is one of only three European Union territories outside Europe that is not an island. As an integral part of France, its head of state is the President of the French Republic, and its head of government is the Prime Minister of France. The French Government and its agencies have responsibility for a wide range of issues that are reserved to the national executive power, such as defense and external relations.
The President of France appoints a prefect (resident at the prefecture building in Cayenne) as his representative to head the local government of French Guiana. There are two local executive bodies: the 19‑member general council and the 34‑member regional council, both elected. They will soon be reunited into only one council, since they have authority on exactly the same territory.
French Guiana sends two deputies to the French National Assembly, one representing the commune (municipality) of Cayenne and the commune of Macouria, and the other representing the rest of French Guiana. This latter constituency is the largest in the French Republic by land area. French Guiana also sends two senators to the French Senate.
Politics in French Guiana are dominated by the Guianese Socialist Party.
A chronic issue affecting French Guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine gold prospectors from Brazil and Suriname. The border between the department and Suriname is formed by the Maroni River, which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the Gendarmerie and the French Foreign Legion to patrol. There have been several phases launched by the French government to combat illegal gold mining in French Guiana, beginning with Operation Anaconda beginning in 2003, followed by Operation Harpie in 2008, 2009 and Operation Harpie Reinforce in 2010. Colonel François Müller, the commander of French Guiana's gendarme, believes these operations have been successful. However, after each operation ends, Brazilian miners, , return.
Soon after Operation Harpie Reinforce began, an altercation took place between French authorities and Brazilian miners. On March 12, 2010, a team of French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which "the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317". Garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues. "The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber “flash balls” but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500 grammes of gold. “The violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grammes of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against illegal mining”, said Phillipe Duporge, the director of French Guiana’s border police, at a press conference the next day."
Transport.
French Guiana's main international airport is Cayenne – Félix Eboué Airport, located in the commune of Matoury, a southern suburb of Cayenne. There are two flights a day to Paris (Orly Airport), served by Air France and Air Caraïbes. The flight time from Cayenne to Paris is 8 hours and 25 minutes, and from Paris to Cayenne it is 9 hours and 10 minutes. There are also flights to Fort-de-France, Pointe-à-Pitre, Port-au-Prince, Miami and Belém.
French Guiana's main seaport is the port of Dégrad des Cannes, located on the estuary of the Mahury River, in the commune of Remire-Montjoly, a south-eastern suburb of Cayenne. Almost all of French Guiana's imports and exports pass through the port of Dégrad des Cannes. Built in 1969, it replaced the old harbour of Cayenne which was congested and could not cope with modern traffic.
An asphalted road from Régina to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock (a town by the Brazilian border) was opened in 2004, completing the road from Cayenne to the Brazilian border. It is now possible to drive on a fully paved road from Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni on the Surinamese border to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock on the Brazilian border.
Following a treaty between France and Brazil signed in July 2005, the Oyapock River Bridge over the Oyapock River (marking the border with Brazil) has been built and, as of April 2013, is due to open in December 2013. This bridge is the first land crossing ever opened between France and Brazil, and indeed between French Guiana and the rest of the world (there exists no other bridge crossing the Oyapock River, and no bridge crossing the Maroni River marking the border with Suriname – there is a ferry crossing to Albina, Suriname). When the bridge is opened, it will be possible to drive uninterrupted from Cayenne to Macapá, the capital of the state of Amapá in Brazil.
Military, police and security forces.
The commander of the French armed forces in French Guiana since July 2009 has been General Jean-Pierre Hestin. The military there is currently 1,900 strong, expected to increase enrollment in 2014–2015.
Among the military, police and security forces in French Guiana, are the following:
In popular culture.
The novel, "Papillon", by the French convict Henri Charrière, is set in French Guiana. It was first published in France in 1969, describing his escape from a penal colony there. Becoming an instant bestseller, it was translated into English from the original French by June P. Wilson and Walter B. Michaels for a 1970 edition, and by author Patrick O'Brian. Soon afterward the book was adapted for a Hollywood film of the same name.
Charrière stated that all events in the book are truthful and accurate, allowing for minor lapses in memory. Since its publication there has been controversy over its accuracy.

Hager Twins

The Hager Twins, also known as the Hager Brothers and The Hagers, were a duo of American country music singers and comedians who first gained fame on the TV series "Hee Haw". They were identical twin brothers Jim (died May 1, 2008) and Jon Hager (died January 9, 2009).
Biography.
The brothers were born August 30, 1941 in Chicago, Illinois and adopted by Jack and Frances Hager, a Methodist minister and a schoolteacher.
The Hager brothers first sang in the church choir. As teenagers, they sang on a Saturday morning WGN-TV series targeting others in their age group. Both brothers served in the United States Army and performed at Officers' Clubs and NCO Clubs in the United States and Europe.
They attended Maine Township High School in Park Ridge (Class of 1959), one year ahead of Harrison Ford and a few more years ahead of Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
After leaving the military, the Hager brothers moved to California and performed at the Ledbetter's Night Club in Los Angeles with The Carpenters, The New Christy Minstrels, John Denver, Steve Martin and Kenny Rogers. They also worked at Disneyland, which is where Buck Owens saw them perform and signed them to contracts. In addition to Owens, the brothers served as opening acts for Tex Ritter, Wynn Stewart, Billie Jo Spears and Lefty Frizzell.
They first came to national prominence on the CBS television series "Hee Haw", on which both were cast members from 1969 to 1986. They also charted Merle Haggard's "Silver Wings", which was an on the B-Side of Haggard's "Working Man Blues." In all, they recorded seven albums—three for Capitol, two for Elektra-Asylum,one for Barnaby Records, and one for Book Shop Records.
The brothers were featured in the second preview issue of "Playgirl", February, 1973.
Their TV appearances also include the original "The Bionic Woman", in which Jim and Jon played Verm and Dier, respectively, in the February 11, 1978, episode "Sanctuary Earth." The characters were cloned detectives. 
In 1976, the brothers starred, with Lillian Gish, as Tony and Shep Thomas in the TV-movie "Twin Detectives". They also appeared in TV commercials and with Florence Henderson in "Country Kitchen" on TNN. 
The Hager Brothers also contributed to numerous charities.
Jim Hager died of an apparent heart attack on May 1, 2008 in Nashville, Tennessee. Only eight months later, surviving twin, Jon Hager, died in his sleep on January 9, 2009, also in Nashville.

Oral contraceptive formulations

Oral contraceptives come in a variety of formulations. The main division is between combined oral contraceptive pills, containing both synthetic estrogens and progestogens (progestins), and progestogen only pills (mini-pills). Combined oral contraceptive pills also come in varying types, including varying doses of estrogen, and whether the dose of estrogen or progestogen changes from week to week.
How they work.
Combination pills usually work by preventing a person's ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation). They also thicken the cervical mucus, which keeps sperm from joining with an egg. The hormones in combination and progestogen-only pills also thin the lining of the uterus. This could prevent pregnancy by interfering with implantation of a blastocyst.
Main action in typical use is prevention of ovulation.
Combined oral contraceptive pills.
All contain an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol or mestranol (the inactive 3-methyl ether of ethinyl estradiol, which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinyl estradiol; 50 µg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35 µg of ethinyl estradiol and should not be used when high-dose ethinyl estradiol estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid), although in varying amounts, and one of a number of different progestogens. They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are monophasic (only one dose of estrogen and progestogen during the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle monophasic pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the withdrawal bleeding intervals can be decreased.
Monophasic.
These are typically given as 21 tablets of estrogen and progestogen, followed by seven tablets of placebo or an iron supplement, although some newer formulations contain more active tablets and fewer placebos. Everyday regimens (Microgynon 30 ED, Femodene ED, Logynon ED), which include seven inactive placebo pills, are rarely used in UK practice. Different formulations contain different amounts of estrogen and progestogen:
Progestogen-only pills.
Progestogen-only pills (POPs) use progestogen alone with doses taken continuously and no gap between packs taken. People who use them may experience irregular light bleeds on POPs, and whilst irregular in the first few months of taking, usually settles to a regular pattern in time.
The following progestogens are used:
Contraindications.
Oral contraceptives should not be used in women who currently have the following conditions:

Portrait of Agnolo Doni

The Portrait of Agnolo Doni is an oil painting by Italian Renaissance master Raphael, executed between 1506 and 1507. It is currently housed in the Pitti Palace in Florence.
Story.
The portrait is one of a pair that depict a recently married merchant and his wife.
Agnolo Doni married Maddalena Strozzi in 1503, but Raphael's portraits were probably executed in 1506, the period in which the painter studied the art of Leonardo da Vinci most closely. The composition of the portraits resembles that of the Mona Lisa: the figures are presented in the same way in respect to the picture plane, and their hands, like those of the Mona Lisa, are placed on top of one another. But the low horizon of the landscape background permits a careful assessment of the human figure by providing a uniform light which defines surfaces and volumes. This relationship between landscape and figure presents a clear contrast to the striking settings of Leonardo, which communicate the threatening presence of nature.
But the most notable characteristic that distinguishes these portraits from those of Leonardo is the overall sense of serenity which even the close attention to the materials of clothes and jewels (which draw one's attention to the couple's wealth) is unable to attenuate. Every element - even those of secondary importance - works together to create a precise balance.
These works, linked not only by the kinship of the subjects, but also by their evident stylistic homogeneity, mark the beginning of Raphael's artistic maturity.

Ignaz von Peczely (1826-1911) was a Hungarian physician, who is credited with the invention or re-invention of the pseudoscientific theory of iridology. Von Peczely first thought of iridology when caring for an owl with a broken leg. After noticing a spot in the owl's eye he hypothesized a link between the two and later tested this theory with other animals. Iridology is now widely rejected by evidence-based medicine and regarded as a pseudoscience.

Parker v McKenna (1874-75) LR 10 Ch App 96 is a UK company law case, concerning the rule against having any conflict of interest.
Facts.
Mr McKenna was one of four directors of the National Bank of Ireland, a joint stock bank. In 1864 resolutions were passed to increase the capital by issuing 20,000 £50 shares. They were to be offered to old shareholders first according to how many they already held, for a £25 premium and £5 as a first call. Any not bought would be sold by directors at a £30 premium. The directors allotted 9778 shares to a Mr Stock, who paid only £5 a share. It was arranged that the certificates would be withheld, the bank had a lien on the shares for the premiums and no transfer could be made till £30 was paid up. He then said he could not take so many and asked the directors to relieve him. They took many at £30 a share, and then sold them on at a profit. The £30 per share was always paid to the bank.
Judgment.
Lord Cairns LC, Sir WM James LJ and Sir G Mellish LJ held that the directors had to account for all profits made through the sale of the shares.
James LJ made this famous statement.

Rivers Casino (Pittsburgh)

The Rivers Casino (originally going to be named the Majestic Star Casino) is a casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. It is owned by Holdings Acquisition Co. L.P., a joint venture of Walton Street Capital LLC and High Pitt Gaming LP. Located in Pittsburgh's Chateau neighborhood along the Ohio River and adjacent to the Carnegie Science Center, it had its groundbreaking in December 2007 and opened on August 9, 2009. The casino was originally to be built by Don H. Barden, but financial troubles forced him to sell 75% of his interest in the casino to Holdings Acquisition Co on July 16, 2008. The casino has 3,000 slot machines.
History.
Application process.
The "Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act" authorized the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to issue up to 17 casino licenses, with at least 1 casino license reserved for the City of Pittsburgh. Four organizations entered the proposal process to win the Pittsburgh casino license: North Shore Gaming, LP, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., Station Square Gaming, LP, and PITG Gaming, LLC. 
Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and other local officials favored a proposal from the Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., which proposed to give the Pittsburgh Penguins $290 million to build a new arena. In a "Plan B" negotiated by local political leaders, both the Majestic Star and Forest City agreed to pay $7.5 million a year for 30 years toward the construction of the new hockey arena.
The Station Square proposal was backed by major casino players, including Harrah's Entertainment and Forest City Enterprises. In 2005, then-Mayor Tom Murphy controversially said during a press luncheon that "the fix is in" for Forest City's proposal. The proposed plan suffered from questions about increases in traffic in the already-developed Station Square location.
The proposal from PITG Gaming, LLC, a holding company owned by Don Barden's The Majestic Star Casino, LLC, was awarded one of five available "Category 2" slots licenses by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board on December 20, 2006. Barden's proposal was generally considered a "long-shot" for much of the application process because, unlike the competition, it lacked a large rewards program for gamblers and did not offer to pay for a replacement for the aging Mellon Arena. Local community groups expressed concern over its proposed North Side location, home to PNC Park and Heinz Field and the increase in traffic congestion. 
Barden and PITG Gaming, LLC, were awarded the casino license in December 2006. Several lawsuits were filed by the losing applicants challenging the Gaming Board's decision, but they were not successful. Early construction delays were blamed on the suits.
Construction.
Ground was broken on the casino's North Shore in December 2007. In July 2008, Barden defaulted on a $200 million bridge loan and failed to pay contractors, halting construction.On July 16, 2008 he sold 75% of his interest to Holdings Acquisition Co, a joint venture of Walton Street Capital LLC and High Pitt Gaming LP and led by Neil Bluhm. The ownership changes were approved by the Gaming Board on August 14, 2008 and construction on the casino restarted. In November 2008, the new owners changed the casino's name to "Rivers Casino" to reflect its location near the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers.
Grand Opening.
The Rivers Casino opened as scheduled at noon on August 9, 2009.
Taxes.
The Rivers Casino is reported to be worth $199.5 million to Allegheny County at least for taxing purposes. That's the assessed value the county has placed on the North Shore riverfront venue for the 2010 tax year. The value was calculated based on construction costs of the casino and surrounding parcels. The $199.5 million assessed value is the largest on any commercial property in Allegheny County and the largest on any casino in Pennsylvania. (According to Allegheny County real estate records, 600 Grant St. 15219 (the tallest building in Pittsburgh), is valued at $175 Million). Barring an appeal, it will produce $935,655 in property tax revenue for the county, $2.77 million for city schools, and $2.15 million for the city. The casino, the school district and the city all have the right to appeal the value if they so choose.
Dining & Entertainment.
Rivers Casino has four restaurants: Grand View Buffet, Ciao, West End Cafe, and Andrew's Steak & Seafood. It also has four bars: Spiral Bar, Drum Bar, Levels, and Wheelhouse. In the fall of 2009, the casino opened a coat room, open till 6pm Sunday though Thursday and until 2 am closing time on Fridays and Saturdays. The casino also has a night club and a 1,000 seat outdoor amphitheater.
Rewards Club.
Rivers Casino offers a rewards club, the Rush Rewards Players Club. It has various rewards based on play level. Some rewards include: free slot play, free monthly gifts, and free/discounted food offers.
Table Games.
Table games opened to the general public in July 2010
As table games have succeeded financially, management officials announced plans in January 2011 to add several additional table game: by Spring 2011 Rivers Casino will have a total of 107 games. The Casino is also in the process of adding a $2 million ballroom in a massive corner space on the second floor, with views of the riverfront and Downtown skyline. It is expected to be ready by late summer 2011
Banned Players.
Rivers Casino abides by Pennsylvania State Law that allows any patron of the casino to put themselves on a "Do Not Play" list. If a patron on the list enters the casino, they can be prosecuted for trespassing.

Chajoma

The Chajoma were a Kaqchikel-speaking Maya people of the Late Postclassic period, with a large kingdom in the highlands of Guatemala. According to the indigenous chronicles of the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel, there were three principal Postclassic highland kingdoms; the K'iche', the Kaqchikel and the Chajoma. In the Annals of the Cakchiquels the Chajoma of Jilotepeque were always referred to as the "akajal vinak", in the Popul Vuh these can probably be identified with the "akul vinak". Both "akajal vinak" and "akul vinak" mean "the bee people" or "the hive people".
"Chajoma" means "people of ocote" (a type of pine). In colonial times this was rendered into Nahuatl as "sacatepēc" "Grass mountain" which led to its current Hispanicized name "Sacatepéquez". Early records, for example, record the placename San Juan Sacatepéquez as San Juan Chajoma. The Chajoma separated into six divisions, equivalent to the various colonial villages bearing Sacatepéquez in the name.
Extent and population.
The political geography of the Chajoma is described in some detail in a small group of early colonial documents composed by the Chajoma leadership. At its greatest extent, the Chajoma kingdom covered an area of 900–1000 km². It was bounded on the north by the Motagua River, on the east with the Las Vacas River, by San Pedro Ayampuc in the southeast, the River Chalcayá on the southwest and the River Quisayá to the west. Their neighbour to the south was the Poqomam kingdom, with its capital at Chinautla Viejo (Old Chinautla, identified as the Mixco Viejo of Colonial period records). To the west they were bordered by the Kaqchikel kingdom based at Iximche. This territory includes the northern third of the department of Guatemala and includes both the cooler highland area to the south and the hotter lowlands of the Motagua Valley to the north. The latter is a challenging area for agriculture, with the poor soil of the steep-sided lowland river valleys consisting of semi-weathered metamorphic schistose. The best land for agriculture lies in the southern highland portion of the Chajoma territory, with settlement concentrating there from the Classic Period onwards.
The Chajoma had their capital at the archaeological site currently known as Mixco Viejo (Old Mixco), apparently known to the Chajoma by a variety of names, including "Chuapec Kekacajol Nima Abaj", "Zakicajol" and "Nimcakajpec". Apart from Mixco Viejo, the principal archaeological sites associated with the Late Postclassic Chajoma kingdom are El Horno, Las Vegas, El Ciprés, Pueblo Viejo Jilotepeque, Chuisac, La Merced, Chuabaj, Chiboló and possibly Sacul. Of these, only El Horno, El Ciprés, Las Vegas and Sacul can be considered major settlements. Other sites, such as Pistun, La Canoa and Cerrito de las Minas, appear to have been remote outposts in strategically important locations or lookout points monitoring access routes.
Population estimates based on the number of archaeological sites put the Postclassic population of the Chajoma kingdom at 15-20,000 people divided between 15-20 clans. Evidence from Colonial documents suggest that 14 clans (or "chinamit" in Kaqchikel) survived into post-Conquest times, with 10 divided between San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Juan Sacatepéquez and 4 in San Martín Jilotepeque. However, these were probably the most important "chinamit" clans, with survivors of smaller subservient "chinamit" groups being absorbed into the larger clans. An estimate based on archaeological sites with monumental architecture place 1 "chinamit" each at El Ciprés and Sacul, 4 at Las Vegas, 2–3 at El Horno and 5 at the archaeological site of Mixco Viejo; plus a possible 2 at Cucul and 1 at Pachalum on the north back of the Motagua, if these were Chajoma sites. This would give a total of 13–16 clans, which is roughly equivalent to the number comprising the other two major highland kingdoms, the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel.
Known rulers.
"All dates are approximate."
History.
Origins.
Indigenous documents describe how the ancestors of the Chajoma, Kaqchikel and K'iche' arrived at a mythical place called Tulan, and then left after a time and wandered until they eventually settled in the Guatemalan highlands.
Recent archaeological research suggests that the ancestors of the Chajoma and other K'iche'an peoples, including also the K'iche', the Kaqchikel and the Tz'utujil, were already occupying the Guatemalan highlands in the Classic Period.
A brief history of Chajoma movements and their rulers is contained in an early Colonial document entitled the "Título de los de San Martín Jilotepeque", written in 1555. This same document has been used to prove that the Mixco Viejo archaeological site was actually the Chajoma capital and not that of the Poqomam, as previously believed.
The Postclassic Period.
The Chajoma claimed not to have been settled long in the lands where the Conquistadors found them in 1524, rather they had originated in the area around Zacualpa and Joyabaj, north of the Motagua River. From Zacualpa they began a movement towards the south, southeast and southwest around AD 1400. Investigations at the Zacualpa archaeological site have shown that it was occupied from the Classic through to the Early Postclassic but was abandoned by the Late Postclassic. The Chajoma migration appears to have been well organised and rapid, and they quickly established sites to defend the borders of their new territory, being placed in defensible locations that had previously been identified after extensive scouting over a large area.
The Chajoma apparently intermarried with the Xpantzay clan of the main branch of the Kaqchikel when these occupied the site of Ochal, identified with the archaeological site of Chuisac, located 2 km west of San Martín Jilotepeque. According to the "Testamento de los Xpantzay", the Chajoma supplied the Xpantzay with wives from their aristocratic class, an arrangement that appears to have been established as far back as the Early Postclassic.
By around 1410, according to the "Anales de los Cakchiqueles", Ochal had become a Chajoma town. It appears that, provoked by the aggressive expansion of the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj, the Chajoma abandoned their old capital of Zacualpa when Ochal was vacated by the Xpantzay, who claimed to have left Ochal in order to serve the K'iche' king Q'uq'umatz together with other Kaqchikel groups. In the 15th century Ochal (known to the Chajoma as "Och'al Kab'awil Siwan") became the new Chajoma capital. Around 1425, the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj seized the largely abandoned former Chajoma capital at Zacualpa.
Rule of Lajuj No'j.
A powerful 15th century Chajoma lord was known by the name Ichalkan Chi Kumkwat in Nahuatl and Lajuj No'j in Kaqchikel. Around 1450, with Kaqchikel help, he put down a rebellion by vassals along the Motagua river. As a result of the rebellion, this lord left his capital at "Och'al Kab'awil Siwan" (Pan Och'al in San Martín Jilotepeque) and moved it to "Saqik'ajol Kaqapek" (Jilotepeque Viejo, the archaeological site known as Mixco Viejo). The Chajoma alliance with the Kaqchikel became more powerful until the Kaqchikels turned on Lajuj No'j and his Chajoma and completely defeated them.
The Chajoma were involved in wars with their neighbours the K'iche', the Kaqchiquel and the Poqomam. In the late 15th century when Lajuj No'j was the Chajoma king, the Kaqchikel conquered several Chajoma villages on behalf of their K'iche' overlords, pushing the border between the two kingdoms eastwards. Lajuj No'j was murdered with much of his entourage at Iximche, the Kaqchikel capital, around 1480. In the "Annals of the Cakchiquels", the Kaqchikel record that they attacked the "Akajal" (Chajoma) settlements of Panah and Chiholom, conquering the former. After these battles and prior to the Spanish Conquest the Chajoma probably made tribute payments to the Kaqchiquel of Iximche but were not completely subject to them. Even after the Conquest, the western boundary between the Chajoma and the Kaqchikel of Iximché remained a source of dispute, even down to modern times.
In 1493 the lords of Iximche judged in favour of the Chajoma in a land dispute between these and the Tukuche clan of the Kaqchikels, this caused the Tukuche to rebel against their rulers and resulted in their expulsion from Iximche.
Shortly before the Spanish Conquest, the Chajoma under their lord Achi Q'alel rebelled against the Kaqchikels of Iximche. Just before the Conquest, the Chajoma occupied the area of the modern municipalities of San Martín Jilotepeque, Santo Domingo Xenacoj, San Pedro Sacatepéquez, San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Raimundo, Chuarrancho, San Pedro Ayampuc and the northern portion of Chinautla, an area that coincides with the Eastern Kaqchikel dialect area.
Spanish Conquest.
There are no direct sources describing the conquest of the Chajoma by the Spanish but it appears to have been a drawn-out campaign rather than a rapid victory. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in the 17th century, long after the event. After the Conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatepéquez, including some of the inhabitants of the site now known as Mixco Viejo. The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Martín Jilotepeque.
The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez and San Pedro Sacatepéquez.
In the colonial period, most of the surviving Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque as a result of the Spanish policy of "congregaciones", with the people being moved to whichever of these three towns was closest to their pre-Conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns with them. After their relocation to the new towns, some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-Conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.
Archaeological sites.
La Canoa.
La Canoa lies to the east of San Pedro Ayampuc, a short distance from the road to Petaca. It consists of a small hill that has been artificially flattened and that once probably supported a small number of houses built from perishable materials. The site has been severely damaged.
Cerrito de las Minas.
Cerrito de las Minas was a small outpost situated in the northeastern extremity of the Chajoma kingdom, apparently to control the route to and from Baja Verapaz to the north. A modern road follows the course of a colonial road that was probably also an important route in the Late Preclassic. The site consists of a single small pyramid measuring sat on top of a steep sided cone of volcanic ash, with some small house terraces extending some of the way down the side. A dozen house platforms are situated on a promontory immediately to the north but the group has not been investigated and it is likely that it is the remains of a post-Conquest settlement due to its open layout and absence of pyramids or a ballcourt.
Chuabaj.
Chuabaj is located north of San Martín Jilotepeque. It was a large site although the architecture has been destroyed.
Chuisac (Ochal).
Group D at Chuisac appears to have had a Late Postclassic occupation, which probably corresponds to the temporary occupation of the site by the Chajoma before they moved their capital to the archaeological site of Mixco Viejo.
El Ciprés.
El Ciprés was first reported in 1941 by Edwin M. Shook, who named it Cimientos. The location of the site was lost by the 1970s and rediscovered in 1991. The site possesses a well-preserved I-shaped ballcourt. In common with other Postclassic sites, it is defensively situated on a plateau surrounded by deep ravines. Most of the structures of the site are small but possess fine flagstone masonry. The two larger structures are the ballcourt and a long structure on the east side of the site.
El Horno.
El Horno is a major site in the eastern Chajoma region. It is situated near the eastern border of San Pedro Ayampuc with San José del Golfo. The structures of the site are divided into three easily defended groups, although they lie below the ridgelines of the surrounding hills, on promontories half way up a ravine near the village of Petaca, above the bottom of the ravine.
Group I is the largest group at the site. It contains an unfinished and heavily looted I-shaped ballcourt.
Group II is linked to Group I by a narrow neck of land. The group is dominated by two badly damaged and looted pyramids built of flagstone and also possesses a number of house platforms.
Group III is situated on a separate promontory to Groups I and II, some to the west. Like Group II it possesses two pyramids with flagstone masonry, and has 5 or more house platforms. Ceramic fragments recovered from Group III are of a type typical of the Late Postclassic and especially common at the Mixco Viejo archaeological site.
Pistun.
Pistun is a small site that has in the past been considered larger than is actually the case due to natural hillocks being mistaken for the remains of artificial structures. Only two structures have been confirmed; a small altar platform with flagstone masonry and a long narrow structure. The site is situated defensively on a hill on the east side of Cerro El Apazote overlooking the Aguacate River. Projectile points were found scattered near the eastern entrance to the site and suggest that a battle took place there, which may have resulted in its abandonment.
Pueblo Viejo.
Pueblo Viejo is located about northwest of San Martín Jilotepeque. Only one structure is currently known at the site, located defensively on a promontory surrounded by deep ravines and may have served as an outpost.
Sacul.
This site was discovered by Earle who reported Classic Period surface ceramic finds. However, it is defensively situated on an plateau bordered by a stream, typical of Postclassic sites. By the mid-1990s, Sacul had neither been investigated archaeologically nor looted. On the other side of the ravine to the northwest of Sacul are the sites of El Tesoro and Chirioj, both dating to the Late Classic.
Las Vegas.
This site was first reported in 1988 by Duncan M Earle and named Chillani after a nearby modern settlement. It lies within the municipality of Chinautla, near the village of San Antonio de las Flores. The site has since been renamed to Las Vegas, after the name of the estate on which it lies. Archaeologist Robert M. Hill II carried out a preliminary exploration of the site in 1991. The site consists of 26 structures divided into four groups, labelled groups I through to IV, built on top of an easily-defensible high ridge between the ravines Quebrada Quezada and Quebrada San Pedro. Each of the four groups contains at least one pyramid and a number of house platforms. All the structures are poorly preserved although Hill reported that only one had been looted in 1996. Surviving masonry consists of cut blocks of tuff or pumice, and of flagstone. A violent end to occupation at the site is suggested by the presence of large quantities of burnt mud daub, and may be linked to the Spanish Conquest. Las Vegas was located only a few kilometers north of the Poqomam capital at Chinautla Viejo.
Group I Evidence of violence was found in this group in the form of burnt mud daub, although not to the same extent as in Group III.
Group II has an unusual structure to the north, which is probably all that survives of the badly eroded remains of a ballcourt. As with Group I, evidence of violence was found in Group II in the form of burnt mud daub, again to a lesser extent than in Group III.
Group III Large amounts of burnt mud daub were found among the most eastern structures of this group and may be linked to the Spanish Conquest.
Group IV Earle reported a wide variety of Late Postclassic ceramic sherds from Group IV. The westernmost structure in this group has been looted.

Military Police of Paraná State

The Military Police are reserve and ancillary forces of the Brazilian Army, and part of the System of Public Security and Brazilian Social Protection. Its members are called Military's States.
The primary mission of PMPR is the ostensible and preventive policing for the maintenance of public order in the State of Paraná.
History.
The Military Police of Paraná was created as a unit of Skirmishers on August 10, 1854, under the name of the Police Force, like a military company.
This origin is due to military necessity of the Empire of Brazil in reinforcing the troops of the Army in emergency situations.
With the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil has adopted a Constitution based on the United States where the states have a large autonomy. With that the police have become small regional armies.
The history of PMPR shows an honorable participation in the events that marked Brazilian national life at that time.
This dangerous situation for the national unity remained until the end of the World War II, with the deposition of the dictatorial government of Getúlio Vargas.
It was only from 1946 that the military police who have purchased the configuration now, a kind of gendarmerie which is subject to the States.
Organization.
The PMPR is operationally organized into battalions, companies, and platoons; and administratively, in departments.
The battalions are based in major urban centers, and their companies and platoons are distributed according to population density in cities.
The Military Police of Paraná is present in all cities of the State.
Firefighters Corps.
The Corps of Firefighters of Paraná was created in 1912.
The Corporation is militarized like the Paris Fire Brigade (France), and is subject to the structure of PMPR. One groupment is equivalent to a battalion, and a subgroupment is equivalent to a company. The groupments and subgroupments are based in major urban centers. In the smaller towns, fire fighting is carried out by small detachment of volunteer firefighters.
Uniforms.
From 1854 until the early years of the Republic, the PMPR used the dark blue in their uniforms. In 1912 was adopted the khaki color, which by tradition is still in use today. The firefighters wear the same uniforms of the Military Police, just adding their badges and insignias.
Ranks.
The PMPR has the same hierarchical classification of the Brazilian Army, with another type of insignias.

Monogamy

Monogamy () is a form of relationship in which an individual has only one partner during their lifetime or at any one time (serial monogamy), as compared to polygamy or polyamory. The term is also applied to the social behavior of some animals, referring to the state of having only one mate at any one time.
It is important to have a clear understanding of the nomenclature of monogamy because scientists use the term monogamy for different male-female relationships. Biologists, biological anthropologists, and behavioral ecologists often use the term monogamy in the sense of sexual, if not genetic, monogamy. Modern biological researchers using the theory of evolution approach human monogamy as the same in human and non-human animal species. They postulate the following four aspects of monogamy:
When cultural or social anthropologists and other social scientists use the term monogamy, the meaning is social or marital monogamy. Marital monogamy may be further distinguished between:
Human monogamy's legal aspects are taught at faculties of law. There are also philosophical aspects in the field of interest of e.g. philosophical anthropology and philosophy of religion, as well as theological ones.
Etymology.
The word "monogamy" comes from the Greek words "μονός", "monos" which means one or alone, and "γάμος", "gamos" which means marriage.
Incidence of monogamy in humans.
Incidence of social monogamy.
According to the Ethnographic Atlas, of 1,231 societies from around the world noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry. However, this does not take into account the relative population of each of the societies studied, and the actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage.
Many societies that we consider monogamous in fact allow easy divorce. In many western countries divorce rates approach 50%. Those who remarry do so on average 3 times. Divorce and remarriage can thus result in "serial monogamy", i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the Caribbean, Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners. In all these account for 16 to 24% of the "monogamous" category.
Incidence of sexual monogamy.
The incidence of sexual monogamy can be roughly estimated as the percentage of married people who do not engage in extramarital sex. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample describes the amount of extramarital sex by men and women in over 50 pre-industrial cultures.
The amount of extramarital sex by men is described as "universal" in 6 cultures, "moderate" in 29 cultures, "occasional" in 6 cultures, and "uncommon" in 10 cultures. The amount of extramarital sex by women is described as "universal" in 6 cultures, "moderate" in 23 cultures, "occasional" in 9 cultures, and "uncommon" in 15 cultures. These findings support the claim that the amount of extramarital sex differs across cultures and across genders.
Recent surveys conducted in non-Western nations have also found cultural and gender differences in extramarital sex. A study of sexual behavior in Thailand, Tanzania and Côte d'Ivoire suggests about 16–34% of men engage in extramarital sex while a much smaller (unreported) percentage of women engage in extramarital sex.
Studies in Nigeria have found around 47–53% of men and to 18–36% of women engage in extramarital sex.
A 1999 survey of married and cohabiting couples in Zimbabwe reports that 38% of men and 13% of women engaged in extra-couple sexual relationships within the last 12 months.
The issue of extramarital sex has been examined frequently in the United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. A convenience sample means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect the population of the United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.
The only way to get scientifically reliable estimates of extramarital sex is to use nationally representative samples. Three studies have used nationally representative samples. These studies have found that about 10–15% of women and 20–25% of men engage in extramarital sex.
In the U.S., some studies have found that the majority of gay male couples are not monogamous. Research by Colleen Hoffon of 566 gay male couples from the San Francisco Bay Area found that only 45% had monogamous relationships. That study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. However, the Human Rights Campaign has stated, based on a Rockway Institute report, that "GLBT young people... want to spend their adult life in a long-term relationship raising children." Specifically, over 80% of the lesbians and homosexuals surveyed expected to be in a monogamous relationship after age 30.
A majority of married people remain sexually monogamous during their marriages. The number of married partners who engage in extramarital sex never exceeds 50% in studies using large or nationally representative samples. Yet, the incidence of sexual monogamy varies across cultures. People in some cultures are more sexually monogamous than people in other cultures. 
Incidence of genetic monogamy.
The incidence of genetic monogamy may be estimated from rates of extrapair paternity. Extrapair paternity is when offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with another male. Rates of extrapair paternity have not been extensively studied in people. Many reports of extrapair paternity are little more than quotes based on hearsay, anecdotes, and unpublished findings.
Simmons, Firman, Rhodes, and Peters reviewed 11 published studies of extra-pair paternity from various locations in the United States, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and among the Yanomamo Indians of South America.
The rates of extrapair paternity ranged from 0.03% to 11.8% although most of the locations had low percentages of extrapair paternity. The median rate of extrapair paternity was 1.8%. A separate review of 17 studies by Bellis, Hughes, Hughes, and Ashton found slightly higher rates of extrapair paternity.
The rates varied from 0.8% to 30% in these studies, with a median rate of 3.7% extrapair paternity. A range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy. Although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or social environments, a large percentage of couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships. A review paper surveying 67 other studies of nonpaternity reporting rates of nonpaternity in different societies ranging from 0.4% to over 50% was recently published by Kermyt G. Anderson.
Pedigree errors are a well-known source of error in medical studies. When attempts are made to try to study medical afflictions and their genetic components, it becomes very important to understand nonpaternity rates and pedigree errors. There are numerous software packages and procedures that exist for correcting research data for pedigree errors.
The evolutionary and historical development of monogamy in humanity: nature vs. nurture.
Biological arguments.
Monogamy, or at least social monogamy, does exist in many societies around the world, and it is important to understand how these marriage systems might have evolved. In any species, there are three main aspects that combine to promote a monogamous mating system: paternal care, resource access, and mate-choice; however, in humans, the main theoretical sources of monogamy are paternal care and extreme ecological stresses. Paternal care should be particularly important in humans due to the extra nutritional requirement of having larger brains and the lengthier developmental period. Therefore, the evolution of monogamy could be a reflection of this increased need for bi-parental care. Similarly, monogamy should evolve in areas of ecological stress because male reproductive success should be higher if their resources are focused on ensuring offspring survival rather than searching for other mates. However, the evidence does not support these claims. Due to the extreme sociality and increased intelligence of humans, "H. sapiens" have solved many problems that generally lead to monogamy, such as those mentioned above. For example, monogamy is certainly correlated with paternal care, as shown by Marlowe, but not caused by it because humans diminish the need for bi-parental care through the aid of siblings and other family members in rearing the offspring. Furthermore, human intelligence and material culture allows for better adaptation to different and rougher ecological areas, thus reducing the causation and even correlation of monogamous marriage and extreme climates.
Paleoanthropology and genetic studies offer two perspectives on when monogamy evolved in the human species: paleoanthropologists offer tentative evidence that monogamy may have evolved very early in human history whereas genetic studies show that monogamy evolved much more recently, less than 10 to 20,000 years ago.
Paleoanthropological estimates of the time frame for the evolution of monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism. According to Reno et al., the sexual dimorphism of "Australopithecus afarensis", a human ancestor from approximately 3.9–3.0 million years ago, was within the modern human range, based on dental and postcranial morphology. Although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids, the authors do say that reduced levels of sexual dimorphism in "A. afarensis" “do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny”. However, Gordon, Green and Richmond claim that in examining postcranial remains, "A. afarensis" is more sexually dimorphic than modern humans and chimps with levels closer to those of orangutans and gorillas. Furthermore, "Homo habilis", living approximately 2.3 mya, is the most sexually dimorphic early hominid. Plavcan and van Schaik conclude their examination of this controversy by stating that, overall, sexual dimorphism in australopithecines is not indicative of any behavioral implications or mating systems.
The genetic evidence for the evolution of monogamy in humans is more complex but much more straightforward. While female effective population size (the number of individuals successfully producing offspring thus contributing to the gene pool), as indicated by mitochondrial-DNA evidence, increased around the time of human (not hominid) expansion out of Africa about 80,000–100,000 years ago, male effective population size, as indicated by Y-chromosome evidence, did not increase until the advent of agriculture 18,000 years ago. This means that before 18 000 years ago, many females would be reproducing with the same few males.
Scientists discuss the evolution of monogamy in humans as if it is the prevailing mating strategy among "Homo sapiens", although only approximately 17.8% (100) of 563 societies sampled in Murdock’s "Atlas of World Cultures" has any form of monogamy. These societies with monogamy account for much larger than 17.8% of the World population. Therefore, “genetic monogamy appears to be extremely rare in humans,” and “social monogamy is not common, ... often reduc to serial polygyny in a biological sense”. This means that monogamy is not the predominant mating system among the hominid lineage and probably never was.
Cultural arguments.
Despite the human ability to avoid sexual and genetic monogamy, social monogamy still forms under many different conditions, but most of those conditions are consequences of cultural processes. These cultural processes may have nothing to do with relative reproductive success. For example, Anthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated that monogamy is part of a cultural complex found in the broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland that practice social monogamy, sexual monogamy and dowry (i.e."diverging devolution", that allow property to be inherited by children of both sexes). Goody demonstrates a statistical correlation between this cultural complex and the development of intensive plough agriculture in those areas. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture. In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work and is associated with private property; marriage tends to be monogamous to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family (endogamy) are the preferred marriage partners to keep property within the group. A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, and more recently in Africa and the Americas. A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society, the belief in "high gods" to support human morality, and monogamy. A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact.
Betzig postulated that culture/society can also be a source of social monogamy by enforcing it through rules and laws set by third-party actors, usually in order to protect the wealth or power of the elite. For example, Augustus Caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs, but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous, legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations. Similarly—according to Betzig—the Christian Church enforced monogamy because wealth passed to the closest living, legitimate male relative, often resulting in the wealthy oldest brother being without a male heir. Thus, the wealth and power of the family would pass to the “celibate” younger brother of the church. In both of these instances, the rule-making elite used cultural processes to ensure greater reproductive fitness for themselves and their offspring, leading to a larger genetic influence in future generations. Furthermore, the laws of the Christian Church, in particular, were important in the evolution of social monogamy in humans. They allowed, even encouraged, poor men to marry and produce offspring which reduced the gap in reproductive success between the rich and poor, thus resulting in the quick spread of monogamous marriage systems in the western world. According to B. S. Low, culture would appear to have a much larger impact on monogamy in humans than the biological forces that are important for non-human animals.
Other theorists use cultural factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy. During times of major economic / demographic transitions, investing more in a fewer offspring (social monogamy not polygyny) increases reproductive success by ensuring the offspring themselves have enough initial wealth to be successful. This is seen in both England and Sweden during the industrial revolution and is currently being seen in the modernization of rural Ethiopia. Similarly, in modern industrialized societies, fewer yet better-invested offspring, i.e. social monogamy, can provide a reproductive advantage over social polygyny, but this still allows for serial monogamy and extra-pair copulations.
Arguments from outside the scientific community.
Karol Wojtyła (Pope John Paul) in his book Love and Responsibility postulated that monogamy, as an institutional union of two people being in love with one another, was an embodiment of an ethical "personalistic norm", and thus the only means of making true human love possible.
Monogamy in ancient societies.
The historical record offers contradictory evidence on the development and extent of monogamy as a social practice. Laura Betzig argues that in the six large, highly stratified early states, commoners were generally monogamous but that elites practiced de facto polygyny. Those states included Mesopotamia, Egypt, Aztec Mexico, Inca Peru, India and China.
Ancient Mesopotamia and Assyria.
Both the Babylonian and Assyrian families were monogamous in principle but not entirely so in practice since polygyny was frequently practiced by the rulers.
In the patriarchal society of Mesopotamia the nuclear family was called a "house". In order "to build a house" a man was supposed to marry one woman and if she did not provide him with offspring, he could take a second wife. The Code of Hammurabi states that he loses his right to do so if the wife herself gives him a slave as concubine. According to Old Assyrian texts, he could be obliged to wait for two or three years before he was allowed to take another wife. The position of the second wife was that of a "slave girl" in respect to the first wife, as many marriage contracts explicitly state.
Ancient Egypt.
Although an Egyptian man was free to marry several women at a time, and some wealthy men from Old and Middle Kingdoms did have more than one wife, monogamy was the norm. There may have been some exceptions e.g. a Nineteenth Dynasty official stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth, even after he had become very successful (P. Leiden I 371). This may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife. Egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, "officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife. "His wife X, his beloved"' is the standard phrase identifying wives in tomb inscriptions". The instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature, e.g. Instruction of Ptahhotep or Instruction of Any, support fidelity to monogamous marriage life, calling the wife a "Lady of the house". The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness.
Ancient Israel.
As against Betzig's contention that monogamy evolved as a result of Christian socio-economic influence in the West, monogamy appeared widespread in the ancient Middle East much earlier. In Israel's pre-Christian era, an essentially monogamous ethos underlay the Jewish creation story (Gn 2) and the last chapter of Proverbs. During the Second Temple period (530 BCE to70 CE), apart from an economic situation which supported monogamy even more than in earlier period, the concept of "mutual fidelity" between husband and wife was a quite common reason for strictly monogamous marriages. Some marriage documents explicitly expressed a desire for the marriage to remain monogamous. Examples of these documents were found in Elephantine. They resemble those found in neighbouring Assyria and Babylonia. Study shows that ancient Middle East societies, though not strictly monogamous, were practically (at least on commoners' level) monogamous. Halakha of the Dead Sea Sect saw prohibition of polygamy as coming from the Pentateuch (Damascus Document 4:20–5:5, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls). Christianity adopted a similar attitude (cf. 1 Tm 3:2,12; Tt 1:6), which conformed with Jesus' approach.
Under Judges and the monarchy, old restrictions went into disuse, especially among royalty, though the Books of Samuel and Kings, which cover entire period of monarchy, do not record a single case of bigamy among commoners — except for Samuel's father. The wisdom books e.g. Book of Wisdom, which provides a picture of the society, Sirach, Proverbs, Qohelet portray a woman in a strictly monogamous family (cf. Pr 5:15-19; Qo 9:9; Si 26:1-4 and eulogy of perfect wife, Proverbs 31:10-31). The Book of Tobias speaks solely of monogamous marriages. Also prophets have in front of their eyes monogamous marriage as an image of the relationship of God and Israel. (Cf. Ho 2:4f; Jer 2:2; Is 50:1; 54:6-7; 62:4-5; Ez 16). Roland de Vaux states that "it is clear that the most common form of marriage in Israel was monogamy".
The Mishnah and the "baraitot" clearly reflect a monogamist viewpoint within Judaism (Yevamot 2:10 etc.). Some sages condemned marriage to two wives even for the purpose of procreation (Ketubot 62b). R. Ammi, a Palestinian "amora" states:
Whoever takes a second wife in addition to his first one shall divorce the first and pay her "kettubah" (Yevamot 65a)
Roman customs, which prohibited polygamy, may have enhanced such an attitude - especially after 212 AD, when all the Jews became Roman citizens. However, some Jews continued to practice bigamy (e.g. up to medieval times in Egypt and Europe). Fourth-century Roman law forbade Jews to contract plural marriages.
A synod convened by Gershom ben Judah around 1000 C.E. banned polygamy among Ashkenazi Jews.
Ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
The ancient Greeks and Romans were monogamous in the sense that men were not allowed to have more than one wife or to cohabit with concubines during marriage.
Early Christianity.
Jesus of Nazareth contended that core problem was faithfulness to the Torah. According to him, monogamy was a primordial will of the Creator described in Genesis, darkened by the "hardness of hearts" of the Israelites. As John Paul II interpreted the dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees (Gospel of Matthew 19:3–8), Christ emphasized the primordial beauty of monogamic spousal love described in the Book of Genesis 1:26–31, 2:4–25, whereby a man and woman by their nature are each ready to be a beautifying, total and personal gift to one another:
Jesus avoids entangling himself in juridical or casuistic controversies; instead, he applies twice to the "beginning". By doing so, he clearly refers to the relevant words of Genesis, which his interlocutors also know by heart. (...) it clearly leads the interlocutors to reflect about the way in which, in the mystery of creation, man was formed precisely as "male and female," in order to understand correctly the normative meaning of the words of Genesis.
Varieties of monogamy in biology.
Recent discoveries have led biologists to talk about the three varieties of monogamy: social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy. The distinction between these three are important to the modern understanding of monogamy.
Monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with partners other than their primary mate. This is called extra-pair copulation.
Sometimes these extra-pair sexual activities lead to offspring. Genetic tests frequently show that some of the offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with an extra-pair male partner. These discoveries have led biologists to adopt new ways of talking about monogamy:
"Social monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy equals monogamous marriage. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively." (Reichard, 2003, page 4)
Whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.
When applying these terms to people, it's important to remember that social monogamy does not always involve marriage. A married couple is almost always a socially monogamous couple. But couples who choose to cohabit without getting married can also be socially monogamous. The popular science author Matt Ridley in his book The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, described the human mating system as "monogamy plagued by adultery".
Serial monogamy.
Serial monogamy is a mating practice in which individuals may engage in sequential monogamous pairings, or in terms of humans, when men or women can marry another partner but only after ceasing to be married to the previous partner.
One theory is that this pattern pacifies the elite men and equalizes reproductive success. This is called the Male Compromise Theory. Such serial monogamy may effectively resemble polygyny in its reproductive consequences because some men are able to utilize more than one woman’s reproductive lifespan through repeated marriages.
Serial monogamy may also refer to sequential sexual relationships, irrespective of marital status. A pair of humans may remain sexually exclusive, or monogamous, until the relationship has ended and then each may go on to form a new exclusive pairing with a different partner. This serial monogamy pattern is very common among people dating in Western cultures.
Reproductive success.
Evolutionary theory predicts that males would be apt to seek more mating partners than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from such a strategy. Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies that allow them to acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners. Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one female’s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because the men have a longer reproductive window.
Breakup.
Serial monogamy has always been closely linked to divorce practices. Whenever procedures for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy, serial monogamy has been found. As divorce has continued to become more accessible, more individuals have availed themselves of it, and many go on to remarry. Barry Schwartz, author of "The Paradox of Choice: Why less is more", further suggests that Western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice. It has been suggested, however, that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce, enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus serial monogamy.
Mating system.
Monogamy is one of several mating systems observed in animals. However, a pair of animals may be socially monogamous but that does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.
Social monogamy refers to the overtly observed living arrangement whereby a male and female share territory and engage in behaviour indicative of a social pair, but does not imply any particular sexual fidelity or reproductive pattern. The extent to which social monogamy is observed in animals varies across taxa, with over 90 percent of avian species being socially monogamous, compared to only 3 percent of mammalian species and up to 15 percent of primate species. Social monogamy has also been observed in reptiles, fish, and insects.
Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. However, scientific analyses can test for paternity, for example by DNA paternity testing or by fluorescent pigment powder tracing of females to track physical contact. This type of analysis can uncover reproductively successful sexual pairings or physical contact. Genetic monogamy refers to DNA analyses confirming that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other.
The incidence of sexual monogamy appears quite rare in other parts of the animal kingdom. It is becoming clear that even animals that are overtly socially monogamous engage in extra-pair copulations. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, "on average, 30 percent or more of the baby birds in any nest sired by someone other than the resident male." Patricia Adair Gowaty has estimated that, out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds, only 10% are sexually monogamous. Offspring are far more successful when both the male and the female members of the social pair contribute food resources.
An example of this was seen when scientists studied red winged blackbirds. These birds are known for remaining in monogamous relationships during the course of mating season. During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved like they do every season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity. These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers.
The highest known frequency of reproductively successful extra-pair copulations are found among fairywrens
Malurus splendens and Malurus cyaneus where more than 65 percent of chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding pair. This discordantly low level of genetic monogamy has been a surprise to biologists and zoologists, as social monogamy can no longer be assumed to determine how genes are distributed in a species.
Elacatinus, also widely known as neon gobies, also exhibit social monogamy. Hetereosexual pairs of fish belonging to the genus Elacatinus remain closely associated during both reproductive and non-reproductive periods, and often reside in same cleaning station to serve client fish.
Evolution in animals.
Socially monogamous species are scattered throughout the animal kingdom: A few insects, a few fish, about nine-tenths of birds, and a few mammals are socially monogamous. There is even a parasitic worm, "Schistosoma mansoni", that in its female-male pairings in the human body is monogamous. The diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species.
The low occurrence of social monogamy in placental mammals has been claimed to be related to the presence or absence of estrus—or oestrus—the duration of sexual receptivity of a female. This, however, doesn't explain "why" estrus females generally mate with any proximate male nor any correlation between sexual and social monogamy. Birds, which are notable for a high incidence of social monogamy, do not have estrus.
Researchers have observed a mixed mating system of monogamy and polygyny in the European pied flycatcher.
Psychology of monogamy.
Psychological studies of social monogamy have relied heavily on observations of married couples. These studies focus on relationship satisfaction, duration and attachment.

Daniele Vantaggiato

Daniele Vantaggiato (born 10 October 1984) is an Italian footballer who currently suspended for 3 years since summer 2012.
Career.
Vantaggiato started his career at A.S. Bari. He was sold to Crotone in joint-ownership bid, where he won Serie B promotion. Vantaggiato returned to Bari in summer 2005. He was the regular of the squad before left for Pescara, who was then struggling to keep from relegation to Serie C1. In summer 2007, he left for Rimini for another joint-ownership bid, replacing Davide Moscardelli, after not appeared on the pre-season medical test for Bari. After Jeda left for Cagliari in January 2008, Vantaggiato became the team leading scorer. At the end of season Rimini won the blind bidding to have the full ownership.
Parma.
But in January 2009, his 13 goals scored in mid-season made Parma F.C. signed him (€1.9M) along with team-mate Francesco Lunardini (€1M) in co-ownership deal, in exchange for Davide Matteini (50% for €1M) and Daniele Paponi on loan. Parma won promotion back to Serie A as 2008–09 Serie B runner-up.
Vantaggiato was not featured in Parma's first three matches of 2009–10 Serie A, as the club signed new players. On 31 August 2009 he was loaned to Torino in exchange for Blerim Džemaili.
Padova.
In January 2010, Vantaggiato was sold to Calcio Padova in another co-ownership deal (Parma also paid Rimini €1.9M). Vantaggiato's 50% registration rights was valued €2.5 million, while Pietro Baccolo joined Parma for €1.5 million also in co-ownership deal. In June 2011 both Parma and Padova gave up the remain 50% registration rights to opposite club.
Vantaggiato then loaned to Serie A club Bologna F.C. 1909 in July 2011 with option to purchase. Vantaggiato signed a 1+2 year contract with the first year worth €842,165 in gross. Vantaggiato only played twice in October 2011.
Italian football scandal.
In April 2012 Vantaggiato was questioned by the prosecutor. In June 2012 he was banned for 3 years for involvement in 2011–12 Italian football scandal.
