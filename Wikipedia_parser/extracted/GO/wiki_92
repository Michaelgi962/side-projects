South Africa at the 2012 Summer Olympics

South Africa competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's eighteenth participation overall and the sixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-apartheid era. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) sent a total of 125 athletes to the Games, 67 men and 58 women, to compete in 17 sports. Field hockey and women's football were the only team-based sports in which South Africa had its representation in these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in archery, BMX cycling, judo, shooting, and weightlifting.
Notable South African athletes featured track stars Oscar Pistorius and Caster Semenya, who both became the nation's greatest highlight to the Games. Pistorius, a four-time Paralympic champion, set South Africa's historical record as the first double-leg amputee to compete at the Olympics. Semenya, a middle-distance runner and a world champion who had been subjected to gender testing in 2009, became the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. The South African team also featured past Olympic medalists, including swimmer Roland Mark Schoeman, who won a full set of medals in Athens, and long jumper Godfrey Khotso Mokoena, who took silver in Beijing.
After suffering a major setback from Beijing, South Africa recaptured its success in London with a total of six Olympic medals (three gold, two silver, and one bronze). Among the nation's medalists were swimmers Cameron van der Burgh and Chad le Clos, who both won gold and silver medals in their events. Van der Burgh broke both an Olympic record and a world record in men's breaststroke swimming. Meanwhile, le Clos surpassed the defending champion Michael Phelps to claim the title in one of the men's butterfly events. For the first time in its history, South Africa had won Olympic medals in rowing and in sprint canoeing.

Ohio State Route 345

State Route 345 (SR 345) is a north–south state highway in the eastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The southern terminus of SR 345 is at a signalized intersection with the SR 13/SR 37 concurrency in New Lexington. Its northern terminus is at a T-intersection with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in the unincorporated community of East Fultonham.
Route description.
SR 345 traverses the northeastern quadrant of Perry County and the southwestern corner of Muskingum County. This state route is not included as a component of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a system of highways identified as most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.
History.
The SR 345 designation was assigned in 1935. It was originally routed along its present alignment from its southern terminus in New Lexington to its northeastern junction with SR 669, and then along the current routing of SR 669 from that point southeasterly into Crooksville. 
Two years later, SR 345 was re-routed from the point that currently marks its northeastern junction with SR 669 onto a new alignment along a previously un-numbered roadway to the point that marks its current northern terminus at US 22 in East Fultonham.

Dancing Backward in High Heels

Dancing Backward in High Heels is the fifth studio album by the New York Dolls. It was released on March 15, 2011, on 429 Records. Dancing Backward in High Heels can best be described as a departure from the New York Dolls hard rock, punk, sound and a return to the girl group, 1960's rock invasion genre that both David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain have claimed to love. With the only song featuring the trade-mark attitude of the Dolls, "Dancing Backwards in High Heels" focused on power-pop, doo-wop, and the style of the 1960s. Funky But Chic is a re-recording of a song from David Johansen's first solo record. It's technically a Doll's song as it was written and performed by the band during shows, but never officially recorded by them.
The album was produced by Jason Hill.

Theodore M. Brantley

Theodore M. Brantley (or Brantly) (February 12, 1851 – September 16, 1922) was the longest-serving Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, serving for 23 years (1899–1922).
Brantley was born near Lebanon, Tennessee. He came from a political family in Tennessee—two of his mother's brothers were elected governor of Tennessee (Neill S. Brown in 1847, John C. Brown in 1871).
Brantley was educated at Southwestern Presbyterian University in Clarksville, Tennessee and the law school of Cumberland University in Lebanon, graduating in 1881. After practicing law for several years, Brantly became a professor of Ancient Languages, first at Illinois College and then at the College of Montana in Deer Lodge. After returning to the practice of law for several years, Brantley was elected District Judge in the 3rd Judicial District of Montana in 1892 and then Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court in the November 1898 elections. He remained Chief Justice until resigning for reasons of health shortly before his death in 1922, in Helena, Montana.
Brantley's brother Erskine Brantly (1850–1936) was a prominent clergyman and school official in Oklahoma. (The rest of the family seems to have preferred the spelling "Brantly", without the "e". Many period sources, however, spell Theodore Brantley's name with the added "e".)
Brantley was married in 1891 to Lois Reat and had 3 children - Theodore Lee, Lois Brown, and Neill Duncan Brantly. (Note that his children seem to have reverted to the "Brantly" spelling.) Neill Duncan Brantly (1897–1972) joined the navy and became a Rear Admiral during World War II, commanding vessels at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Lois Brown Brantly (1894–1972) married Francis A. Hazelbaker, who was lieutenant governor of Montana 1929–1933.

Dino D-Day

Dino D-Day is a multiplayer team-based first-person action video game developed by 800 North and Digital Ranch and published by Valve Corporation. It was released as a digital download, via Steam, on April 8, 2011. The game is developed as a total conversion modification on the Valve Corporation's proprietary Source engine.
The premise of the game is that during World War II, Adolf Hitler found a way to resurrect dinosaurs for use in the war effort. Players can battle online choosing to serve either the Allied nations or the Nazis. The game has been described as a new twist on "the overdone World War II FPS ... that has become a running joke in the industry and gaming press".
Gameplay.
"Dino D-Day" is a first-person shooter where players join one of two teams of other players as they attempt to complete their goal. Players have the choice between the Allied nations or the Axis powers, the latter represented by the Nazis and their dinosaur soldiers. Upon the game's initial release, both the Allies and the Axis had six different classes of soldier. The Allied classes range from assault troops, medics and heavy support. However, the Axis have three human and three dinosaur classes. The human classes comprise assault troops, snipers and medics; while the dinosaurs comprise an attack Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus and a Desmatosuchus with a cannon mounted on its back. Additional classes were added to both teams at later dates bringing the total to seven classes for the Allies and nine for the Axis. The Allies gained a dinosaur class of their own; a protoceratops with a mounted machine gun. The Axis gained a Stygimoloch with a mounted gun, a Compsognathus that acts as a kamikaze bomber with a grenade and a flying Microraptor. In certain maps, an Axis player can also be chosen at random to play as a Tyrannosaurus with a jaw-mounted machine gun. While powerful, the class counts as three kills in a team death match.
The initial release consisted of five maps and three game modes that included: team deathmatch, where players must reach a set number of killed enemy players; king of the hill, where teams fight for control of a section of a map; and objective mode, where players are given specific goals to capture including a Fortress Objective where one Axis player takes control of a styracosaurus with a Panzer IV turret mounted on its back and with his team must make it to their objective point while the allies must stop it with explosives.
Development.
The developers have announced that they will add more maps, game modes, increase the number of playable characters and even add a single player mode through free updates.
Reception.
Upon release, Dino-Day met with mixed to average reviews. The game's controls and graphics were universally singled out as being disappointing and problematic, with the website IGN describing it as "a class-based quagmire." However, despite complaints regarding balance and playability, the art direction and alternate history setting were praised. Some also noted the game's sense of humour as positive.

<doc id="31216882" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31216882" title="Insulin signal transduction pathway and regulation of blood glucose">
Insulin signal transduction pathway and regulation of blood glucose

The insulin transduction pathway is an important biochemical pathway beginning at the cellular level affecting homeostasis. This pathway is also influenced by fed versus fasting states, stress levels, and a variety of other hormones.
When carbohydrates are consumed, digested, and absorbed the pancreas senses the subsequent rise in blood glucose concentration and releases insulin to promote an uptake of glucose from the blood stream. When insulin binds on the cellular insulin receptor, it leads to a cascade of cellular processes that promote the usage or, in some cases, the storage of glucose in the cell. The effects of insulin vary depending on the tissue involved, e.g., insulin is most important in the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue.
This insulin signal transduction pathway is composed of trigger mechanisms (e.g., autophosphorylation mechanisms) that serve as signals throughout the cell. There is also a counter mechanism in the body to stop the secretion of insulin beyond a certain limit. Namely, those counter-regulatory mechanisms are glucagon and epinephrine. The process of the regulation of blood glucose (also known as glucose homeostasis) also exhibits oscillatory behavior.
On a pathological basis, this topic is crucial to understanding certain disorders in the body such as Diabetes (Type 1,2,3), Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia.
Insulin signal transduction pathway.
The functioning of a signal transduction pathway is based on extra-cellular signaling that in turn creates a response which causes other subsequent responses, hence creating a chain reaction, or cascade. During the course of signaling, the cell uses each response for accomplishing some kind of a purpose along the way. Insulin secretion mechanism is a common example of Signal transduction pathway mechanism.
Insulin is produced by the pancreas in a region called Islets of Langerhans. In the islets of Langerhans, there are beta-cells, which are responsible for production of insulin. Insulin is secreted as a response mechanism for counteracting the increasing excess amounts of glucose in the blood.
Glucose in the body increases after food consumption. This is primarily due to carbohydrate intake, but to much lesser degree protein intake (Depending on the tissue type, the glucose enters the cell through facilitated or passive diffusion. In muscle and adipose tissue, glucose enters through GLUT 4 receptors via facilitated diffusion ([http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/299/2/E169.long). In brain, kidney and retina, glucose enters passively. In the beta-cells of the pancreas, glucose enters through the GLUT 2 receptors (process described below). 
Two aspects of this process are explained below: insulin secretion and insulin action on the cell.
Insulin secretion.
The glucose that goes in the bloodstream after food consumption also enters the beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. The glucose passively diffuses in the beta cell through a GLUT-2 vesicle. Inside the beta cell, the following process occurs:
Glucose gets converted to Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P) through Glucokinase; and G6P is subsequently oxidized to form ATP. This process inhibits the ATP sensitive potassium ion channels of the cell causing the Potassium ion channel to close and not function anymore. The closure of the Potassium channels causes Depolarization of the cell membrane causing the cell membrane to stretch which causes the voltage-gated Calcium channel on the membrane to open causing an influx of Ca2+ ions.
This influx then stimulates fusion of the insulin vesicles (bubble like structure with insulin in them) to the cell membrane and secretion of insulin in the extracellular fluid outside the beta cell; thus making it enter the bloodstream. Illustrated in Figure 1.1.1.
Insulin action on the cell.
After insulin enters the bloodstream, it is taken up by the cells, as glucose is the preferential fuel for human bodies. However, insulin does not directly go inside the cell in its original form. To activate the effects of insulin, it has to bind to an enzyme that activates its functions. Thus, the insulin binds to the α (alpha) subunit of the insulin receptor embedded in the cell membrane. The α-subunit acts as the insulin receptor and the insulin molecule acts as a ligand in an receptor-ligand complex.
This triggers the Tyrosine Kinase activity in the β-subunit that is attached to the α-subunit. The Tyrosine Kinase activity causes Phosphorylation (activation) of the enzymes.
The 2 enzymes, Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP-Kinase) and Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI-3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) are responsible for expressing the Mitogenic and Metabolic actions of Insulin respectively.
The activation of MAP-Kinase leads to completion of mitogenic functions like cell growth and gene expression.
The activation of PI-3K leads to crucial metabolic functions such as synthesis of lipids, proteins and glycogen. It also leads to cell survival and cell proliferation. Most importantly, the PI-3K pathway is responsible for the distribution of glucose for important cell functions. The GLUT-4 vesicle (responsible for passive diffusion of glucose in cell) binds to the PI-3K after bringing glucose in the cell. The PI-3K isolates the GLUT-4 Vesicle from the glucose and sends the vesicle back to the cell membrane. The glucose that is isolated is then sent to the Mitochondria to make ATP and excess glucose is stored in the cell as Glycogen. process is also illustrated in Figure 1.1.2.
Thus, insulin’s role is more of a promoter for the usage of glucose in the cells rather than neutralizing or counteracting it.
Feedback mechanism.
Signal transduction is a mechanism in which the cell responds to a signal from the environment by activating several proteins and enzymes that will give a response to the signal.
Feedback mechanism might involve negative feedback and positive feedback. In the negative feedback, the pathway is inhibited and the final result of the pathway is reduced or limited. In positive feedback, the transduction pathway is promoted and stimulated to produce more products.
Positive feedback.
Insulin secretion results in positive feedback in different ways. Firstly, insulin increases the uptake of glucose from blood by the translocation and exocytosis of GLUT4 storage vesicles in the muscle and fat cells. Secondly, it promotes the conversion of glucose into triglyceride in the liver, fat, and muscle cells. Finally, the cell will increase the rate of glycolysis within itself to break glucose in the cell into other components for tissue growth purposes.
An example of positive feedback mechanism in the insulin transduction pathway is the activation of some enzymes that inhibit other enzymes from slowing or stopping the insulin transduction pathway which results in improved intake of the glucose.
One of these pathways, involves the PI(3)K enzyme (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase). This pathway is responsible for activating glycogen, lipid-protein synthesis, and specific gene expression of some proteins which will help in the intake of glucose.
Different enzymes control this pathway. Some of these enzymes constrict the pathway causing a negative feedback like the GSK-3 pathway. Other enzymes will push the pathway forward causing a positive feedback like the AKT and P70 enzymes.
When insulin binds to its receptor, it activates the glycogen synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes that slow down the PI(3)K pathway such as PKA enzyme. At the same time, it will promote the function of the enzymes that provide a positive feedback for the pathway like the AKT and P70 enzymes. The inactivation of the enzymes that stops the reaction and activating of enzymes that provide a positive feedback will increase glycogen, lipid & protein syntheses and therefore promoting the intake for glucose.
Negative feedback.
When Insulin binds to the cell's receptor, it will result in negative feedback by limiting or stopping some other actions in the cell. It inhibits the release and production of glucose from the cells which is an important part in reducing the glucose blood level. Insulin will also inhibit the breakdown of glycogen into glucose by inhibiting the expression of the enzymes that catalyzes the degradation of Glycogen.
An example of negative feedback is slowing or stopping the intake of glucose after the pathway was activated. Negative feedback is shown in the insulin signal transduction pathway by constricting the phosphorylation of the insulin-stimulated tyrosine. The enzyme that deactivates or phosphorylates the insulin-stimulated tyrosine is called tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). When activated, this enzyme provides a negative feedback by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptors. The dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor slows the intake of the glucose from the blood by not allowing the other proteins in the insulin transduction pathway to be activated and consequently not do their job of transferring the signal to the other proteins in the pathway.
Trigger mechanism.
Insulin is secreted in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. Before secretion, insulin is synthesized. Once insulin is synthesized, the beta cells are ready to release it in two different phases. As for the first phase, insulin release is triggered rapidly when the blood glucose level is increased.
The second phase is a slow release of newly formed vesicles that are triggered regardless of the sugar level.
Glucose enters the beta cells and goes through glycolysis to form ATP that eventually cause depolarization of the beta cell membrane (as explained in Insulin secretion section of this article). The depolarization process causes voltage controlled calcium channels (Ca2+) opening and allowing the calcium to flow into the cells. An increased calcium level causes activation of phospholipase C, which cleaves the membrane phospholipid phosphtidyl inositol 4 into inositol 1 and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) binds to receptor proteins in the membrane of endplasmic reticulum (ER). This allows the release of (Ca2+) from the ER via IP3 gated channels, and raises the cell concentration of calcium even more. The influx of Ca2+ ions push the Insulin molecules (that are inside their "bubble" surrounding) outside of the cell.
Therefore, the process of insulin secretion is an example of a trigger mechanism in a signal transduction pathway because insulin is secreted after glucose enters the beta cell and that triggers several other processes in a chain reaction.
Counter mechanism.
Function of glucagon.
While insulin is secreted by the pancreas to lower blood glucose levels, glucagon is secreted to raise blood glucose levels. This is why glucagon has been known for decades as a counter-regulatory hormone. When blood glucose levels are low, the pancreas secretes glucagon, which in turn causes the liver to convert stored glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, releasing glucose into the blood. This process is called glycogenolysis. Liver cells, or hepatocytes, have glucagon receptors which allow for glucagon to attach to them and thus stimulate glycogenolysis. Contrary to insulin, which is produced by pancreatic β-cells, glucagon is produced by pancreatic α-cells. It is also known that an increase in insulin suppresses glucagon secretion, and a decrease in insulin, along with low glucose levels, stimulates the secretion of glucagon. So, this proves that insulin is a β-cell product that reciprocally regulates the α-cell glucagon secretion.
Oscillatory behavior.
When blood-glucose levels are too low, the pancreas is signaled to release glucagon, which is essentially the opposite of insulin and therefore creates glucose in the body. Glucagon is delivered directly to the liver, where it connects to the glucagon receptors on the membranes of the liver cells, which allows the liver to convert the glycogen already stored there into glucose. This process is called glycogenolysis.
Conversely, when the blood-glucose levels are too high, the pancreas is signaled to release insulin. Insulin is delivered to the liver and other muscle tissues throughout the body. When the insulin is introduced to the liver, it connects itself to the insulin receptors already present, called a tyrosine kinase receptor. These receptors have two alpha subunits (extracellular) and two beta subunits (intercellular) which are connected through the cell membrane via disulfide bonds. When the insulin binds to these alpha subunits, glucose transport 4, or Glut4, is released and goes to the surface of the cell to regulate glucose transport in and out of the cell. With the release of Glut4, the allowance of glucose into cells is increased, and therefore the concentration of blood-glucose is able to decrease. This, in other words, increases the utilization of the glucose already present in the liver. This is shown in the image to the right. As glucose increases, production of insulin increases, which thereby increases the utilization of the glucose, which maintains the glucose levels in an efficient manner and creates an oscillatory behavior.

Murder of Koby Mandell and Yosef Ishran

The murder of Koby Mandell and Yosef Ishran occurred on May 8, 2001, when two Jewish teenagers, Yaakov "Koby" Mandell and Yosef Ishran, were killed on the outskirts of the Israeli settlement of Tekoa in the West Bank, where they lived with their families. The identity of the killers has never been determined, though a number of sources state that Palestinian militants were responsible.
Koby Mandell was an Israeli-American, his family having emigrated from the United States to Israel in 1996, and the murders resulted in legislation by the U.S. Congress aimed at strengthening the U.S. response to the killing of Americans overseas. Also in response to his death, Koby's parents set up the Koby Mandell Foundation to provide support for families bereaved by terrorist attacks.
Disappearance and discovery.
Koby Mandell and Yosef Ishran were two Israeli teens, 13 and 14 years old. Koby was a citizen of both the United States and Israel. The boys lived and attended school in the Israeli settlement of Tekoa, in the West Bank, located near the Palestinian town of the same name variously referred to in English as Tuqu', Tekoa, and similar spellings.
On May 8, 2001, the boys skipped school and went hiking in the Judean desert surrounding their village. At first, their parents did not worry about the boys. They believed that they had gone to school, and then to Jerusalem to participate in a political demonstration. But when the boys did not come home by midnight, their parents informed the authorities.
The bodies of two boys were discovered the next morning in a cave near the West Bank settlement where they lived. USA Today reported that, according to the police, both boys had "been bound, stabbed and beaten to death with rocks". The newspaper continued, "The walls of the cave in the Judean Desert were covered with the boys' blood, reportedly smeared there by the killers". CNN and the Irish Independent reported that "Israel's Channel Two TV said police believed there were at least three assailants who dipped their hands into the boys' blood after the killing and smeared it on the walls of the cave."
Miro Cohen, a sheep rancher described the scene to "Time" magazine: "A rock the size of a computer rested on Kobi's smashed skull. Both bodies were covered with stones. Blood smeared the walls, and the dirt floor was muddy with it." The bodies were so badly mutilated and disfigured that dental records had to be used for positive identification.
The Jerusalem Post reported that police could not determine whether the boys had been killed outside the cave, or if their bodies were deposited in the cave after the murders. After forensic examination, the bodies, together with blood-stained rocks, were taken out of the cave.
The boys' funeral was attended by thousands of people.
Responsibility.
Israeli police made several statements about responsibility for the murders. They were reported variously as stating that thieves, who stole 100 goats from Tekoa the same night, may have been responsible; that there was no clear link between the two crimes; and that there was no link. One police commander however expressed the view that there was "no doubt" the murders were committed "for nationalistic reasons". Police said the killings appeared to have taken place during a "chance encounter" rather than one that had been planned in advance. Israeli security forces arrested 20 Palestinians from nearby villages and imposed curfews and roadblocks in response to the attack.
A few of the many news agencies that reported about the murders said that an anonymous person claiming to represent an Islamic militant group telephoned one or more "other" news agencies to take responsibility. The "Irish Independent" reported that a call was made to Reuters, and that the call could not be authenticated. It also said that the call had stated revenge for the killing of an Islamic Jihad militant the previous Saturday as a motive. The "Irish Independent" didn't name any particular group. The "Jerusalem Post" said in its day-after the event story that an anonymous caller to unnamed "foreign news agencies" had said he represented a group called "Hizbullah-Palestine" and that the boys were killed as revenge for the death of a four-month-old Palestinian baby, Iman Hiju, who became the youngest victim of violence when she was killed by an Israeli tank shell a few days previously. That death was apologized for by Ariel Sharon, who stressed that the "soldiers did not intend to kill her". A subsequent "Jerusalem Post" story, printed in 2008, suggested that the boys' killings might be attributable to "Bedouin shepherds".
Three books on terrorism that include compilations of terrorist attacks against Israel subsequently listed the murders as being attributable to Islamic Jihad and/or a "splinter group" of Hezbollah, called "Hizbullah-Palestine". Another source blames "a Palestinian mob". The "Boston Globe" reported that Israeli settlers, among other possible motives, suggested "a group of Palestinian youths had staked a claim on the cave during the seven months of violence, and that Israeli youths had been warned not to hike there." Most sources simply blame unidentified Palestinian terrorists. According to a 2004 U.S. Congressional report, there was never a "meaningful investigation or prosecution" of the case, and apparently, the perpetrators have yet to be apprehended.
Reactions.
The Israeli government condemned the killings. Ariel Sharon blamed the murder on the Palestinian Authority. Sharon said that Palestinian security forces do nothing to stop terrorists from murdering innocent civilians. He said that Palestinian TV was promoting violence by "by broadcasting music videos filled with images of children throwing stones."
The Palestinian Authority condemned the killings. A spokesman for the Authority, Saeb Erekat said, "The Palestinian Authority regrets the loss of life of these two boys and all children, be it Israeli or Palestinian, Jewish, Muslim or Christian." He added, that killing civilians on either side of the ongoing conflict is a crime, and that "the short way for peace and stability is finishing the Israeli occupation."
Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian National Authority, responded by blaming Israel for "victimizing Palestinian children". He cited the case of a three-month old Palestinian girl, Reema Ahmed, who was wounded by gunfire the previous Wednesday during an Israeli attack on a Palestinian refugee camp.
Shlomo Riskin, a rabbi from Efrat, saw "a profound distinction" between "Israel and its enemies":
f a child is killed by Israel, it is in an act of defense directed at a building where shots were fired at soldiers. In the case of Kobi and Yossi and Shalhevet, the enemy picked out innocent children to destroy them.
Ariel Sharon also characterized the boys' deaths as a "horrific murder" and ordered a missile strike on Yasser Arafat's Fatah offices in Gaza City, in which 20 Palestinians were wounded.
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the killings of the Israeli boys "horrible, brutal." Pope John Paul II, speaking in Malta, said he was saddened by "news from the Holy Land of terrible violence even against innocent young people."
Koby Mandell Act.
As a result of the murder, several legislators introduced the Koby Mandell Act, which reprimanded the State Department for, as it said, not doing enough about Palestinian terrorists who had harmed American citizens, and which would create an Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism in the Department of Justice. The legislation was spearheaded by Morton Klein's Zionist Organization of America but was not a priority of other Jewish groups, who said that it did more to reprimand the State Department rather than support counter-terrorism: by targeting only Palestinian terrorists, they said, it was too narrow in its scope and would not, for example, have been able to deal with the murder of Daniel Pearl. The provisions of the law which created the office were eventually incorporated into a 2004 omnibus spending bill.
The Koby Mandell Foundation and comedy shows.
The mission of the Koby Mandell Foundation, set up by his parents Seth and Sherri Mandell, is to "work to bridge the isolation that bereaved children and adults are struck with after the loss of a loved one." Leonard A. Cole, in his book "Terror: how Israel has coped and what America can learn", writes that Koby's parents are determined "to take the cruelty of Koby's murder and transform it into kindness."
Both Seth and Sherri Mandell reject responding to violence with violence. Seth Mandell says that "Throwing stones at Arab houses makes us as bad as the Arabs, and is not an intelligent response." Urging against the violence he says: "There’s plenty of stuff that can be done that is non-violent and makes a point."
Sherri Mandell says that "Revenge, to her, means they have won".
Koby's parents also organized comedy shows to commemorate the memory of their son, who they say loved jokes.

Mirror Dance

Mirror Dance is a Hugo- and Locus-award-winning science fiction novel by Lois McMaster Bujold. Part of the Vorkosigan Saga, it was first published by Baen Books in March 1994, and is included in the 2002 omnibus "Miles Errant".
Plot summary.
Clone Mark masquerades as Miles Vorkosigan (his progenitor) and dupes Miles' mercenary force, the Dendarii, into a mission to free clones held "prisoner" on Jackson's Whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet where Mark was created and raised. When Miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and his brother from the mess Mark has made, but is killed by a needle-grenade. He is frozen in a cryonic chamber on the spot, but the medic in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating under fire. The medic uses an automated shipping system to send the chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone its destination.
The Dendarii take Mark to Miles' parents on Barrayar. Cordelia accepts him as another son and has him acknowledged legally as a member of the family. After a while, Mark concludes that Miles is still on Jackson's Whole, and decides to go there himself to look for him, since Barrayaran Imperial Security does not believe him. Cordelia helps by buying him a ship.
Meanwhile, the frozen Miles has been resuscitated by the Duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius, who are employed by Jackson's Whole magnate Baron Fell. His memory takes some time to return, and the doctors treating him do not know whether he is Mark, Miles or Admiral Naismith (Miles' cover identity with the Dendarii). Mark finds Miles, but is captured by Miles' old nemesis, Baron Ryoval, held prisoner, and tortured for five days. His personality fragments into four sub-personalities: Gorge the glutton, Grunt the sexual pervert, Howl the masochist, and Killer the assassin. Together, the first three protect the fragile Mark persona, while Killer bides his time. When Ryoval's assistant informs him that Mark seems to be enjoying the torture, a frustrated Ryoval decides to study his victim alone. Killer takes the opportunity to kill Ryoval, allowing Mark to escape.
He sells Ryoval's secrets, accessible through a code ring, to Baron Fell for a large sum of money and permission for the Durona Group to emigrate.
Miles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for his health. Mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange upbringing, complicated by the torture. When he asks his mother for help, she sends him to Beta Colony for psychiatric treatment and therapy.
Format.
By necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of Miles and Mark. This was the first novel in the Vorkosigan series to be written this way, though not the first time Bujold has employed this style; the first occasion was in "Falling Free".
Awards.
"Mirror Dance" won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1995.

Epistles of Wisdom

The Epistles of Wisdom or Rasa'il al-Hikma () is a corpus of sacred texts and pastoral letters by teachers of the Druze Faith, which has currently close to a million faithful, mainly in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan.
The Druze canon.
The full Druze canon or Druze scripture includes the Bible, the Qu'ran and philosophical works by Plato and those influenced by Socrates among works from other religions and philosophers. They also consider Alexander the Great to be a prophet. The Druze claim that an understanding of these is necessary, but that their "al-ʻUqqāl" (عقال), ("the Knowledgeable Initiates") have access to writings of their own that supersede these. The Epistles of Wisdom are also referred to as the Kitab al-Hikma (Book of Wisdom) and Al-Hikma al-Sharifa. Other ancient Druze writings include the "Rasa'il al-Hind (Epistles of India)" and the previously lost (or hidden) manuscripts such as "al-Munfarid bi-Dhatihi" and "al-Sharia al-Ruhaniyya" as well as others including didactic and polemic treatises.
Description.
The Epistles of Wisdom were revealed in the Arabic language and contain one hundred and eleven epistles in total. They are organised into six books first compiled by one of the greatest Druze sages 'Abd-Allah Al-Tanukhi in 1479 AD. According to oral traditions there were originally twenty-four books. Eighteen are reasonably assumed to have been lost, hidden or destroyed. Epistle number six is dated earliest and was written in July 1017 AD by Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and he is specifically mentioned as the author of thirty more epistles in the first two books. Epistles 109 and 110 are dated latest, written by Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin in 1042 AD. Epistles 36 to 40 are attributed to Isma'il al-Tamimi ibn Muhammad. The first epistle opens with the goodbye message from Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the original teacher of the Druze. He details his efforts to assist his people's welfare and peace and urges them to remain upright.
History.
The Druze religious establishments interpretation of "taqiyya" (تقیة) and the esoteric nature of the faith led to the restriction of access, inquiry and investigation from even their own uninitiated Druze known as "al-Juhhāl" (جهال) ("the Ignorant") or "jismaniyeen" ("the Material Ones"). Such restrictions aimed to prevent possible damage to the individual and community if the writings were interpreted incorrectly, since the study of the Epistles of Wisdom is better accompanied by commentary texts and guidance from the higher ranking Druze "Uqqal" ("Knowledgeable Ones").
Druze manuscripts are generally written in a language, grammar and diction that, to the uninitiated is hard to understand and includes ambiguous words and highly obscure and cryptic phrases, in-addition to the extensive usage of symbology and numerology in much of the writings.
A Syrian physician gave one of the first Druze manuscripts to Louis XIV in 1700 and is now kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Local disturbances such as the invasion of Ibrahim Pasha between 1831 and 1838, along with the 1860 Lebanon conflict caused some of these texts to fall into the hands of academics. Other original manuscripts are held in the Robert Garrett collection at Princeton University. Sami Makarem has published sections of the works in English with commentary from a Druze compendium held in the Shaykh Nasib Makarem collection in Aytat, Lebanon. The first French translation was published in 1838 by linguist and orientalist Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre de Sacy in "Expose de la religion des Druzes".
Another edition of the "Rasa'il al-hikma" was published by pseudonymous writers in Lebanon in 1986 as part of the highly controversial "The Hard Truth" series which included several anti-Druze, anti-Alawite and anti-Islamic books and was banned by the authorities for containing misleading information and hate speech, also an unpublished dissertation by David Bryer was prepared on the first two volumes. A French translation and critical examination of these first two volumes (epistles one to forty) from the Epistles of Wisdom was published in 2007 by Daniel de Smet who has provided a doctrinal introduction, notes, a description and inventory of the manuscripts and studies of their contents and characteristics.
Contents.
The epistles contain philosophical discourses about Neoplatonic and Gnostic subjects, Ptolemaic cosmology, Arabic paraphrases of the philosophies of Farabi, Plotinus and Proclus, writings on the Universal Soul along with several polemic epistles concerning other faiths and philosophies that were present during that time and towards individuals who were considered renegades or those who tried to distort and tarnish the reputation of the faith and its teachings such as the "Answering the Nusayri" epistle and the fifth volume of the Epistles. Most of the Epistles are written in a post-classical language, often showing similarities to Arab Christian authors. The texts provide formidable insight into the incorporation of the Universal Intellect and Soul of the world in 11th century Egypt, when the deity showed itself to men through Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim and his doctrines. These display a notable form of Arabic Neoplatonism blended with Ismailism and adopted Christian elements of great interest for the philosophy and history of religions. It is believed by the Druze from interpretation of the epistles that Al-Hakim did not die, but merely withdrew into occultation and will return one day and reveal the Druze wisdom to the world in order to inaugurate a golden age.

Bukit Marak

Bukit Marak (literally Shining Hill) is a village in Bachok, Kelantan, Malaysia, located about south of the state capital Kota Bharu. It is famous as the childhood home of Puteri Saadong, and thus has great significance in the history of the Sultanate of Kelantan.
The village derives its name from a local hill, one of the last hillocks in the district. The hill has some attractions for tourists, and draws thousands of visitors every weekend both for hiking and for sightseeing. Among these are a famous pool in which Puteri Saadong was believed to have bathed, and three granite rocks at the peak of the hill resembling Puteri Saadong's favourite musical instrument. However, the hill is being negatively affected by excavation of soil for use in land reclamation; local villagers are said to be selling soil from the hill at RM40 for one lorry-load. Aside from the damage to the historical site, this also may introduce the danger of mudslides and landslides during the monsoon season. The state government has offered to purchase the hill from its owners in accordance with the National Heritage Act 2005, in order to prevent further damage.

Atacamatitan (meaning "Atacama Desert titan") is a genus of sauropod dinosaur. It is a titanosaur which lived during the late Cretaceous in what is now northern Chile. It is known from the holotype SGO-PV-961, which includes two dorsal vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, ribs, a possible sternum, part of an upper arm, the right femur, and unidentified incomplete bones. This specimen was found in the Tolar Formation. The discovery locality is near Conchi Viejo town, Atacama Desert in Antofagasta Region. It was named by Alexander W.A. Kellner, David Rubilar-Rogers, Alexander Vargas and Mario Suárez in 2011 and the type species is "Atacamatitan chilensis". The specific epithet "chilensis" refers to Chile.
The fossils were announced as "Domeykosaurus" in 2003 (meaning "Domeyko lizard", after nineteenth century scientist Ignacy Domeyko) but the name was never formally published.

Arbace

Arbace is an "opera seria" in three acts by Francesco Bianchi. The libretto was by Gaetano Sertor.
The opera was forward looking in its structure, with tension gradually mounting, via an exciting prison scene ("a fore-shadowing of romanticism") to a considerable climax. Marita P. McClymonds remarks on "The use of tonality, modality, chromaticism and strong dynamic contrasts for expressive purposes, as well as the liberal use of wind instruments ..."
Performance history.
The opera was first performed at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples on 20 January 1781. It was revived again in the same theatre on 4 November that same year.
Synopsis.
Arbace's wife Semiri is in the hands of the lascivious Assyrian tyrant Scitalce. Arbace tries to rescue her by pretending to be his own assassin. Eventually they are rescued by Idaspe, Scitalce dies in a conflagration, and Arbace becomes the new ruler of Assyria.

Acmarhachis

Acmarhachis is a genus of trilobite in the order Agnostida, which lived in what are now Australia (Queensland, Tasmania), Canada (British Columbia, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories), China (Anhui), Kazakhstan, Russia (Kharaulakh), and the US (Alaska, Alabama, Nevada, Maryland, Vermont). It was described by Resser in 1938, and the type species is "Acmarhachis typicalis".
Description.
Like all Agnostida, "Acmarhachis" is diminuative and the headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are of approximately the same size (or isopygous) and outline. As in all Agnostina, "Acmarhachis" has two thorax segments. When Agnostina are enroled, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the Eodiscina. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the Condylopygoidea. In "Acmarhachis" the furrow at midline between the front of the glabella and the border is weak or absent. The glabella has a long ogival to subquadrate front lobe, and the furrow defining it at its back is straight. The back lobe of the glabella is accompanied by two triangular basal lobes of moderate to large size. On the pygidium the axis or rhachis reaches the border. It is divided along its length in three lobes. It is shaped a bit like an amphora, the back pointed and strongly constricted across the middle lobe. The middle lobe also carries a node where it contacts the posterior lobe.

Dear Friend Hitler

Dear Hitler () released in India as Gandhi to Hitler
Plot.
The film is set during World War II and centres upon the letters written by Mohandas Gandhi (Avijit Dutt) to Adolf Hitler (Raghubir Yadav), and around the relationship of Hitler with his long-term lover Eva Braun (Neha Dhupia), whom he married in his final days in the Berlin bunker in which they died. The film depicts the difference between the ideologies of Gandhi and Hitler and claims the superiority of Gandhism over Nazism.
Cast.
The main cast of the film is:
Anupam Kher had originally agreed to play the role of Hitler, but he later backed out after Jewish organisations in India condemned him for playing the part because of Hitler's massacre of millions of Jews. The filmmakers accused Kher of not returning the 4 lakhs he had been paid after signing the contract and consequently sued him for 2.5 crores. However, Kher perceived it as a way of filmmakers to promote their film before the release.
Criticism and controversies.
British newspaper, "The Guardian", declared the film to be profoundly misguided and to show a shocking ignorance of history. Noah Massil, president of the "Central Organization of Indian Jews in Israel" (COIJI) stated that "he would write to President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene in order to prevent bringing disrepute to Indian entertainment industry", but the filmmakers claimed that the film does not glorify Hitler, but rather juxtaposes him against Gandhi's ideology of peace.
Critical reception.
The film was met with negative reviews. Times of India gave the film 2 stars out of 5, calling it an "unnecessary play with history". DNAIndia.com gave the movie one star. NDTVMovies.com criticized the movie for using Indian actors to play all non-Indian characters, using India itself as a stand-in to Europe, and for its "strands". Koimoi.com gave the film 0.5/5; although it praised Yadav's performance as Hitler, it criticized the film's script, direction, technical values, soundtrack, and the performance from other actors.
The film's theatrical poster also used a still from "Downfall", specifically the scene where Mohnke's group approaches the square, as pointed out by members of a Downfall fan community. So far the producers of the film have not commented on this issue. Several scenes, including the often-parodied scene of Hitler throwing a rage on hearing that Steiner did not attack, were also directly lifted from "Downfall".

Flood Control Act of 1950

The Flood Control Act of 1950 was a law passed by the United States Congress authorizing flood control projects in Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
The Act was prompted in part by floods that swept through the Columbia River watershed in 1948, destroying Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities as far north as Trail, British Columbia. By that time, local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a Public Utility District in Grant County, Washington ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.

Australian Emperor

Hemianax papuensis (also known as the Australian Emperor Dragonfly and Yellow Emperor Dragonfly) is a species of dragonfly in the Aeshnidae family that can be found in Australia. It is black coloured with yellow dots along the tail.
Description.
The Australian Emperor is a very large dragonfly, up to 70 mm long. Its abdomen is marked boldly in black and yellow. The thorax is greenish-grey. The head is yellow with a T-shaped mark on the forehead (frons). The eyes are yellow-green. The leading edges of the wings are yellow. The insect habitually hunts fairly slowly, patrolling up and down like other hawkers, with short bursts at high speed.
Their wingspan is . Males and females are similar.
Distribution and habitat.
The Australian Emperor is found throughout Australia. In the state of Victoria, it has a split distribution: below about 600 metres in altitude, and above about 1200 metres, apparently because it avoids forested areas. It is also found in New Zealand, New Guinea, the Cocos-Keeling Islands, Java, Sumba and New Caledonia.
The Australian Emperor is widespread and common on larger bodies of water with tall vegetation on the banks. Like other hawkers, it may hunt far from water. It flies throughout the summer from September to May.
Behaviour.
The Australian Emperor is notable as the dragonfly in which Motion camouflage was studied by Mizutani et al.: males of "H. papuensis" are fiercely territorial, and to approach and attack rivals, the males choose a flight path that keeps their image as seen by the target still with respect to a landmark point. The attacking dragonfly thus looms larger in the target's eyes, but otherwise does not seem to move until it is very close.
The males are very protective of their females. In case of intrusion of another individual, it will drive him away by engaging in a series of noisy air battles. Females lay their eggs under water.

<doc id="31217346" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31217346" title="Duodecet">
Duodecet

In music, a duodecet—sometimes duodectet, or duodecimette—is a composition which requires twelve musicians for a performance, or a musical group that consists of twelve people. In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a "twelvetet". The corresponding German word is duodezett. The French equivalent form, douzetuor, is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to "dixtuor", the French word for decet). Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the string quartet, there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet.
History.
Of the ensemble types named according to the number of musicians in the group, the decet, undecet, duodecet, tredecet, etc., are names less common in music than smaller groupings (quartet, quintet, etc., up to nonet). In the eighteenth century, twelve-part ensembles were most often encountered in the genre of the wind serenade, divertimento, nocturne, or partita—for example, Josef Reicha's "Parthia ex D", for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 3 horns, 2 bassoons, and double bass, and the partitas for the same instrumentation by Reicha's colleague Johann Georg Feldmayr (Gerhart 2011). In fact, the titles "serenade" and "suite" continue through the 19th century to be the preferred term for ensembles of twelve or thirteen instruments, especially winds (e.g., Wilhelm Berger's op. 102 for 12 winds, Felix Mendelssohn's op. 24 for 11 or 12 winds, Max Reger's Serenade for 12 winds, or Richard Strauss's opp. 4 and 7, for 13 winds). The word "duodecet" remains rare as a genre title in the 20th century (exceptions are found amongst the works of Polish composers Barbara Buczek and Bogusław Schaeffer), where works for twelve instruments or singers most often are given either a true title, or a genre title describing the form (e.g., "concertino", "suite", "variations"), often followed by a designator such as "for twelve instruments".
The three "twelve-part inventions", variations 3 (12 solo violins), 5 (10 violas and 2 double basses), and 11 (12 wind instruments), in Stravinsky's "Variations: Aldous Huxley in memoriam" (1963–64) have been designated "duodecets" by his biographer Eric Walter White (White 1965, 19–20; White 1979, 535–36).

Platykotta

Platykotta akaina is a species of decapod crustacean from the Triassic of the United Arab Emirates. It is the oldest known fossil from the infraorder Anomura, and is most closely related to "Eocarcinus praecursor".
Stratigraphy.
The holotype of "P. akaina" was found in the United Arab Emirates on the Musandam Peninsula – the peninsula which separates the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Oman. From the Permian to the Cretaceous, the area was near the shore of the Tethys Sea, which produced carbonate sedimentary rocks. The strata that contained "Platykotta" were part of the Ghalilah Formation, of Norian–Rhaetian age. These rocks contain extensive networks of burrows, and various other fossils, including bivalves of the families Megalodontidae and Wallowaconchidae, brachiopods, crinoids, sponges and corals. The holotype was found at approximately and has been deposited in the Natural History Museum of Geneva, Switzerland.
Description.
"Platykotta" is characterised by a broad, triangular sternum, unlike the very narrow sternum seen in Astacidea (true lobsters and freshwater crayfish) and Glypheoidea. A similar sternal form is seen in the spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters, and also several families of Anomura, including Galatheidae and Chirostylidae (squat lobsters), and Aeglidae. Unlike other anomurans, however, the carapace is considerably longer than wide. The pattern of grooves on the carapace indicates clear affinities with the Anomura.
Systematics.
"Platykotta" is placed in its own family, Platykottidae, which sits alongside Eocarcinidae (containing only "Eocarcinus") in the superfamily Eocarcinoidea. "Eocarcinus" was previously treated as the earliest true crab, but is now thought, like "Platykotta", to show too little carcinisation to be a true crab, and is placed instead among the Anomura.

The Syracuse Northern Electric Railway, also known as the Syracuse and Northern Electric Railway, was an interurban rail that ran from Syracuse, New York to Oswego, New York, a distance of . The line also proceeded to South Bay, New York on Oneida Lake.
The rail was formerly the Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company and the name was changed in 1917.
History.
The first mortgage was issued on May 1, 1917, to the "Trust and Deposit Company" of Onondaga, New York, in the form of 5 percent mortgage bonds due on May 1, 1946.
In 1917, the directors authorized the sale of four miles of track from Watertown Junction to South Bay, New York. The double-track lines were torn up and replaced with a single-track line. The section of rail was sold for $30,000.
Syracuse and South Bay railway.
The rail was formerly the Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company and the name was changed to Syracuse Northern Electric Railway Company.
Financial.
In June 1920, the total value of the Syracuse Northern Electric Railway franchise in Syracuse as determined by the New York State Tax Commission was $4,000, down from $4,150 in 1919.
Vacation excursions.
By May 1923, a round trip to South Bay from Syracuse cost 82 cents. The company advertised that "Good fishing awaits you at Oneida Lake. Rowboats and motor launches are available for pleasant rides to Frenchmen's Island. Auto buses meet the Electric Cars."
Tickets were sold at the "Electric Terminal" at 112 West Genesee Street where other rails such as Rochester and Syracuse Railroad and Empire State Railway also sold vacation excursions.
Trolleys replaced by buses.
In August 1932, the "Public Service Commission" authorized the railway to substitute buses for trolleys on routes from Brewerton in the town of Cicero in Onondaga County to Syracuse. Additionally, from town of Cicero to South Bay and in the village of North Syracuse.
This action was taken after a rehearing of the petition of the New York Central Railroad Company which claimed that no determination was made in regard to the removal of a bridge just east of the Syracuse-Cicero highway. A previous report of the commission stated that this was a matter between the two companies and any agreement for the removal of the bridge would have to be enforced by a court order. The rehearing counsel for the railway stated that an agreement had been accepted for the removal of the bridge and the hearing was adjourned until request and further hearing was received, if ever.
Outstanding bonds redeemed.
During September 1933, Syracuse Northern Electric Railway, Inc. issued a public notice that the company had elected to redeem all of its bonds outstanding on November 1, 1933, which would be deposited with the First Trust and Deposit Company of Syracuse as successor in trust to the original mortgage holder, Trust and Deposit Company of Onondaga a sum sufficient to redeem all bonds plus a premium of 10 percent and accrued interest to that date. All bonds held after that date were declared "null and void" and holders of such bonds were only entitled to look for payment "out of said funds deposited for such purpose."
Land use.
The Syracuse Northern Electric Railway ran from Downtown Syracuse north to the Northern Lights Traffic Circle via U.S. Route 11. This was by franchise. The line then proceeded to South Bay, New York, on Oneida Lake over a right-of-way which is now an Onondaga County roadway known as South Bay Road.
There was a branch line from Watertown Junction (South Bay Road and Pine Grove Road) which went miles north to Brewerton. This line is adjacent to the east side of Interstate 81. It is a wide right-of-way which was occupied by a Niagara Mohawk Electrical Transmission Line by 1974. Some evidence of the railroad bed is visible between Cicero and Brewerton.

Jonathon Robran

Jonathon Robran (born 21 October 1972) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Hawthorn and Essendon in the Australian Football League (AFL).
Robran was mostly a key position defender during his league career but could also play as a ruckman. He is the son of South Australian football great Barrie Robran and the younger brother of Adelaide player Matthew Robran.
Although he was selected in the 1992 AFL Draft, with Hawthorn's first pick and 11th overall, Robran didn't play an AFL games until 1995. He suffered from shoulder problems in 1996 but didn't miss a single games in the 1997 AFL season and continued to be a regular fixture in the team over the next two years.
Promising young key defenders, Trent Croad and Jonathan Hay, were making it difficult for Robran to claim a spot down back and in 1999 he was traded to Essendon. In a trade involving three clubs, Essendon gave Andrew Ukovic to Collingwood but received both Robran and draft selection 40, used on David Hille. Hawthorn acquired two draft picks from Collingwood, which would be used on Tim Clarke and Chance Bateman.
With Essendon winning their first 20 games of the 2000 AFL season, on the way to their 16th premiership, Robran could only manage four appearances during the year. He played once early in the year and was then stuck in the seconds until being called into the team to replaced an injured Dustin Fletcher at full-back for the final three home and away matches.
Delisted at the end of the 2001 season, Robran returned to his original club, Norwood, where he would play until 2004.

Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer

"Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer" is a song written by Bob McDill and Wayland Holyfield, and recorded by American country music artist Johnny Russell. It was released in July 1973 as the first single from his album "Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer". The song peaked at number 4 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the "RPM" Country Tracks chart in Canada, thus becoming his only number 1.
The song is performed from the perspective of a patron of a neighborhood tavern. Although he notes the cigarette smoke hanging in the air (a dated reference to a time when most taverns allowed smoking), and describes several customers – patrons who either make an unwanted pass at a female bartender, a cowboy who "cusses the pinball machine," a drunken customer who has become boisterous and another customer who phones his wife to tell her he'll soon be leaving for home – he also refers to the good times and camaraderie of friends at the establishment (""The four-thirty crowd is about to arrive/The sun's goin' down, and we'll all soon be here"").
A reference is also made to "There Stands the Glass," a No. 1 country hit by Webb Pierce, which is noted as playing on the jukebox.

"Kid Stuff" was one in a series of Fairchild songs using childhood themes to express a woman's dismay over broken relationships and the male-dominated hiearchy of traditional ones. Here, a young woman plays upon the childhood game of house and a not-so-fond recollection of playing the game with a little boy, who insists on dominating the proceedings, regardless of the girl's feelings. Now an adult, the woman has entered into a relationship where the man is the dominant figure and is either ignorant or uncaring when she objects. Unlike childhood, the woman bemoans that their relationship is real life, and not just "kid stuff."

Alfred Thornton

Alfred Horace Thornton (27 January 1853 – 31 March 1906) was an English amateur footballer who played for England in the first representative international match against Scotland in 1870. By profession, he was a banker.
Family and education.
Thornton was born in Rawalpindi, then in India, the son of Edward Parry Thornton C.B. and Louisa Chicheliana Plowden. Edward Thornton was the grandson of Samuel Thornton, former Governor of the Bank of England and was Commissioner of Rawalpindi from 1849 to 1858 under Lord Lawrence, and Judicial Commissioner for the Punjab from 1858 to 1862. He was awarded the C.B. in 1860 in recognition of his services.
Between 1867 and 1869, Alfred attended Harrow School. In his final year at Harrow, he was a member of the school football team.
Two elder brothers, Richard Chicheley Thornton and Robert Milnes Thornton, attended Harrow from 1861 to 1864 and 1867 respectively; Richard joined the 77th (Middlesex) Regiment in 1867, attaining the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, while Robert joined the 5th Fusiliers in 1867. A younger brother, George Walter Thornton, also attended Harrow (from 1869 to 1871); he died at Avranches in Normandy on 2 May 1873.
Football career.
Thornton was a member of the Wanderers club, to whom he was probably introduced by E. E. Bowen, a master at Harrow School.
In March 1870, along with Bowen, he was invited to play for the English XI in a match arranged by C. W. Alcock against a side representing Scotland. This was the first of a series of matches played over the next two years, before the first official football international in November 1872. There was no score in the match until 75 minutes had elapsed, when the English goalkeeper moved out of goal to play upfield; the Scots took advantage of the exposed goal when Robert Crawford scored with a shot from distance:. . . the game progressed until within a quarter of an hour of the time determined for the cessation of play, when the English rashly removing their goalkeeper paid the penalty by witnessing the reduction of their fortress to a long shot by R.E. Crawford. England fought back to score through Alfred Baker to salvage a draw a minute from the end of the game.
As well as being a member of the Wanderers, Thornton played for the Harrow Chequers. On 14 October 1871, he played for Harrow Chequers against the Wanderers; the teams played out a 0–0 draw. The "Morning Post" mentioned Thornton as "conspicuous for excellent play". Three days later, Thornton played for the Wanderers in a 1–0 victory over the Civil Service.
Professional career.
On leaving school, Thornton became a banker progressing to manager of the Old Bank and Brewery at Windsor. The bank and brewery were owned by Nevile, Reid & Co. and was originally founded as Ramsbottom & Baverstock in 1780. In 1914, the bank was acquired by Barclays Bank. The brewery was acquired by Noakes & Co. of Bermondsey, London in 1918, eventually becoming part of the Courage Brewery.
In the 1881 census, he was shown as living at 51 Thames Street, Clewer, Berkshire; his occupation was "banker".
Thornton was also a J.P. for the County of Berkshire. He died on 31 March 1906, aged 53.

Marks-Roos

Named after its legislative sponsors, the Marks-Roos Local Bond Pooling Act (California Government Code §6584-6599.1) is a law enacted by the California Legislature in 1985. The main purpose of this statute is to allow local California governments to work together to get financing in a way that will conceivably lower borrowing costs. Underlying this concept is the belief that money can be saved through economies of scale by selling one large bond issue to finance several small projects. Through this legislation, local municipalities and other political subdivisions can join together by signing a Joint Powers Agreement, which creates a Joint Powers Authority ("JPA"). In its broadest terms, the Marks-Roos Act authorizes JPAs to issue Marks-Roos bonds and loan the proceeds to local governmental agencies and non-profit corporations to finance public capital improvements, working capital or insurance programs. Alternatively, JPAs can purchase the bonds of local agencies with the proceeds of Marks-Roos bonds. Marks-Roos bonds do not require voter approval. Instead they are approved by resolution of the JPAs. However, there is a requirement for the JPA to make the finding that the financing would result in significant public benefit prior to bond.
Background.
In 1978 Californians enacted Proposition 13, which limited the ability of local public agencies to increase property taxes based on a property’s assessed value. This change in law, combined with sharp cuts in federal aid to state and local governments, severely limited local government’s ability to fund public infrastructure. The Marks-Roos Bond Pooling Act was thus created with the intent of providing a flexible alternative method of financing needed improvements, along with the benefit of reduced borrowing costs through the use of bond pools.

Mary Schepisi

Mary Rubin Schepisi (born March 6, 1949) is an American artist currently working in Melbourne, Australia and New York City. She is married to the film director Fred Schepisi.
Background.
Schepisi was born Mary Rubin into a Jewish family in New York City. Her father, the son of Polish immigrants, operated a company supplying industrial uniforms. Her mother migrated to the United States from England. Always supportive of Schepisi's interest in the arts, her parents enrolled her in the Art Students League of New York at the age of 10, where she came to study with many leading figures in the formative art movements of the 1960s, including the painters Jean Liberte and Milton Glasier. She attended Birch Wathen School on the Upper East Side and Boston University's College of Fine Arts. Schepisi spent her early career in the fashion and modeling industries. She has one sister, Leslie Slatkin, a nephew, William Slatkin, one son, Nicholas Schepisi, who currently works in film in New York, and six step-children.
Work.
Schepisi's figurative-based works involve drawing, painting, collage, needlework and a range of mixed media applications. When signing her smaller works Schepisi on occasion uses the lower-case monogram "mrs". Her art practice is notable for the high level of engagement she pursues with her subject matter. From the political to the personal, covering topics from perestroika to domestic violence, Schepisi often develops a close working partnership with her subjects as each body of work takes shape.
Schepisi's early work comprised small-scale pieces undertaken in her travels to film locations with her director-husband Fred Schepisi. One notable exhibition from these years was "Glasnost/Perestroika" (1990) shown in different configurations in London, Los Angeles and Melbourne, which was executed in 1989 during the shooting of The Russia House in Moscow, the first American production granted permission to film in the Soviet Union. With access to many leading figures in Russian film circles, including Raisa Fomina, Masha Chugunova (assistant to Andrei Tarkovsky), the producer Leonid Vereschagin and the famed director Elem Klimov, the artist employed painting and collage—clipping reports in the morning newspaper and gathering ephemera from her daily travels in Moscow—to chronicle the rapidly changing cultural landscape under Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of perestroika.
Schepisi's most recent body of work, "Beauty Interrupted" (2011) involves photographs of models in New York, Paris and Milan fashion shows similarly over-painted with contemporary and topical imagery including burkhas and burkinis (Islam-approved swimwear).
Her more personal work is both intimate and confronting, delving into issues of domestic violence, mental illness and sexual assault, in some cases combining text with portraiture. In "Speculations" (2004), Schepisi asked a large number of women to write often highly personal biographical essays before painting their portraits. The essays and paintings were then hung unmatched, leaving it to the viewer to connect each woman's life story to her portrait.
In recent years Schepisi has turned to needlework to address both the personal and political from her strongly feminist perspective. The subject matter for these pieces varies widely, from images of handguns and household cleaning products to indigenous Australian iconography and text-based invectives. A current work-in-progress entails a body of needlepoint revealing an exchange of imagined love letters sent between her Polish grandmother and the fictive Leipzig artist Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841–1898). Of this use of text Schepisi writes: 
Schepisi has been an active supporter of arts philanthropy, in 2009 organizing an art auction that raised $84,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. She and her husband own a winery on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula, where they live part of the year.

The song is one of several by Cash paying tribute to the working man. This first-person story is about a factory worker who plans to get retribution against his mean boss. In the song's spoken prologue, Cash dedicates the song ""to the working man/for every man that puts in a hard eight or 10 hours a day of work and toil and sweat/always got somebody looking down his neck/trying to get more out of him than he really ought to have to put in"."
The story of "Oney".
The story picks up on a factory worker's retirement day, where he laments about his years of long hours, exhausting, backbreaking and thankless work, and frustration in dealing with a micromanaging boss, Oney. The song's title character, Oney is a strict boss who demands promptness and sternly reprimands workers for the slightest of infractions, such as showing up five minutes late for work. During the worker's final day, his immediate supervisor (presumably one of Oney's lackeys) drops by, reminding the protagonist that it was Oney who made him and, without his help, would have not succeeded, all while the worker continues to lament about seeing Oney in his sleep.
As quitting time (at 4:30 p.m.) approaches, the worker pictures his retirement party, where he says Oney -- whom the protagonist complains has put in little to no work in the factory, while his employees toil away in poor conditions -- will probably give him a gold watch for his years of hard work. However, the worker says he plans to give something Oney in return: a beating. As the song ends, 4:30 approaches, leading the song's hero to call out, "Oney, Oney!" before chuckling over his plans.

<doc id="31217535" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31217535" title="Memory">
Memory

In psychology, memory is the process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Encoding allows information that is from the outside world to reach our senses in the forms of chemical and physical stimuli. In this first stage we must change the information so that we may put the memory into the encoding process. Storage is the second memory stage or process. This entails that we maintain information over periods of time. Finally the third process is the retrieval of information that we have stored. We must locate it and return it to our consciousness. Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information.
From an information processing perspective there are three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory:
The loss of memory is described as forgetfulness or, as a medical disorder, amnesia.
Sensory memory.
Sensory memory holds sensory information for less than one second, after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item, and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to "see" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the "partial report paradigm". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display, but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the "whole report" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.
There are three types of sensory memories. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information, a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. Haptic memory is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.
Short-term memory.
Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: George A. Miller (1956), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7±2 items (the title of his famous paper, "The magical number 7±2"). Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 4–5 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking. For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456) and lastly a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.
Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code. Conrad (1964) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar (e.g. E, P, D). Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made.
Long-term memory.
The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurably large. For example, given a random seven-digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our short-term memory. On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.
While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966) discovered that, after 20 minutes, test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings (e.g. big, large, great, huge) long-term. Another part of long-term memory is episodic memory, "which attempts to capture information such as 'what', 'when' and 'where. With episodic memory, individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings.
Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the parietal lobe. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. Without the hippocampus, new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory, as learned from patient Henry Molaison after removal of both his hippocampi, and there will be a very short attention span. Furthermore, it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal.
Research has suggested that long-term memory storage in humans may be maintained by DNA methylation, or prions.
Models.
Models of memory provide abstract representations of how memory is believed to work. Below are several models proposed over the years by various psychologists. There is some controversy as to whether there are several memory structures.
Atkinson-Shiffrin model.
The multi-store model (also known as Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model) was first described in 1968 by Atkinson and Shiffrin.
The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and procedural memory. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.
The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson-Shiffrin model. Patient KF was brain damaged, displaying difficulties regarding short term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Interestingly, visual short term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.
Working memory.
In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed a "working memory model" that replaced the general concept of short term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short term storage. In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer (Baddeley's model of working memory).
The central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.
The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember.
The visuospatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images).
The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.
The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect. However, the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague. Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.
Types of memory.
Researchers distinguish between recognition and recall memory. Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before. Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information. For example, individuals might be asked to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.
Classification by information type.
Topographic memory involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places. Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory. This is often reported among elderly patients who are evaluated for dementia. The disorder could be caused by multiple impairments, including difficulties with perception, orientation, and memory.
Flashbulb memories are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events. People remembering where they were or what they were doing when they first heard the news of President Kennedy’s assassination or of 9/11 are examples of flashbulb memories.
Anderson (1976) divides long-term memory into "declarative (explicit)" and "procedural (implicit)" memories.
Declarative memory.
Declarative memory requires conscious recall, in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called "explicit memory", since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.
Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory, which concerns facts taken independent of context; and episodic memory, which concerns information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as "Paris is the capital of France". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image. Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.
Procedural memory.
In contrast, procedural memory (or "implicit memory") is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.
A characteristic of procedural memory is that the things that are remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory are the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.
Classification by temporal direction.
A further major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, retrospective memory, or whether the content is to be remembered in the future, prospective memory. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or "remembering to remember" (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.
Techniques used to study memory.
Techniques used to assess infants’ memory.
Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories, and so, verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children’s memory. Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants’ recognition memory and their recall memory. Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants’ recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants’ recall memory.
Techniques used to assess infants’ recognition memory include the following:
Techniques used to assess infants’ recall memory include the following:
Techniques used to assess older children and adults' memory.
Researchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults' memory. Some examples are:
Physiology.
Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning, while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory. Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning, as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses, thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the memory enhancement effect. Patients with amygdala damage, however, do not show a memory enhancement effect.
Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage.
Cognitive neuroscience of memory.
Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called engram or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).
One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007).
Genetics.
Study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy. A notable initial success was the association of APOE with memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the gene "KIBRA," which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period.
Memory in infancy.
Up until the middle of the 1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode, retain, and retrieve information. A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay. Furthermore, research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time; 6-month-olds can recall information after a 24-hour period, 9-month-olds after up to five weeks, and 20-month-olds after as long as twelve months. In addition, studies have shown that with age, infants can store information faster. Whereas 14-month-olds can recall a three-step sequence after being exposed to it once, 6-month-olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it.
It should be noted that although 6-month-olds can recall information over the short-term, they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information. It is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two-step sequence in the correct temporal order - that is, recalling step 1 and then step 2. In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence (such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end), 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order (step 1 and then step 2). Younger infants (6-month-olds) can only recall one step of a two-step sequence. Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6-months.
Memory and aging.
One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005). Research has revealed that individuals’ performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time. Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example.
Effects of physical exercise on memory.
Physical exercise, particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running, cycling and swimming, has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain. Influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels, improved oxygen and nutrient delivery, and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The effects of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children's academic performance, maintaining mental abilities in old age, and the prevention and potential cure of neurological diseases.
Disorders.
Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying "memory disorders", particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition.
Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder which affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory.
While not a disorder, a common "temporary" failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. Sufferers of Anomic aphasia (also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia), however, do experience the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain.
Factors that influence memory.
Influence of odors and emotions.
In March 2007 German researchers found they could use odors to re-activate new memories in the brains of people while they slept and the volunteers remembered better later. Emotion can have a powerful impact on memory. Numerous studies have shown that the most vivid autobiographical memories tend to be of emotional events, which are likely to be recalled more often and with more clarity and detail than neutral events.
The part of the brain that is critical in creating the feeling of emotion is the amygdala, which allows for stress hormones to strengthen neuron communication. The chemicals cortisone and adrenaline are released in the brain when the amygdala is activated by positive or negative excitement. The most effective way to activate the amygdala is fear, because fear is an instinctive, protective mechanism which comes on strong making it memorable. Sometimes the feeling can be overwhelming. This is when a memory can be hazy yet vivid, or haunting with perfect clarity. This discovery led to the development of a drug to help treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When someone is in a heightened emotional state, the events causing it become strong and ground in the memory, sometimes disrupting daily life for years.
An experiment done with rats helped create the drug for treating this issue. Dr. Kerry Ressler at Emory University, used tones and shocks to test an existing drug called cycloserine (an anti-tuberculosis drug). Rats would hear a tone and receive a mild shock, training them to fear the tone. Then the drug was given to one set of rats, and the tests were done again. The rats that did not receive the drug froze in fear. When the tone was heard, the rats given the drug ignored the tone and continued on. The drug can effectively allow for new receptor connections between neurons and relaxing of the amygdala when it comes to fear, allowing patients to have a chance of recovery from PTSD.
Dr. Barbara Rothbaum at Emory University conducts experimental treatments for PTSD using the knowledge that exactly the same neurons are active when remembering an event as when it was created. Her administration of the drug cycloserine is intended to help patients foster new connections between neurons, providing a window to lessen former traumatic connections. Rothbaum decided to use the drug in a therapy session that utilizes virtual reality to give PTSD suffers a second chance. Once the events that have caused the PTSD are identified, the process can begin. The surroundings of the events are recreated in a virtual reality helmet (for instance, in a combat vehicle in the desert). This would help to recall the target memories in a safe environment, and activate the neurons without activating the fear response from the amygdala. When the dicyclomine is in the patient's system and the same neurons are active that were active during the event, the patient can now have a chance to re-form neural connections, with less chemicals present from the amygdala. This does not erase the memory, but rather lessens the strength of it, giving some relief so that people suffering from PTSD can try to move on and live their lives.
Recall is linked with emotion. If pain, joy, excitement, or any other strong emotion is present during an event, the neurons active during this event produce strong connections with each other. When this event is remembered or recalled in the future, the neurons will more easily and speedily make the same connections. The strength and longevity of memories is directly related to the amount of emotion felt during the event of their creation.
Interference from previous knowledge.
At the Center for Cognitive Science at Ohio State University, researchers have found that memory accuracy of adults is hurt by the fact that they know more, and have more experience than children, and tend to apply all this knowledge when learning new information. The findings appeared in the August 2004 edition of the journal Psychological Science.
Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is retroactive interference, when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference, where prior learning disrupts recall of new information. Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information. Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French – this phenomenon is known as positive transfer.
Memory and stress.
Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or ‘Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test’) for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.
However, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress. A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated. Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards – a computerized version of the card game "Concentration" or "Memory". The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory. Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present, or in a different room without the fragrance. The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context); however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context). All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.
This research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy: students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from post-traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context.
Memory construction and manipulation.
Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they "smashed" into each other?" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they "hit" each other?" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with "smashed" were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with "hit". There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers’ memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with "smashed" recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.
Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children. That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.
Research reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using optogenetics, a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and schizophrenia.
Improving memory.
A UCLA research study published in the June 2006 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating, physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives. This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance.
Eight subjects were asked to follow a "brain healthy" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance. No long term follow up was conducted, it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.
There are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the Art of memory.
The International Longevity Center released in 2001 a report which includes in pages 14–16 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition.
Levels of processing.
Craik and Lockhart (1972) proposed that it is the method and depth of processing that affects how an experience is stored in memory, rather than rehearsal.
Methods to optimize memorization.
Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. Rote learning is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets. The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is cramming which is intensive memorization in a short period of time. Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.

Velvet Sky (airline)

Velvet Sky was a low cost airline based at the King Shaka International Airport near Durban, South Africa. The airline launched in March 2011. It ceased operations in February 2012 and was liquidated in May 2012.
History.
Velvet Sky Aviation was established in 2009 as a subsidiary of Macdonald Holdings. Flight operations began on 22 March 2011. It was the only airline based in Durban and claimed to be the first Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment compliant airline in South Africa.
On 25 March 2011 technical problems with the airline's only aircraft caused a seven hour delay at Johannesburg. A replacement aircraft had to be chartered and a new aircrew had to be brought in as the Boeing 737, built in 1988, was grounded for repairs. The original crew could not continue the flight as they would have exceeded their duty hours limit. Customers also complained about poor service relating to problems with the airline's website and telephone service.
Sale of airline.
On 1 July 2011 McDonald Holdings announced that it had reached an agreement with Excalibur Aerospace to sell all its shares in the airline. The chairman of Excalibur Aerospace, Stephen Nthite, became the chairman of the airline as a consequence. Confirming the purchase of the airline, Excalibur Aerospace announced that they would retain Dhevan Pillay as CEO and Gary Webb as COO. In addition, the new owners announced plans to increase the fleet of aircraft in operation from August 2011.
Route expansion.
The airline had plans to extend their routes into other countries in Southern Africa when their fleet enlarged.
In November 2011 the airline added a route between Durban and Cape Town direct as well as via Port Elizabeth, when two more 737s were added to their fleet.
Services between Johannesburg and Polokwane International Airport began in September 2011, but were abruptly ended in January 2012 when the airport operator became involved in controversy over corruption.
Cancellation of flights and liquidation.
On 20 January 2012 the airline had its aviation fuel supplies embargoed due to outstanding bills. Temporary measures were put in place to secure fuel, but by late February the supplier, BP Southern Africa, had applied to the Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal high court for a liquidation order against the airline. The application was heard on Friday 24 February 2012. The liquidation was not granted immediately and the airline was given time to respond to 5 March 2012. Simultaneously its Air Maintenance Organization (AMO), SAA Technical, withdrew their services, allegedly for unpaid maintenance bills. The ground handling service provider, Menzies Aviation, had also been engaged in payment disputes with the airline for some time.
On 22 February 2012 hundreds of passengers were left stranded at Cape Town International Airport, Velvet Sky Airlines confirmed that its flights were delayed because of a dispute with a service provider.
On Thursday 23 February 2012 the airline was forced to cancel most of its flights due to a lack of an AMO as well as fuel delivery problems. Normal operations resumed after midday on Friday 24 February 2012 but were cancelled again on Monday 27 February after further service provider disputes.
The airline management issued a statement to the media shortly after midday on 27 February 2012 in which it cited the various disputes over payments to suppliers, the negative publicity generated by the flight cancellations and the need to re-structure the management with a concurrent attempt at re-capitalising the balance sheet as reasons for the suspension of all flight operations to 5 March 2012.
On 7 March the airline and its creditors reached an agreement to postpone the liquidation application indefinitely. One of the creditors applied to launch an application for a business rescue plan. The court gave Umzamo Transport Services (which is owed about R4 million) until 10 April to file supplementary papers to support its rescue plan application.
On 7 May 2012 the airline was placed under provisional liquidation. The liquidation was finalised on 21 June 2012.
Destinations.
Velvet Sky served the following destinations:
Fleet.
The fleet consisted of three Boeing 737-300s leased from Aergo Capital The aircraft were configured with 148 passenger seats in a single class cabin and a Douglas DC-9 leased from Global Aviation.

2000 A.D. (chess variant)

2000 A.D. is a chess variant created by V. R. Parton which employs fairy chess pieces on a 10×10 board. Parton describes his invention as "the game for Future Players in the Next Millennium", feeling that to be sufficiently challenging for later generations a variant should possess a larger board and increased possibilities.
The Gorgon, Chimaera, and Fury are all terrifying female monsters from Greek mythology. The Dragon is also referred to by Parton as female . The Attendant stands next to the Empress at the beginning of the game and moves as a chess king, but is stripped of all normal royal powers.
The distinction between moving and capturing methods of most of the pieces is a feature characteristic of the game. Parton published the variant in his 1972 monograph "My Game for 2000 A.D. and After".
Game rules.
Capturing the enemy Empress wins the game. There is no castling or checking in 2000 A.D. White moves first.
Pieces that move and capture the same way.

Reception.
The Allmusic review by Jason Ankeny awarded the album 4 stars stating "Yusef Lateef's first Impulse! date "Jazz 'Round the World" anticipates the emerging vogue for global music with a series of impassioned interpretations of traditional ethnic folk songs... Lateef proves that while music may indeed reign as the universal language, some speakers are far more fluent and eloquent than others".

Plochingen station

Plochingen station is the only station in the town of Plochingen in the German state of Baden-Württemberg and the most important railway junction of the Esslingen district. It is located 22.8 kilometres from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof on the Fils Valley Railway and at the beginning of the Neckar-Alb Railway.
History.
In the planning of the Fils Valley Railway () from Stuttgart to Ulm the chief engineer Michael Knoll foresaw a station southeast of Plochingen. At that time, approximately 1,900 people lived in the market town and its vineyards. On 14 December 1846, the Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen) officially opened the Esslingen–Plochingen line. The completion of the next section to Süßen took place on 11 October 1847. The first station building, which no longer exists, was a two-storey sandstone building. In 1852, a second track was completed on the Fils Valley line from Cannstatt to Plochingen. On 20 September 1859, the station became a junction station with the opening of the line then called the Upper Neckar Railway ("Oberen Neckarbahn") to Tübingen.
In 1900, the Royal Württemberg State Railways planned to build a railway on the south bank of the Neckar from Stuttgart to Plochingen to relieve the Fils Valley line of the transport of freight. The planners revised their concepts several times. In 1909, they decided that the line should end in Esslingen, but this variant was not realised and the plan was abandoned. Proposals for a railway link between Neuhausen and Plochingen were rejected by the State Railways.
The growth of rail traffic made an extension of the railway facilities inevitable. These included the laying of many new tracks, the widening of platforms, the installation of new signal boxes and the inauguration of a new roundhouse and water tower. The current station building was built in 1905-1907 to a design by the famous architect Theodor Fischer in the Art Nouveau style. The workers' houses along the line were built to his plans.
On 1 June 1913, Plochingen suffered major damage from a tornado and the station was affected, particularly the platform canopies.
On 1 June 1933, the line between Stuttgart and Ulm was electrified. This linked Plochingen for the first time with the Stuttgart suburban railway services—most services from Stuttgart, however, ended in Esslingen.
Because of the dense traffic on the line and the planned Stuttgart S-Bahn, Deutsche Bundesbahn rebuilt the Esslingen–Plochingen line as four tracks. This was completed on 27 September 1970; the related upgrading of the station lasted until 1974.
The first S-Bahn line, S1 was launched to Plochingen on 1 October 1978. Plochingen took a major role in the S-Bahn, since a train depot is located there. As part of the construction, Deutsche Bundesbahn demolished the old roundhouse and the water tower.
Track layout.
Track 1 is adjacent to the entrance building. The through tracks, 3/4, 6/7 and 9/10, are on three central platforms, which are accessed by an underpass. In the south direction of the platform 9/10 is the bay platform 59. At the southern end of the middle platform (3/4) are two more bay platforms, tracks 52 and 53, which are only used as depot tracks. Tracks 2, 5 and 8 do not have platforms and therefore they are only used by trains running through the station without stopping. West of the platforms, there are several storage tracks for S-Bahn and freight trains. North of the station is a depot for the maintenance of electric multiple units of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. The central bus station is next to the entrance building.
Entrance building.
The station building of 1907 is very spacious. In its symmetry, it differs from the traditional station buildings of Württemberg. It has a long central block with a two storey central section with a hipped roof, and the two wings with different hipped roofs. While the eastern extension has four floors, its western counterpart has a fifth floor and a clock tower on the ridge of its copper roof. The total length of the building is 96 metres.

World Heroes (video game)

Due to its success in the market, "World Heroes" was followed by a sequel released less than a year later titled "World Heroes 2".
Gameplay.
"World Heroes" is controlled with three of the four buttons ("A" to punch, "B" to kick and "C" to throw) used along with an 8-way joystick on the Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinet. The punches and kicks have two levels, weak and strong. In order to get each strength with just two buttons, the punch and kick buttons have to be pressed briefly for weak and longer for strong. This same mechanic even can be performed with special moves. The throw button C, if close enough to the opponent, grabs and throws the opponent across the stage; however, if holding the joystick in the opposite direction at the right time, the opponent would be tossed the opposite direction. Introduced in the fighting game genre by "World Heroes" are some abilities exclusive to some characters that were used in several later fighting games, such as multi-jumping using Hanzou and Fuuma, and shooting projectiles from the air using Rasputin.
There are eight playable characters in the roster and two different play modes for players to choose from: "Normal Game" and "Death Match". In "Normal Game", players have to defeat the other seven playable characters in a random order, followed by a battle against the final boss Geegus (misspelled as "Gee Gus" in localized English versions), all by using the chosen character. If the player defeats an opponent, the player moves on to the next opponent. After the third battle, the player has a bonus round to carve a block of stone into a statue in ten seconds with repeated hits. After the sixth battle, the player has another bonus round to break falling pots in ten seconds before they hit the ground. "Death Match" acts like Normal Mode with a difference. Players will fight in a ring with environmental hazards such as electrical barriers, spiked walls, oil puddles and others which players must avoid while fighting. Players also can force their opponents against the environmental hazards to their advantage.
Plot.
Eight heroes have been brought to the distant future by time machine to battle each other and become the title of Number One Hero. By the time the winning Hero has succeeded the others, a cosmic shapeshifting being name Geegus threatens to destroy the Earth unless the hero fights him. As the Hero defeats Geegus, the Earth is saved, but his/her quest is not complete.
Ports and related releases.
"World Heroes" was later ported to the Neo Geo AES in both Japan and North America on September 11, 1992, which is identical to the Neo Geo MVS version, but designed for home gaming, just like nearly every AES versions of Neo Geo titles. "World Heroes" was later ported to the Neo Geo CD exclusively in Japan by ADK on March 17, 1995, which is the same as the MVS and AES versions, but with arranged background music. Besides SNK's consoles, it was first ported by Sunsoft to the SNES in Japan on August 12, 1993, in North America in September 1993, and PAL regions in 1993. Later, it was ported to the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis by Sega Midwest Studio (then known as Sega Midwest Development Division) exclusively in North America on August 16, 1994. The Neo Geo AES version was also added to the Wii's Virtual Console first in Japan on September 28, 2007, then in North America on October 8, 2007, and in Europe on October 19, 2007. Later, it was added to a compilation of Neo Geo arcade games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii titled "SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1" as an unlockable game. A port was in development for the Mega-CD/Sega CD by Funcom, under the title "World Heroes CD", but was cancelled prior to its release.
On October 18, 2007, SNK Playmore added it with its three sequels to the arcade game compilation in Japan for the PlayStation 2. It was later published in North America on March 11, 2008, and in Europe on November 7, 2008, both titled as "World Heroes Anthology". This was created to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of the "World Heroes" series. This compilation was later reprinted as part of a series of best-sellers labeled "The Best" in Japan on June 18, 2009.
Reception.
On release, "Famicom Tsūshin" scored the Neo Geo version of the game a 22 out of 40.

James R. Whelan

James R. Whelan (July 27, 1933–December 1, 2012) was a journalist and historian who served as the first editor in chief of "The Washington Times", holding the position from 1982 to 1984. He is also known as the author of several books, most of them on the recent political history of Latin America. He was born in Buffalo, New York.
Early career.
Whelan began a career in journalism in 1952, much of it spent in Latin America including Chile, Venezuela, and Mexico. He started as a local correspondent for United Press International (UPI). In 1964, while UPI manager for Venezuela, he was named a Nieman Fellow. He later served as managing editor of "The Miami News". He graduated from Florida International University in 1975 with a bachelor’s degree. He served as vice president and editor of "The Sacramento Union".
"The Washington Times".
In 1982 Whelan resigned from "The Sacramento Union" to work at the newly created "Washington Times", serving as its first editor in chief and publisher. It was owned by the News World Communications, at which Whelan was later made an executive, which is affiliated with the Unification Church, although Whelan himself is not a member of the church. Whelen had initially rejected the offer to work at the new publication, but a persistent recruiting effort from Colonel Bo Hi Pak eventually changed his mind. In response to concerns over its church associations, Whelan promised the paper would be independent, citing a contract that promised autonomy. At a National Press Club luncheon in 1983, he complained about the sloppiness and hypocrisy of complaints made about the relationship with the church, stating that he himself had met the church’s leader Sun Myung Moononly twice.
In 1984 Whelan unexpectedly left the paper. At a news conference, Whelan claimed that “senior members of the Unification Church Movement—the so-called Moonies—have seized direct control of The Washington Times,” and that this led to his sacking by Bo Hi Pak. Smith Hempstone, Whelan’s successor, denied this, saying that a group of executives and editors, none of whom were members of the church, felt Whelan’s removal would be better for the paper’s "continued integrity.”
Later career.
After leaving the "Times", Whelan worked for the Latin American News Service. He lived in Chile, serving as visiting professor at the University of Chile and writing on the nation’s history. In 2008 he moved back to the United States and lived in Miami.
Death.
He died of multiple organ failure at 79, at his home in Miami, Florida.

Gino Bramieri

Gino Bramieri ( 21 June 1928 - 18 June 1996) was an Italian comedian and actor. He was especially known as a television comedian, but also performed in theatres, on radio, and in about thirty movies. He was nicknamed "Il Re della barzelletta" ("the King of jokes") for his burlesque comic style, which was largely based on his skill at telling funny stories. His jokes were sometimes as quick as a cut and thrust, and bordering on surrealism. They have been collected in a series of books, such as "50 chili fa" ("50 kilos ago", a collection he published after dieting).
Bramieri was born in Milan, Italy, into a humble family. He made his stage debut in 1943, with the prose company in prose of Egisto Olivieri. He later graduated in accountancy at night school.

Isanzu language

Isanzu is a Bantu language of spoken by the Isanzu people south of Lake Eyasi in Tanzania. 
The position of Isanzu within the Bantu family is uncertain. It is rather distinct in certain features from other Bantu languages of the area, such as Nyaturu, but is quite close in others. One easily recognizable feature is /h/ in words where neighboring languages have /s/ or /tʃ/, as in the name Isanzu ~ "Ihanzu", a feature it shares with Iramba, and a reason it is commonly classified with Iramba.

Amos Eno

Amos Richards Eno (November 1, 1810 — February 21, 1898) of Simsbury, Connecticut was an American merchant of dry goods who expanded into real estate in New York City, built the Fifth Avenue Hotel and established a prominent family fortune, of which the New York real estate alone was estimated at twenty million dollars at the time of his death.
Having clerked in a small general store in Hartford, Connecticut, he married Lucy Phelps, also of Simsbury, and moved to New York, where he and his cousin John Jay Phelps opened a profitable dry goods business. While making a fortune in the dry goods business, Amos Eno parlayed his profits into real estate investment in Manhattan, New York, buying corner lots and occasionally full undeveloped city blocks. His brownstone-fronted store at 74 Broadway had the reputation of having been the first use of brownstone in the city. Retiring from active participation as a merchant, he concentrated in 1856–59 in building the famous Fifth Avenue Hotel at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street in Madison Square, Manhattan, and the adjacent Madison Square Theatre in 1863. North of the Square he built a brick four-storey house at 233 Fifth Avenue that served as his residence for many years, then from 1890 housed the Reform Club of New York, recently (1888) founded by Anson Phelps Stokes.
He and relatives established the Second National Bank of New York, headquartered in the hotel. In 1884 scandal hit the family bank when one of Amos' sons, John Chester Eno, president of the bank, embezzled millions of dollars and then fled to Canada to avoid prosecution. Eno never closed the bank, though three to four million dollars were withdrawn in panic, and made good his son's embezzlement, "though he never recovered from the shock".
After settling his son's debts, Amos retreated to the family summer residence in Simsbury, the Amos Eno House (1820, on the National Register of Historic Places) which had been erected by Eno's father-in-law, Elisha Phelps. Every summer the Eno family would visit the house, which was enlarged by Eno and by his daughter Antoinette Eno Wood. He was a founding benefactor of the Simsbury Free Library, among other local philanthropic gestures.
He held the greater part of a full block facing Broadway in Longacre Square (now Times Square). His last real estate speculations were in open lots in the Upper West Side.
Eno's portrait by Eastman Johnson, commissioned by his family in 1899, was a posthumous one, based on photographs; it is conserved in the New York State Museum. A grandson, Amos Richards Eno Pinchot (1873–1944), was an American reformist, a mainstay and the historian of the Progressive Party, 1912-16.

<doc id="31217952" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31217952" title="Desura">
Desura

Desura is a digital distribution platform developed by Linden Research, Inc. for the Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X platforms. The service distributes games and related media online, with a primary focus on small independent game developers rather than larger companies. Desura contains automated game updates, community features, and developer resources. The client allows users to create and distribute game mods as well.
Desura seems to be supporting all three platforms : Windows, Mac and Linux.
Many independent developers and small companies have published their content on Desura including Frozenbyte, Frictional Games, Introversion Software, Basilisk Games, S2 Games, Linux Game Publishing, RuneSoft, Running with Scissors, Interplay Entertainment, and Double Fine Productions. Desura sells many games that were previously included in Humble Bundle initiatives, as well as numerous other commercial titles. Desura also provides several freeware and free software games.
Features.
The Desura client is heavily tied to its website through the use of the Chromium Embedded Framework. Most of its services are provided through its online interface, with the exception of the game launcher, installer, and update features. This provides Desura with an interface that does not vary much from system to system.
The interface itself offers various selections based on what feature a user may want to access, with installed games being offered through the "Play" tab, games available for download or purchase being offered through the "Games" tab, user interaction and social networking features from the "Community" tab, information and features for game developers through the "Development" tab, and technical support and client settings through the "Support" tab.
Desura does not impose digital rights management, and Desura employees have commented against its use in the past, recommending that content producers ship without DRM or at least use a CD Key system instead. However, Desura itself is DRM neutral, and publishers and developers may sell games that require such technologies to be used. Desura will make sure users purchasing these titles are aware of the DRM it ships with and how it works.
Competitors.
Desura competes in the same market as Valve Software's "Steam" platform. However, Scott Reismanis, the founder of DesuraNET does not consider it a competitor, but rather an attempt to address a different segment of the market.
Content hosted on Desura is primarily Indie games, which are games by smaller developers who do not have enough popularity or power to negotiate deals with Steam. Desura believes that its tighter links to a dedicated community will foster better relationships between players and developers.
Desura is also highly tied to the "Mod DB" community, as both are run by the same company. Desura therefore highlights content distribution for mods as one of its features, although this is not yet available for the Linux client.
History.
The initial development on Desura had been happening in secret by DesuraNET for many years, with the project being first publicly announced on December 16, 2009.
Near its launch, it publicized itself by offering free keys for games to augment the purchases of the same games made through Humble Indie Bundle #2. The initial Windows client was finally released to the public on December 18, 2010. On July 10, 2013, Desura was bought by Linden Lab.
Linux support.
Development on a Linux client was announced during the Summer of 2011, utilizing wxWidgets and GTK+ as the toolkit, and was introduced in a limited beta program in the Fall. The client was publicly available for download and execution, but users could not log into the online service unless they were a selected beta tester. On November 16, 2011 the Desura Linux client was publicly released with an initial offering of over 65 games.
Although Desura was not the only game distribution platform available for Linux, with there being several traditional online sellers such as "Tux Games", "Gameolith" and "Wupra", as well as many Linux distributions distributing games through their package management systems, with the Ubuntu Software Center even selling commercial game titles, However, the account login feature is only available to some testers, as of November the 10th, 2011 .
Source release.
On November 9, 2011 it was announced that Desura would be made partially free software in order to facilitate its further development. The client itself would be released under the GNU General Public License, while the server-side portion of the distribution platform would remain proprietary. The media assets and trademarks would also remain property of DesuraNET. The free software release and development is handled in a manner similar to Google's Chromium project. The free project, named "Desurium", was publicly made available on January 21, 2012.
Acquisition by Linden Lab.
Linden Lab, the makers of shared creative spaces including Second Life, Patterns, Creatorverse, on July 10, 2013 announced that Linden Lab acquired Desura. The service would continue uninterrupted for current customers and the team and technology become a part of Linden Lab. After acquiring Desura, Linden Lab changed their Terms of Service to include the wording that they have future rights to use and adapt content from their virtual citizens. Speculation exists as to whether the acquisition of Desura is tied to this change in TOS.

A column family is a NoSQL object that contains columns of related data. It is a tuple (pair) that consists of a key-value pair, where the key is mapped to a value that is a set of columns. In analogy with relational databases, a column family is as a "table", each key-value pair being a "row". Each column is a tuple (triplet) consisting of a column name, a value, and a timestamp. In a relational database table, this data would be grouped together within a table with other non-related data.

Comedy hip hop

Comedy hip hop or comedy rap is a sub-genre of hip hop music that is comedic in nature, often incorporating satirical lyrics. While many examples of comedy hip hop could be considered a parody of the hip hop genre, in the case of artists who merely incorporate humor into their more serious, purist hip hop styles, such as Eminem, this is not necessarily the case.
Before the darker themes that are characteristic of the Gangsta rap of the 1990s, comedy hip hop, with its lighter and more humorous style, came to prominence in the 1980s, carried by popular acts such as the Beastie Boys. Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the early 1990s, such as Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens, and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, rappers like Hopsin, Eminem, Jon Lajoie, and The Lonely Island gained popularity. Rucka Rucka Ali is an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop while touching on social issues like racism, as in his song, "I Can Do Whatever I'm White". "Weird Al" Yankovic has made entries to this music genre, along with Nerdcore. "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is also a well known song of comedy hip hop. While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus, the genre maintains a substantial loyal following.

Municipality of Alexandria

The Municipality of Alexandria was a local government area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was bounded by the Eveleigh railway yards and Boundary Street to the north, Botany Road in the east, Canal and Gardners roads to the south and crossing through the suburbs of St Peters and Erskineville in the west. The small municipality was initially a ward (along with Waterloo) of the borough of Redfern created under the Municipalities Act of 1858. The Waterloo Municipal Council was then proclaimed in 1860, followed by Alexandria Municipality in 1868. Over the next sixty years there were few alterations to municipal boundaries centred around the suburb of Alexandria. Rapid industrial and residential development occurred from the 1880s, with the population of the municipality recorded as 7499 in 1705 dwellings by April 1891. By 1891, the tramline along Botany road was constructed, the road itself the major thoroughfare in the municipality being laid out in 1821. By 1949 the municipality as one of the so-called "slum municipalities" was merged into the City of Sydney located immediately to the north under the "Local Government (Areas) Act 1948".
The Alexandria Town Hall, constructed in 1928 is located in Garden Street in Alexandria.

Director's Cut (Kate Bush album)

"Director's Cut" is an album by English singer and songwriter Kate Bush that she released in May 2011. It is made up of songs from her earlier albums "The Sensual World" and "The Red Shoes" which have been remixed and restructured, three of which were re-recorded completely. It was Bush's first album release since 2005's "Aerial" and the first on her own record label, Fish People.
Bush wrote all of the songs and composed all of the lyrics with the exception of lines referenced from James Joyce. The album has received mostly positive critical reviews. Praise has appeared from various publications such as Allmusic and "The Scotsman".
Overview.
Released in May 2011, the album features four tracks taken from "The Sensual World" (1989) and seven from "The Red Shoes" (1993) which have been re-recorded while retaining most of the original instrumentation.
Regarding the entirely new lyrics to the song "The Sensual World", now re-titled "Flower of the Mountain", Bush said this: "Originally when I wrote the song "The Sensual World" I had used text from the end of "Ulysses" by James Joyce, put to a piece of music I had written. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I’m not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes. It is now re-titled "Flower of the Mountain" and I am delighted that I have had the chance to fulfill the original concept. For some time I have felt that I wanted to revisit tracks from these two albums and that they could benefit from having new life breathed into them. Lots of work had gone into the two original albums and now these songs have another layer of work woven into their fabric. I think of this as a new album."
All the lead vocals on "Director's Cut" and some of the backing vocals have been entirely re-recorded, with some of the songs transposed to a lower key to accommodate Bush's matured voice. Additionally, the drum tracks have been reconceived and re-recorded, with some of the tracks featuring Steve Gadd. Bassist Danny Thompson also appears and, on backing vocals, Mica Paris. Three songs have been completely re-recorded: "This Woman's Work", "Rubberband Girl" and "Moments of Pleasure".
"Director's Cut" is available as a digital album, a standard CD in a case-bound book, a deluxe version ("Collector's Edition"), consisting of a box set including "Director’s Cut", "The Sensual World" and the "The Red Shoes" (re-mastered from digital to analogue), and two-disc vinyl. "Director's Cut" was recorded using analogue equipment. Bush stated in an interview for BBC radio that she never liked the "hard-edged sound" of the digitally recorded "The Red Shoes" and feels both the new recordings of the songs from this album and the re-mastered "The Red Shoes" have a "warmer, fuller sound."
The album was a chart success, reaching No. 2 on the UK albums chart (matching the chart peak of both "The Sensual World" and "The Red Shoes") and although it fell swiftly down the chart after its first week it has sold consistently and has since been certified silver in the UK. The album also charted in a number of other countries, including a No. 4 entry in the Irish charts, and also went top ten in the Netherlands and Norway.
Singles.
The only single to be released from the album was "Deeper Understanding", originally the sixth track of "The Sensual World". Its lyrics describe a relationship between a lonely person and a computer which has replaced human companionship.
The video was released through her official YouTube account. The song features a newly recorded main vocal by Bush, and the voice of her son Albert on the chorus. The single, upon its initial release as a digital download, charted in the UK at No.87.
Critical reception.
Critical reception for the album has been mostly positive, with most reviewers acknowledging the confusion surrounding the release of this unique revisitation of old songs. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 22 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim". Simon Price of "The Independent" noted: "Director's Cut was greeted with reactions ranging between disappointment, bafflement and ridicule, before anyone had heard a note... taken on its own merits, however, there's plenty to enjoy".
Specifically, Fiona Shephard of "The Scotsman" gave "Director's Cut" a 4-star review, writing: "Ever the perfectionist, Kate Bush has revisited earlier songs, the first-time recordings of which didn't reflect her original vision. The resulting revamps are satisfying, rounded - and occasionally bizarre." Thom Jurek of Allmusic stated that he found the release "deeply engaging and satisfying" and particularly stated that since Bush has "her own world-class recording studio" where "she's kept up with technology" that it shows positively in the details added to the remade songs.

European Civil Service Training Network

The European Civil Service Training Network (or ENTO) is a network which groups together the local and regional training establishments and programmes for nearly all 47 Council of Europe member states.
Purpose.
While the idea for a European network such as this was first proposed by the Council of Europe, it became an independent association in 1995 and groups a wide variety of members together some with extensive experience and others which have been relatively recently created or organized. This diversity fosters a network with a wide-range of abilities which facilitates the exchange of ideas and pools experience from various bodies in related fields.
Improving Public Administration.
One of the primary purposes behind ENTO lies in the strengthening of local democracy which is essential for democratic society. As a result of its work, fundamental reforms have been implemented in many European countries. These have created greater efficiency of officials and elected representatives at all levels of government starting at the local level. The reforms have also helped to support both the Council of Europe (more particularly the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe) and the European Union initiatives and efforts to improve public administration throughout Europe but particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. The training and availability of skilled staff ensures that duties and carried out professionally, lawfully, and democratically in each country.

Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East Europe

The Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East Europe or (NALAS) was created in 2001 to enhance the process of democratization and decentralization in south-east Europe. It is currently made up of national associations of local authorities in the region.
Background.
In each of the countries of south-east Europe, national associations of local authorities have been established with assistance from donors and support of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. Each of these organizations brings together a great number of municipalities (all voluntarily) and plays a key role in fostering local democracy in each country.
In May 2001, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe began using voluntary donations from the Swiss Government under the Stability Pact to help create this network now known of NALAS to help strengthen local democracy.
In December 2002, the Congress hosted the network’s first conference in Strasbourg, and, after 18 months’ work, the NALAS statutes were signed in the Council of Europe’s Assembly Chamber during the Plenary Session of the Congress on 27 May 2004.
The first General Assembly of the Association was held in Skopje on 6 September 2005. NALAS is no longer an informal network but rather an association with an official status and an infrastructure which should enable it to become more independent. It can now establish links with international and European organizations and with other associations in the same field and set up specific projects and activity programmes.
Members.
NALAS currently is a network of associations covering more than 4,000 local authorities who have been directly elected by over 60 million citizens in south-east Europe. It is made up of full members (national associations of local authorities from south-east Europe) and associate members (associations of local authorities from countries outside south-east Europe, international associations of local authorities, bodies working in the same areas as local authorities, foundations, international and European organizations, non-governmental organizations and donors), as well as honorary members.

Terje Sagvolden

Terje Sagvolden (February 12, 1945 – January 12, 2011, Oslo) was a Norwegian behavioral neuroscientist, a professor at the Universities of Oslo and Tromsø, and adjunct professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Research.
Sagvolden's research career started with his work for his PhD, which he obtained in 1979 from the University of Oslo based on a thesis entitled "Behavioral Changes in Rats with Septal Lesions: Effects of Water-Deprivation Level and Intensity of Electrical Shocks". Sagvolden is best known for the discovery that the SHR rat strain is hyperactive. Over the next decades, he then went on to demonstrate that this strain is a valid animal model for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Subsequently, Sagvolden also showed that the WKY/NCrl rat strain showed inattention, but no impulsivity or hyperactivity, and validated this strain as an animal model of inattentive ADHD. Over the course of his career, Sagvolden worked not only with rats, but also with humans and pigeons.
Editorial activities.
Sagvolden was the founding editor-in-chief of the scientific journal "Behavioral and Brain Functions", from the time of its establishment in 2005 to his death in 2011. In 1989 he co-edited, together with Trevor Archer, a book summarizing current research on ADHD, followed in 1998 by a special issue on ADHD for "Behavioural Brain Research".
Community service.
Sagvolden was a member at large of the executive committee of the European Brain and Behaviour Society from 1986-1989 and its secretary from 1990 to 1995. Over the last two decades of his life, he was an active supporter of the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) and in 1993 played a significant role in its founding. He was subsequently member of SONA's International Advisory Committee and an official internal adviser from 1999-2004. In 2000, Sagvolden organized the first IBRO school in Africa at the University of the North (Pietersburg, South Africa). In addition, Sagvolden was one of the "founding fathers" of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies, where he represented Norway on the council from the foundation of the federation until his death.
Outside of the scientific community, Sagvolden was also active in local politics. He was a member of the Lier municipal council for the Conservative Municipal Group from 2003 until his death, and served in the areas of health, culture, childhood, education. In 2003, he was one of the top five candidates to run for mayor.
Notable works.
According to the Web of Science, Sagvolden published over 103 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. , these articles have been cited over 3400 times, resulting in an h-index of 30. His three most-cited publications (> 185 times) are:

Bicker family

Bicker (also: Bicker van Swieten and Bicker Caarten) is a very old Dutch patrician family ("since 1390"). The family have played an important role during the Dutch Golden Age. They were at the centre of Amsterdam oligarchy from the begin of the 17th century until the early 1650s. Since 1815 the family belonging to the new Dutch nobility with the title of jonkheer or jonkvrouw.
The Bicker family during the Dutch Golden Age.
During the Dutch Golden Age, the Bicker family was very critical of the influence of the House of Orange. They belonged to the republican political movement, also referred to as the ‘state oriented’, as opposed to the Royalists. Together with the Republican political leader Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and the republican-minded Cornelis de Graeff, the Bickers strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. During the two decades from the 1630 to the 1650s the Bicker family had a leading role in the Amsterdam administration, the city was at the peak of its political power.
In 1646, seven members of the Bicker family, called the Bicker's league, simultaneously held some political position or other. The Bickers provided silver and ships to Spain, and were very much interested in ending the Eighty Years War. This brought them in conflict with the stadtholder, some provinces, like Zeeland and Utrecht, and the Reformed preachers. After the Peace of Münster (1648) was signed, the Bickers were of the opinion that it was no longer necessary to maintain was a standing army, bringing him into vehement conflict with prince Willem II. To regain power William went on the march towards Dordrecht and Amsterdam with an army. His troops got lost in a dense fog and were discovered by the postal courier on Hamburg. The mayors of Amsterdam had the civic guard called out, the bridges raised, the gates closed and the artillery dragged into position. 
After that the leader of the family, Andries Bicker, was purged from the vroedschap, as was his brother Cornelis Bicker, as one of the conditions of the treaty that followed, led by Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen. Henceforth, it was the equally republican-minded brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff, and their following, who dominated Amsterdam. His niece Wendela Bicker married the powerful raadspensionaris Johan de Witt.

Koerich Castle

Koerich Castle () is a ruin located in the village of Koerich in central Luxembourg. With a history dating back to the 12th century, it is one of the castles in the so-called Valley of the Seven Castles.
Location.
Standing on level ground in the valley of the stream of Goeblange, the castle's impressive keep and external walls blend harmoniously with the Baroque church and the old houses in the centre of the village. 
History.
The "Grevenschlass", now known as Koerich Castle, was built by Wirich I, Lord of Koerich and Seneschal of Luxembourg at the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century in late Romanesque style. It was expanded in 1304 by Godefroid of Koerich who gave it a more Gothic appearance. The keep, now 11 m tall, was certainly much higher when it was built. With a base measuring 12 by 11.6 m and walls up to 3.5 m thick, it is one of the most impressive in the entire region. A spiral staircase inside one of the walls provided access to the different floors. 
Surrounded by a moat, the castle originally had a fortified entrance with a portcullis. 
From 1380, Gilles of Autel and Koerich converted the stronghold into a more comfortable residence by building two 12-m towers at either end of the south wall. The south-western tower which still stands, houses a chapel on the ground floor. In 1580, the new owner Jacques de Raville made further changes, demolishing part of the property and adding two Renaissance wings. The stately fireplace on the first floor and large rectangular windows testify to the castle's palatial splendor at the time. The south wing was again altered in 1728, this time with Baroque additions.
After the death of the Ravilles in the second half of the 18th century, the castle started to fall into ruin owing to lack of maintenance. In 1950, Pierre Flammang, the last private owner, carried out some essential structural repairs before the castle finally came into the hands of the State.
The castle today.
Although major repairs are still in progress, the site can be visited free of charge.

<doc id="31218649" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31218649" title="Funding Circle">
Funding Circle

Funding Circle is an online marketplace which allows savers to lend money directly to small and medium sized businesses. Funding Circle was the first site to use the process of peer-to-peer lending for business funding in the UK, and now operates in both the UK and US markets. As of February 2014, Funding Circle has facilitated £223 million in loans to small and medium sized firms.
History.
Funding Circle was set up in the UK in August 2010. It was launched at a time when small businesses were struggling to obtain finance from traditional channels. In its first 10 weeks investors used the platform to invest more than £1 million into small businesses.
It received £2.5 million in funding from Index Ventures in April 2011. In March 2012 Funding Circle closed a series B round of £10 million led by Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures.
A report published by Nesta in April 2013 found widespread preference for online lending over traditional banks among existing Funding Circle users. 77 per cent of businesses that borrow through Funding Circle said they were ‘likely or very likely’ to approach the peer-to-peer lender for a loan first, rather than go to a bank.
By September 2013 Funding Circle had trebled in size and announced it had facilitated over £150 million of loans since it launched. In October 2013, Funding Circle announced that it had raised a $37 million investment. Accel Partners led this round of funding, which brings the company’s total to $58 million. New investor Ribbit Capital contributed, along with existing investors Union Square Ventures and Index Ventures. Additionally, Funding Circle announced it was launching in the US and joined forces with Endurance Lending Network. Endurance now trades under the Funding Circle name. Since launching more than 50,000 people have registered at Funding Circle. Investors now include local councils, universities and the British Government.
Business Model.
Funding Circle provides a platform where investors can browse businesses that Funding Circle has credit assessed and approved for lending. Businesses submit an application which is reviewed by Funding Circle credit assessors. Once approved, businesses post their loan request on the Funding Circle marketplace. Here, investors choose which type of businesses to lend to, and through an auction process, bid the amount of money they wish to lend, and the interest rate they want to earn. Loan auctions typically take seven days. After the business accepts a loan, they make one repayment each month which is collected by Funding Circle and distributed to all the investors. Loan requests are typically made up of lots of investors each bidding small amounts on hundreds of different businesses to spread their risk.
Funding Circle also has an Autobid function, where the system automatically places bids according to the criteria investors have set. Investors can choose the average rate they wish to offer, which types of businesses they want to lend to, and the maximum percentage of their portfolio to be lent to any one business.
Investors can build up their portfolios quickly by buying loans from other investors via the secondary market. Similarly, if investors need to withdraw money at any point, all or part of the investment can be sold via the secondary market. Alternatively investors can choose to withdraw their money gradually as they receive their monthly repayments. In the UK, loan lengths start at the 6 month mark and go up to 5 years. Businesses can borrow between £5k and £1M to finance: working capital, expansion capital, asset finance and one off business expenses.
Risk and regulation.
If a borrower fails to fully repay the loan then the lender risks losing part of his or her return. To mitigate against this, Funding Circle recommends that users lend to at least 100 businesses equally. This can be done with as little as £2,000 – i.e. lending £20 to 100 businesses.
In the UK any established and creditworthy business currently operating can apply for a loan at Funding Circle, including partnerships, limited companies and sole traders. Businesses must have at least 2 years of filed or formally prepared accounts and have no outstanding County Court Judgements over £250. A minimum turnover of £100,000 is also required.
Funding Circle use many of the same credit checks as the high street banks to ensure only strong, healthy and creditworthy businesses can post a loan request. This includes an Experian check, whilst also splitting businesses into five risk bands (A+, A, B, C, and C-). If a business defaults, Funding Circle will pursue the business owner to recover the remaining part of the loan on behalf of the investors.
In partnership with Zopa and RateSetter, Funding Circle launched a trade body, the P2P Finance Association, with the stated goal of "ensuring high minimum standards of protection" for lenders and borrowers in the industry. The association will also lobby the UK Government to regulate the industry itself. The Government has since ruled that peer-to-peer lending and borrowing activities will be overseen by the UK’s new market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, from April 2014.
Returns.
Because lenders choose to which businesses and at what rate they lend, returns for lenders using Funding Circle vary from person to person. However, during the first year from when the company was founded in August 2010, lenders received an average return of 8.3 per cent before fees and taxes. As of September 2013 Funding Circle advertise an average return of 5.8% after fees and bad debt.

<doc id="31218680" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31218680" title="Gaman (term)">
Gaman (term)

"Gaman" is variously described as a "law," a "virtue," an "ethos," a "trait," etc. It means to do one's best in distressed times and to maintain self-control and discipline.
Gaman is a teaching of Zen Buddhism.
Analysis.
"Gaman" has been attributed to the Japanese-Americans and others held in United States' internment camps during World War II and to those affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. In the internment camps, "Gaman" was misperceived by non-Japanese as introverted behavior or as a lack of assertiveness or initiative rather than as a demonstration of strength in the face of difficulty or suffering.
After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the resilience, civility, lack of looting and ability of the Japanese to help each other was widely attributed to the "gaman" spirit. The 50–70 workers that remained at the damaged and radiation-emitting Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant despite the severe danger demonstrated what was regarded as "gaman" as well.
"Gaman" is also used in psychoanalytic studies and to describe the attitudes of the Japanese. It is often taught to youth and largely used by older Japanese generations. Showing "gaman" is seen as a sign of maturity and strength. Keeping your private affairs, problems and complaints silent demonstrates strength and politeness as others have seemingly larger problems as well. If a person with "gaman" were to receive help from someone else, they would be compliant; not asking for any additional help and voicing no concerns.

Dr Dee

Dr Dee: An English Opera is an opera created by theatre director Rufus Norris and musician and composer Damon Albarn. It was inspired by comic book author Alan Moore. Its debut performance was at the Palace Theatre, Manchester in July 2011, as part of the 2011 Manchester International Festival. The opera is based on the life of John Dee, medical and scientific advisor to Elizabeth I.
Background.
Damon Albarn became associated with the Manchester International Festival through a 2006 concert production by his band Gorillaz, "Demon Days Live", a 2007 Chinese opera, "", and a 2009 immersive theatre production, "It Felt Like a Kiss", for which he wrote music.
An opera titled "Doctor Dee" was originally planned as a collaboration between Albarn, Gorillaz partner Jamie Hewlett and comic book author Alan Moore. According to Moore, he was approached by Albarn and Hewlett to collaborate on an opera featuring superheroes, but instead he suggested John Dee as a subject. He withdrew from the project when expected contributions from Albarn and Hewlett to his magazine "Dodgem Logic" failed to materialise. Moore is credited for "inspiration" in the opera's official programme and his incomplete libretto was published in "Strange Attractor" magazine.
Production.
"Dr Dee" ran from 1 to 9 July 2011 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. It was commissioned by the Manchester International Festival, English National Opera and the London 2012 Festival. It was subsequently performed from 26 June to 7 July 2012 at the London Coliseum, as part of the London 2012 Festival. 
The opera was scored for a band combining Elizabethan English instruments (viola da gamba, shawm, dulcian, crumhorn, recorder, lute) with the African kora and the distinctive drumming of Nigerian percussionist Tony Allen. Damon Albarn played acoustic guitar and harmonium and sang on a number of songs. A twenty-piece conventional orchestra was provided by the BBC Philharmonic and conducted by André de Ridder.
John Dee, a non-singing part, was played by Bertie Carvel. Dee's wife, Katherine, was played by Anna Dennis. Francis Walsingham was played by Steven Page. Edward Kelley was played by Christopher Robson, whose singing was described as "sublime" by Albarn.
Reception.
"The Guardian" gave the Manchester production four stars, saying that it "reaches to the heart of the tragedy of an overreaching intellect destroyed by a deal with a second-rate Mephistopheles". "The Independent" also awarded four stars, saying that the production was "mostly a triumph, but the opening dumb show and final song don't work". Rupert Christiansen in "The Daily Telegraph" gave the same star-rating, describing the opera as "fresh, original and heartfelt". The "NME" described it as "visually sumptuous and musically haunting".

Phalerus

In Greek mythology, Phalerus was the son of Alcon and grandson of Erechtheus, from Athens. He is counted among the Argonauts. He also attended the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia. Phalerus was Alcon's only son, his father took pride in sending him forth to join the Argonauts, so that he would shine conspicuous among those bold heroes, "yet no other sons had he to care for his old age and livelihood". 
It is related of Phalerus that he escaped from Athens to Chalcis in Euboea together with his daughter Chalciope; the Chalcidians refused to deliver him up at the demand of his father. He is credited with having founded Gyrton; he and Acamas are also the reputed founders of the temple of Aphrodite and Isis in Soli. In Phalerum, of which he presumably was the eponym, there was an altar to his and Theseus' children.
Phalerus was also the name of a Trojan killed by Neoptolemus.

Punk &amp; Poetry

Punk & Poetry is the third album by The King Blues. It was released on 17 April 2011 on digital download, and on CD the following day. The track listing for the album was released on 5 March 2011 on their website, and featured the previously released "Headbutt" single, which reached number 72 upon release in May 2010. "We Are Fucking Angry" was made available as a free to download on 27 January 2011. Their second single off the album "Set The World On Fire" got its first play on Mike Davies Radio 1 punk show on 8 February 2011, and was announced that it would be released on 10 April 2011. Itch announced on both Facebook and Twitter that 'I Want You' would be released as the third single.
"Punk & Poetry" entered the UK Albums Chart at number 31.
Album themes.
In a podcast with "Kerrang!", Jamie Jazz & Jonny 'Itch' Fox go through the album track by track, explaining what each song is about. Itch explains that the opening track "Last Of The Dreamers" is 'a call out for all the people unspoken for'. The next song, which is the lead single from the album "We Are Fucking Angry" (which has become a popular anarchist slogan) Itch tells that the song was written after seeing the student protests, which was made to be 'blare out of our sound system', and they wanted 'a full on, in your face, punchy kind of punk rock track'. The third song off the album "Set The World On Fire", Itch says the song is 'not accepting that the convenience of modern life is necessarily a good thing, or honest way to live, but questioning it, and questioning how we've got to a point where in some places in the world, they're making these things for us, and here we just use them and spending them freely'. Jamie Jazz adds 'Musically, when we first wrote it, it was an out and out hardcore track, it was nice to get it into the studio and take that rawness and break it down a little bit, pull it apart and put it back together, and I think it's a much better song now'. "Dancehall" according to Itch is 'about living your life as a celebration really'. "The Future's Not What It Used To Be" is about how the generation now are told they can't enjoy life as much as previous generations, and have been put in an unfair scenario because of a previous generations mistakes. Itch explains that 'it's about hoping that kids can hear it and realise that although it seems doom & gloom, the answers lie with them and the power lies with kids, the power to change their lives and transform their lives, be whoever they want to be is down to them at the end of the day.' The next song, "I Want You" was made because 'we wanted to write a buzzcock, fun, 70, pop punk song, and that's what we did' according to Jamie.

<doc id="31218810" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31218810" title="Macedonian parliamentary election, 2011">
Macedonian parliamentary election, 2011

An early parliamentary election was held in the Republic of Macedonia on 5 June 2011, a year earlier than necessary. All 123 parliamentary seats of the "Sobranie" were due for election, including the 3 seats provided for the first time for representatives of the Macedonian citizens living abroad: 1 from Europe, 1 from North America, and 1 from Asia and Australia. The decision of the ruling parties, the Christian Democratic VMRO-DPMNE and the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), to dissolve the Parliament and call for an early election was preceded by protests of the Social Democratic Union (SDSM), the major opposition party, and subsequent boycott of the Parliament by them, and by other smaller opposition parties.
Background.
The parliamentary election in Macedonia was due in mid-2012, after the ruling coalition between VMRO-DPMNE and DUI won over two thirds of the parliamentary seats in the 2008 early election.
A bitter dispute between the ruling coalition and the opposition was triggered when a police-assisted raid of public revenue officers took place on 25 November 2010, on a group of related companies including a private TV station, three daily newspapers, and other companies, for alleged tax evasion offenses. The opposition claimed that the media were raided due to their anti-government inclination. The opposing SDSM organised a huge rally on 5 December 2010, in which, according to estimates of the organisers, some 50,000 marched on the main streets of the capital Skopje and in front of the Parliament building, demanding that charges against the companies and the managers be dropped, and early election. However, the investigation continued, and on 24 December 2010 16 people were charged and detained for suspected tax evasion, abuse of office and money laundering, including the owner of the TV station and several executives.
On 28 January 2011 the opposition SDSM decided to walk out of the Parliament in protest, citing lack of democratic capacity of the government, and demanding early election. The move was followed by the smaller opposition parties in the Parliament – New Social Democratic Party (NSDP), New Democracy (ND) and the Liberal Party (LP). The Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) supported the decision, but they were already boycotting the Parliament since 2009.
The ruling coalition initially rejected this request for early election by the opposition, citing strong public support according to the polls, and solid parliamentary majority as main reasons against the opposition's demands. But after a one-month standoff, during which the opposition SDSM lobbied the EU & US officials, foreign diplomats, and failed to participate in consensus-building on any major political issues, the Prime Minister accepted the request and announced on 23 February 2011 that early elections will eventually take place.
After the failed attempts of the major parties to reach consensus on the changes of the electoral law and other demands of the opposition during March, the Parliament was dissolved on 14 April 2011, and the election was called the next day, with the election date set for 5 June 2011.
Electoral system.
Important dates:
After the official results are published, the President delegates the task of forming a government to the leader of the party or coalition which won most seats in the Parliament. That member has up to 35 days to negotiate with the different parties, and then present his or her government to the Parliament for a vote of confidence. Once the government is approved (by a vote of simple majority), he or she becomes Prime Minister.
Campaign.
The parties, coalitions and independent candidates were required to submit candidate lists by 5 May 2011. Separate lists were submitted for each or any electoral districts.
18 parties and coalitions submitted their candidate lists with 1,679 candidates in total. The two major parties both formed large coalitions.
VMRO-DPMNE.
The VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition included 22 parties; VMRO-DPMNE, the Socialist Party of Macedonia, the Democratic Union, Democratic Renewal of Macedonia, the Democratic Party of Turks, the Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia, the Union of Roma in Macedonia, the United Party for Emancipation, the Party of Justice, the Party of the Democratic Action of Macedonia, the Party of the Vlachs from Macedonia, the Party for Integration of the Roma, the Bosniak Democratic Party, Democratic Forces 
of the Roma, Permanent Macedonian Radical Unification, the New Liberal Party, the People's Movement for Macedonia, VMRO–Democratic Party, VMRO-United, Fatherland's Macedonian Organisation for Radical Renewal–Vardar–Aegean–Pirin TMORO–VEP, Macedonian Alliance and VMRO–
Macedonian
SDSM.
The SDSM-led coalition consisted of 15 parties; the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the New Social Democratic Party, the Party for a European Future, the Liberal Party of Macedonia, the Party for the Movement of the Turks in Macedonia, the Serbian Progressive Party in Macedonia, the Party for the Full Emancipation of the Roma of Macedonia, the New Alternative, the Union of Tito's Left Forces, the Movement for National Unity of Turks in Macedonia, the Democratic Union of Serbs in Macedonia, the Democratic Union of Vlachs in Macedonia, the Party of Free Democrats, the Party of Pensioners of Macedonia and the Sandžak League.
Opinion polls.
‡ The poll does not include the 3 seats from the diaspora.<br>
♦ The poll does not represent number of parliamentary seats, only percentages of voters.
Result.
Voter turnout was 63,48%. 7,851 accredited observers monitored the election, including representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, ODIHR, and others. The election went smoothly and without incidents.
Only 5 parties and coalitions, out of the 18 listed on the ballots, managed to win parliamentary seats. Several parties that were represented in the previous parliaments didn't win any seats, including VMRO-NP, LDP, and others.
The official final results are presented below. The main opposition coalition led by SDSM conceded the defeat and congratulated the winning coalition led by VMRO-DPMNE.
Reactions and aftermath.
In his election victory speech, Mr. Nikola Gruevski said that in the next term the government "will work on attracting investments and creating jobs, on EU and NATO membership with our dignity intact, the fight against corruption, maintaining good multi-ethnic relations and supporting education, which is key to the future".
In a joint statement, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton and Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Štefan Füle hail the multiparty, transparent and well organized elections.
EU Commission president José Manuel Barroso sent a message of congratulations to Mr. Nikola Gruevski, the current Prime Minister and leader of VMRO-DPMNE on the election victory.
On 6 June, a day after the election, Ljube Boškoski, the leader of the United for Macedonia was arrested on suspicion of illegal party financing and abuse of office. Allegedly, he received 130.000 Euro in illegal funding for his party's campaign.
Most of the smaller parties did not win any seats in the parliament. Of the 18 parties and coalitions listed on the ballot, only 5 won any seats. The leaders of several of the parties that did not win any seats, including the Social Democratic Union, New Democracy, Democratic Right, and the Liberal Democrats, resigned in the days after the election due to the poor results.

Description.
Adult.
Male, female. Forewing length 3.1-5.7 mm. Head: frons shining ochreous-white, vertex and neck tufts shining greyish brown with some reddish reflection, laterally and medially lined white, collar brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment three-quarters of the length of third, greyish brown with white longitudinal lines laterally and ventrally, third segment white, laterally lined dark brown; scape dark brown with a white anterior line, white ventrally, antenna from greyish brown in basal half, to shining dark grey in apical half, a white line from base to one-third, distal half interrupted, the apical section can be white, greyish white or dark grey, preceding by two, more or less distinct, white rings, especially in male specimens the white markings on the antennae are often greyish white and narrower than in female specimens. Thorax and tegulae greyish brown, thorax with a white median line, tegulae lined white inwardly. Legs: dark brown, femora of midleg and hindleg shining ochreous, foreleg with a white line on tibia and tarsal segments, tibiae of midleg and hindleg with white oblique basal and medial lines and white apical rings, tarsal segments of midleg and hindleg dorsally white, spurs brown on outside, white on inside. Forewing greyish brown, five white lines in the basal area, a short costal from before one-half to the transverse fascia, a subcostal from base to two-fifths or one-third, bending from costa at distal third, but occasionally it reaches almost or completely the transverse fascia, the white medial line can be complete from base to the transverse fascia, but more often it starts from just beyond base or well away from it and does not reach fully the transverse fascia, a subdorsal from two-fifths to the transverse fascia, a narrow dorsal from base and reaches from one-quarter to one-third, but sometimes almost to the transverse fascia, a yellow transverse fascia beyond the middle with a small basal protrusion and a larger apical protrusion, the latter can vary from small to very large, almost occupying the whole apical area, the transverse fascia bordered at the inner side by two tubercular pale golden metallic subcostal and dorsal spots, the subcostal spot outwardly edged by a patch of blackish brown scales, the dorsal spot nearer apex, the position of the inner tubercular spots vary, both can be at the edge of the transverse fascia, but more often only the subcostal spot is at the edge and the dorsal is surrounded by the yellow scales of the transverse fascia, occasionally both inner spots are free and surrounded by yellow scales, when free the dorsal spot is inwardly edged by a small patch of blackish brown scales, bordered at the outer edge by a similarly coloured, but smaller, costal and dorsal spot, opposite each other, sometimes one spot or both spots are inwardly lined brown or blackish brown, both outer costal and dorsal spot outwardly edged by a white costal and dorsal streak respectively, a shining white apical line connected to the apical protrusion, cilia greyish brown, paler towards dorsum. Hindwing shining pale grey, cilia pale ochreous. Underside: forewing shining greyish brown, white costal streak indistinctly and white apical line distinctly visible, hindwing shining pale grey. Abdomen dorsally shining ochreous-yellow, segment seven white, ventrally shining white, anal tuft white.
Larva.
Body yellow, head and prothoracic plate very pale brown, anal plate almost colourless, thoracic legs transparent.
Pupa.
Shining dark brown.
Biology.
The larvae feed on "Schizachyrium scoparium". They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow gallery near the midrib on the upper side of the leaf. The linear mine follows the midrib for quite a while, gradually widening until it occupies half the leaf from the midrib to the edge, before the top of the leaf the larva passes the midrib and starts feeding downwardly. So far the whole mine is filled with frass. The lower and final part of the mine is without frass and walls are lined with silk. Pupation takes place in this part with the pupa in upwards position and the cremaster firmly attached to the silk lining. When emerging the adult leaves the mine through a semi-circular slit. Adults have been collected in June and July in Michigan, in southern states of the United States from April to May and in August-September, in Brazil in March to May and in December. Larvae from Michigan collected in August hibernated inside the mines and emerged in May-June the following year. This gives the indication that the species is univoltine in the north, but bivoltine in the southern United States. In Brazil the species is probably multivoltine.

Economic history of Pakistan

The economic history of Pakistan begins with the country's independence in 1947. The economy of Pakistan is a semi-industrialised one, based heavily on textiles, agriculture and food production, though recent years have seen a surge towards technological diversification. The land forming modern-day Pakistan was home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation from 2800 BC to 1800 BC; historical evidence suggests that the civilisation relied on and carried trade through the Indus River, and its inhabitants were some of the most resourceful traders.
First five decades.
Pakistan's average economic growth rate since independence has been higher than the average growth rate of the world economy during the same period. Average annual real GDP growth rates were 6.8% in the 1960s, 4.8% in the 1970s, and 6.5% in the 1980s. Average annual growth fell to 4.6% in the 1990s with significantly lower growth in the second half of that decade. See also
During the 1960s, Pakistan was seen as a model of economic development around the world, and there was much praise for its economic progression. The capital Karachi was seen as an economic role model around the world, and there was much praise for the way its economy was progressing. Many countries sought to emulate Pakistan's economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea, copied the city's second "Five-Year Plan"; the World Financial Centre in Seoul is modeled after Karachi. 
Later, economic mismanagement in general, and fiscally imprudent economic policies in particular, caused a large increase in the country's public debt and led to slower growth in the 1990s. Two wars with India - the Second Kashmir War in 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 - and the resultant separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan also adversely affected economic growth. In particular, the latter war brought the economy close to recession, although economic output rebounded sharply until the nationalisations of the mid-1970s. The economy recovered during the 1980s via a policy of deregulation, as well as an increased inflow of foreign aid and remittances from expatriate workers.

Larva.
Body light green with short light hairs, at maturity with three brilliant wine-red longitudinal stripes, head and prothoracic plate yellow.
Biology.
The larvae feed on "Dichanthelium clandestinum". They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine is an irregular longitudinal blotch mine with the frass ejected at one end. At maturity the larva cuts a circular piece out of the epidermis of its mine, which it bends lengthwise and uses for a cocoon exactly like the genus "Cycloplasis". There are two generations, the adults have emerged from late May to early June and again in late July and August. The specimens from Michigan are obviously from the second generation, the mines were collected in August and the adults emerged in May.

Tesseract (band)

Tesseract (often stylized as TesseracT) is a British progressive metal band formed in 2007. They are currently signed to Century Media Records. They are credited as one of the bands to pioneer the 'djent' movement in progressive metal. As of 2013 Tesseract have released two studio albums, "One" and "Altered State".
History.
Early years (2003–2009).
Tesseract started out in 2003 whilst founding member Acle Kahney was recording and writing with his band Mikaw Barish. What started as an outlet for creativity and experimentation grew and Kahney posted clips of his technically heavy guitar work on forums such as Sevenstring.org, taking the feedback on board and gradually improving his technique. It was in this way that a community of bedroom producer-musicians were spawned and a new wave of progressive music called djent was created. Others who helped to create this new "djent" scene include Misha Mansoor (Periphery), Paul Ortiz (Chimp Spanner), and John Browne (Monuments), who was a band mate of Kahney's in Fellsilent.
Frenchman Julien Perier supplied vocals during the bands' very early stages, but the logistical difficulties of distance meant that he could not join the band permanently. The line-up was completed in 2007 with Jay Postones on drums, James Monteith on guitar, and Amos Williams on bass. Monteith and Williams brought along with them Abisola Obasanya, the vocalist of their previous band, <209>. After their first full lineup was realized, they began playing live shows and compiling material for their debut album; they released a 4 song demo in 2007 containing parts of what would eventually become their debut album "One".
"One" (2009–2011).
In 2009, Obasanya decided to leave the band. He was replaced by Daniel Tompkins;Acle had come into contact with him having assisted with the production on his previous band First Signs of Frost's album "Atlantic". The band reworked the album's songs with Daniel, moving towards a 2010 release. Just before heading out on their first major tours, they released the Concealing Fate EP, a 6 track suite which forms the centrepiece of their debut album.
In 2010 they performed headline shows in the UK in support of their "Concealing Fate EP", opened up for The Devin Townsend Project on a North American tour, and performed in the Great Indian Rock Festival in India. "One" was released on 22nd March 2011.
In 2011 they were a part of "The League Of Extraordinary Djentlemen Tour" with Periphery and Monuments throughout the UK, and were an opening act on the Scurrilous Tour with Protest The Hero and Maylene And The Sons Of Disaster in the US. Later in 2011 Tesseract toured throughout the UK in support of "One" with openers Chimp Spanner and Uneven Structure, and they also performed at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth.
Departure of Daniel Tompkins and "Perspective" EP (2011–2012).
On 20 August 2011 rumors began spreading that vocalist Daniel Tompkins had left the band, as Tesseract were seen performing with a different vocalist during a gig at the Craufurd Arms in Milton Keynes. This was confirmed by the band a few days later on 23 August, when they introduced Elliot Coleman as their new singer. Daniel Tompkins now sings for the progressive metal band Skyharbor and the pop-rock band In Colour, as well as gradually developing his own solo project White Moth Black Butterfly.
In September 2011 an instrumental version of "One" was digitally released and in October 2011 both the original and the instrumental versions were released on vinyl as a double LP.
During early 2012 Tesseract worked on an acoustic EP inspired by the radio acoustic session they played in Brooklyn, New York a year before. This came to be known as the Perspective EP and it was released on 25 May 2012.
Departure of Elliot Coleman and "Altered State" (2012–present).
On 12 June 2012 Tesseract announced that Coleman had amicably left the band: Sadly, our good buddy Elliot has decided to leave team TesseracT. We’d like to thank Elliot for everything he has done for us. We have loved having him be a part of this beast. He introduced us to a completely different side of our sound, as well the delights of Pho! Things we will always be grateful for. So, as well as continuing to write and record album 2, we are also on the hunt for that special (shpecial) person to be the new full-time Tesseract vocalisT.
On 7 September 2012 the band announced that they had found their yet unnamed new vocalist and would release the single "Nocturne" on 12 October. A series of shows in Europe were also announced, including a performance at Euroblast Festival.
It was later revealed that the new singer was Ashe O'Hara, who is also currently the vocalist of the bands Voices From The Fuselage and These Precious Days. Tesseract issued a short statement about the new vocalist on their website: We realize that the vocalist search seemed like it took a long time, but we wanted to make sure that we found someone who was a perfect fit both on stage and in the studio and Ashe is just that. We very much appreciate the patience and support our fans have shown us and look forward to the next TESSERACT chapter.
On 15 December 2012 Monteith stated in an interview with Gothestro Radio that they expect Tesseract's upcoming second album to be released in the early part of 2013. He also said that the album is taking a more melodic route than their previous releases.
On 28 February 2013 the band unveiled a release date for Altered State (27 May 2013 in UK and 28 May in US), a full track listing and a subsequent UK tour with The Algorithm and Enochian Theory just prior to the release. The album is a 51-minute continuous piece divided into four large sections ("Of Matter", "Of Mind", "Of Reality", "Of Energy"), each of which contains several tracks. The album's artwork was also posted. They have since released four trailers for the new album, each containing two minute snippets of different songs, although the names of the songs were not mentioned. Footage of the band rehearsing for their upcoming headlining UK tour (which featured a clip of a new song blended with camera audio of the band rehearsing it) was also uploaded onto the internet on 26 April 2013 by Century Media. On 30 April 'Singularity' was aired for the first time on BBC Radio 1's Rock show, and has been released on their Soundcloud account.
During a phone interview with Metal Injection, Amos Williams stated that the band would be going on tour in the US during the summer of 2013 and touring Europe in late 2013.
"Altered State" streamed on 12 May 2013 on Century Media's official YouTube channel, 2 weeks before the planned release.
The band stated in an interview at the HRH Prog festival that they have been steadily working on new material and are "always writing".
On 20th February 2014, a video was released of the band performing the "Of Matter" movement of "Altered State" live in a studio, similar to their "Concealing Fate Live" DVD which came as a bonus disc in the deluxe edition of "One".
Departure of Ashe O'Hara, return of Daniel Tompkins and 3rd album (2014-present).
On 27th June 2014, it was announced that TesseracT had parted ways with vocalist Ashe O'Hara, with Dan Tompkins rejoining the band as vocalist, while still continuing his duties as frontman of Skyharbor. TesseracT commented: 
"We have amicably parted ways with Ashe as we have found ourselves in different places, creatively. Ashe is a fantastic talent and will continue to be successful in his career and we wish him the absolute best!
"Moving forward for TesseracT – Daniel Tompkins will be rejoining us as a full time member of the band. Starting from our main stage performance at Sonisphere, UK on 05.07.14. We are also looking forward to starting writing and recording album three with Daniel, which will begin later this year."
Music.
The band plays a specific style of progressive metal which often features polyrhythmic riffs and odd time signatures, and several atmospheric layers. They have stated that they do not compose their music with specific polyrhythms in mind, and play what they feel fits the groove. They also include a mid-range sounding distorted guitar tone and melodic clean passages heavily influenced by ambient music. They are regarded as one of the pioneers of the djent subgenre of metal.
The vocal style of the band has seen a considerable shift. On "One", Daniel Tompkins employed a mixture of clean and harsh vocals, with an emphasis on long, drawn out notes. However, Ashe O'Hara's performances on "Altered State" dropped the harsh vocals entirely in favour of a more melodic style, with an emphasis on strong melodic "hooks". In an interview with Metalspree, Ashe stated, '...right now, being ourselves is to have purely melodic vocals. With ‘One’ they felt they had to have harsh vocals in order to be accepted by the community. But, they’ve never really wanted to be that type of band.'
In his interview with Metal Injection, Amos Williams stated that the decision to drop harsh vocals entirely from future material was an unconscious collective decision by the band and this made the search for a new vocalist extremely hard; his explanation was that many vocalists with an all clean style do not want to live the "metal" lifestyle of regular touring, or do not enjoy metal music enough to want to take part in a band in TesseracT's style.
Throughout their career, the band have produced, mixed and mastered all their material themselves: Williams is a qualified audio engineer and Acle Kahney has carried out production, mixing and mastering work for several other progressive metal bands. They have also refrained from taking part in the loudness wars; instead, they use more gentle mastering which preserves the dynamics of their music.
Amos Williams stated in an interview that TesseracT's music is relatively reliant on the bass in comparison to other metal bands: he states that "bass is always on its own little shelf" in the music and that during the production process "We left a lot of room for there to be sub and actual bass stuff going on".

Employment reference letter

An employment reference letter (German: Arbeitszeugnis) is a letter from an employer about an employee's qualities, common in German-speaking countries. An employment reference letter can be written by co-workers, customers, vendors and colleagues. This letter can then be used to help the employee find a new job at another company. Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Bulgaria are the only countries in Europe where employees can legally claim an employment reference, including the right to a correct, unambiguous and benevolent appraisal. Some employers may not be willing to provide reference letters because they may be worried about potential lawsuits. In this case, the employer may only provide the job title, dates of employment and salary history for the employee. 
Content.
The employment reference letter can cover topics such as:
Language.
Although some reference letters do give explicit grades on these points (e.g. excellent, good, poor), most express these in an implicit way using a unique language:
This language established itself as an unwritten code in the employment world. Its purpose was to give even weakly performing employees a letter of recommendation that does not sound negative. However, the euphemistically glazed-over descriptions are now codified and generally known, so that the original cryptic intent is no longer served. 
Verifying references.
Most potential employers will verify the information provided in the employment reference letter. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) found that eight out of ten resource professionals said they regularly conduct reference checks for professional (89 percent), executive (85 percent), administrative (84 percent) and technical (81 percent) positions.

Wendlingen (Neckar) station

Wendlingen (Neckar) station (formerly "Unterboihingen station") is the only station in the town of Wendlingen in the German state of Baden-Württemberg and is a railway junction on the Neckar-Alb Railway from which the Teck Railway branches. It is served by regional trains and the Stuttgart S-Bahn.
History.
On 20 September 1859 the Royal Württemberg State Railways opened the Plochingen–Reutlingen line, the first section of the Upper Neckar Railway. Its first stop after Plochingen was Unterboihingen station, which was about 700 metres north of Unterboihingen village.
As a connection to the district of Kirchheim was not under consideration by the State Railways, the city council sought on 13 August 1860 permission for a private railway company to build the connection. The railway would run from Unterboihingen to Kirchheim. On 12 August 1863 the Württemberg State Parliament approved its construction. The starting point of the eastward running line was at the Hotel Keim, which had a platform. On 21 September 1864 the Kirchheim Railway Company ("Kirchheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") commenced operations. On 1 January 1899, the Royal Württemberg State Railways took over the Teck Railway ("Teckbahn"). In 1902, a second track was added to the Plochingen–Reutlingen section.
In 1913, the director of the Behr Company, who had been a resident in Wendlingen for a year, sought to have the station renamed as "Unterboihingen-Wendlingen". The community in Wendlingen supported him. The State Railway Board refused, however, and even pointed out that if there was a name change, it would be called after the larger town of Köngen. Double names could also only be used in exceptional cases. After the Württemberg State Railways was absorbed into the Deutsche Reichsbahn, Wendlingen asked the Railway Administration ("Reichsbahndirektion") in Stuttgart to rename the station after the town on 25 April 1921. Meanwhile Köngen and Wendlingen had become almost equal in population and Pfauhausen-Steinbach station had been given a double name without complaint. Nevertheless, the Stuttgart Railway Administration again denied the request. Again on 30 November 1927, the Railway Administration pointed to Wendlingen’s disadvantage in size compared to Köngen. In 1933 the deputy mayor of Wendlingen pointed out to the Railway Administration that Wendlingen and Unterboihingen had grown togrther and that Wendlingen had about 3,000 inhabitants compared to Unterboihingen with 1,100 inhabitants. On 1 April 1940, the communities of Wendlingen, Unterboihingen and Bodelshofen merged and the station received its present name of Wendlingen (Neckar).
After the Second World War, on 20 October 1946, the citizens of Unterboihingens petitioned the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of the Interior to disincorporate from Wendlingen. A long dispute followed. On 11 December 1950, as a compromise, the Ministry of the Interior suggested that the station be renamed Wendlingen-Unterboihingen. Wendlingen had little sympathy for this and it did not satisfy the representatives of Unterboihingen. Tempers eventually calmed down.
Already in the 1970s, the Deutsche Bundesbahn planned the continuation of the S-Bahn from Plochingen to Kirchheim. Implementation, however, lasted for several decades and work only commenced on 23 July 2008. S-Bahn line S1 has operated on the Teck Railway since 12 December 2009.
Entrance building.
The station building was constructed in 1859 and its two annexes still exist. The ground floor, which has arched windows and doors, is made of sandstone. The upper floor, where an official residence was located, is painted light beige. The walls under the eaves is decorated with half-timbered elements.
In September 1900, the building was given a single-storey extension towards the south. In it were a room for the traffic controller and a post office. In 1902, it was connected with the telegraph network. 
After the extension for the post office was no longer sufficient, it got a new extension to the south, a two-storey building with a hipped roof and wood panelling on the upper floor facade.
The last renovation was on the north side of the entrance building, which has a sign with the name “Wendlingen (Neckar)”, while the south side has a sign with the name “Unterboihingen”.
Rail services.
The station has five platform tracks. Track 1 is next to the station building and is used by regional trains towards Plochingen. Track 2 is used by trains towards Nürtingen. Track 3 is also used by regional trains towards Nürtingen. Track 11 is served by S-Bahn to Kirchheim and is connected to the main platform (track 1). Track 12 is served by S-Bahn trains to Plochingen.
Wendlingen (Neckar) station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station.

Legs: shining dark brown with reddish gloss, femora shining ochreous, foreleg with a white line on tibia and tarsal segments one to three and five, tibia of midleg with narrow white oblique basal and medial streaks and a white apical ring, tarsal segments one and two with white dorsal spots at apex, segment five dorsally white, tibia of hindleg with a basal silver spot, and broad silvery white medial and apical rings, tarsal segment four dorsally and segment five entirely white, spurs shining white dorsally, dark brown ventrally. Forewing shining bronze brown with reddish gloss, three narrow white lines in the basal area, a subcostal from base to one-quarter, a medial just above fold, starting beyond base and ending just beyond the subcostal, a short subdorsal from one-quarter to beyond the medial, some traces of white scales on dorsum at one-sixth, a dirty yellow transverse fascia beyond the middle, bordered on each side by broad pale golden metallic fasciae with pinkish gloss and with a narrow blackish patch subcostally on the outside of the inner fascia, the outer fascia narrowed in the middle or interrupted, both fasciae lined brown at the sides of the transverse fascia, a narrow white apical line from beyond the outer fascia, the narrow white apical line changing in the cilia into a broader yellow line to the tip of the wing, cilia bronze brown around apex, paler towards dorsum. Hindwing shining dark brownish grey with greenish and reddish reflections, cilia brown. Underside: forewing shining greyish brown, the yellow streak in the costal cilia at apex distinctly visible, hindwing shining greyish brown.

Larva.
Head pale brown, mouth parts dark brown, body transparent yellowish green with broad red dorsal and lateral lines.
Biology.
The larvae feed on "Ipomoea neei". They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as an irregular gallery, later widening and branching. The larva constructs a silken gallery at the beginning of the mine from where most of the frass is rejected. Later some frass is heaped in the branches of the mine. The larva change mines and the second mines are irregular blotch mines, occupying a considerable part of the leaf. Pupation takes place inside the mine. Although "Ipomoea santillanii" also occurred next to the food plant the mines were not found on this plant. Adults have been collected in May.
Etymology.
The species is dedicated to the wife of the species author, Etmy Laura Koster-Keuter.

List of disputed territories of India

There are several disputed territories of India. A territorial dispute is a disagreement over the possession or control of land between two or more states or over the possession or control of land by a new state and occupying power after it has conquered the land from a former state no longer currently recognized by the new state. India faces territorial issues with 5 of its neighbors.
Major disputes.
People's Republic of China.
The Republic of China (ROC), now based in Taiwan, is involved in territorial disputes with many governments bordering China. Due to the One-China policy, it has no formal diplomatic relations with any of these states. The ROC recognises neither the People's Republic of China (PRC) nor its border agreements or treaties with any other countries. Article 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of China states that "The territory of the Republic of China according to its existing national boundaries shall not be altered except by resolution of the National Assembly." Section 5 of Article 4 of the now overrides this provision. Thus ROC is involved with all Sino-Indian border conflicts.
Aksai Chin.
Aksai Chin, also Aksayqin, Akesaiqin or Akesai Qin (Hindi: अक्साई चिन, Urdu: اکسائی چن, Simplified Chinese: 阿克赛钦), is a disputed region located in the northwestern part of the Tibetan Plateau and immediately south of the western Kunlun Mountains. It is entirely administered by the People's Republic of China as a part of Hotan County in the Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang Autonomous Region. India considers it as a part of its state of Jammu and Kashmir. What little evidence exists suggests that the few true locals in Aksai Chin have Buddhist beliefs, although some Muslim Uyghurs may also live in the area because of the trade between Tibet and Xinjiang. India claims the area as a part of the Ladakh District of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Both sides in the dispute have agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control.
Depsang Plains.
The Depsang Plains are located on the border of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and the disputed zone of Aksai Chin. The Chinese Army occupied most of the plains in 1962. The area is currently disputed, with both China occupying and laying claim to the eastern portion of the Depsang Plains, and India occupying the western portion and laying claim to all of the Depsang Plains.
Disputed areas located near Aksai Chin.
Demchok, Chumar, Kaurik, Shipki Pass, Jadh, and Lapthal. All controlled by India except for most of the Demchok parcel.
Trans-Karakoram Tract.
The Trans-Karakoram Tract (Chinese: 喀喇昆仑走廊; pinyin: Kālǎkūnlún zǒuláng) is an area of nearly 5,800 km2 (2,239 sq mi) along both sides of the Shaksgam River, is entirely administered by the People's Republic of China as a part of Kargilik County and Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County in the Kashgar Prefecture of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, but was claimed by Pakistan until 1963. It is still claimed by India as part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan gave up its claim to the tract under a border agreement with China in 1963 with the proviso that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute.
Arunachal Pradesh.
Arunachal Pradesh (Hindi: अरुणाचल प्रदेश, pronounced [ərʊˈɳaːtɕəl prəˈd̪eːɕ] ( listen)) is a state of India, located in the far northeast. It borders the states of Assam and Nagaland to the south, and shares international borders with Burma in the east, Bhutan in the west, and the People's Republic of China in the north. The majority of the territory is claimed by the People's Republic of China as part of South Tibet. The northern border of Arunachal Pradesh reflects the McMahon Line, a controversial 1914 treaty between the United Kingdom and the Tibetan government which was never accepted by the Chinese government and not broadly enforced by the Indian government until 1950.
Pakistan.
JAMMU AND KASMIR. This is the major dispute between Pakistan and India. Two wars have been fought between the two countries.
In addition to the disputed Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir a few other territorial disputes exist between Pakistan and India.
Siachen Glacier.
The Siachen Glacier is located in the eastern Karakoram Mountains in the Himalayas at about 35.5°N 77.0°E, just east of the Actual Ground Position Line between India-Pakistan. India controls part of the Siachen Glacier, Pakistan controls the rest. At 70 km (43 mi) long, it is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second-longest in the world's non-polar areas.
Saltoro Mountains.
The Saltoro Mountains (also known as Saltoro Parvat or Saltoro Muztagh) are a subrange of the Karakoram Range. They are located in the heart of the Karakoram, on the southwest side of the Siachen Glacier.
They are claimed as part of Jammu and Kashmir by India and as part of Gilgit-Baltistan by Pakistan. In 1984, India assumed military control of the main peaks and passes of the range, with Pakistani forces into the glacial valleys just to the west. Hence, despite high peaks and dramatic climbing opportunities, they are little visited except by military forces due to the ongoing Siachen conflict.
Sir Creek.
The Sir Creek is a 96 km (60 mi) strip of water disputed between India and Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch marshlands. Pakistan claims the line to follow the eastern shore of the estuary while India claims a center line (differing interpretations of "paragraphs 9 and 10" of the "Bombay Government Resolution of 1914" signed between then the Government of Sindh and Rao Maharaj of Kutch.

Minor disputes.
Bangladesh.
Boraibari.
Boraibari falls under the adverse possession category with the map suggesting that it should be within India but it has been controlled by Bangladesh authorities since 1971.
Indo-Bangladesh enclaves.
The enclaves between India and Bangladesh border in the Indian state of West Bengal remain an issue, though recent yet-to-be finalised negotiations have reportedly finally resolved the problems in this Chitmahal (Bengali: ছিটমহল) area. India has about 92 enclaves of Bangladesh territory, and 106 exclaves of India are surrounded by Bangladeshi soil. The enclaves were reputedly part of a high stake card or chess games centuries ago between two regional kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur and the result of a confused outcome of a treaty between the Kingdom of Koch Bihar and the Mughal Empire.
After the partition of India in 1947, Cooch Behar district was merged with India and Rangpur went to then East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971. In 1974, both countries agreed to exchange the enclaves or at least provide easy access to them, but since then little has materialised. Talks between the two countries on the issue resumed in 2001, but the lack of a concrete time frame has relegated the issue to the back burner.
New Moore / South Talpatti.
New Moore (as it was known in India) or South Talpatti Island (as it was known in Bangladesh) was a small uninhabited offshore sandbar landform in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta region. It emerged in the Bay of Bengal on the Bangladesh side of river that makes the boundary between India and Bangladesh in the aftermath of the Bhola cyclone in 1970, and disappeared before or during Cyclone Aila in 2009.
Although the island was uninhabited and there were no permanent settlements or stations located on it, both India and Bangladesh claimed sovereignty over it. The issue of sovereignty was also a part of the larger dispute over the methodology of settling the maritime boundary between the two nations.
Nepal.
Kalapani.
Kalapani (कालापानी) is an area under territorial dispute in Darchula District, Nepal and Pithoragarh district of India.
Although claimed by Nepal, Kalapaani has been occupied by India's Indo-Tibetan border security forces since the 1962 border war with China. Nepal claims that the river cited in the 1816 treaty should be followed all the way to its Himalayan source as the boundary, rather than the ridge line east of the river claimed by India. The river borders the Nepalese zone of Mahakali and the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Sugauli Treaty signed by Nepal and British India in 1816 utilizes the Kali River as Nepal's western boundary with India. Subsequent maps drawn by British surveyors show the source of the boundary river at different places. This discrepancy in locating the source of the river led to boundary disputes between India and Nepal, with each country producing maps supporting their own claims. The Kalapani River runs through an area that includes a disputed area of about 400 km² around the source of the river although the exact size of the disputed area varies from source to source.
Susta.
Susta is an area under territorial dispute currently in Tribenisusta, Nepal and near Nichaul, Uttar Pradesh, India. The area under dispute totals over 14,000 hectars.
Sri Lanka.
Kachchatheevu.
Kachchatheevu or Katchatheevu or Kachativu (Tamil: கச்சத்தீவு Kaccatīvu) (Sinhala:කච්චතීවු) is an uninhabited island belonging to Lanka - Disputed Comprising a Area of 285 Acres. This island was given to Sri Lanka by India in 1974. It has a Catholic shrine and has been declared as a sacred area by the government of Sri Lanka. In 2001, the Tamil Government called for the return of the island but Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister of Sri Lanka and current president, declined. He said that, `It is impossible to give it back to them as it has been recognized by the international community as an integral part of our country since it was handed over by late Indira Gandhi.'

The Rotherham trolleybus system once served the town of Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Opened on , it was the third trolleybus system to be established in the United Kingdom, after the systems in nearby Bradford and Leeds, which had opened simultaneously in 1911. Between 1912 and 1949, the Rotherham system gradually replaced the Rotherham Tramway.
By the standards of the various now-defunct trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, the Rotherham system was a medium-sized one, with a total of 10 routes, and a maximum fleet of 80 trolleybuses. It was closed on .

Coldham Hall

Coldham Hall is a Grade I listed building, built in 1574, that is located in the parish of Stanningfield in Suffolk. The Hall is very close to the village of Lawshall, and part of the Coldham estate is located within this parish.
Description.
Coldham Hall is a large Tudor country house that was constructed in 1574 for Sir Robert Rookwood (or Rokewood) of Stanningfield. A notable feature of this two-storey building is the great hall, with a long gallery in the roof space some 32 metres long, running from east to west. Internal alterations undertaken around 1770 include a Roman Catholic chapel with delicate plasterwork, leading from the long gallery.
Mid-nineteenth century alterations, including loggias on the east and south side, are now removed, but various window alterations at the rear and a service wing at the north end remain. The house was restored around 1980.
History.
Following its construction by Robert Rookwood in 1574, Coldham Hall remained the property of the Rookwood family for almost three centuries, until 1869.
The Hall has had a number of famous residents including Ambrose Rookwood who was involved in the Gunpowder plot and was executed in 1605. The Rookwood family continued in the Roman Catholic faith, as shown by the two chapels and several priest holes at Coldham. A remarkable feature of the history of Stanningfield and Lawshall has been the continuity of Roman Catholicism from the Middle Ages to the present day, in a predominantly Protestant area.
While the property remained in the Rookwood family until 1869, the estate passed through the female line to the Gages of Hengrave and was let to a tenant, Robert Taylor in the 1840s. In 1869 the estate was sold to Richard Holt-Lomax, whose family held it until 1893.
The purchaser in 1893 was Colonel Henry Trafford-Lawson who developed Coldham as a shooting estate, enlarging old clumps of woodland andplanting new blocks, some very close to the Hall. After the death of the Colonel's son, John Trafford-Lawson, in the First World War, the Coldham estate was purchased in 1918 by Colonel Everard Hambro, who lived there until his death in 1952. 
In 1952 the estate was purchased by Richard Duce who owned the property for 27 years before selling it to David Hart, an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, in 1979.
Since then the estate has been owned by Jens Pilo; and more recently Matthew Vaughn and his supermodel wife Claudia Schiffer, the current owners.
Gardens and grounds.
The house is approached down an avenue of trees and by crossing two small lakes in the valley bottom, which drain to the River Lark. From time out of mind there has been a footpath alongside the grounds of the Hall, giving parishioners past and present a view of the mansion.
Community.
In the past Coldham Hall had strong links with the local communities of Lawshall and Stanningfield, with many local women working in service at the main house and local men employed on the estate as agricultural workers or grooms. In the 1920s Christmas parties for the children of the employees at Coldham Hall were held in the Emancipation Chapel at Stanningfield.
The field near the main entrance on to the Bury Road, Lawshall was actively used for both football and cricket for many years. The clubs relocated more than 40 years ago but the Coldham Hall Football Club still plays in the Bury & District Sunday Football League, and the Hartest & Coldham Hall Cricket Club in the Hunts County Bats Suffolk Cricket League.
David Hart maintained a rapport with the local community by inviting local residents to Coldham Hall on 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night, to acknowledge the estate's link with the Gunpowder plot with a fireworks display and synchronised music from a brass band.
Folklore.
A tunnel is said to have run from Coldham Hall to the 16th century Lawshall Hall in Lawshall, a mile to the south.
Notable former and current residents.
The following residents lived at the Coldham Hall:

He went abroad (1801–1809) as a representative of the Academy and later returned as professor and advisor. Varnek's specialty was portraiture. He was particularly noted for his masterful drawing, his harmonious, if not particularly vivid coloring, the ability to capture a close resemblance, appropriate lighting, and in general for his conscientious execution without embellishment. Contemporaries highly rated his portraits, consequently he created many works of this sort. Particularly striking are his self-portrait, a portrait of Madame Khatova, a life-size portrait of Count Stroganov, a portrait of the former president of the Academy, A. N. Olenin, and the paintings "Head of a Young Turk", "Boy with Dog", and "Fiddler". In addition, Varnek painted icons representing the Annunciation and the Four Evangelists.

Fortuna started fast throwing power punches in bunches but the iron-chinned Irishman stayed on his feet and began to put the pressure on Fortuna. Fortuna seemed to fade late but had built enough of an early lead to take the fights' victory on a Unanimous Decision and handing Hyland his first loss as a professional.

Donka Hospital

The Donka Hospital is a publicly owned hospital in Conakry, Guinea. It has inadequate facilities to handle demand, and many Guineans cannot afford its services. More than once in recent years the hospital has had to deal with a major influx of patients wounded in civil disturbances.
Facilities.
Donka is a University Teaching Hospital, one of two in Conakry, the other being Ignace Deen Hospital.
It is located to the northeast of the Conakry Grand Mosque and across the main road from the infamous Camp Boiro.
It is the largest public hospital in the country, built in 1959 just before independence.
The Soviet Union assisted in its construction.
The bleak conditions in the hospital were the subject of a 1996 documentary "Donka, radioscopie d'un hôpital africain" by the Belgian director Thierry Michel.
Sewage is treated by autonomous wastewater treatment plants funded by the World Bank.
The hospital receives priority supply of electricity, but blackouts were frequent in 2006 when oil prices soared.
The hospital did not have enough money to pay for fuel for the main back-up power generator.
The Orthopedic Department was established in February 1982. At that time, the main problems it addressed were neglected poliomyelitis cases.
In 2004, the West Africa Health Organization (WAHO), working with the Guinea Government, began giving two-year courses in ophthalmology for General Practice Doctors, with intensive theoretical and practical training. Facilities were insufficient. CBM, Sightsavers and WAHO arranged to build a new facility in the teaching hospital compound, which was opened on 9 April 2010.
Charges.
The hospital has built up debt over the years, and cannot persuade the government or aid agencies to help with repayments.
It therefore enforces a rigorous pay-as-you-go policy, which puts treatment and drugs out of reach of many poor people.
New patients must first be tested for life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis, AIDS, cholera, malaria and cancer. Since many Guineans do not have enough money to pay for the blood test, they cannot get medical attention at the hospital.
The director of the hospital, Dr Taibou Barry, acknowledged the problem in 2003, saying: "The families are poor and when they come to the hospital, they have to pay for everything, and that’s probably all the money they have, so they must choose to eat or to come to the hospital".
A 2008 report from IRIN described the case of Aboubacar Traoré, who took his two-year-old daughter to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. Although the fee for consultation was $5, as shown on a sign on the wall, the doctor demanded more. 
Another doctor at the hospital said she was not surprised. She said "I have seen colleagues here persuade patients that only they can treat them, and once the patient has gained trust in that doctor, he or she bribes the patient".
Treatment.
A 1989 study found that maternal mortality at the hospital was 12.47 per 1,000, an extremely high figure.
Causes include lack of primary health care or peripheral obstetrical services, poor training of nurses and midwives and lack of general health education among the public.
In March 2011, the general wardroom for pre-mature babies in the Maternity Center had four incubators, but only one was working. It held five babies. The center is not equipped to handle the demand. About 80% of premature babies die within a few days.
The Donka Hospital Institute of Nutrition and Child Health is the only children's hospital in Conakry.
Between January and the end of September 2006, 623 malnourished children were admitted, a significant increase over previous years. The "dark, airless wards" were overcrowded, with some children sleeping two to a bed.
On 27 January 2009, a group of Marines from the U.S. Embassy delivered toys to each of the children at the Pediatric Hospital.
The actress Mia Farrow, who serves as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, visited the hospital in May 2010.
She saw three newborn infants in one incubator in the maternity ward. 
She met mothers of severely malnourished children, and saw children fighting measles and other preventable childhood killer diseases.
She said "It is wrenching to watch a child dying of a disease that is completely preventable. This is a result of Guinea's failing health system".
The cost of a measles vaccine is as low as US$1.
The hospital's dialysis department has five dialysis machines and can only treat 21 patients. There are private dialysis centers, but most patients cannot pay the $100 cost of the treatment.
The Donka hospital provides training for mass marketing, communication and marketing aspects of prevention of HIV/AIDS, funded by the World Bank and other sources.
Civil unrest.
At the start of 2007, strikes and protests were called due to rising commodity prices and falling living standards, coupled with pervasive corruption and political unrest. In the ensuing violence, about 180 people died and over 1,000 were injured. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided six vehicles to take wounded people to Donka Hospital on 22 January 2007.
119 patients were admitted, most with bullet wounds. 
The ICRC supplied a surgical kit for treating up to 150 gunshot victims to the hospital.
Donka hospital cared for at least 800 wounded people, assisted by Médecins Sans Frontières.
According to Djoulde Barry, director general of the hospital, 33 dead were registered there.
On 28 September 2009 a demonstration against the military junta at a city stadium was violently suppressed by security forces, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.
Women reported that soldiers had raped them in public in the stadium. Medical records from Donka Hospital showed that at least 32 of the women protesters were raped.
More than 220 first aid workers from the Red Cross Society of Guinea gave emergency medical assistance to more than 350 wounded people and took the most serious cases to the hospitals, mostly to the Donka National Hospital.
The injured packed the emergency room. Military from the Presidential Guard and Anti-Drug and Anti-Organized Crime Unit showed up around 3:00 pm that day. They fired their rifles into the air, destroyed medicines and yelled at the wounded to leave the hospital. They prevented anyone else from entering the building. The register of people treated was later lost.
Following the 28 September violence, the ICRC gave essential medical and surgical items to Conakry's hospitals, including kits to treat bullet wounds, masks, gloves and saline solution, and also provided body bags.
The ICRC and the Red Cross Society of Guinea tried to reunite family members, particularly children, who had been separated in the violence.
The NGO Terre des hommes was providing meals to patients in the Hospital, with the Health Ministry and private donations assisting in the supply of food. 
As follow-up to the violence, the ICRC helped Donka Hospital revise its emergency plan for handling a large influx of patients with bullet wounds.
Further violence occurred before the October 2010 Presidential run-off elections. 
Supporters of the candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea threw stones at police, who responded with gunfire. Two people were killed and at least 29 people were injured, treated in private clinics or Donka Hospital. The victims included "13 adolescents and three young girls".
Violence continued after the elections, which were disputed.
On 16 November 2010, Donka hospital reported treating 30 gunshot wounds, mostly direct shots rather than from stray bullets.

Risk-based authentication

In cryptography, risk-based authentication is a non-static authentication system which takes into account the profile of the agent requesting access to the system to determine the risk profile associated with that transaction. The risk profile is then used to determine the complexity of the challenge. Higher risk profiles leads to stronger challenges, whereas a static username/password may suffice for lower-risk profiles. Risk-based implementation allows the application to challenge the user for additional credentials only when the risk level is appropriate.

Tecnam MMA

The Tecnam MMA (Multi Mission Aircraft) is a cost and fuel efficient twin-engine aircraft for surveillance, law enforcement and remote sensing missions developed by Airborne Technologies in Austria. The MMA is based on Tecnam’s high-wing P2006T aircraft and adapted to carry various sensor equipment for aerial work.
History.
After Tecnam’s launch of the P2006T serial production in the year 2009, Airborne Technologies started developing the P2006T to obtain a smart and efficient special mission aircraft. The light aluminum P2006T was chosen because it’s characterized by the independency of Avgas fuel, an endurance of more than 8 hours and the enormous cabin space. The general trend in the commercial world to miniaturize electronic components and consequently the sensors itself made the deployment of a small and light aircraft for a sensor carrier platform possible. In the past, observation and sensing missions have been limited to bigger FAR Part 23 and Part 25 aircraft due to the dimensions and weights of the electronic sensor equipment. But nowadays by using state of the art technology small aircraft like this one are an affordable alternative for limited budgets of private organizations, governments and intra-governments.
In October 2009 was the roll out of the first MMA.
Design and Development.
The MMA is equipped with an autonomous alternator supporting the mission equipment separately and independently from the electrical bus of the aircraft with 28 volts and 60 amps. The separate mission bus is backed up with an extra battery and external power unit for ground support. This enables the sensor operator to set up the sensor equipment even on ground without starting the aircraft systems.
The sensitive technical equipment is housed within the sensor bay in the body of the aircraft. Therefore a hatch with dimensions of 430mm width and 660mm length and electronically hatch flaps are installed in the fuselage. The construction of the aircraft and the crashworthiness is not influenced because of the metal airframe where load paths are keeping via ribs and stringers and the shell of the aircraft only acts supporting. Covert ISR mission can be carried out very discreetly because the sensors and gimbals are not visible externally when transiting to/from the operational areas. On entering an operation the flaps of the hatch are opened and the sensors are lowered down by a sensor lift. After mission completion the sensors are brought back into the interior by the lift and flaps are closed again.
The sensors are operated directly from the second row of seats where a sensor operator station is integrated. It consists of a console for up to three screens, a keyboard, a joystick and recording devices. Hard drives and technical equipment (for the flight management system, data recording/processing and data down linking) are stored in the systems compartment, where an airborne server room is integrated. Additional antennas for mission GPS data, data down linking to ground stations or up linking to satellites are installed.
In opposite to civil aircraft where it’s often an advantage when flying fast, the majority of surveillance and sensing missions require low mission speeds (e.g. from 80 to 100 KIAS). The minimum mission speed of the MMA is 64 KIAS. Thus enables the aircraft to operate also in areas which have been reserved for helicopters so far (e.g. power line monitoring). 
The aircraft is powered by two ROTAX 912 engines of each 100 hp (75 kW) with overhaul times of 2000 hours. The water-cooled cylinder heads and the gearbox of the ROTAX engines make the aircraft to emit very low noise. Refueling with standard automotive gasoline (95-octane) and/or aviation gasoline (AVGAS 100 LL) in any blend enables keeping direct operating cost very low and to operate even in areas where AVGAS is not available or prohibitively expensive. The fuel consumption during sensing/surveying missions is 15 liters per hour per engine. This moderate fuel consumption and the low infrared emissions of the engines effect that infrared search heads cannot find the aircraft in typical operating altitudes. In conjunction with a non reflecting camouflage painting the basic conditions to be undetected for passive surveillance systems are fulfilled when operating for hours over same targets. 
These modifications and integrations of sensors up to 115 kg are certified on STC-base.
Worldwide distribution, maintenance and service are ensured by Tecnam’s dealer network, maintenance facilities and service centers.

The Agusan del Norte Provincial Board is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial legislature) of the Philippine province of Agusan del Norte.
The members are elected via plurality-at-large voting: the province is divided into two districts, one sending one member and the other sending seven members to the provincial board; the electorate votes the number of seats allocated for their district, with the candidates with the highest number of votes (first in the first district and the first seven in the second) being elected. The vice governor is the "ex officio" presiding officer, and only votes to break ties. The vice governor is elected via the plurality voting system throughout the province.

Casco Cove Coast Guard Station

Casco Cove Coast Guard Station is a military facility and private use airfield on Attu Island, one of the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska. Owned by the United States Coast Guard, Casco Cove CGS is located west of Anchorage, Alaska. Also known as LORAN Station Attu, the facility was closed on August 27, 2010, but the airfield remains available for emergency use.
History.
Established as Naval Air Facility Attu on June 7, 1943, just seven days after Attu Island was declared secured.
Overview.
The Casco Cove Airport was a LORAN navigation station operated by the United States Coast Guard. The USCG personnel lived in a group quarters facility. There were no families stationed at Attu. All services needed for staff in this facility are available. Electricity is provided by USCG Generator. Auxiliary health care is provided by USCG emergency medical staff.
Casco Cove is one of the most isolated and remote airports in the United States. Flying into and taking off from the airport was hazardous, as the weather is characterized by persistently overcast skies, high winds, and frequent cyclonic storms. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of 100 knots. During the summer, extensive fog forms over the Bering Sea and North Pacific.
The island is protected as part of the National Parks Trust territory and few people visit the island or area, as it is restricted. Gun emplacements for over twenty guns are still present around the airfield.
Facilities.
Casco Cove CGS resides at elevation of 88 feet (27 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 2/20 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,998 by 150 feet (1,828 x 46 m).
Incidents.
On January 1, 1945, 2nd Lt. Robert L. Nesmith flying from Alexai Point, crashed his Lockheed P-38G-10-LO Lightning in Temnac Valley, just west of Attu Station, while on a low-level training mission over Attu. This aircraft was recovered in 1999 and is now static-restored and on display at Elmendorf AFB.
