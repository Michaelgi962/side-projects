Corwin Clairmont

Corwin "Corky" Clairmont is a printmaker and conceptual and installation artist from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation. Known for his high concept and politically charged works, Clairmont seeks to explore situations that affect Indian Country historically and in contemporary times.
"I don't put work out that gives solutions but provokes questions." - Corky Clairmont
Background.
Early life.
Corky Clairmont was born in 1946 at the St. Ignatius Mission on the Salish Kootenai reservation. Creative at a young age, Clairmont was encouraged by his parents to be creative. During the holidays family members gave him paint by number kits, which he disliked, never completing them. At age 15 he submitted a design for the communities' tribal seal; it was chosen, and is still used to this day.
Attending high school in Polson he learned about the different elements of fine art, and during his sophomore year he was introduced to using a palette knife to paint with acrylics. This was his first experience in fine art painting, paving the path for a future as a professional artist.
Higher education.
Obtaining a Bachelors of Art at Montana State University, Clairmont went on to complete a graduate fellowship at San Fernando State University. He finalized his formal education in 1971 at California State University, Los Angeles, receiving a Masters in Fine Art. His higher educational experiences provided him awareness about the movements of the 20th century international art world. Clairmont was drawn to the work of Joseph Beuys and John Baldessari, primarily due to the environmental and nature based influence in their works. After graduation he remained in Los Angeles teaching fine arts and handling programming at Otis Art Institute.
Current activities.
In 1984 Clairmont became an administrator at Salish Kootenai College, which at the time, did not have an arts program. He took the lead in creating an arts department. In 1989, he was named Director of Art Programming and Assistant Vice President, positions he still holds today. He designed the college's arts building, "Three Woodcocks", basing the design on a traditional Salish longhouse. He lives in Ronan, Montana and has served on the Montana Arts Council Board since 2008 and the Ronan Consumer Advisory Committee.
Fine art career.
Gail Tremblay on Clairmont's work:
"His work offers a door to revelation and gives indigenous and non-Indian people alike a space to reflect on the dynamics of culture in their lives."
Early work.
Clairmont started creating conceptual artworks inspired by the likes of Beuys and Baldessari, often working as an individual or collaborating with other artists, showing primarily in Los Angeles.
In 1979 he was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Visual Arts Grant which supported him to travel to seven American cities and publish fragments of the statement "Support Subversive Art in Your Community" in major newspapers. Documenting his conceptual project, Clairmont gathered postcards and photographs from the seven cities, sending copies of these materials, and the newspapers, to the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for display. Completed assemblages would allow viewers to see the statement in its entirety.
With "Los Angeles Sidewalk/Survival" (1981) Clairmont photographed 12-inch squares of Los Angeles sidewalks. The images depicted the many faces of concrete in the city: grass growing through cracks, pitted concrete, graffiti, contractor stamps. Each photograph had instructions on the back with instructions on how to survive broken bones, choking, nuclear fallout and other extreme situations. Through this series Clairmont sought to explore "the way differences in how occupants of rural and urban areas interact can create surreal dislocations of imagery and idea."
Clairmont's early pieces reflected many other conceptual works by other artists of the late 1970s and early 1980s, focusing on concerns about nature and the purpose of art. Suffering from feelings of dislocation after leaving the reservation, these works allowed Clairmont to convey the emotional impacts of moving from the Big Sky Country to a large metropolis like Los Angeles.
Return to Montana.
In 1984 Clairmont returned to the reservation, where he became active in community life. He served on tribal committees, worked on the Flathead Resources Organization, attended sweat lodge, and became a teacher and administrator at Salish Kootenai College. He delved into historical studies of indigenous peoples and their relationships with early settlers, specifically the Flathead Indian Reservation and those of his friends off the reservation.
"It's work that I feel is educational and is not just for the native community, but is for everyone that might want to get a better understanding of our Indian people." - Corky Clairmont
Influenced by his research he created two major works of his career about the Treaty of Hellgate. The first work is a reprint of the entire treaty printed in small type on a threefold wallet-sized card, which he distributed and displayed. The second work, "Skunk Prairie Hellgate Treaty Rocks", featured the treaty text written in a spiral shape. Recreating the text of the twelve treaty articles in his own intricate handwriting gave Clairmont an even greater sense of connection to the experience of his community.
After completing the handwritten portion of the work, Clairmont cut his copy into 50 5x7 inch mats, with rectangular cutouts in the center of each mat. These cutouts were taken to Skunk Prairie, a traditional hunting and gathering area of the Salish Kootenai people. He distributed the cutouts under rocks, representing the ongoing relationship of humans and the earth, covered in lichen, photographing them and leaving them as an offering. The photographs were placed in the rectangular cutouts of the mats, then the mats were placed in clear plastic envelopes and displayed in the form of an "X" the wall, representing the signatures of those who signed the treaty.
1990s.
The 1990s saw the Quincentennial celebration of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, which led to a series of commentary artworks titled the "Submuloc Warrior" ("Submuloc" is Columbus spelled backwards). In this heavily charged series, Clairmont uses irony to confront the cities which have been named as a tribute to the explorer and the celebration of the anniversary of North American European colonization and genocide.
The "Grandfather Rocks" series comprised two artworks, one about the murder of Piegan Blackfeet man by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and another about the defeat of Chief Joseph. A series of photographs and text, Clairmont combines the two encouraging viewers to question the historiography of the topics presented in the works.
[[File:Animals bridge flathead reservation.JPG|250px|thumb|right|"Animals' Bridge," on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, used by grizzly and black bears, deer, elk, mountain lions, and others 
This decade also brought the prominence of printmaking into Clairmont's catalog. Heavily layered, his monoprints and prints entail multiple meanings and images, encouraging exploration by the viewer to question the meaning and symbolism within his works. "Turtle X's 93" utilized images of turtles, bears, birds, buffalo, trucks, car, bulldozers, chevrons and photographs of Montana landscape and highways. Combined with bold colors and grayscale, he explored trade, transportation, and the dangerous effects that U.S. Route 93 has had on the reservation and its wildlife. Each image, in the series of 10 prints, proceeds to show the onslaught of traffic into the area, until the vehicles outnumber the animals. In response, Clairmont worked with community members and highway officials to secure overpasses over waterways and pond areas, allowing for safe passage of affected animals.
Video clips of bears, mountain lions, deer, and other animals using the Rt. 93 wildlife crossings are available. As of Feb. 28, 2011, the Montana Department of Transportation reports that "With the majority of the US 93 Evaro-Polson (The Peoples Way) reconstruction work on the Flathead Indian Reservation nearly complete, wildlife, and natural resource managers on the project are now moving into the next phase of assuring the highway is fitting into the landscape and Spirit of Place. The Peoples Way Project set a new standard for mitigating the impacts of roads and traffic on wildlife with wildlife fencing combined with dozens of wildlife underpasses and one wildlife overpass."
Paha Sapa controversy.
In 1993 Clairmont created "Paha Sapa", the Lakota word for the Black Hills, and the location of Mount Rushmore. In "Paha Sapa" Clairmont created life-sized silhouettes of two families, one Indian and one Euroamerican. The silhouetted family members wear reflective sunglasses, with the Euroamerican sunglasses reflecting the presidential images on Mount Rushmore. In contrast, the Indian family sunglasses show four skulls, making a powerful statement about the history of genocide towards indigenous peoples, and simultaneously raising the question of what this largest of all Presidential memorials is actually showing us—do we see the gigantic faces of greatness, or the immensity of death?
Displayed in a group show at the Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art, "Paha Sapa" was viewed by the superintendent of Great Falls schools, who proceeded to cancel all scheduled field trips to the exhibition which celebrated American Indian artists from Montana. The press got wind of the controversy, in which the superintendent defended the decision on grounds of not wanting to expose students to artwork that criticized the government's actions towards Indians. This led to major conversations and dialogue by local and regional residents, who questioned the politically charged artwork and the censorship that took place.
2000s.
New installation work began to form during this decade as well, including "TIME X", using gift shop "artifacts" - trinkets collected from his travels representing "Indians" - in an altar like presentation. Clairmont questions stereotypes, kitsch, and the way that Lewis and Clark's exploration is represented in gift shops and culture in contemporary times.
In 2003 he was rewarded with an Eiteljorg Fellowship for Native American Fine Art. "TIME X", "10,000 Years Indigenous Indian People, 200 Years Lewis and Clark", "Turtle X's 93" and "Split Shield" were exhibited in a group show at the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art.
2010s.
In June 2010 Clairmont co-designed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes veteran memorial with architect Paul Bishop. The memorial, made of granite, forms a large eagle. Each side of the center panel features images of a mounted warrior, one male and one female, on each side, along with buffalos. Images of Salish and Kootenai camps are also depicted, on the wings of the eagle. The panels feature the names of Salish, Pend d'Oreille and Kootenai tribal members who have served throughout the United States military, with room for upwards of 2,600 names, as well as an area for unknown warriors. Seeking inspiration, Clairmont visited with tribal elder veterans for ideas on what the memorial should look like. Upon completing the design, he presented it to community members of various groups for approval. Clairmont on creating the memorial:
"I felt that the Creator and those we are honoring got to me somehow and influenced the concept I came up with. In reality my inspiration came from many forces. I just put what I see together. Even though this memorial is specific to our tribal veterans I can’t help but believe that it honors all Indian veterans."

Coronidium scorpioides

Coronidium scorpioides, commonly known as the button everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous shrub in the family Asteraceae found in Australia. Previously known as "Helichrysum scorpioides", it was placed in the newly described genus "Coronidium" in 2008.
Taxonomy and naming.
Jacques Labillardière described the button everlasting as "Helichrysum scorpioides" in 1806 from a specimen collected in Tasmania. The large genus "Helichrysum" was long recognised as polyphyletic and many of its members have been transferred to new genera. Botanist Paul G. Wilson erected the new genus "Coronidium" for 17 species of daisy of the eastern states of Australia, and it was given its new name of "C. scorpioides" in 2008. Wilson suspects there may be several species within "C. scorpioides" as currently defined, but deferred formally splitting them when revising the genus.
Description.
The button everlasting is a herbaceous perennial plant that grows to 20–50 cm (8–20 in) high from a woody rootstock. The woolly stems rise vertically and are unbranched, and are topped by the yellow flowerheads in spring.
Distribution and habitat.
"Coronidium scorpioides" is found from the Gibraltar Range in northern New South Wales, south through the eastern part of the state into Victoria and southeastern South Australia as well as Tasmania. It grows on heavier more fertile soils, such as brown clay or clay-loam, derived from basalt, or sandstone-shale, in open forest under such trees as narrow-leaved peppermint ("Eucalyptus radiata"), Sydney peppermint ("E. piperita"), brown barrel ("E. fastigata"), grey gum ("E. punctata"), manna gum ("E. viminalis") or Blaxland's stringybark ("E. blaxlandii"), or in more open woodland under scribbly gum ("Eucalyptus sclerophylla") and narrow-leaved apple ("Angophora bakeri").
Ecology.
"Coronidium scorpioides" resprouts after bushfire, some plants taking as little as 16 weeks to flower.

Bill Foster (director)

Billy Ray "Bill" Foster (April 7, 1932 – February 2, 2011) was an American television director known for his work with sitcoms. His credits, which spanned more than fifty years and encompassed hundreds of hours, included episodes of "Full House", "Sanford and Son", "Amen", "Marblehead Manor" and "You Again?".
Foster directed the 1967 pilot episode of "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In", which earned him the only Emmy nomination of his career. Foster went on to direct the television broadcasts of the 23rd and 24th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1971 and 1972 respectively. He also directed the AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to James Cagney in 1974, for which he won a Directors Guild of America Award in 1975. 
In 1986, Foster directed the now infamous live syndicated special, "The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults", which was hosted by Geraldo Rivera. The special, which advertised the potential to find the secrets of Al Capone buried in a vault beneath the Lexington Hotel in Chicago, turned up very little.
Foster spent much of his career directing television sitcoms, especially during the 1970s and 1980s. He directed 43 episodes of the sitcom, "Benson", between 1982 and 1986. Foster also directed 36 separate episodes of NBC's "Amen", which starred Sherman Hemsley and Clifton Davis, between 1986 and 1989.

<doc id="31000053" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31000053" title="Chris Candido Memorial Show">
Chris Candido Memorial Show

The Chris Candido Memorial Show was an annual professional wrestling memorial event produced by the USA Xtreme Wrestling (UXW) promotion and held between 2005 and 2006. The show was held in memory of Chris Candido, who died from a blood clot due to complications from ankle surgery in Matawan, New Jersey on April 28, 2005, with the proceeds and merchandise sales being donated to Candido's late common-law wife and manager Tammy Lynn Sytch and the Chris Candido Scholarship Fund.
Though not the first such event, the show was arguably the biggest gathering of former alumni of Extreme Championship Wrestling prior to the Hardcore Homecoming shows which started that same year. It was also the third major memorial show held for a former ECW star, the second and last one held by UXW, and one of four held for Chris Candido: the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament (2005), the Chris Candido Cup Tag Team Tournament (2007-2008) and the Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup (2009). A second Candido Memorial Show was held by the National Wrestling Superstars, another independent promotion Candido wrestled for, during the same time. NWS promoter Joe Panzarino acquired the rights to promote the J-Cup Tournament that same year which was subsequently renamed the Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup.
The first show was later released on DVD by two companies, RF Video and TCTapes.net; Rob Feinstein and Doug Gentry both made public appearances for the event while RF Video provided additional coverage backstage and conducted interviews with wrestlers and other on-screen personalities in attendance including Candido's younger brother Johnny, The Sandman, Mick Foley, Raven, Balls Mahoney (who also performed as a color commentator), Axl Rotten, DeVito, Corporal Robinson, Ref Hansen, Stephen DeAngelis, Kid Kash, Trinity, Bill Apter and others discussing their memories of Candido. Sean "The Mic" McCaffery, editor-in-chief of DeclarationofIndependents.net, also provided color commentary for TCTapes.net. The show was also promoted by the Minority Report internet radio show by offering those who ordered tickets via Wrestling-News.com to have their photo be taken with Daffney and be the first fans let into the building before the general public.
While the promotion was praised for its tribute to Candido, who had been a mainstay in USA Xtreme Wrestling since 2001, the memorial shows themselves received mixed reviews from critics. Some of the criticism was due to the length of the shows, which ran roughly four hours, and the last-minute substitutions of local wrestlers in place of bigger stars. This was primarily due to promoter Frank Goodman dropping his policy prohibiting USA Pro wrestlers wrestling "double shots", in which wrestlers worked on more than one show a night, causing many of the bigger stars to arrive late or miss the show entirely. D-Lo Brown, for example, wrestled on two other shows on the night of the Candido's memorial. Several other promotions were running shows on the same night including the New York State Wrestling Federation (NYSWF) in Yonkers, New York, the CyberSpace Wrestling Federation (CSWF) in Wayne, New Jersey, and smaller organizations in Pennsylvania. This, in addition to the heavy inbound traffic to Long Island, resulted in more than half the regular roster being absent a half-hour before showtime. It also meant last-minute changes to the card, substituting opponents with local wrestlers or dropping other matches altogether, as Crowbar, "Lowlife" Louie Ramos, Mana the Polynesian Warrior, Billy Reil, Sonny Siaki, Sabu, and Xavier were all unable to make the show. Similarly, Axl Rotten, Sabu and Big Van Vader were scheduled to be on the second show but failed to appear as did UXW sound technician Pat Savino, whose wife had gone into child labor earlier that night, meaning wrestlers were not provided with entrance music.
Among the reviews, GumGod.com's Matt Dawgs called the first event "one of the best UXW shows ever assembled" while Peter Kent of 411mania.com referred to the show as "torture" and gave the show a rating of 1 out of 5. In his review of the second event, John Lynch of DeclarationofIndependents.net wrote the event "seemingly marked the end of one era in UXW and the beginning of another" as many of the promotion's former ECW stars were likely to leave the promotion to join World Wrestling Entertainment's newly formed ECW brand.

Northeastern University Rugby Club

The Northeastern University Rugby Football Club (or NURFC or Maddogs) is a college rugby union team representing Northeastern University, competing in East Coast Rugby Conference and governed by USA Rugby. The team competes in College Division I rugby, against the best college rugby teams in the Northeast.
The Northeastern Maddogs has approximately 70 members from all over the United States, and from countries all over the world, including South Africa, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, China and Japan. The Maddogs field a competitive team every year, and have been nationally ranked.
The NURFC competes in, and is an original member of, the East Coast Rugby Conference that was founded in 2011 during the USA Rugby college re-structuring.
History.
Founding.
The club was founded by a Northeastern University student and rugby enthusiast named Bob Hubbard in 1984. He, along with 14 other students were the first team ever fielded by the Northeastern University Rugby Club. This first incarnation was not affiliated with Northeastern University, its only connection to the school was its players being students. The team's practices were held on a small triangle of dirt on Huntington Avenue across from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which is now the Wentworth Institute of Technology athletic complex.
In 1985, the club became more organized as another key leader named Tony Kalaijakis emerged. Kalaijakis turned the rag-tag group into a team, under him the club drafted a constitution and elected leaders yearly. The team lobbied for school recognition, hoping to become an official Northeastern club, but was denied. Disappointed by the university's decision, but wishing to maintain a connection with the school, the team chose as its mascot, the MadDog; instead of the traditional mascot of Northeastern University, the Husky. 
In spring of 1987, aided by Northeastern University Professor Peter Eastman, the team became an official club of Northeastern. The club then hired its first coach, Jay Dacey of the Mystic River Rugby Club. Competing in its first Beast of the East Tournament, the Maddogs went undefeated and won the 1987 tournament. The following fall the Maddogs joined NERFU Division I and made the play-offs in their inaugural year.
2000 - present.
The NURFC competed in New England Rugby Football Union College Division I from 1987 to 2010, playing against teams such as Army and Boston College. Dartmouth, Harvard, and Yale competed in NERFU until fall 2009, leaving to join the new Ivy League Conference. In the years since its creation, Northeastern Rugby often competed in the Beast of the East rugby tournament, winning it multiple times in recent years including in 2005 with a 21-0 win over Buffalo in the tournament final. 
In 2011 Northeastern along with Boston College, UMass Amherst, University of Connecticut, Middlebury College, UAlbany, and Southern Connecticut State University joined to form the East Coast Rugby Conference. In their inaugural season, Northeastern went undefeated and scoring an average of 37 points and allowing an average of 4 points per game. Their undefeated season led them to the National Championship Round of 16, where they lost to Stony Brook University 24-22. Northeastern's fall 2012 season resulted in a 5-2 record, with losses to Boston College and Middlebury, to finish 3rd in the conference. 
Northeastern, as the winner of the 2012 ECRC Sevens Tournament, qualified for the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, in College Station, Texas. Assigned to Pool A with Life University, Colorado State, and Wisconsin, Northeastern went 2-1 with their only loss coming from the reigning champion Life University, to advance to the bowl bracket. Northeastern was eventually knocked out of the tournament by Cal Poly. After their strong showing at the National Sevens Championships, Northeastern received an invitation to the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship tournament at PPL Park in Philadelphia, broadcast live on NBC.

Casey Abrams

Casey Abrams (born February 12, 1991) is an American musician and multi-instrumentalist from Idyllwild, California who finished in sixth place on the tenth season of "American Idol." He was eliminated from the competition on April 28, 2011, five weeks after becoming the third finalist to be saved from elimination by the judges.
Early life.
Abrams was born on February 12, 1991 in Austin, Texas, to Pam Pierce and Ira Abrams. His father is Jewish and his mother is from a Catholic background, and Abrams grew up in an interfaith family. He spent his early years in the Chicago area, first in Evanston, Illinois, then in Wilmette, where he attended McKenzie Elementary School.
Abrams later moved to California and attended middle school and high school there. He was a student at Idyllwild Arts Academy in Idyllwild, California, where his father teaches film production. At Idyllwild Arts, he studied classical bass instruction and improvisation, and participated in the jazz ensembles, gaining a foundation in music history, piano, and jazz piano, and learning to write musical scores for films.
After graduating from Idyllwild in 2009, he attended University of Colorado at Boulder as a music major. He worked as a film camp counselor at Idyllwild Arts Summer Camp prior to his appearance on "American Idol."
Abrams suffers from ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory disease which causes ulceration and inflammation of the colon, and that occasionally requires blood transfusions, which resulted in his having been hospitalized while on "American Idol."
Abrams lists as his musical influences Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Oscar Peterson, and James Taylor, as well as Marshall Hawkins, head of the jazz department at Idyllwild Arts Academy.
"American Idol".
Overview.
Abrams auditioned for the tenth season of "American Idol" in Austin, Texas. He was selected as one of the Top 24 semi-finalists, but two days before he was due to perform for the semi-finals, he suffered severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital. He was well enough to perform on performance night, and was one of the five male vote receivers to advance to the Top 13; however, he missed the Top 13 results show due to his illness. He was the lowest vote receiver on the Top 11 result show, but was saved by the judges; they chose to save him immediately, stopping his supposedly last performance on the show halfway through it. He is the third finalist to be saved by the judges in three seasons.
Abrams was eliminated from the competition on April 28, 2011, finishing in sixth place. During his last performance he sang "I Put a Spell on You" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, a song he had performed during the semifinals. During the performance he kissed audience members, rolled onto the stage, thanked the judges, and sang the last two words ("you're mine") to fellow contestant Haley Reinhart.
On May 25, 2011, Abrams sang "Fat Bottomed Girls" with Jack Black on the "American Idol" finale.
Post-"Idol".
Abrams appeared and performed on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" in April 2011, and "Live with Regis and Kelly", "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", and MTV's "The Seven" in May of the same year. He was one of the performers in the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2011, which began in West Valley City, Utah in July 2011, and ended in Manila, Philippines in September 2011.
In August 2011, Abrams became a spokesman in a national campaign called IBD Icons to raise awareness of inflammatory bowel disease.
Abrams is managed by 19 Entertainment. Abrams and former "American Idol" season 10 contestant Haley Reinhart recorded a holiday song, "Baby, It's Cold Outside", in November 2011—also released on video.
On January 8, 2012 Abrams signed with Concord Music Group. Abrams’ linking with Concord Music Group marks the second signing of a contestant from season ten to a non-Universal Music Group-owned label. His first album is self-titled, "Casey Abrams". The album was executive produced by Randy Jackson and "American Songwriter" writes that "co-writers on the album include "American Idol" co-producer Iain Pirie and mega-hit songwriters Jason Mraz, Rune Westberg, Martin Terefe, and Toby Gad." The first single from the album "Get Out" was released on June 5, 2012. The album was released June 26, 2012. Performing on the show gave sales of his album a boost of nearly 2,000% over the previous week.

Howardena Pindell

Howardena Pindell, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 14, 1943, to Howard and Mildred (Lewis) Douglas, is an American abstract artist. Her work explores texture, color, structures, and the process of making art; it is often political, addressing the issues of racism, feminism, violence, slavery, and exploitation. She is known for her use of unconventional materials in her paintings including string, perfume, glitter, and postcards.
Education, museum work, and teaching career.
Howardena Pindell is a graduate of the Philadelphia High School for Girls. She received her BFA from Boston University in 1965 and her MFA from Yale University in 1967. After graduating from Yale, she began working at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, where she was employed for 12 years while establishing herself as an artist. Pindell was initially a curatorial assistant, but in 1977 became associate curator of the department of Prints and Illustrated Books.
Pindell is a professor of art at Stony Brook University, where she has taught since 1979. From 1995-1999, she worked as a visiting professor in the art department at Yale University.
Pindell holds honorary doctorates from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Parsons The New School for Design.
Art.
Pindell had known she wanted to be an artist since age 12, but it wasn't until the late sixties that, working at MoMA, she was able to produce her first accepted works. He earliest paintings had been mostly urban scenes, but in the 1970s undergoing a radical transformation as an artist, she began developing a unique style rooted in minimalism and pointillism. As she experimented with the process of creating her paintings, Pindell began making use of the scrap circles that resulted from the production of her pointillist works. As David Bourdon writes, "By 1974, Pindell developed a more three-dimensional and more personal form of pointillism, wielding a paper punch to cut out multitudes of confetti-like disks, which she dispersed with varying degrees of premeditation and randomness over the surfaces of her pictures."
Pindell's first important exhibition was at Spelman College in Atlanta in 1972, and she has exhibited in almost every following year for over 30 years, either as a solo artist, or in a group exhibition. In the 1970s and 1980s she was often aware that she had been selected for exhibition as a token black among a group of other artists, and she spent a great deal of time researching and analyzing the status of black painters in the mainstream art world.
In 1980 she made a video called "Free, White, and 21", in which she appears in a blonde wig, dark glasses, and with a pale stocking over her head as a caricature of a white woman. In the 1990s she painted a series of "word" paintings, in which her body in silhouette is overlaid with words such as "slave trade," while an earlier work about South Africa features a slashed canvas roughly stitched back together and the word "INTERROGATION" laid on top.
Awards.
Pindell has received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in painting in 1987, the Most Distinguished Body of Work or Performance Award, granted by the College Art Association in 1990, the Studio Museum of Harlem Artist Award, and two National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships. Collections of her work are worldwide including Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, The Detroit Institute of New York, Chase-Manhattan Bank in New York, Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn, New York, Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, and The Louisiana Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark.

JWH-424

JWH-424 is a drug from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, but with moderate selectivity for CB2, having a Ki of 5.44nM at CB2 vs 20.9nM at CB1. The heavier 8-iodo analogue is even more CB2 selective, with its 2-methyl derivative having 40x selectivity for CB2. However the 1-propyl homologues in this series showed much lower affinity at both receptors, reflecting a generally reduced affinity for the 8-substituted naphthoylindoles overall.

Jantzen &amp; Thormählen

Jantzen & Thormählen was a German firm based on Hamburg that was established to exploit the resources of Cameroon. The firm's commercial and political influence was a major factor in the establishment of the colony of Kamerun in 1884.
Coastal trade.
Until the later part of the 19th century, most German trade with Africa passed through Hamburg. 
The Carl and Adolf Woermann Firm, established in 1837 by the Hamburg merchant Carl Woermann, entered the West African market in 1849 and came to dominate the trade of the region.
Jantzen and Thormahlen were initially agents of Adolph Woermann's Woermann-Linie. 
Johannes Thormählen was the firm’s agent in Gabon, and Wilhelm Jantzen was the Woermann agent in Liberia.
After they established their own firm in 1875, they maintained contact with Woermann.
Woermann, Jantzen & Thormählen and other German firms controlled a network of trading posts in different parts of West Africa.
About half the trade with Kamerun was German-controlled.
The traders were mainly interested in selling goods including guns and liquor in return for palm products, and had no interest in permanent colonization.
In fact, they preferred to operate informally and without interference from German civil servants, and opposed annexation.
Many felt that African traders working on credit produced better results at lower cost than European agents, who were hard to recruit and were prone to sickness.
The shift toward favoring permanent colonies was driven by two factors: a fall in the prices of African products created a demand to bypass the local African traders and establish direct routes to the interior; and once firms such as Jantzen & Thormählen had established bases and plantations they required military protection.
Annexation of Kamerun.
Trade with the interior of Cameroon was handled by the Duala people settled at the mouth of the Wouri River in the area now covered by the city of Douala. They were led by two "kings" representing the Bell and Akwa factions.
The rival Duala groups were plagued by disputes.
Their leaders sought European protection to support their authority and stabilize trade. 
On 12 July 1884, King Ndumbé Lobé Bell and King Akwa signed a treaty in which they assigned sovereign rights, legislation and administration of their country in full to the firms of Carl Woermann and Jantzen & Thormählen, represented by the merchants Edward Schmidt and Johann Voss. 
The treaty included conditions that existing contracts and property rights be maintained, existing customs respected and the German administration continue to make "comey", or trading tax, payments to the kings as before. 
King Bell received 27,000 marks in exchange for signing the treaty, a very large sum at that time.
On the basis of this treaty between the kings and the representatives of the trading firms, the next day the German Consul assumed the suzerainty of the German Empire over the territory of the Cameroons.
The legal grounds were that the German Emperor automatically assumed any sovereign powers that were assigned to his subjects, but later the Duala leaders were to make many complaints about violations of the treaty intent by the colonial administration.
Plantations.
Jantzen & Thormählen entered the plantation business in 1885, but development was slow, with more interest being shown in railways by investors.
At first, the firm had to depend on imported labor for their tobacco and cocoa operations.
By 1898, Jantzen & Thormählen had their headquarters in Bimbia, in the Victoria District, and lands in Debundscha, Isongo Udje and Mokundange.
The process for acquiring land in the early years was informal. In some cases, the company simply occupied the land and their title was later recognized by the government. Sometimes they paid the local chiefs for the land. In other cases, the government declared an area to be crown land, and sold it to the company.
Eventually, through various mergers, Jantzen & Thormählen created the largest plantation area in West Africa around Mount Cameroon, with of cocoa, coffee, and later rubber, oil palm and bananas.
Johannes Thormälen considered that it was inconceivable that Cameroon could ever be developed through the work of the natives, thinking they were incapable of the organization required and too lazy. He believed that they had to be forced to work the large plantations by more civilized people. 
The population naturally resisted, and the army assisted in hunting for workers, 
Those with children were preferred.
It was common for them to be fed poorly, forced to work 18 hour days and whipped if they slacked off.
Interior trade.
In 1885, it was reported that Jantzen & Thormählen had established a company with capital of ₤500,000 to trade on the Benue River, a major tributary of the Niger River.
When the explorer Eugen Zintgraff tried to create a caravan route from the upper Mungo River to the Adamawa Plateau via the Bamenda grassfields, Jantzen & Thormählen decided to establish a factory at Mundame on the Mungo in 1889 as a trading post for palm products, ivory and rubber.
They also agreed to support a trading expedition further into the interior to Bali, in the grassfields.
At first, they were supported in this enterprise by the governor Julius von Soden.
By 1892 they had built a wooden house and a corrugated iron barracks at Mundame, and were building a store house. They had made a clearing planted with palms, cocoyam, manioc, maize and rice, as well as potatoes and other European vegetables.
However, the enterprise failed in part because of competition from Efik traders from Calabar in Nigeria, using the Cross River route, and in part from local competition from the Bell faction of Duala traders led by Ndumbe Lobe Bell.
Canoe transport was more efficient than steam vessels. 
The Bells had well-established contacts along the river and were backed by British traders who were excluded from the river by the Jantzen & Thormählen monopoly. In 1892, Jantzen & Thormählen closed the factory, partly for financial reasons and partly because von Soden's successor Eugen von Zimmerer had decided to support the Bells on the Mungo and focus on the Sanaga River as a route for direct trade to the interior.
In the mid-1890s, Jantzen & Thormählen made a first attempt to start a station at Yabassi, on the Wouri River. Although this failed, the firm was one of eleven merchant firms that purchased land at Yabassi between 1898 and 1900. The move was probably due to growing competition among Douala traders, who could not afford to be cut off from efficient access to the sources of goods in the interior.
Later years.
In the early years of the 20th century, the firm expanded their production of cocoa, for which there was growing European demand, in competition with the Liverpool firms of John Holt and Ambas Bay. They made major plantings, which were later to lead to a glut on the market.
Business was suspended when World War I broke out in 1914, and after the war the plantations were taken over by the British colony of the Cameroons.

Early life.
McCreery was born to Judy (née Cooke) and Michael McCreery on October 9, 1993 in Raleigh, North Carolina. His parents originally planned on naming him Evan, but changed their minds as they were on their way to the hospital. He is a quarter Puerto Rican; His father, a manufacturing systems analyst for Schneider Electric, was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, to an American father on military duty and a Puerto Rican mother from San Juan who later moved to Aberdeen, North Carolina. McCreerey's mother works as a real estate agent for Fonville Morisey. McCreery has an older sister named Ashley, who attended UNC Charlotte. The two of them were raised in Garner, North Carolina.
Around the age of five or six, McCreery received a book about Elvis from his grandmother, and Elvis became McCreery's earliest musical influence. He began learning guitar when he was around nine or ten years old.
McCreery attended Timber Drive Elementary School in Garner, West Lake Middle School in Apex, and Garner Magnet High School. He participated in all three schools' choruses, and he also sang at his middle school graduation. He sang tenor as a freshman in high school, where he was named Rookie of the Year. In his sophomore year, he switched to singing bass and began singing in his church. He also starred in school production of "Bye Bye Birdie" that year, playing the role of Conrad Birdie. McCreery went on to join a vocal ensemble called Die Meistersingers that was formed by his high school chorus teacher, Meredith Clayton, and with which he performed across the United States.
In 2009, McCreery won a singing contest called "Clayton Idol", which was held by WQDR-FM at the Clayton Harvest Festival in Clayton, North Carolina. After winning, he held several local shows with the radio station, raising money for sick children. Later the same year, he was one of thirty-six finalists in a contest called Rip the Hallways, which featured teenage vocalists from across North Carolina. On the eve of Valentine's Day, 2010, McCreery performed in a variety show called Gift 4, which was held by the town of Garner. In April of that year, he performed at the second annual Boots, Bands, and Bulls benefit concert. Funds from the concert went to Brittany's Battle, a Garner-based nonprofit that supports those affected by cancer. The concert was held in Raleigh, and country singer Jason Michael Carroll also performed.
Growing up, McCreery attended First Baptist Church in Garner. He led the church's youth praise band, Audience of One. In addition to his musical pursuits, McCreery was a member of his high school baseball team. His coach, Derik Goffena said of him, "He doesn't throw terribly hard. His best pitch is a curveball as far as getting people out. If he had to start he probably wouldn't walk more than one or two in a game." McCreery was working as a bagger at Lowes Foods when he auditioned for "American Idol".
"American Idol".
Overview.
McCreery auditioned for the tenth season of "American Idol" in Milwaukee.

In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, McCreery confirmed that he has Puerto Rican ancestry. "Yes, I'm Puerto Rican," said McCreery with a smile. "I have a little bit of J.Lo in me." 
McCreery and Alaina became the final two contestants in the season ten finale. This was the youngest match-up in the history of the series. Alaina was sixteen at the time, and McCreery had turned seventeen since auditioning. He went on to become the series' youngest male winner and second youngest winner overall, after season six's Jordin Sparks, who was also seventeen when she won.

Gosford Kariong Storm

The Gosford Kariong Storm "(formally known as Gosford Giants, Gosford Townies, Kariong Kookaburras)" is a rugby league club based on the Central Coast, New South Wales region of Australia.
Known as "The Storm", wearing Purple, Gold and White it is the oldest running club and member of the Central Coast Rugby League having been originally formed in 1947.
History.
Gosford Storm were formed in 2000 as a result of the "Gosford Giants" and "Kariong Kookaburras" merging.
In 2010 the club entered its first seniors team who were successful in their first season although knocked out in the semi finals by Umina.
In 2011 the club hoped to submit three teams in the seniors competition with under 17's, Open Age and a Second Grade team but was only granted inclusion for an Open Age team. The Open Age team finished the season equal 5th but failed to qualify for the semi finals due to an 8 point difference in for & against.
2012 saw a number of new recruits join the club which the club had hoped would be enough to be accepted in fielding both a reserve grade, and open age team although this was rejected by the Central Coast Division of Rugby League with only an open age team being granted inclusion. However only weeks out from the beginning of the season on the 21st February the club was told that they along with Central Wyong Razorbacks had been excluded from entering any teams into any grades of the central coast competition, despite a number of appeals from both clubs the decision was not reversed and both clubs were forced to close their senior clubs. Both clubs still remain fully active in junior rugby league competitions.
Home Ground.
Gosford Giants originally played all home games from Grahame Park which also played host for all Central Coast Rugby League finals games up until the late 1990s when the ground was redeveloped to be the new home stadium of the North Sydney Bears rugby league football club. However as the Bears never made the move to Gosford the stadium has since become home to the Central Coast Mariners Football Club who compete in the A-League and is currently known as Bluetongue Stadium due to sponsorship agreements.
Following their move from Grahame Park "(aka Central Coast Stadium)", the team's home ground is now Carrington St Oval, Narara NSW.

Sack of Baturyn

Sack of Baturyn (, ) (November 1-2, 1708), sometimes also referred to as the Slaughtering in Baturyn, was a part of series of punishing raids conducted by the Russian Imperial Army against Mazepa and Cossack state. On November 2, 1708 upon the sack of Baturyn its entire civil population was exterminated (~7,000 according to Serhiy Pavlenko), while the "Hetman Residence" was completely obliterated.
Battle events.
Before the storm of Baturyn Menshikov had at his disposal some 20 Dragoon Regiments of some 15 to 20 thousands dragoons. Baturyn at that time was a heavily fortified city reinforced with a high number of artillery. Considering that Menshikov decided to use his diplomatic skills to convince the defenders to surrender and sent down Andrei Markovich with his message. The Baturyn defenders refused and opened fire onto the Menshikov's positions. 
The appointed colonel Ivan Nis of Pryluky Regiment and an interpreter Stefan Zertis were arrested by Serdyuk Guards as saboteurs and attached to artillery guns. Trying to save himself from being executed for desertion Nis was able to sent to Menshikov one of his officers, Solomakha, who pointed to a secret entrance to the fortress. The next morning on November 2 at six o'clock the Russian forces penetrated into the city and, after some two hour of resistance from cossacks, were victorious. According to the official Ukrainian version, after being left completely defenceless the whole civil population of the city was tortured to death.
Losses: Ukrainians, 15 thousand including civilians. Russians, 3 thousand soldiers.

Scenario (artwork)

Scenario is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) computer graphic interactive installation, directed by the artist Dennis Del Favero, and developed in collaboration with scriptwriter Stephen Sewell, AI scientist Maurice Pagnucco working with computer scientists Anuraag Sridhar, Arcot Sowmya and Paul Compton. It is a 360-degree 3D cinematic work whose narrative is interactively produced by the audience and humanoid characters. The title is a Commedia dell'arte term (ʃeˈnarjo) referring to the way dramatic action is dependent on the way actors and audience interact. was developed at the iCinema Centre for Interactive Cinema Research [http://www.icinema.unsw.edu.au at the University of New South Wales.
Description.
"Scenario" is inspired by the experimental television work of Samuel Beckett. It is set within a concealed labyrinth where five humanoid characters have been imprisoned. The characters take the audience through the labyrinth in an attempt to discover the possible ways they and the audience can resolve the mystery of their imprisonment and so effect an escape. Watching them are a series of shadowy humanoid sentinels who track these humanoids and the audience, physically trying to block their escape. 
By rapidly interpreting and responding to audience behaviour by means of a sophisticated AI system, the humanoid sentinels work effortlessly to try and inhibit the audience at every turn. This two-fold dramatic action enables the work to create a narrative that evolves according to how the humanoids and the audience physically interact with each other. This is effected by means of a vision system that tracks the audience's behaviour, linked to an AI system that allows the humanoids to independently interpret and respond to audience behaviour.
"Scenario's" AI system.
The AI system is based on a variant of a symbolic logic planner drawn from the cognitive robotics language Golog developed at the University of Toronto, capable of dealing with sensors and external actions. Animations that can be performed by a humanoid character are considered actions that need to be modeled and controlled (e.g., walking to a location, pushing a character, etc.). Each action is modeled in terms of the conditions under which it can be performed (e.g., you can push a character if you are located next to it) and how it affects the environment when the action is performed. Using this modeling, the AI system plans or coordinates the actions (i.e., animations) of the humanoid characters by reasoning about the most appropriate course of action. A custom 3D behaviour toolset allows the creation of 'scenarios' that exhibit a cycle of cause and effect between the real world and the digital world. Its principal feature is that it allows the cognitive robotic language to implement realistic behaviour in the humanoid characters with a minimum of programming effort.
"Scenario's" environment: AVIE.
"Scenario" takes place within iCinema's Advanced Visualisation and Interaction Environment (AVIE), which consists of a 360 degree stereoscopic immersive interactive visualisation environment with motion and shape tracking systems and a multi-channel audio system. Measuring four meters high and ten meters in diameter, it is a set of state-of-the-art resources that enables the development and study of applications in the fields of immersive visualisation, interactive narrative, and human interaction design. It is located in iCinema's Scientia Facility.

Its founders were two American missionaries from the Methodist Church, Miss "Louise Best" and Miss "Eunice Andrew". Funding was obtained through the efforts of the Methodist Ladies' Societies of the United States of America, as part of celebrations of the Centenary Methodist Mission. 
At first it was just a cottage, but over the years, several buildings were built and the school began offering courses at all levels, from preschool through college, for that is integrated the Methodist College in Santa Maria - FAMES (in the same buildings). The architectural style follows the model of universities in the United States of America, resembling the shape of a house, with a triangular roof and brick wall without coverage.
Originally a school for girls, it began accepting boys in the 1970s. 
Since 2006, the Methodist Colégio Centenário is part of the "Education Network of Southern Methodist" and is directed by a board representing the Methodist Church.

<doc id="31000337" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31000337" title="Fortified Region of Metz">
Fortified Region of Metz

The Fortified Region of Metz comprised the central and most heavily fortified portion of the Maginot Line. The region was established in 1926 as a military organization for the French fortifications along the frontier with Luxembourg and Germany to the east of Longuyon in northeastern France, forming a shield to the north of the industrialized areas of Metz and Thionville. The region was dissolved as a military organization on 18 March 1940, its command personnel moving to the 42nd Army Corps.
The region was divided into four sectors:
The region was given the highest priority in funding, manning and equipment of all Maginot regions.
Creation.
Following the First World War, French defense policy was re-examined at the order of Marshal Philippe Pétain. The 1919 study recommended the creation of a mobile army that could carry war to the territory of an enemy, supported by frontier defenses that would prevent an enemy from penetrating French territory. The second part of the recommendation was to involve the creation of fortified regions ("regions fortifiés") in which an enemy could be confronted. The initially recommended fortified regions included:
The regions were to provide locations in which to confront an enemy and from which to launch an offensive to carry the battle onto enemy territory. The Metz region was considered a potential base for a counter-offensive should border defenses be pierced and Lorraine threatened, possibly using the former German fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg. The previous fortifications of the Séré de Rivières system of the 1880s were designed to defend the frontiers of France that existed following the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had lost Alsace and Lorraine. With the recovery of these territories following World War I, most of the Séré de Rivières forts were deep in the interior of northeastern France and not useful.
The "Conseil Supérieure de la Guerre" ("Supreme War Council") created a committee in March 1920 to study France's newly adjusted frontiers, with Marshal Joseph Joffre as chairman. Disagreement arose between supporters of Pétain, who favored continuous light defenses covering concentrations of troops and construction materials for field fortifications, and supporters of Marshal Joseph Joffre, who advocated fortified regions like the ring of forts around Verdun, that had performed well during the first world war. The committee dissolved without reaching any conclusions.
The RF Metz was again proposed in 1922 by the Territorial Defense Commission ("commission de défense du territoire"), which identified potential invasion routes from Germany into France at three locations: the Belfort Gap, between the Vosges Mountains and the Rhine, and across the Lorraine plateau, the last two directly affecting the Metz industrial basin, home of much of France's coal and steel industry. The CDT recommended that the industrial area of Metz-Thionville-Longwy be protected by new fortifications. The report noted that the frontier with Belgium would be difficult to fortify. The committee's final report proposed a continuous fortification from the Swiss border north to the Lauter, and west to Longwy, with the area of the Sarre, which faced the demilitarized area of the Saarland, left unfortified. The final report recommended three fortified regions:
The CDT's report proposed that offensive operations into Germany should focus on an incursion to establish a line from Konz to Trier, then to Ottweiler, Homburg and Kaiserslautern. No specific recommendations on the location or character of the defenses were made. 
The Commission on Defense of the Frontiers ("commission de défense des frontiers") was established on 31 December 1925 by Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, to once again consider the question of the frontiers. The commissioned was charged with formulating specific recommendations for defenses and for the incorporation of the existing defenses of Metz and Belfort. The report again listed potential invasion routes, listing the area to the northeast of Hunsrück in addition to the previously-identified routes. It reiterated the proposed fortified regions around Metz, Belfort and along the Lauter. The report formalized the concept of the fortified region, to be about in depth, a distance dictated by the range of heavy artillery. The RF Metz-Thionville-Longwy was planned to provide a protected area from which to counter-attack an enemy moving into France along the Sarre, to protect the industrial regions, and to anchor the right flank of the northern armies. The German fortifications of Thionville and Metz were to be incorporated into the region, while the forts of Verdun, to the rear, were to be kept in reserve without renovation
The line of the fortifications was modified in 1927 to leave Longwy exposed, anchoring the right end of the region instead at Longuyon. This allowed optimal siting of fortifications on the heights behind Longwy, rather than contending with the town's basin and its close proximity to the border.
Construction.
The "Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiés", or CORF, was established on 30 September 1927 to oversee the design, financing and construction of the Maginot Line. Its first priorities were the Metz and Lauter regions. CORF built 14 "gros ouvrages" (large artillery positions) and 24 "petit ouvrages" (more lightly armed infantry works), as well as more than one hundred casemates and infantry shelters in the RF Metz. In 1929 an initial appropriation of 1,498,000,000 francs was allotted to the RF Metz, the most expensive region in the Maginot system. The highest-priority positions in the RF Metz were "ouvrages" Rochonvillers and Hackenberg, with work beginning in 1929. A continuation of the construction campaign starting in 1930 resulted in the construction of three more large positions, six lesser artillery "ouvrages", and seven infantry positions. Four interval casemates were built in 1930. At the same time, a program to provide the Line with long-range artillery was gradually dropped as costs mounted. By November 1930 the RF Metz had been allocated 2,298,000,000 francs.
From 1931 new projects were developed to extend the RF Metz to the west from Rochonvillers to Longuyon, and eastward to the Sarre. The left, or western wing was allocated an additional 400,000,000 francs. By the end of 1935, when CORF was disestablished, the sector's positions were being commissioned and garrisoned. However, budget cuts were felt in the eastern wing, where the expansion of several "petit ouvrages" was deferred to 1940, never started after war threatened.
Operations.
The Fortified Region of Metz was organized as the 6th Military Region in peacetime. On 2 September 1939 a general mobilization of French forces was declared. Reserves were called up and the Maginot Line was fully manned. The Phoney War continued into 1940.
The Fortified Region of Metz was disestablished on 18 March 1940, two months before the Battle of France, with Army command exercising a more direct control over the four sectors. At the time of its dissolution, the RF Metz was commanded by General Le Maignon de Kérengat from the Fort de Saint-Julien at Metz. After the dissolution of the fortified region, the staff was transferred to the 42nd Fortress Army Corps, formerly the SF Crusnes.

Cyanea copelandii

Cyanea copelandii is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name treetrunk cyanea. It is endemic to Maui, where there are no more than 250 individuals remaining in the wild. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
There are two subspecies of this plant, but one, ssp. "copelandii", is thought to be extinct. It was native to the island of Hawaii, where it was driven to extinction by feral ungulates such as pigs. The plant was probably also pollinated by Hawaiian honeycreepers, many of which are also extinct.
The remaining subspecies, ssp. "haleakalaensis", has been reduced to a population under 250 by habitat degradation caused by exotic plants and feral non-native animals. The population is divided into three subpopulations. They are shrinking by 25% each generation.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a short-lived shrub which grows as a vine. It occurs in wet and moist forests.

Handpan

Handpan is an expression describing a group of musical instruments resulting from a growing worldwide interest in the Hang, an instrument invented and built by the company PANArt Hangbau AG.
History.
This expression first appeared in the fall of 2007 on the website of an American steelpan producer Pantheon Steel. It was used to describe its own development of a new instrument which was launched as an alternative to the Hang.
Consequently, this term found its way into discussions in the now non-existent Hang-Music Forum on the Internet. The successor of this forum was founded in 2009 and was called handpan.org. The expression "handpan" found wide circulation especially in the context of this forum.
Instruments.
Commercially available musical instruments which are generally included by the term "handpan" are (in the order of their appearance): Caisa, BElls, Halo, Spacedrum, the handpan by Bali Steel Pan, Victor Levinson's SPB, the Blue Point SteelHarp, Dave's Island GAIA and Symphonnette, and the Saraz. Additional instruments are being built but only a small number are available.
Discussion about the term.
The term "handpan" is controversial. Critics point out that the Hang, which all makers of handpans use as a standard model, is essentially defined through its difference to the steelpan. Furthermore, the term "pan" is used for the national culture of the steel bands in Trinidad and Tobago, to which neither the Hang nor the instruments called handpans bear any relationship. Supporters stress the necessity of a generic term. They advocate that "handpan" is a suitable and well-understood new term for the abbreviation of a "steelpan played by hand". It has become a conventionalized expression among those who are interested in these kinds of instruments and there is no better alternative in sight.
The Hang makers of PANArt, Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer, repudiate the expression "handpan" to describe the Hang. "To state it clearly and precisely: we do not make percussion instruments, handpans or hang drums."

Te Onepoto / Taylors Mistake

Te Onepoto / Taylors Mistake is a locality in New Zealand, at the south eastern extremity of Christchurch city. Taylors Mistake is a bay adjacent to the locality, on the north side of Godley Head, on the northern edge of Banks Peninsula.
The name Te Onepoto / Taylors Mistake is one of New Zealand's dual placenames. The Māori portion, Te Onepoto, means short or little beach. For the English portion, the "Lyttelton Times" in 1865 said it was "originally called Vincent's Bay, and more recently Taylors Mistake, owing to the master of a vessel running in here during the night-time, thinking he was about to pass over the Sumner Bar."
Taylors Mistake Surf Life Saving Club was established at the beach in 1916. During World War II, hills above the beach were fortified with two machine gun posts, to guard the Godley Head coastal defence battery. Makeshift baches near the beach have been a source of dispute since they were constructed in the 1890s.

125 West 55th Street

125 West 55th Street, also known as Avenue of the Americas Plaza, is a 23-story, office building located on 55th Street between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The building also has an entrance at 120 West 56th Street, across the street from the Le Parker Meridien Hotel.
The facility, with of rentable office space, was developed by The Macklowe Organization. The building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, has floorplates. The second floor of the building houses Air France's United States executive offices. Macquarie Bank houses its New York representative office in the building. Boston Properties currently owns and manages the building. The building also houses offices of Katz Media, a division of Clear Channel Communications.
History.
The building had a cost of $60 million in 1988 dollars. The Saint Thomas Choir School previously occupied the site, before the construction of the skyscraper. The choir school moved into a new building as the previous one was replaced. Fisher Brothers constructed the building.
Construction on 125 West 55th Street began in 1988. In order to capitalize on a City of New York zoning bonus, the developers planned to have the building's foundation installed by May 13, 1988; buildings in the area installed before a deadline in the northern hemisphere spring of 1988 received a 20% increase in size in order to spur development of western Midtown Manhattan. The developers planned to have tenants begin occupying the building in May 1989. The building was completed in 1990.
In 1991 Air France leased of space in the building, including of office space on the building's second floor and of retail space on the first floor. Air France, which had its previous ticket office at 666 Fifth Avenue and its previous reservation department at 888 Seventh Avenue, wanted a larger ticket office facility and overhauled reservation department offices, so it moved both departments into 125 West 55th Street. Air France opted to move into 125 West 55th Street instead of spending $2.5 million to upgrade the telecommunications systems and remove asbestos at 888 7th Avenue; 125 West 55th Street came with the latest fiber optics systems and did not have any asbestos. Harry Macklowe, the owner of the building, paid for Air France's new fiber optics system. Frederick A. Smith, a Cushman & Wakefield broker who represented Air France, said that the new fiber optics and reservations systems "made the deal." Air France has since closed the street-level retail ticket office.
Beginning in 1992, the airline planned to move its Northeast United States headquarters, its U.S. reservation center, and its New York City ticket office to the building. Around that time Katz Communications signed a lease for of space in 125 West 55th Street, as of July 10, 1991 it was the largest lease in Manhattan in the year 1991. As of November 24 of that year, the Katz lease was the fourth largest lease in New York City in 1991. During that year the National Bank of Canada and Credietbank were tenants in the building.
In the summer of 1992, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae moved 1,200 employees into the building. The firm had consolidated from several previous locations, and occupied eight floors and the concourse level. The 20-year lease was for of space. The LeBouef deal, signed in 1991, was that year's second largest lease in New York City as of November 24, 1991.
Boston Properties acquired the building in 2008. The company spent $444 million to buy the building. In 2010 Katz Media Group renewed its lease until 2027; its renewal gave the company over one third of the building to Katz. Katz, which already occupied floors three through seven, began to occupy floors 11 and 12 and some basement space. Since the lease renewal, Katz has about of space in the building. In 2010 MetLife refinanced a portion of the debt of the building. As of 2011 the building was worth $345 million. In 2011 a former deputy of Harry Macklowe, former head of the Macklowe Group, filed a lawsuit against Macklowe, saying that Macklowe did not share the proceeds of the sale of 125 West 55th Street.
Design.
Thomas L. Waite of "The New York Times" said in 1988, before the completion of the building, that the blue glass sheathing around it "may give it a pastoral sheen." Waite said that the design of 125 West 55th Street is similar to that of the Metropolitan Tower.

Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations

The Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations "CIAT" is an international organization specialized in training and exchanges of information between national tax administrations.
The CIAT is a non-profit international public organization that provides specialized technical assistance for the modernization and strengthening of tax administrations. Founded in 1967, CIAT currently has 39 member countries and associate member countries from four continents; 31 countries of the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country.
History.
Foundation.
After the authorities of the tax administrations of countries of the Americas visited the United States in 1965 to learn about and discuss on site issues of tax administration, Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss, at the time Commissioner and Director, respectively, of the International Assistance Office of the US Internal Revenue Service, had the vision to create an organization that could serve as a permanent forum to address tax administration issues.
A Steering Committee was designated in order to lay the groundwork for a multilateral tax administrators’ organization. The members of the Committee were Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss (USA), Roberto Hoyo and Alfredo Gutiérrez (Mexico), Jaime Ross and Tomás Aguayo (Chile), Menalco Solís and Targidio Bernal (Panama) and Edison Gnazzo and Emilio Vidal (Uruguay). In the meetings held in 1965 and 1966, said Committee drafted the organization’s Bylaws.
In May 1967, in the first General Assembly held in Panama, the Bylaws of the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrators (CIAT) were approved.
In 1997 a change in the Center’s name was approved, becoming the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, to emphasize the organization’s institutional nature.
Evolution of CIAT's Activities.
Until 1977, CIAT’s activities were mainly focused on the organization of international meetings (annual Assembly, conferences and technical seminars), the publication of a newsletter and the creation and maintenance of a library specialized in tax matters. That same year, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed with the Federal Republic of Germany, whereby said country appointed a permanent mission to CIAT, which was of great benefit to the organization and its member countries. The Agreement was in place until 1997 and facilitated CIAT’s entering into the field of technical assistance.
In 1982 and 1983, technical cooperation agreements were signed with France and Spain, respectively, as a result of which permanent missions of said countries were appointed to CIAT’s headquarters in Panama.
In addition, in 1983, the Regional Technical Cooperation Project on the Single Taxpayers’ Registry and Current Account, RUC/CC (as per the Spanish acronym) was undertaken for Central America and the Caribbean, financed by the IDB and administered by CIAT. The Center then started acting as a specialized agency rendering technical assistance services for the tax administrations of Latin America and the Caribbean.
In 1987, in the General Assembly held in Uruguay, the reform of the Bylaws was approved, creating the category of Associate Member Countries. This enabled the accession under such status of Spain and Portugal in 1990, France in 1991, Italy in 1995, and The Netherlands in 1996.
The institutional evolution process continued in the course of the 1990s with, on the one hand, the increasing use of information technology and management tools like strategic planning, and, on the other, the increasing interest and commitment on the part of the European associate member countries, five of which became full members in 2001.
Another significant event in the history of CIAT was the incorporation as associate members of the Czech Republic and South Africa in the Assembly held in Bolivia in 2004, Kenya in the General Assembly held in Brazil in 2006, and India in the General Assembly held in Guatemala in 2009. The last General Assembly was held in Buenos Aires on April 22–25, 2013.
The participation of all these countries has made it possible to significantly increase and improve CIAT’s chances to meet its purpose of supporting the strengthening and modernization of the tax administrations of its member countries.
It is worth noting that the volume and scope of CIAT activities, as well as the number of member countries and associate member countries from different continents has expanded significantly since its creation, which allows us to assert that our Center is currently the largest and major world organization of tax administrations.As such, it has signed cooperation agreements with the most relevant public and private international entities specialized in tax matters.
Head-offices are located in Panama City, Republic of Panama, and its official languages are Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.
Training.
Training activities are mostly in virtual mode and aim to help improve professional standards of tax administration officials through the design and implementation of training programs according to the need of the member countries tax administrations. 
On line courses are offered in the areas of international taxation, tax administration, Human Resources, political and technical aspects of taxation, tax management. 
International cooperation.
Among the main activities carried out by CIAT in this area:
Member States.
CIAT is composed of the tax administrations of 39 member countries and associate member countries -31 countries from the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country. South Africa and India are associate members.

Nathan &quot;Ned&quot; Miller

Nathan 'Ned' Miller (August 2, 1899 in London – January 26, 1990) was a British-born American songwriter, composer, music publisher, and actor who wrote the hit songs, "Why Should I Cry Over You", (a waltz ballad) in 1922, "Sunday" (a jazz standard) in 1926, and "Little Joe" (a jazz standard) in 1931. His music has been recorded by Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Al Jolson, Carmen McRae, Stan Getz, Peggy Lee, the Ink Spots, Johnny Mercer, Benny Goodman, Andy Williams, and many others.
His music has also been featured in weekly TV programs and films.
In 1982, Ned Miller was inducted into the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Golden Circle after having been a member for fifty years.
Early life and career.
Ned Miller was born in London and emigrated to the United States with his family when he was a small child. At the age of seven, he quit school to support his brothers and sisters by singing on the street corner for pennies a day. In 1922, Ned Miller moved to Chicago and joined with Jack Benny on the vaudeville circuit where Benny included him in his acts. From that time on, they became lifelong friends often collaborating on television shows, TV specials, and even musical compositions.
Composer.
Based on his success in vaudeville, Ned Miller began writing and publishing his music in the 1920s and became part of the Chicago jazz sounds and Tin Pan Alley. Before long, his songs were recorded by Victor Records (acquired by RCA Victor), the Virginians' "Why Should I Cry Over You?" in 1922, the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in 1923, and the Jean Goldkette Orchestra in 1926. In 1926, when Jule Styne was only 17 years old and beginning his career, he collaborated with Ned Miller on “Sunday,” which became an instant hit and the first best-selling song for Styne. "Sunday" also became a “parlor song,” popularly sung by friends and family gathering around the piano for entertainment. Art Tatum included the song in a collection of his Parlor Songs. Al Jolson liked the song so much that he helped promote it. “Sunday” later became the theme song for the 1940s radio show of husband and wife team Alice Faye and Phil Harris.The song charted three times in 1927.
Cliff Edwards (Ukelele Ike) took it to number three: Gene Austin (the “Voice of the Southland”) took it to number 11 accompanied by pianist Abel Baer; and the vaudeville singing trio, the Keller Sisters and Lynch, recorded “Sunday” with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra where their version rose to number 11.
“Sunday,” has been performed regularly by a wide variety of noted jazz musicians. Many saxophonists have recorded it: Lester Young, Lee Konitz, and John Coltrane; Ben Webster on two occasions with fellow saxists Gerry Mulligan and Don Byas; Harry Allen with the John Pizzarelli Trio; and Stan Getz with the Oscar Peterson Trio. Other recordings include vibraphonist Red Norvo; trumpeter Sweets Edison; pianists Fats Waller and Hank Jones; and vocalists Maxine Sullivan, Johnny Hartman, Carmen McRae, June Christy, Nat King Cole, Carol Sloane and the Buddy Rich Ensemble.
The multi-Grammy winning vocal quartet, The Manhattan Transfer, closed each episode of their weekly television variety show with the song, "Sunday."
In addition to "Sunday" and "Why Should I Cry Over You", Mr. Miller wrote hundreds of songs during his lifetime, including "Kentucky Lullaby", "Don't Mind The Rain", "What Will You Do", "You Don't Like It—Not Much", "Heartbreaker", "Sicilian Tarantella", and many others.
Jack Benny also collaborated with Ned Miller on several compositions and recordings. For example, in 1922, Jack Benny recorded "Why Should I Cry Over You" in 1922 and co-wrote the song, "You're Sweet That Way", in 1962. In 1976, Irving Fein, Jack Benny's manager and producer, interviewed Mr. Miller for the book "Jack Benny: an Intimate Portrait", where he described their lifelong friendship and artistic collaborations.
Actor.
In addition to his music, Miller also worked for years with Jack Benny on "The Jack Benny Program", television appearances, commercials, and NBC specials. He appeared in 22 episodes of "The Jack Benny Program" between 1961–1965 and often served as a stand-in for blocking shots due to a similarity in appearance. The show earned 20 Emmy nominations during its run and won seven, including two for Benny himself and one for Best Comedy Series.
Legacy.
Long after retirement, Ned Miller continued to write music for his family, friends, and neighbors. Since Miller's death (at 90 years of age), his music catalog has been actively maintained by a granddaughter, Jennifer Gerhold, Ph.D., and his songs continue to be played all over the world.

Calvary-St. George's Parish

Calvary-St. George's Parish is an Episcopal parish in Manhattan, New York City. It was formed in 1976 from the merger of the parishes of three churches which were in close proximity:
With all three parishes facing dwindling enrollment and financial problems, the combined parish deconsecrated the Church of the Holy Communion and sold the church buildings to Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation program, in order to raise money and pay down their debts. Odyssey House, in turn, sold them to nightclub entrepreneur Peter Gatien, who opened the New York Limelight club there in 1983. The buildings are currently the location of an upscale boutique mall called the Limelight Marketplace.
The other two sanctuaries of the combined parish both remain in use.

3G (countries)

3G countries or Global Growth Generators countries are 11 countries economies which have been identified as sources of growth potential and of profitable investment opportunities.
Background.
Prepared in February 2011, a Citigroup report prepared by analysts Willem Buiter (Chief Economist) and Ebrahim Rahbari noted that BRICS (BRIC plus South Africa) countries have "outlived their usefulness". "We hold the view that categories emerging markets, advanced economies, developing countries, BRICS, Next Eleven or the Growth Markets are all labels belonging to classification schemes that either have outlived their usefulness or are unlikely to ever have any," the two analysts said. So, long run continues growths are important, although some of the eleven countries identified are poor today and have decades of catch-up growth to look forward to.
The grouping based on a weighted average of 6 growth drivers:
3G Index Score.
Note: China and India highligted in Gold with Bold text as also BRIC countries. Bigger index means better conditions. GDP per capita measured at 2010 PPP USD. Average growth is average growth in forecast of real GDP per capita measured at 2010 PPP USD.
3G countries.
The most promising growth prospects countries are: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Nigeria, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
China and India as BRIC countries are 3G countries, but not for Brazil, and Russia.
Developing Asia and Africa will be fastest growing regions until 2050, driven by population and income growth, so all of 3G countries came from the both continents (Asia by 9 countries and Africa by 2 countries) and no one from the other continents. Vietnam has the highest Global Growth Generators Index among the 11 major economies, China is second with 0.81, followed by India's 0.71. This holds Vietnam as world's highest potential source of high growth and profitable investment opportunities.
October 2011: Based on a report from the HSBC Trade Confidence Index (TCI) and HSBC Trade Forecast there are 4 countries with significant trade volume growth, i.e. Egypt, India, Vietnam and Indonesia with growth expected at least 7.3 percent per year until 2025.
Others countries.
Iran and North Korea could catch the 3G countries if they achieve political transitions and open their economies. Some might add Argentina, Myanmar, and Venezuela. Whether Mexico, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand will catch 3G countries depends on increasing their domestic saving/investment rates substantially. Some developed countries, such as Ireland, Canada, Australia and the USA could also become 3G countries, as stated in the report.
The Top 10 Largest Economies in the World.
Note: 3G countries are highlighted in green colour and bold text.
Note: There are no 3G countries on the list above, because most of the 3G countries have large populations.

Cyanea dolichopoda

Cyanea dolichopoda was a species of shrub in the bellflower family that was endemic to Kauai. It was discovered in 1990 and has not been located in the wild since 1992. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This Hawaiian lobelioid was discovered in the Blue Hole, a valley on Kauai near the Wailua River. The Blue Hole is deep, nearly surrounded by steep cliffs up to 900 meters tall, and wet, a very high rainfall area filled with waterfalls. Only four plants were ever found, three juvenile specimens and one plant just reaching flowering stage. Because the plant was so obviously an unknown species and was apparently on the brink of extinction, it was given a name. It was not seen again after 1992.
The IUCN has declared the species extinct. The habitat is steep and hard to access. Because it is "very likely" that more specimens of the plant will be found in future surveys, the species was added to the endangered species list of the United States in 2010.

Tim Halperin

Tim Halperin (born May 27, 1987 in Omaha, Nebraska) is an American singer-songwriter. A piano player and vocalist, in 2007 he began performing and recording, and in 2010 his track "We Fight Back" became the theme song for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. He was a Top 24 "American Idol" contestant for season 10, and afterwards released his 2011 debut album, "Rise and Fall", which peaked at #1 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter Chart and #14 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. A Christmas EP, "Under that Christmas Spell" followed in 2012. Since "Rise and Fall", his albums have been released on 24 Hour Distribution.
According to Allmusic, his style is "a soulful blend of modern and classic pop, which has been favorably compared to everyone from Jason Mraz and The Fray to Ben Folds and Coldplay."
Early life.
Tim Halperin was born on May 27, 1987 in Omaha, Nebraska. Exposed to artists such as the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, and Billy Joel at a young age, he began taking piano lessons at the age of six. In middle school he began singing on the worship team at his local church, and soon started playing with bands and singing in choir at Westside High School in Omaha. He has stated he didn't write his first serious song until his sophomore year, and has cited Coldplay, The Fray, One Republic, Ben Folds, and Elton John as early musical influences.
On April 1, 2014, Halperin proposed to his girlfriend, Kylie. They are engaged.
Career.
First releases.
In 2007 he moved to Fort Worth, Texas to begin attending Texas Christian University. While studying business he continued to pursue songwriting, performing at a school talent show his sophomore year.

For the middle of 2008 he was an intern in human resources at the First National Bank of Omaha, while from May 2009 to January 2011 he was a Wyndham Account Rep at Range Online Media in Fort Worth. In 2010, he graduated from the Neely School of Business in Fort Worth.
After graduating in 2010, he debuted a music video for his single "She Runs," posting it on YouTube that July. Drawing a budget of $500 and volunteers, Shot in one continuous take, the video required building several sets on rolling platforms that move with scenes in the video. It was tweeted by Jimmy Kimmel, covered by "New York magazine", and featured in August episode of "The Real World" and MTVU.
Also in summer 2010, Tim volunteered to write a song for a TCU mentor and breast cancer survivor involved with Susan G. Komen for the Cure. “We Fight Back” became the Komen theme song, frequently featuring in their promotional material, including in commercials associated with Belk, Inc. and General Mills. The song went live on iTunes on October 1, 2010, with all proceeds donated to Komen.
"American Idol".
While attending school and working on his debut album in the fall of 2010, Halperin was encouraged by a friend to audition for season 10 of "American Idol". A video of his original track "The Last Song" led to a live audition in Los Angeles, where he was selected as one of the final 24 contestants, becoming the first competitor to perform an original song on "Idol" to qualify for the Top 24. He auditioned in Los Angeles with "She Will Be Loved" by Maroon 5, also performing "Something" by the Beatles as a duet with Julie Zorrilla. His live stage performance at the semi-finals was "Streetcorner Symphony" by Rob Thomas. Hours after his elimination in March 2011 he offered "The Last Song" as a free download, though the track was already in rotation on various radio stations in Omaha.
Association with Kidd Kraddick.
In response to the elimination, on 106.1 KISSFM in Dallas, radio personality Kidd Kraddick started the “Idol Got It Wrong” campaign where each week Halperin would learn a song overnight performed by an Idol contestant, then perform it live on the radio. Audiences voted for the winner, with Halperin coming out on top for nine weeks. Afterwards Kraddick continued to invite Halperin to the "Kidd Kraddick in the Morning" show for appearances, and according to Halperin, "I would not be where I am today without Kidd Kraddick. He went on a limb for me after "American Idol" and never turned back. He believed in my music and in me, and as long as I am around, I will be giving credit to him and stopping at nothing to further the cause of his beloved foundation Kidd's Kids."
After Kraddick's death in 2013, Halperin recorded and released a version of Ben Folds track “The Luckiest,” one of Kraddick's favorite songs. In August 2013 Halperin performed at the first-ever Concert for Kidd's Kids, where he met Ben Folds.
"Rise and Fall".
His debut full-length album, "Rise and Fall", was released on September 27, 2011. He had started work on the album over a year earlier, only to put the release date on hold to fulfill his "Idol" contract. He spent much of 2010 working on the recordings with producer Jordan Critz (The Fray, Third Eye Blind and Lifehouse). According to Halperin, “With this record, because it’s my first full-length album, I wanted to make sure that it was the most me. That it had songs on it that I felt like best represented who I am, not only as a songwriter, but as a person."
It rose to #1 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter Chart, and held that position for 4 days. "Rise and Fall" also debuted at #14 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The CD underwent a second official release on December 6, 2011. The first track on the album, "All You Got," was written for Kidd's Kids, with all proceeds going to the organization.
His first single for "Rise and Fall" and one of the first tracks recorded for the album, “The Last Song,” as of September 26, 2011 was in the top ten on the Singer/Songwriters Songs chart on iTunes. For the music video of "The Last Song" fans donated a budget of $8,000.
"Under that Christmas Spell".
In November 2012 he released the EP "Under that Christmas Spell", which includes five arrangements of classic songs and the eponymous single written by Halperin. The album’s final cover, “I'll Be Home for Christmas,” features Hayley Orrantia on vocals. According to Halperin, “Growing up, I worked on a Christmas tree farm for four years. Around Christmas, people in general are more happy and forgiving.”
According to a review, ""Under That Christmas Spell" is a six-song album that intermixes original tunes and classic covers. Halperin reinvented the hymn-like 'Mary Did You Know' by adding cello and redirecting the listener to the lyricism of the song. In his rendition of 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,' Halperin's sincerity bleeds through as his voice dances over minimalist guitar lines and dainty xylophone."
Recent years.
Halperin contributed vocals to the album "Under Fire" by Green River Ordinance, and his track "Let It Go" was used on the compilation album "Salvation City Hope Compilation CD ", which funded the distribution of suicide prevention resources in schools. He continues to perform and record in the United States, chiefly Dallas/Fort Worth, Nashville and Los Angeles. He has opened for Lee Ann Womack, The Fray, and Kelly Clarkson.
In June 2012, OurStage hosted the first Band Against Bullying live concert event. The "Band Against Bullying" Competition to find an artist to add to the lineup was awarded to Halperin. The concert was held on July 20, 2012, at the B.B. King Blues Club in Times Square, New York City.
Since "Rise and Fall", his albums have been released on 24 Hour Distribution.

Zhejiang Xinhua Compassion Education Foundation

Zhejiang Xinhua Compassion Education Foundation was founded by Mr Wang JiaXuan in 2007. 
The NGO’s main area of concern is that children in rural China often go to school with an empty stomach because they do not have the money for breakfast. This causes them to be malnourished and affects both their mental concentration and physical body growth. As education is seen as a way to improve one’s standard of living and help them to break out of the poverty trap, it is necessary for children to have enough nutrition especially when young. In an experiment conducted by Rural Education Action Project (REAP), results have shown that when kids in China are given vitamin pills, they tend to score better than their counterparts who were not given the pills. 
To solve that issue, Zhejiang Xinhua Compassion Education Foundation has launched a “One Child One Egg” program that ensures that schooling children get an egg a day for breakfast to provide them with the necessary nutrients for mental and physical growth. The program covers 4 main mountainous areas in China namely Guizhou, Gansu, Sichuan and Anhui. An egg a day may look negligible to some but the nutrients contained within an egg can help boost the growth of these malnourished children. Eggs contain high amount of protein, fat, cholesterol and amino acids which are beneficial to a growing child. 
The NGO has also tried to highlight to the society and world on the need for attention regarding this issue, by inviting the media to observe the program. MediaCorp Channel U is one of the media companies being invited to follow members of the NGO to transport the eggs from the farm to the school before the students can cook them for breakfast. The route to the school was uneven and it took great care to ensure that the eggs were not broken, as a broken egg meant that a child would not get his/her egg for breakfast.

<doc id="31000776" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31000776" title="Thurian Age">
Thurian Age

The Thurian Age a specific epoch in the fictional timeline used by Robert E. Howard in his Kull stories. It predates the Hyborian Age of the Conan the Barbarian stories and is known to them as the "Pre-Cataclysmic Age".
The main continent is called Thuria, although smaller continents such as Atlantis and an unnamed Eastern continent exist, as do several island chains. Most of the planet is unexplored wilderness inhabited by "scattered clans and tribes of primitive savages."
The time of King Kull was The Thurian Age is a fictional period within the artificial mythology created by Robert E. Howard, in which the sword and sorcery tales of Kull of Atlantis are set. It is within the same shared universe as the Hyborian Age of Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories, but at an earlier period. The boundary between the two ages is marked by the "Great Cataclysm," which took place ca. 35,000 to 40,000 B.C. When Robert E. Howard began to chronicle the adventures of Conan the Cimmerian, more than forty years ago, he prepared a fictional history of the so-called Hyborian Age which he had created. That "history" dealt not only with the period during and after Conan's life, but also with events some eight thousand years earlier, during the Thurian civilization which produced King Kull, exiled warrior of Atlantis in the days before that continent sank into the surging seas.
A great cataclysm ends the Thurian Age some time after the Kull stories. Several countries sink into the sea, others rise from it, and the rest is devastated by earthquakes and volcanoes. Civilization is destroyed and the survivors attempt to build a new culture but warfare and a Lesser Cataclysm strike, creating the Hyborian "Vilayet Sea" and destroying any last remnants of Thurian society.
Dominant kingdoms.
Six kingdoms dominate the main continent of Thuria. All share a common language and possibly a common origin. East of these kingdoms is a vast desert. The six kingdoms are all part of the "Seven Empires" although the seventh member is never named.
Following the Cataclysm, one of the kingdoms (not Valusia), become the Zhemri people who eventually form the land of Zamora (the people of which in turn eventually become the Romani people).
Commoria.
They are described as having wars with Valusia but it does not appear in the Kull stories.
Grondar.
The kingdom furthest to the east of the Thurian continent, bordering the eastern desert. Its people are less cultured than those of the other kingdoms.
In an untitled draft in "Kull- Exile of Atlantis", Grondar is 1) described as being east of Zarfhaana and having a wasteland, 2) occasionally sending out raiders into the grass savannah that separates it from its western neighbors, 3) Thurania is a named target of these raids, 4) the ancestors of the Grondarans came from somewhere unknown and defeated an older people who inhabited the land now known as Grondar (the remains of the original inhabitants' cities lie in the grass savanah between Grondar and the western kingdoms), and 5) hinted that Grondar didn't have cities similar to those of the west.
Thule.
The name Thule comes from Classical mythology (or pseudo-geography). First described by Greek explorer Pytheas, it is a mysterious land to the north. It has been associated with Scandinavia and Iceland.
Valusia.
The kingdom furthest to the west of the Thurian continent. It was created and initially ruled by Serpent Men until they were overthrown by their human slaves. They attempted to control new human kingdom of Valusia from behind the scenes, using illusionary magic, when mankind's memories of the past wars faded but they were again defeated in a secret war. Finally they created a religion, the Snake Cult, to do the same thing again and almost succeeded. Their power was, however, eventually destroyed by Kull, an Atlantean barbarian who had gained the crown of Valusia by force.
Kull notes, in "The Shadow Kingdom" that the Valusia of his time is a "fading, degenerate" country, "living mostly in dreams of bygone glory, but still a mighty land and the greatest of the Seven Empires". The kingdom is already ancient by his standards: "The hills of Atlantis and Mu were isles of the sea when Valusia was young."
Barbarian societies.
There are three main barbarian societies in the Thurian Age.
Atlantis.
A small continent to the west of Thuria and east of the Pictish Islands. They have colonies on Thuria itself.
Atlantis is an old enemy of the "Seven Empires" (see Dominant Kingdoms) of Thuria and has an even more ingrained enmity of the Picts.
Following the cataclysm that destroys the Thurian Age, Atlantis sinks beneath the sea. The survivors on the Thurian continent are forced back into the stone age by lack of resources but become skilled in this medium and develop an artistic culture. They soon enter a war with the surviving Picts and lose to their superior numbers and stone-age military technology. The survivors of the war devolve back into apes. They eventually re-evolve into humans to become the Cimmerians of the Hyborian Age. In turn the Cimmerians become the Celts, Gaels and Scythians of modern, real world, history.
Lemuria.
Lemuria is a chain of large islands east of Thuria.
Following the cataclysm that ended the Thurian age, these islands sank into the sea. The surviving Lemurians escaped to the east coast of the Thurian continent but were enslaved by an unnamed pre-human race. After enduring more than a thousand years of brutal slavery, the Lemurians were reduced to a state of savagery. They eventually rose up and destroyed their masters, the survivors of whom escaped to the south of Thuria to form the nation of Stygia.
The Lemurians eventually became the Hyrkanians of the Hyborian Age and formed the country of Turan on the edge of the Vilayet Sea. The Hyrkanians played a part in destroying the Hyborian civilisations some unspecified time after the Conan stories. The stories assert they eventually became the Tatars, Huns, Mongols, Pashtuns and Turks of the modern age.
Pictish Islands.
A chain islands far to the west of Thuria and Atlantis. Due to raiding expeditions, they have colonies on Thuria itself. They have an ancient feud with the Atlanteans.
After the cataclysm, the Pictish Islands rose to form the mountains of what would be the Americas. The Picts of the islands would become the Native Americans. The Picts of Thuria fell further into barbarism but remained stable, neither evolving or devolving as other societies had. At first their society held, despite reverting to the stone age, but a war with the surviving Atlanteans halted any advances they would have made. They would become the savage Picts of the "Pictish Wilderness" on the west coast of the Hyborian realms in the Conan the Barbarian stories and the more degenerate Picts of Britain in the Bran Mak Morn stories and real history.
In literature.
Pulp fiction author Robert E. Howard wrote extensively about his romanticized version of the Picts, especially in his short stories revolving around the fictitious character Bran Mak Morn, but also in many other of his stories. Howard's contemporary and friend, horror writer H.P. Lovecraft references Bran Mak Morn in his short story "The Whisperer in Darkness".
Rudyard Kipling, author of The Jungle Book devotes several chapters to the Picts in his book, Puck of Pook's Hill.
Historical fantasy author Juliet Marillier's series, The Bridei Chronicles, tells of the Picts and Gaels in the sixth century A.D. Nancy Farmer's book The Sea of Trolls, depicts fictional Picts. Anne Rice also wrote of fictional Picts, crafting them into the Taltos for her book series The Lives of the Mayfair Witches.
The 2004 film King Arthur depicts the Picts (called "Woads" in the film) as tattooed and painted savage forest people, led by the dark magician Merlin. Originally enemies to Arthur and his knights, they later unite to defeat the Saxons at Badon Hill. Neil Marshall's 2010 film Centurion features a conflict between a band of Picts and the Roman Ninth Legion
Other kingdoms.
Another mysterious kingdom lies on the east coast of the Thurian continent. They have some contact with Lemuria but come from another continent entirely to the east of the Lemurian islands.
The Kull story "The Shadow Kingdom" refers in passing to two other countries, Mu and Kaa-u. Mu sinks during Cataclysm and its mountains become the islands of the South Seas.
An untitled draft in the "Kull of Atlantis" stories mentions 3 other nations: Farsun (enemy of Thurania, described as west of Valusia), Zarfhaana (east of Valusia, the Camoonian Desert separates the two and there is a sea to the north of Zarfhaana), and Thurania (south of Zarfhaana, enemy of Farsun).
Pre-human societies.
There are other "equally civilized" but non-human kingdoms. The citizens were of one or more older, pre-human races. One such mysterious pre-human civilization exists at the south of Thuria, this country is, at first, untouched by the Cataclysm. When the oppressors of the Lemurians are overthrown, however, the survivors escape to this region and destroy it in turn, creating the new country of Stygia.

Jonathan Singletary Dunham House

The Jonathan Singletary Dunham House, located in Woodbridge Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States (the state's first Township, chartered on June 1, 1669 by King Charles II of England), is a house that was built around 1700 by Jonathan Singletary Dunham (January 17, 1640 – September 6, 1724), an early American settler and freeholder who built the first gristmill in New Jersey nearby the house.
Jonathan Dunham was born in Newbury, Massachusetts and married Mary Bloomfield with whom he later moved to present day New Jersey. Bloomfield is a relative of Joseph Bloomfield, Governor of New Jersey, for whom the township of Bloomfield, New Jersey is named. After building the first gristmill in New Jersey, he went on to serve the community in a variety of ways and was elected to the New Jersey Provincial Congress in 1673.
History.
The of land upon which the house and gristmill were built was granted to Jonathan Dunham by the newly appointed Governor of New Jersey. The Dunham house is the oldest building in Woodbridge Township, and among the oldest buildings in Middlesex County. Originally a two-story, four room home, the house was built with brick from Holland which had been used as ballast in ships. The Flemish bond brickwork, also known as Dutch bond, makes a distinctive checkerboard pattern that is visible on the first and second floors of the façade. As Dunham's allegiance was with the American Continental Army, the house was used as a garrison by American soldiers during the American Revolution. The mill, a tidal mill, was located just south of the home, along the Woodbridge River, which was then known as Papiack Creek, at the intersection of the Port Reading Road.
Today.
Since 1873, the home has been part of the grounds of Trinity Episcopal Church (Woodbridge Township, New Jersey), listed on the New Jersey and national registers of historic places. Jonathan’s youngest son, Benjamin Dunham, is recognized as a founder of the church, and the house his father built now serves as the Rectory. One of the original circular millstones used by Dunham in his grist mill operations still exists and is displayed on the property.

Elizabeth Branwell

Elizabeth Branwell (1776, Penzance, Cornwall, England - 29 October 1842 Haworth, Yorkshire, England) was the aunt of the literary siblings Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë and Anne Brontë. Referred to as "Aunt Branwell" she helped raise the children after her sister, Maria Branwell, died in 1821 and managed the household until her own death in 1842.
Early life.
Elizabeth Branwell was one of twelve children born to Thomas Branwell and Anne Carne in Penzance, Cornwall. The family was very successful in the import and export trade, and her father owned a brewery, an inn, and the largest grocers emporium in the town. The close-knit family was broken up by the death of Thomas Branwell in 1808 and of his wife the next year. Maria Branwell moved north to Yorkshire where she met her husband, Patrick Brontë, while Elizabeth most likely moved in with her married sister, Charlotte. This sister was the namesake of Maria's daughter, Charlotte Brontë. Not much is known of Elizabeth's remaining time in Penzance, but she was a member of polite society and she had a private income of £50 which would have allowed her to live comfortably.
'Aunt Branwell'.
Elizabeth Branwell visited Maria in 1815 in Hartshead, Yorkshire where Patrick was curate. She would have then met her nieces Maria and Elizabeth, the later of which was her namesake. Elizabeth helped her sister's family move to Thornton, Yorkshire where Patrick was offered a larger living. She stayed on with the family for a year and helped with Maria's confinement with Charlotte, born in 1816. Elizabeth Branwell returned to Penzance soon after the family settled in at Thornton. In the summer of 1821 she would be called back to Maria's side, this time in Haworth, Yorkshire, where her sister was suffering from uterine cancer. Maria died on 15 September 1821. Elizabeth decided to stay on, temporarily, to help take care of Maria and Patrick's six children.
Aunt, mother, friend.
When Elizabeth Branwell took over the care of her nieces and nephew, the oldest, Maria, was seven years old while the youngest, Anne, was only twenty months. Elizabeth, at 45, was considered a spinster and though she missed the warmth and familiarity of her Cornish homeland, she stayed in the cold and secluded Haworth to help Patrick raise and educate his children. She kept the family on a strict routine and was mostly concerned with running the house and caring for the little ones. When the two eldest girls, Maria and Elizabeth, died from tuberculosis contracted at the Cowan Bridge School, Patrick decided to keep the children at home where he and Elizabeth would oversee their education. Branwell Brontë, the only boy of the family, especially doted upon "Aunt Branwell" as he craved a mother figure in the wake of the death of his own.
Influence on Brontës.
Elizabeth Branwell subscribed to several magazines that the children enjoyed reading as youths. Charlotte remembers "reading them by stealth and with the most exquisite pleasure." Elizabeth also continued to receive her annual income and needed very little money to live upon. As a result she was able to fund many of the Brontë's adventures that would otherwise have proved impossible. She gave the girls money to open a boarding school, though the project failed to attract any pupils. She also paid for Charlotte and Emily's trip to Brussels to study French.
Death.
Elizabeth Branwell unexpectedly fell ill in October 1842 with a bowel constriction. Charlotte and Emily were in Brussels at the time and were notified of their aunt's illness. It was too late however, as Elizabeth died four days later on 25 October 1842. Branwell, rumoured to have been Elizabeth's favourite, was devastated. He wrote to a friend "I have now lost the guide and director of all the happy days connected with my childhood." She was buried in the family vault near the remains of her sister and two nieces.

2011–12 Florida Panthers season

The 2011–12 Florida Panthers season was the 19th season for the National Hockey League franchise that was established on June 14, 1993.
The Panthers enjoyed a resurgence on the backs of their "We See Red" campaign, and qualified for the playoffs, 12 years after their previous playoff appearance in the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, and also won their division for the first time. However, the Panthers could not further their progress, losing in the opening round to the New Jersey Devils who would go on to be the Stanley Cup runner-up. The Panthers had a 3–2 lead in the series before dropping games 6 and 7 to be eliminated from the playoffs.
Off-season.
On June 1, 2011, the Panthers introduced their new head coach, former NHL player Kevin Dineen. Dineen had spent the previous six seasons coaching the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League.
Regular season.
The Panthers had their first quality season in over a decade in 2011–12, having never finished above 3rd place in the Southeast Division since 1999–2000. Despite losing more games than they won, competition for the Panthers within the Division was not fierce, and the team was in 3rd place in the Eastern Conference as the Southeast Division Leader throughout much of the season. Although the Panthers amassed more losses than wins, 18 of these losses were in overtime or a shootout (the highest number of any team in the NHL for the 2011–12 season), meaning Florida often gained a point even when they failed to come out on top.
Playoffs.
The Panthers clinched a playoff berth on April 5, 2012, securing the return of playoff hockey to South Florida for the first time in 12 years. The third-seeded Panthers had home ice advantage by virtue of winning their division, despite the sixth-seeded New Jersey Devils besting them in regular season point totals (102 to 94). The Devils won the first game of the series but the Panthers bounced back with a win in Game 2 to even the series as it headed to New Jersey. The Panthers would return the favor by winning Game 3, 4–3, but the Devils recorded a shutout in Game 4, 4–0. The Panthers returned home to play Game 5 and were one win away from winning their first post-season series since 1996 after notching a shutout of their own, 3–0. The series went back to New Jersey for the final time of the series, with the home team tying the series after winning Game 6 in overtime, the first extra period of the series. The seventh and deciding game went even longer than Game 6 after the Panthers managed to score two power-play goals in the third period to force overtime. The game—and series—was still even after the completion of one extra period. Less than four minutes into the second overtime, the first shot on goal by either team was recorded by Devils rookie center Adam Henrique and notched his second goal of the game and deciding goal of the series, eliminating the Panthers from the playoffs, 3–2.

<doc id="31000879" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31000879" title="Operation IceBridge">
Operation IceBridge

Operation IceBridge is a 2009–2016 NASA mission that aims to monitor changes in polar ice from a fixed-wing aircraft. It is a temporary replacement for the ICESat satellite.
Equipment.
Since 2003 NASA has used a satellite, ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite), for observing polar ice. ICESat was retired in February 2010 due to a technical malfunction, leaving NASA without a satellite dedicated to ice observance. A new satellite is not expected to be launched until 2016. NASA therefore introduced the IceBridge program which utilizes an aircraft to make similar measurements.
IceBridge flights began in October 2009 using a DC-8. Beginning in 2010, the DC-8 was joined by a P-3 Orion and other aircraft such as a King Air B-200, Gulfstream G-V and Guardian Falcon.
There are tradeoffs to using an aircraft instead of a satellite. One drawback is that a satellite can observe a far wider area. Also, satellites take measurements full-time, while IceBridge aircraft measurements are limited to annual campaigns that are several weeks long. Aircraft, however, have the advantages of being able to carry more instruments and target and focus on scientifically interesting areas instead of just flying a fixed path. Also, certain instruments such as ice-penetrating radar only work from the lower altitudes afforded by aircraft like the P-3 Orion and DC-8.
Instruments.
IceBridge aircraft carry a suite of specialized science instruments. Among these is the Airborne Topographic Mapper, a laser that measures the surface elevation of the ice. Also on board is a Gravimeter, an instrument capable of measuring the shape of cavities in the ice. There are numerous other pieces of equipment on board, including the Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor, the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder, a Snow Radar, a Ku-Band Radar Altimeter, a magnetometer and the Digital Mapping System.
Laser Altimeters.
Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) – The Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a laser altimeter that bounces laser light off ice surface and measures how long it takes for the light to return. By combining this timing data with information about the aircraft's position and attitude, researchers can calculate ice elevation. By flying over the same areas of ice year after year, they can build a time series of changes in elevation. This instrument works similarly to the lidar instrument used in ICESat and is helping maintain a record of elevation changes until ICESat-2 becomes operational.
Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) - The Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) is a laser altimeter optimized for operation at higher altitudes. LVIS was created by scientists at the Laser Remote Sensing Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. LVIS has flown on a wide variety of aircraft such as NASA's P-3, DC-8, B-200 and HU-25C Guardian Falcon and NSF's Gulfstream G-V. By flying at a higher altitude, LVIS can survey larger areas and expands IceBridge's range.
Radars.
Operation IceBridge uses four different radar instruments operated by the operated by the Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) at the University of Kansas. Indiana University provides data management services for CReSIS activities in Operation IceBridge.
Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS) - The Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS) is used to measure ice thickness and map beneath the ice. This instrument uses multiple channels and a large range of radar frequencies to image internal ice layering and bedrock beneath ice sheets. Information on sub-ice terrain is useful for modeling ice sheets.
Snow Radar - The CReSIS Snow Radar instrument is used to measure the thickness of snow layers on top of land and sea ice. Measuring snow thickness is crucial for estimating sea ice thickness.
Ku-band Radar Altimeter - IceBridge also carries a Ku band radar altimeter, which can penetrate snow layers to measure sea and land ice surface elevation.
Accumulation Radar - The accumulation radar instrument is used to gather high-resolution data on the top part of ice. Looking at the uppermost part of ice allows researchers to map past snow accumulation rates.
Mapping Instruments.
Digital Mapping System (DMS) - The Digital Mapping System (DMS), created by researchers at NASA's Ames Rsearch Center, is an airborne digital imaging system that is used to detect openings in sea ice and build high-resolution maps of polar ice. The DMS instrument is a downward-facing digital camera that captures multiple individual frames that are combined into image mosaics using computer software.
Gravimeter - Operation IceBridge also uses a gravity-measuring instrument known as a gravimeter. This instrument measures the strength of gravitational fields beneath the aircraft, which researchers can use to determine the shape of water cavities beneath floating ice shelves. Because water has a lower density than rock areas of floating ice show weaker gravitational fields than areas with rock underneath.
Magnetometer - The NASA P-3 Orion carries a magnetometer that can be used to gather data on the properties of sub-ice rock. Density and magnetic properties can be used to infer bedrock type, which is helpful for determining sub-ice basal conditions.
Research.
The project, headed by Michael Studinger from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, uses a suite of airborne science instruments to get a three-dimensional view of Arctic and Antarctic ice. The mission's goals are to monitor changes in polar ice, gather data for predictive models of ice and sea-level rise and bridge the gap in measurements between NASA's ICESat and ICESat-2 satellites. IceBridge achieves this by collecting data from specific glaciers. Pine Island Glacier is one such area of focus. There, Operation IceBridge has been observing the underside of the ice-sheet using an advanced radar, as well as closely monitoring an area of Pine Island Glacier, known as the ice tongue, that, were it to melt, would allow a large portion of the glacier to slide into the Amundsen Sea.
In August 2013 the discovery of the longest canyon on the Earth under the ice sheet, was reported, based on the analysis of data from IceBridge.

The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush

The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush (also known as Benjamin Rush, Rush Arts, or simply Rush) is a public, magnet high school located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Rush Arts is known for placing its focus on both academia and the visual/performing arts, as well as encouraging creativity and the development of strong critical thinking skills.
Mission Statement.
"Our special admissions school is based on the belief that the arts provide an unequaled opportunity to foster intellectual growth by connecting arts and literacy. Visual and media literacy skills will permeate all subjects at the high school. Reflective teaching and learning will be expected in every classroom with an emphasis on building a community of learners to be thinkers and creators, and who are preparing for college or professional careers. At the same time, the school will prepare students to be participating members of a democratic society by engaging them as stakeholders in their education. The spirit of intellectual curiosity will be encouraged in and through the arts."
Core Values.
Rush Arts embraces a set of core values, abbreviated as "ICEPAC." All students are expected to both follow and help enforce this moral code; to serve as a reminder to everyone, it is depicted in both classrooms and hallways on posters.
Academics.
Each student at Rush Arts auditions for one specific "major" out of the five that the school offers. These are the visual arts (which have graphic, media, and fine arts as three subcategories), dance, theatre, instrumental music, and vocals. Students generally stick with one major throughout their high school career; while they have the option of switching majors, this requires a re-audition and acception into that field.
Athletics.
The school competes as a representative of PIAA District XII, Public League. The teams' mascot is the knight, while the team colors are purple and black. Rush Arts offers girls' volleyball, boys' varsity basketball, girls' junior varsity basketball, girls' varsity soccer,junior varsity baseball, and junior varsity softball3 v. 3 basketball, and indoor soccer.
Extracurricular activities.
Since its establishment, The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush has offered a number of extracurricular activities for students to participate in. Among these are...
In addition, many teachers will stay after school on specified days to aid students academically.

Friday Night Blues

"Friday Night Blues" is the title of a song co-written by Sonny Throckmorton and originally recorded by him. Throckmorton's version of the song went to number 89 on the Hot Country Songs charts in 1980, released on Mercury Records with "It Always Rains on Me" on the b-side.
Only one month after Throckmorton's version charted, John Conlee released his own rendition of the song, from his album of the same name for MCA Records. Conlee's version charted at number two on Hot Country Songs. Conlee's version of the song was the first credit for session guitarist Brent Rowan, who soon became the only guitarist that Conlee used under the production of Bud Logan.
Song content.
The couple at the focus of this song is living in a dying relationship. The husband has been on the road all week on business, and tired out when he arrives home on Friday afternoon, wants to sit on the couch, watch the 6 p.m. news and relax. Meanwhile, his wife is getting dressed for a night out on the town; when she tries to ask him to accompany her, he flatly declines, leaving her with the "Friday night blues." The wife's feelings of loneliness for her oft-absent husband build through the week, as she converses with a neighbor about married life.

Haunchyville

Haunchyville is a mythical village of dwarfs in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. It is rumored to be located near Mystic Drive in Muskego, WI.
History.
Locals say that within the woods near Muskego, Wisconsin lives a conclave of dwarves whose homes are built-to-scale and in the woods. In the mythical village is said to live an old albino man, who serves as their protector. Legend has it, if trespassers are caught, the unruly dwarves cut their legs from the knees down, so they are forced to live like one of them.
Origin.
According to the legend, after continuous exploitiation of a number of circus dwarfs, they revolted against their ring leader. After killing their master they hanged him in a wooded area, after first cutting off his arms and legs. To avoid being arrested, or even worse consequences from the circus community, the dwarves set out to create their own community, built exclusively for dwarves.
The Protector.
The story goes that in the woods lives an old man, among the dwarfs. He is said to wait at the end of Mystic Drive, shot-gun in hand, to ward off anyone trying to cause trouble to the dwarves.
The story also goes that he first met the group of dwarves as a child. As a young boy he accidentally stumbled upon Haunchyville, upon instantly treating them as equals, they sheltered the young boy and raised him as one of their own. As he grew up, he notoriously defended the dwarves, often resorting to violence.

George James Bruere

George James Bruere (born 1720/21, died 10 September 1780) was the British Governor of Bermuda from 1764 until his death.
Of all Bermuda's governors since 1612, his term of office was the longest.
He had a difficult time during the American Revolutionary War and is thought to have died of stress caused by the interplay of Bermudians and Continental rebels.
Life.
Born about 1721, on 17 July 1743 Bruere married Elizabeth Neale, daughter of Richard Neale by his marriage to Anne Pendock, in St Mary's Church, Nottingham, England.
After an early career as a British Army officer, Bruere was appointed as Governor of Bermuda in 1764. Previously serving in the Army with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he arrived in Bermuda on the "Prince of Wales" in August 1764, bringing with him his wife and nine children.
He has been described as "a benign, simple and kindly man with a large family" and by the historian Sir John William Kaye as "a staunch royalist... loyal to the core". However, Kaye reports further that 
Governorship of Bermuda.
On taking up his appointment as Governor, Bruere was taken aback by the way slaves were treated in the Bermuda islands. He made a speech to the House of Assembly of Bermuda in 1766 in which he proposed the need for stricter controls, including "...haveing the Doors lock'd where they are, under the inspection of a white Person". Familiar with the control of slaves in other colonies, he advised the Bermudians: 
On 21 March 1767, the House of Assembly resolved to appoint a Committee consisting of its Speaker and eleven other members to address His Majesty the King on "the tyranny and oppression of the Governor" if they deemed it necessary during the House's adjournment.
Bruere was interested in agriculture, and he and his wife bought of land to the north of St George's to grow grapes, hoping to produce the equivalent of Madeira.
American War of Independence.
On 20 August 1774, Bruere wrote to the Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Dartmouth, that some Bermudians were showing sympathy for the rebellion on the North American mainland: 
In 1775, after the Battle of Lexington, the Continental Congress announced a trade embargo against British colonies remaining loyal to the Crown. Bermuda offered to supply the Patriots with salt, but they were unimpressed and asked for gunpowder. Meanwhile, in June 1775 Bruere lost his son John, who was killed fighting on the British side at the Battle of Bunker Hill. On 14 August, to the fury of Bruere, Bermudians sympathetic to the Revolution stole the island's supply of gunpowder from the Powder Magazine in St George's and shipped it to the rebels. Trade with Bermuda developed, for which Bruere was not blamed in London.
This was despite the implication of his Bermudian relatives in the act of treason. The President of the Governor's Council, and occasional acting Governor, was Henry Tucker, the husband of Bruere's daughter, Frances. Henry's father, a Colonel of the Militia, as well as Henry's brother, St. George Tucker, were suspected of involvement in organising the gunpowder theft. Colonel Henry Tucker had been one of the Bermudian delegates to the Continental Congress, and had met with Benjamin Franklin, with whom he is believed to have orchestrated the gunpowder theft. St. George had moved to Virginia to study law in 1772. He later moving to South Carolina, which had been colonised from Bermuda in 1670 by William Sayle (and which still had a sizeable and important enclave of Bermudians). He served during the American War of Independence as a colonel in the Virginia Militia. Another of Henry's brothers, Thomas Tudor Tucker, had emigrated to the continent before the war, and was serving in the rebel administration (he later became the longest serving Treasurer of the United States, as well as serving as a US Congressman and Senator). It has been suggested that George Washington (possibly unaware of the plotting of Franklin and Colonel Tucker) wrote the letter addressed to the people of Bermuda, which had sparked the treason, at the suggestion of Thomas, and that it had been delivered into the hands of his relatives in Bermuda. The theft, during which a visiting French officer was murdered and buried on the spot, was organised by persons highly-enough placed that no one was ever prosecuted.
The letter from Washington had read:
In 1776, in the course of the American Revolutionary War, Admiral Lord Howe sent two Royal Navy sloops of war, HMS "Nautilus" and "Galatea", to Bermuda with the task of stopping the trade between Bermuda and the Colonies in rebellion. In 1777, American forces (reportedly Bermudian expatriates, familiar with local waters) briefly seized control of the fort and battery near Wreck Hill on Bermuda's Somerset Island, a strategic position for the protection of the West End Channel, one of the few passages through the ring of reefs. The Bermudian militia men retreated, and the Americans spiked the fort's guns and destroyed its walls, then withdrew before local forces could retaliate. Between 1778 and 1780, Bruere commissioned several privateers, which were fitted out in Bermuda, "to cruise against the French, Spanish, and Americans".
During the early years of the war, however, when rebel sympathy was strongest, Bermudians reportedly built large numbers of Bermuda sloops for sale to the Americans, via neutral ports, for use as privateers.
Death.
Exhausted by his last years in office, Bruere became ill in July 1780, probably a result of chronic stress, and he died in St George's on 10 September 1780, at the age of fifty-nine. He was later said by the historian Henry Wilkinson to be "the victim in the eyes of his family of five years of incessant strain and foul play", in particular caused by the dealings of the islanders with the rebel colonists. Perhaps because he was said to have died of yellow fever, he was buried under the floor of St Peter's Church, St George's.
Sir John William Kaye noted that 
Bruere was succeeded as Governor by his son, George Bruere (1744–1786), who as a lieutenant in the 18th Regiment of Dragoons had been wounded at Bunker Hill, and who in 1777 had married Martha Louisa Fatio, then aged fourteen. The younger Bruere was Lieutenant Governor of the Bermudas from 1780 to 1781.
A surviving portrait of Bruere "(pictured)" is attributed to John Russell, RA and now hangs in the Tucker House Museum (located in the former home of President Henry Tucker), St. George's.
In 2008, Bruere's skeleton was unexpectedly found under the floorboards of St Peter's Church when archaeologists from Boston University were searching for evidence of the foundations of the original church on the site, built in 1612. His wooden coffin had crumbled away, but a copper plate supposed to be from the top of the coffin was found in the skeleton's chest cavity, bearing the inscription "His Excellency / George James Bruere ESQr / Governor of Bermuda / And Lieut. Colol. In His/ Majestys Service OB / The 10 September 1780/ AE 59 Years". The vicar of the church commented that he had no record of the funeral. From the bones, it was estimated that Bruere was , in height, which was about the average for the 18th century.
Children.
Bruere had at least nine children: William; George ("ca." 1744–1786); John (killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill, 1775); Frederick; Elizabeth; Pendock; Frances (born 18 May 1749, Bermuda, died 20 November 1813, Cheltenham); Charlotte (born 1762, at Alderston, East Lothian, died 22 February 1827); and James (1765–1838).
Bruere's son William Bruere became Secretary to the Government of the Bengal Presidency of British India and a member of the Council of India. He married Anne Sadleir, and their daughter Nancy Sadleir Bruere married in 1804 William Otter, later Principal of King's College London and Bishop of Chichester.

The Little Dragons

The Little Dragons (also known as Karate Kids U.S.A. or simply Karate Kids) is a 1980 American film about two young brothers who use their karate skills to rescue a friend after she is held captive for ransom. Produced and directed by Curtis Hanson. Starring Charles Lane, Ann Sothern, Chris Petersen and Pat Petersen
Synopsis.
Brothers, Zack and Woody (portrayed by real-life brothers Chris and Pat Petersen) are young karate students who embark on a weekend camping trip with their grandfather J.J. (Charles Lane). Along the way they meet a new friend, Carol Forbinger (Sally Boyden) and her parents (Rick Lenz and Sharon Clark). When the Forbinger family encounters a tough-talking backwoods mother (Ann Sothern) and her two bumbling sons (Joe Spinell and John Davis Chandler) who decide to hold Carol captive believing they can collect a sizeable ransom, the "karate kids" must find a way to use their martial arts skills to rescue the Forbinger girl with a little help from their grandfather and some new friends they meet along the way.
Production.
Although most online sources list the film as being released in July 1980, the Petersen brothers, Chris (born in 1963), and Pat (born in 1966) appear to be notably younger than in their various other roles during that same year. Indicated by their youthful appearance and hairstyles, the film appears to have been most likely filmed sometime between 1977 and 1978.
Originally released in 1980 as ""The Little Dragons"", the film was later released on VHS by Active Home Video in 1984 under the same title, but with the new tag line: "The karate kids to the rescue!" in order to take advantage of the popularity of the hit film "The Karate Kid" released that same year. The film was later re-released on VHS by Magnum Video in 1991, this time retitled as ""Karate Kids U.S.A."". Subsequent DVD releases in the U.K. and the U.S. used shortened versions of both titles, retitled simply as ""Dragons"" and ""Karate Kids"" using the tag line: "Before the Karate Kid, there was The Karate Kids!"; however, the most recent 2009 Music Video Distributors DVD has been released under the film's original title, ""The Little Dragons"" this time with the tag line: "Meet the REAL Karate Kids...".
Although intended to be a "family film", by the time of the first VHS release in 1984, some of the language used by the children in the film was deemed inappropriate for a young audience, and was "cleaned up" for the 1984 Active Home Video VHS release. The Petersen brothers having grown too old to re-dub their childhood voices, the decision was made to simply remove the "offending" dialogue altogether, resulting in the actors' mouths moving, but without the audio.

Cyanea dunbariae

Cyanea dunbariae (often misspelled "dunbarii") is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name ravine cyanea. It is endemic to Molokai, where there were sixteen plants remaining in the wild as of 2005. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This Hawaiian lobelioid is a branching shrub which grows in wet and moist forests and gulches in the Molokai Forest Reserve. The plant was not seen throughout much of the twentieth century until it was rediscovered in 1992 at the site of the single extant population. It is in decline. Threats to the species include its low numbers and limited gene pool, degradation of its habitat by axis deer, and feral pigs, damage to plants by slugs, rats, and birds, and competition by exotic plants such as climbing dayflower ("Commelina diffusa"), air plant ("Kalanchoe pinnata"), and castor bean ("Ricinus communis").
Propagation efforts in the greenhouse have met with little success.

The Satirist

The Satirist, or the Censor of the Times was a controversial 19th century British newspaper which featured reports of scandals involving well known residents of London. It was published by Barnard Gregory, who faced multiple libel charges and was later imprisoned due to its articles. "The Satirist" was frequently criticised by commentators, and James Hain Friswell described it as a "poor imitation of "Town and Country"".
History.
"The Satirist" was first published on April 10, 1831, at that time it cost 7d. It was published weekly and released on Sundays. The paper became notorious for the allegations it published and the legal battles they provoked. The front page of the paper carried the motto, "Satire's my weapon. I was born a critic and a satirist; and my nurse remarked that I hissed as soon as I saw light". Though it never failed to gain an audience, public opinion eventually turned squarely against the paper. "The Satirist" published 924 issues, the last of which was released December 15, 1849. At its height the paper had a weekly circulation of over 9,000.
In many cases Gregory would send a draft of an article that he had prepared to the subject of the article and request a bribe to suppress its publication. This proved to be a lucrative practice for the paper. Gregory was sued for libel several times, however, and he was almost constantly involved in litigation during the eighteen years that he published the paper. Though the nature of the English justice system at the time made it difficult for slandered parties to enforce judgments against him, some wealthy targets of the paper managed to win cases against him, and he served several stints in prison as a result. In addition to legal attacks, some targets of the paper responded by publishing the same type of articles directed at the staff of "The Satirist". After "The Satirist" published articles attacking the printer of the competing "The Town" newspaper, "The Town's" publisher, Renton Nicholson, retaliated with a series of scathing articles directed at Barnard Gregory.
Topics.
"The Satirist" covered accusations as serious as arson and as minor as individuals cheating while playing cards. One topic that it frequently covered, however, was affairs between wealthy men and their female servants. "The Satirist" also editorialised about the mistreatment of the poor. Gregory used his paper to become a prominent critic of the practice of medical schools using the bodies of deceased paupers for dissections. It also attacked Tory politics and published caricatures of its targets, reserving special disdain for the Duke of Cumberland and Queen Adelaide. Other notable targets of the paper included Sir James Hogg and the Duke of Brunswick. Both of these men brought Gregory to court over the articles he published about them and long legal court resulted. In one court battle between the Duke of Brunswick and Gregory, the Duke's lawyer claimed that "The Satirist" published, "divers indecent, obscene, lewd, filthy, and disgusting articles". Though it typically focused on stories set in London, "The Satirist" also published stories about foreign disasters.
"The Satirist" also had a sister publication known as the "Penny Satirist" which was devoted to exposing the transgressions of more obscure citizens.

DNA nanoball sequencing

DNA nanoball sequencing is a high throughput sequencing technology that is used to determine the entire genomic sequence of an organism. The method uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA into "DNA nanoballs". Fluorescent probes bind to complementary DNA and the probes are then ligated to anchor sequences bound to known sequences on the DNA template. The base order is determined via the fluorescence of the ligated and bound probes. This DNA sequencing method allows large numbers of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced per run at lower reagent costs compared to other next generation sequencing platforms. However, a limitation of this method is that it generates only short sequences of DNA, which presents challenges to mapping its reads to a reference genome. The company Complete Genomics uses "DNA nanoball sequencing" to sequence samples submitted by researchers.
Procedure.
DNA Nanoball Sequencing involves isolating DNA that is to be sequenced, shearing it into small 400 – 500 base pair (bp) fragments, ligating adapter sequences to the fragments, and circularizing the fragments. The circular fragments are copied by rolling circle replication resulting in many single-stranded copies of each fragment. The DNA copies concatenate head to tail in a long strand, and are compacted into a DNA nanoball. The nanoballs are then adsorbed onto a sequencing flow-cell. Unchained sequencing reactions interrogate specific nucleotide locations in the nanoball by ligating fluorescent probes to the DNA. The color of the fluorescence at each interrogated position is recorded through a high-resolution camera. Bioinformatics are used to analyze the fluorescence data and make a base call, and for mapping the 35-bp mate pair reads to a reference genome. The genome is assembled and any polymorphisms present in the sequence are identified.
DNA Isolation, fragmentation, and size capture.
Cells are lysed and DNA is extracted from the cell lysate. The high-molecular-weight DNA, often several megabase pairs long, is sonicated to break the DNA double-strands at random intervals. Bioinformatic mapping of the sequencing reads is most efficient when the sample DNA contains a narrow length range. Therefore, selecting the ideal fragment lengths of the DNA for sequencing the fragments are size separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The DNA of the suitable size range is purified by gel extraction, resulting in DNA with lengths within a narrow range (typically 400 – 500 base pairs).
Attaching adapter sequences.
Adapter DNA sequences must be attached to the unknown DNA fragment so that DNA with known sequences flank the unknown DNA. In the first round of adapter ligation, a right and left adapter (Ad1) is attached to the right and left flanks of the fragmented DNA, and the DNA is PCR amplified (Figure 3). The right and left Ad1 are modified to create complementary single strand ends that bind to each other and form circular DNA. A restriction enzyme is added which cleaves the DNA 13 bp to the right of the right adapter. This results in linear double-stranded DNA (Figure 3). Right and left adapter sequences (Ad2) are ligated onto the ends of the linear DNA and the product is amplified using PCR. The Ad2 sequences are then modified to allow them to bind each other and form circular DNA. The restriction enzyme is used again to cleave the circular DNA 13 bp to the left of Ad1. The result is a linear DNA fragment (Figure 3). Right and left adapter sequences (Ad3) are ligated to the right and left flank of the linear DNA and the product is amplified by PCR. The adapters are modified so that they bind to each other and form circular DNA. The type III restriction enzyme "EcoP"15 is added, which cleaves the DNA 26 bp to the left of Ad3 and 26 bp to the right of Ad2. This step removes a large segment of DNA and linearizes the DNA once again. Right and left adapters (Ad4) are ligated to the DNA, the product is PCR amplified, and the Ad4 sequences are modified so that they bind to each other. The result is the completed circular DNA template.
Rolling circle replication.
Once a circular DNA template, containing sample DNA that is ligated to four unique adapter sequences has been generated, the full sequence is amplified into a long string of DNA. This is accomplished by rolling circle replication with the Phi 29 DNA polymerase which binds and replicates the DNA template (Figure 4). The newly synthesized strand is released from the circular template, resulting in a long single-stranded DNA comprising several head-to-tail copies of the circular template. The four adapter sequences contain palindromic sequences which hybridize and cause the single strand to fold onto itself, resulting in a tight ball of DNA approximately 300 nanometers (nm) across. This allows the nanoballs to remain separated from each other and reduces any tangling between different single stranded DNA lengths.
DNA nanoball microarray.
To obtain DNA sequence, the DNA nanoballs are attached to a microarray flow cell (Figure 5). The flow cell is a 25 mm by 75 mm silicon wafer coated with silicon dioxide, titanium, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), and a photoresist material. The DNA nanoballs are added to the flow cell and selectively bind to the aminosilane in a highly ordered pattern, allowing a very high density of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced.
Unchained sequencing by ligation.
The order of the DNA bases between the adapter sequences is determined after being arrayed onto a flow cell (Figure 6). First, oligonucleotide anchor DNA that is complementary to either the right or left end of one of the adapters is added to the flow cell. Next, T4 DNA ligase is added to a pool of four 10-mer DNA sequences that have degenerate nucleotides in all but one position (for example position 1 next to the anchor, figure) and are added to the flow cell. The interrogative position in the DNA probe contains an "A" nucleotide with a red fluorophore attached, a "C" with a yellow fluorophore attached, a "G" with a green fluorophore attached or a "T" with a blue fluorophore attached. Only the probe that has a complementary nucleotide in the interrogative position will bind. The T4 DNA ligase attaches the probe to the anchor, the non-binding probes are washed away, and the fluorescence is detected. The probe/anchor is removed from the DNA nanoball and another anchor is added. A new pool of probes is added with a different interrogative position. The correct probe hybridizes, is ligated, rinsed and the fluorescence is read and recorded. This process is repeated with all ten interrogation positions next to an anchor sequence. Once all ten positions are recorded, an anchor is added that binds to a different adapter and the process is repeated to identify the ten nucleotides next to that adapter.
Imaging.
After each DNA probe/ligation step, the flow cell is imaged to determine which nucleotide base bound to the DNA nanoball. The fluorophore is excited with an arc lamp that radiates specific wavelengths of light towards the flow cell. The wavelength of the fluorescence of each DNA nanoball is captured on a high resolution CCD camera. The image is then processed to remove background noise and assess the intensity of each point. The color of each DNA nanoball corresponds to a base at the interrogative position and a computer records the base position information. The order of 70 nucleotides per DNA nanoball is determined using 80 images (8 rounds of 10 interrogative positions per round).
Genome assembly.
In generating the circular template, a large segment of the original 400 – 500 base pair fragment was replaced with the adapter Ad4. The 70 bp that are sequenced are therefore the first 35 bp of the original 400 – 500 bp fragment, and the last 35 bp of the 400 – 500 bp fragment. Therefore, the sequence is identified for two 35 bp reads of DNA separated by about 330 – 430 bp. These 35 bp reads are compared, using bioinformatics, to a reference genome and assigned to a genetic locus (Figure 7). Massive parallel genome mapping is accomplished through high coverage of the reference nucleotide positions, and the complete genome of the DNA sample is assembled. Single base-pair mismatches between the sequenced reads and the reference sequence are used to identify possible single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In addition, mapping of one 35-bp portion of the mate pair may identify DNA inserts and deletions (indels) via bioinformatics algorithms that detect possible discrepancies between the mate pairs.
Advantages.
DNA nanoball sequencing technology offers several advantages over other sequencing platforms. One major advantage is the use of very high-density arrays. The array design permits one DNA nanoball to attach to each pit that is part of an ordered array, and therefore a higher concentration of DNA can be added. This allows a high percentage of the pits to be occupied by a DNA nanoball thus maximizing the number of reads per flow cell (Figure Top). compared to other sequencing arrays where molecules of DNA are added to a flow cell in a random orientation (Figure bottom)
Another important advantage is that the sequencing reactions are non-progressive; after each reading of the probe, the probe and anchor are removed and a new anchor and probe set are added. Therefore, if a probe did not bind in the previous reaction, this has no effect on the next probe ligation, thus eliminating a major source of reading error that may occur in other next generation sequencing platforms. It also reduces the use of expensive probes, since DNA nanoball sequencing does not necessitate the probe ligation reaction to be run to completion.
Other advantages of DNA nanoball sequencing include the use of high-fidelity Phi 29 DNA polymerase to ensure accurate amplification of the circular template, several hundred copies of the circular template compacted into a small area resulting in an intense signal, and attachment of the fluorophore to the probe at a long distance from the ligation point results in improved ligation.
Disadvantages.
The main disadvantage of DNA nanoball sequencing is short read length of the DNA sequences obtained with this method. Short reads, especially for DNA high in DNA repeats, may map to two or more regions of the reference genome. A second disadvantage of this method is that multiple rounds of PCR have to be used. This can introduce PCR bias and possibly amplify contaminants in the template construction phase.
Applications.
DNA nanoball sequencing has been used in recent studies. Lee "et al." used this technology to find mutations that were present in a lung cancer and compared them to normal lung tissue. They were able to identify over 50,000 single nucleotide variants Roach "et al." used DNA nanoball sequencing to sequence the genomes of a family of four relatives and were able to identify SNPs that may be responsible for a Mendelian disorder, and were able to estimate the inter-generation mutation rate. The Institute for Systems Biology has used this technology to sequence 615 complete human genome samples as part of a survery studying neurodegenerative diseases, and the National Cancer Institute is using DNA nanoball sequencing to sequence 50 tumours and matched normal tissues from pediatric cancers.
Significance.
Massively parallel next generation sequencing platforms like DNA nanoball sequencing may contribute to the treatment and diagnosis of many genetic diseases. The cost of sequencing an entire human genome has fallen from about one million dollars in 2008, to $4400 in 2010 with the DNA nanoball technology. Sequencing of the entire genome of patients with heritable diseases or cancer, mutations associated with these diseases have been identified, opening up strategies, such as targeted therapeutics for at-risk people and for genetic counseling. As the price of sequencing an entire human genome approaches the $1000 mark, genomic sequencing the entire population may become feasible as part of normal preventative medicine.

Maggie Doyne (born c. 1987) is an American philanthropist who has been recognized for her work helping to develop an orphanage and school in the Kopila Valley of Nepal after spending time in that country during a gap year after completing high school.
Doyne grew up in Mendham Borough, New Jersey and attended West Morris Mendham High School. In 2005, following her graduation from high school, she undertook a 'gap year' of travel with the organization Leapnow.org. During that trip, she visited Nepal where in 2006 she used $5,000 in money she had saved from babysitting to open up an orphanage in Surkhet. She subsequently built, opened up and manages the Kopila Valley Primary School, also in Surkhet.
When Doyne first visited Nepal in 2006, the Nepalese Civil War had just ended. During the war over 12,000 people were killed and over 100,000 were displaced. The country was left impoverished and struggling for recovery. Amnesty International noted that the war was devastating for Nepalese children. According to their report, Children Caught in Conflict, children were the victims of violence, murder, imprisonment and rape. Many children were also recruited to be soldiers by both sides of the conflict.
As of 2011, there were 35 children living in Doyne's Kopila Valley orphanage and over 230 children attending Kopila Valley Primary School. Doyne also created the Blinknow Foundation to encourage and enable other young people to volunteer in developing countries. 
She has received numerous awards and commendations for her work including: 2009 Grand Prize Winner of the Do Something Awards and CosmoGirl of the Year 2008.
Family.
Doyne's parents are Steve and Nancy Doyne. After she was born, her father quit his job as the manager of a natural food store to be a stay-at-home dad, while Nancy Doyne worked in real estate. Maggie has two sisters: older sister Kate and younger sister Libby.

Cyanea eleeleensis is a rare species of flowering plant in the bellflower family known by the common name Eleele cyanea. It is endemic to Kauai, where there are no more than ten plants remaining in the wild. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 2010. Like other "Cyanea" it is known as haha in Hawaiian.
This Hawaiian lobelioid was discovered in 1977 near a gulch called Pali 'Ele'ele on Kauai. The shrub is known to grow nearly two meters tall with leaves up to 40 centimeters long by 11 wide. The inflorescence bears up to 20 tubular flowers which are purple in color with paler longitudinal stripes. 
Threats to this rare species include habitat degradation by feral pigs, exotic plants, and landslides.
Much of the potential habitat for this plant has not been surveyed, and it is said to be "likely" that more individuals will be found in future searches.

Pact of San José de Flores

The Pact of San José de Flores ("Pacto Unión San José de Flores", or "Pacto de Unión Nacional") was a treaty signed between the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires on November 11, 1859, on the aftermath of the Battle of Cepeda. It established guidelines for the entry of the latter into the Confederation, and Buenos Aires' acceptance of the Argentine Constitution of 1853.
Overview.
Background.
The Argentine Confederation, consisting of thirteen provinces in the interior, and the State of Buenos Aires, formed by the Province of Buenos Aires had divided what today is Argentina since the 1852 Battle of Caseros removed the paramount Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas (who had wielded the sum of public power since 1835, thereby keeping the nation tenuously united). The division was caused by the refusal of Buenos Aires to endorse the San Nicolás Agreement of 1853 or to recognize the Constitution of Argentina, promulgated that year. 
The most contentious issue remained the Buenos Aires Customs, which remained under the control of the city government and was the chief source of public revenue. Nations with which the Confederation maintained foreign relations, moreover, kept all embassies in Buenos Aires (rather than in the capital, Paraná). 
The Buenos Aires government also enjoyed numerous alliances in the hinterland, including that of Santiago del Estero Province (led by Manuel Taboada), as well as among powerful Liberal Party governors in Salta, Corrientes, Tucumán and San Juan. The 1858 assassination of San Juan's Federalist governor, Nazario Benavídez, by Liberals inflamed tensions between the Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires. Relations deteriorated further with the signing of a free trade agreement between the Port of Rosario (the chief Confederate port) and the Port of Montevideo to the detriment of Buenos Aires. The election of Valentín Alsina as Governor of Buenos Aires made hostilities imminent, culminating in the Battle of Cepeda of October 23, 1859. 
Buenos Aires forces, led by General Bartolomé Mitre, were defeated by those led by the President of the Confederacy, Justo José de Urquiza. Ordered to subjugate Buenos Aires separatists by force, Urquiza instead invited the defeated to a round of negotiations. The son of the President of Paraguay, General Francisco Solano López, had attempted to prevent the Battle of Cepeda, persuaded Governor Alsina to accept Urquiza's offer, and a meeting place was soon arranged in the village of San José de Flores (west of the capital), by Buenos Aires emissaries Juan Bautista Peña (Minister of the Economy) and jurist Carlos Tejedor.
Negotiations.
Buenos Aires was represented by Peña, Tejedor and Antonio Cruz Obligado. The Confederation was represented by Senate Vice President Tomás Guido, Urquiza, San Luis Province Governor Juan Esteban Pedernera (who had played a decisive military role at Cepeda), and Jujuy Province Governor Daniel Aráoz. 
The negotiations were guarded by Urquiza's forces, despite objections to this by Buenos Aires delegates. Urquiza, furthermore, demanded the resignation of Buenos Aires Governor Alsina and his cabinet. Faced with the threat of invasion, Alsina's government resigned, and he was replaced by Vice Governor Felipe Llavallol.
Following an impasse, General López succeeded in restarting talks on November 9, and on November 11,the Pact of National Union was signed.
Treaty and terms.
The final text closely followed President Urquiza's stipulations, though with a number of concessions toward Buenos Aires. The principal terms were:
Aftermath.
The constitutional convention ultimately met on September 14, 1860, and approved the amendments outlined in the treaty on September 23. Elections on March 6, 1860, resulted in victory for the incumbent Federalist Party, electing Santiago Derqui (who had administered San Juan Province following the Benavídez assassination, and whom Urquiza trusted) and General Pedernera. The influence of the new governor of Buenos Aires, Bartolomé Mitre, on the Derqui presidency was strong, and Mitre obtained numerous important bills from Derqui, including an extension on the province's customs house concession and measures benefiting the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires, whose currency was authorized for use as legal tender at the customs house (thereby controlling much of the nation's foreign trade). These concessions would strain Derqui's relations with Urquiza, who had been returned as governor of Entre Ríos, though the enactment of the new constitution on October 8 temporarily placated ongoing tensions. 
This impasse continued until, on November 16, Domingo Sarmiento organized a revolt in his native San Juan Province, leading to Governor José Antonio Virasoro's murder and renewed hostilities. The insurrection spread to neighboring Córdoba Province, which the president (who was from Córdoba) attempted to quell by personally assuming the governor's post. 
The absence of the president from the nation's capital led to Mitre's abrogation of the Pact of San José de Flores and -inevitably- to renewed civil war. These hostilities culminated in the September 17, 1861, Battle of Pavón, and the victory on the part of Mitre and Buenos Aires over Urquiza's national forces. President Derqui resigned, and the national government was taken by Mitre who, despite victory, reaffirmed his commitment to the 1860 constitutional amendments and was to be elected the first president of the reunited Argentine Republic on September 4, 1862.

Pier Luigi de Borgia, 1st duke of Gandía

Pier Luigi de Borgia, 1st duke of Gandía (, ) (1458 or 1460–1488 or 1491) was a Valencian noble. Pier Luigi was the son of Pope Alexander VI and half-brother of Cesare Borgia, Gioffre Borgia, Giovanni Borgia and Lucrezia Borgia.
He was betrothed to María Enríquez de Luna of the House of Enríquez. Due to Pier Luigi's untimely death, she would later wed his younger brother Giovanni (also known as Juan) in September 1493.
Pier Luigi Borgia fought alongside the Spanish armies during the Granada War (Reconquista). Following his heroic triumph during the Battle of Ronda, King Ferdinand II rewarded him with the title of 'grandee of Spain' on 18 May 1485.
The lands of Gandia, the ancestral home of the Borgia family, were initially inherited by Pier Luigi (Pedro Luis). However, before becoming duke of Gandía, he purchased the duchy through a financial agreement with local nobles Andrés de Cabrera, Marquis of Moya, and his wife, Beatriz de Bobadilla. Through this agreement, Pier Luigi was required to provide the marquis an unknown sum, albeit considered small, and accept certain rights pertaining to the crown and of Valencia over the lands of the duchy. Some sources state that Pedro Luis' father gave him 50,000 ducats in order to purchase the territory. In late 1485, King Ferdinand II officially elevated Pier Liugi's status to duke of Gandía. 
In his will, Pier Luigi ceded the duchy to his younger brother Giovanni and demanded a dowry of 10,000 florins to be given to his sister, Lucrezia.

The Ozimek Suspension Bridge () is a suspension bridge over the Mała Panew River in Ozimek, Poland. Designed by Karl Schottelius and completed in 1827, it is the second oldest wrought iron suspension bridge in Europe.
The bridge was manufactured in a local "Malapane Steelworks" in Ozimek which supplied bridges to European cities from Berlin to Petersburg. It was constructed between 1825 and 1827 from parts made of 57 tons of wrought iron and 14 tons of steel. Suspended between two towers, on each side of the bridge, are four chain cables which support the span. The deck was made of timber.
The bridge was used as a road bridge until 1938; then it continued to be used for pedestrian traffic only.
The first extensive renovations of the bridge were carried out between July 2009 and September 2010. During the renovations the entire bridge was taken apart, renewed and put back together again, and its structure strengthened with steel cables.

Smoothing group

In 3D computer graphics, a smoothing group is a group of polygons in a polygon mesh which should appear to form a smooth surface. Smoothing groups are useful for describing shapes where some polygons are connected smoothly to their neighbors, and some are not. For example, in a mesh representing a cylinder, all of the polygons are smoothly connected except along the edges of the end caps. One could make a smoothing group containing all of the polygons in one end cap, another containing the polygons in the other end cap, and a last group containing the polygons in the tube shape between the end caps.
By identifying the polygons in a mesh that should appear to be smoothly connected, smoothing groups allow 3D modeling software to estimate the surface normal at any point on the mesh, by averaging the surface normals or vertex normals in the mesh data that describes the mesh. The software can use this data to determine how light interacts with the model. If each polygon lies in a plane, the software could calculate a polygon's surface normal by calculating the normal of the polygon's plane, meaning this data would not have to be stored in the mesh. Thus, early 3D modeling software like 3D Studio Max DOS used smoothing groups as a way to avoid having to store accurate vertex normals for each vertex of the mesh, as a strategy for computer representation of surfaces.

Single molecule fluorescent sequencing

Single molecule fluorescent sequencing is one method of DNA sequencing. The core principle is the imaging of individual fluorophore molecules, each corresponding to one base. By working on single molecule level, amplification of DNA is not required, avoiding amplification bias. The method lends itself to parallelization by probing many sequences simultaneously, imaging all of them at the same time. 
The principle can be applied stepwise e.g. the Helicos implementation, or in realtime as in the Pacific Biosciences implementation.

John F. Kennedy document hoax

In 1997, documents purported to prove an affair between President John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, as well as other illicit relationships, were discovered to have been part of an elaborate hoax. Lawrence X. Cusack, known as Lex, had forged the documents under the guise that they had belonged to his father, an attorney who represented Monroe's mother Gladys as well as the Archdiocese of New York. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh was hired to attest to the authenticity of the documents, and before the scandal broke there were plans for an ABC-backed TV special or film. Certain inconsistencies later raised doubts among ABC investigators, such as a typeface newer than the date of the letters, and a ZIP code included before ZIP codes had been instituted. Led by Peter Jennings, ABC confronted Cusack with these issues on air. Cusack was indicted on fraud charges and was later sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Octavius Wigram

Octavius Wigram (18 December 1794 – 20 May 1878) was an English businessman and ship owner in the City of London, a member of Lloyds and Governor of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation.
Life.
Born at Walthamstow House, Walthamstow, on 18 December 1794, despite his name Wigram was the twelfth child and seventh son of Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet (1744–1830), a merchant shipbuilder and Tory politician who had a total of twenty-three children. He was educated privately at Shacklewell, and at the age of sixteen he entered his father's counting-house. In 1819 he became a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, remaining with the company until his death.
Wigram joined the London and Westminster Light Horse (a Volunteer regiment) as a trooper. At the coronation of King George IV at Westminster Abbey in 1820, Wigram was on duty, guarding one of the doors of the Abbey, when the new king's estranged wife Queen Caroline tried unsuccessfully to enter the Abbey by force. She was turned away. In 1822 he was commissioned as a cornet in the same regiment.
From 1823 to 1831 Wigram is listed as the owner of two ships in the service of the East India Company. In 1824 he was elected a member of Lloyds, and on 24 March 1824 was married at St George's, Hanover Square, by William Knox, Bishop of Derry, to the bishop's daughter, Isabella Charlotte, who was a niece of Thomas Knox, 2nd Viscount Northland, later created Earl of Ranfurly. They had three sons and three daughters. Until 1830 the Wigrams lived at 36, Wimpole Street, Westminster. They then moved to Thorpe Combe House and in 1841 to Dulwich.
Wigram was a partner in Huldart's Patent Cables Company and Reid's Brewery Company, was on the Committee of Lloyd's Register of Shipping, and was a member of a Royal Commission of inquiry into the law governing pilots.
In 1870 he was still Governor of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, and the next year the Company presented him with his portrait in oils by George Richmond. He died on 20 May 1878.
Family.
Wigram's eldest brother, Robert (1773–1843), was a Director of the Bank of England and a Tory Member of Parliament who in 1832 changed his name from Wigram to Fitzwygram. Their other brothers included Joseph Cotton Wigram (1798–1867), Bishop of Rochester, Loftus Tottenham Wigram QC (1803–89), a barrister and politician, and the theologian George Vicesimus Wigram (1805–79).
Wigram's eldest son, William Knox Wigram, born on 13 September 1825, became a barrister and married Mary Anne Pomeroy, the daughter of the 5th Viscount Harberton (1790–1862). Their sons Sir Henry Francis Wigram (1857–1934) and William Arthur Wigram were notable business men in New Zealand.

After the disintegration of Seljuks the area was a part of the Turkmen beylik of Teke. In 1389, the city was captured by the Ottoman Empire. After the defeat of Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Kepez area was annexed by Karamanids, another Turkmen principality up to 1415. During this brief period a Turkmen tribe named Varsak was settled around Kepez. After 1415 Antalya area became an Ottoman territory. During the Republican era the scattered population around Kepez increased. After Antalya was declared as the metropolitan center, Kepez municipality was incorporated into Greater Antalya in 1993 and the corresponding district governorate was established in 2008.

Otago rugby league team

The Otago rugby league team are New Zealand rugby league team that represents the Otago Rugby League. They are known as the Whalers. In the past they have been nicknamed the Storm, the Raiders and the 45er's.
History.
In 1908 Otago was involved in some of the first provincial matches in the country when it played a home and away series against Southland. The first game was played at Caledonia Ground in Dunedin on 3 October and used goalposts which were rented from the Otago Rugby Union. The Southland side included Ned Hughes, a former All Black. Otago won the match 11-8. A return match was played at Queens Park, Invercargill on 7 October. Southland was able to win the match 30-14 and draw the series.
The Otago side was made up of fullback D Bannantyne, three-quarters J Harrhy, WR Kirk and G Ogg, five-eighths EO Nees and P Walker, halfback J Coulter, and forwards J Bryant, E Manley (captain), T Mockford, W Harridge, J Campbell and Larkins.
Although rugby league was played in Southland over the next two years, the code ceased to exist in Otago until it was revised again in 1924, following the announcement by the New Zealand Rugby League that a Test was to be held in Dunedin that year. After securing a ground literally only days before the Test, due to blockades at different venues by the Otago Rugby Football Union, the Test went ahead at Tahuna Park in front of more than 14,000 spectators. The ORFU tried to sway the public away from the game and arranged a provincial Otago-Canterbury match at the same time. However the public sympathy went to the fledgling code and with it came the formation of the Otago Rugby Football League that year, chaired by Dunedin dentist, John Cooper.
Until the stock market crashed five years later, the ORFL soon became one of the most powerful league provincial bodies in New Zealand after its leading administrators Harry Divers founded the Art Union lottery leading to an abundance of wealth. Subsequently the ORFL bought up a big section of land in South Dunedin, which was later subdivided, including a ground originally called Colossal Park after one of the lotteries. It soon became known as Tonga Park, which remains to this day. The ORFL also loaned the NZRL 820 pounds in 1927 to keep it out of he red as well as hosting a Test the following year at the Caledonian Ground, which by now was under a five year lease of the code. In addition there were five clubs (Athletic, Christian Brothers, City, Kaikorai and Kaitangita) that began and in the case of Kaikorai and Kaitangita were only short lived. 
As a provincial team, Otago was a strong side and proved to be a strong rival against its South Island rivals West Coast and Canterbury. Four local players - Bert Eckhoff, Herb Pearce, Harry Thomas and Alf Townsend all became New Zealand representatives, while others such as Gordon Blazey, Ted McKewen and brothers, John and Tom O'Connor played for the South Island against the North Island. After four glorious years, 
the turning point for the ORFL began in 1928 when the test at the Caledonian Ground was marred by fighting by the New Zealand and English teams, causing wide negative press in the local media. The following year the share market crashed causing local players to relocate outside Dunedin in search of work. Perhaps the biggest tragedy came in 1931 when Divers died. A most popular man who had been involved in other sports in Dunedin, Divers had held all of the main roles within the ORFL at one stage or another - President, Secretary and Treasurer, in addition to being responsible for keeping a high profile of the game in Dunedin. Failing playing numbers saw the ORFL go into recess in 1934. 
After 19 years of no league in Dunedin, a Christian Brothers club reunion in 1952 together with radio interviews between broadcaster Ray Cody and former Halifax player and one time Maori All Black, Enoka Macdonald, helped to reform the ORFL the following year. A large board of control (which was chaired by Cody) together with a schoolboys board (led by the future ORFL Life Member George Stuart) and a Referees Association along with four clubs - Athletic, Caledonian, Celtic and Western Suburbs all started up in the first year. The following year in 1954 saw the beginning of New Zealand's first University rugby league club along with the Kia Toa Club. Both 1953 and 1954 saw the South Island play in Dunedin against international touring team and together with a renewed interest, the ORFL also like their 1920's counterpart was able to secure a five year lease on a ground as its headquarters. In this case it was the scene of the 1924 Test match, Tahuna Park. A year later in September 1955 Celtic played Athletic under lights at Tahuna Park and in doing so created history by becoming the first ever rugby league match in New Zealand to do so. 
The ORFL gained a further three Kiwis over the next decade in Jimmy Haig, John Walshe and Trevor Patrick. In 1966 the first televised league match in Dunedin was held when Otago played the West Coast at the Caledonian Ground and two years later, the ORFL hosted a national Quarangular tournament between home side Otago along with Canterbury, West Coast and Wellington. 
The arrival of ex Auckland and West Coast players in Dunedin in the mid 1970's helped Otago win a provincial tournament in Palmerston North in 1975. The following year rugby league began in Southland for the first time since 1910 when the Invercargill-based Leopards Club began to compete in the Otago competition. Two years later, the ORFL now became known as the Otago-Southland Rugby League and soon the clubs from the deep south began to take control over their more northern rivals. The amalgamation between the two provinces was separated in 1985, so that it once again became the ORFL. In 1993 an Otago Invitation side, including Mark Elia and Francis Leota, played New Zealand Māori. The Māori won 39-18.
In 1995 Otago recorded their first win over Canterbury in 35 years. In 1998 Otago defeated West Coast for the first time since 1927. They went on to make the final of the National Provincial Competition Second Division before losing 56-10 to the Bay of Plenty. Another triumph that year was having primary, intermediate and secondary school competitions run that year. 
Otago won the Rugby League Cup in 2002 when they defeated Tasman on the 8 September. Otago continued to hold the cup for another three years before losing to a Midlands side in the North Island. Dwindling playing numbers caused the ORFL to go into recess for the third time in 2008, before it re-emerged again in 2010. Just before it went into recess Otago won a centenary match against Southland in 2008, defeating them 64-4. In 2014, four clubs play league in Dunedin, which includes Kia Toa and University, both of whom celebrate their 60th anniversary years, during this season.

Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2011)

Homenaje a Dos Leyendas 2011 (Spanish for "Homage to Two Legends") was an annual professional wrestling major event produced by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), which took place on March 18, 2011 in Arena México, Mexico City, Mexico. The event paid tribute to CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who is always honored at "Dos Leyendas" and to Ángel Blanco, grandfather of current CMLL wrestler Höruz. The main event of the show was a Tag team "Lucha de Apuesta" match with both teams risking their hair on the outcome of the match. The father / Son team of Brazo de Plata and Máximo faced off against El Terrible and El Texano, Jr. In the semi-main event Averno defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship against his rival Máscara Dorada.
Background.
The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portray either villains (referred to as "Rudos" in Mexico) or fan favorites ("Técnicos" in Mexico) as they competed in wrestling matches with pre-determined outcomes.
Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held a press conference on February 24, 2011 and announced the first match for the 2011 "Homenaje a Dos Leyendas" would be a "hair vs. hair" Tag team "Lucha de Apuesta" between Brazo de Plata and Máximo and the team of El Terrible and El Texano, Jr.

Niccolò Barbieri

Niccolò (or Nicolò) Barbieri (Vercelli, 1586 - 1641) was an Italian writer and actor of the commedia dell'arte theatrical genre. He was also known as Beltrame di Milano ("Beltrame of Milan") in reference to one of his most popular characters, Beltrame; this was the main character of one of Barbieri's best known plays, "L'inavertito", which is known to have inspired Moliere's "L'Étourdi ou Les Contretemps" ("The Blunderer"). Besides popularizing Beltrame, Barbieri is also credited with creating another "commedia dell'arte" mask, Scapino.
Barbieri was a successful author and actor, and one of those that toured Europe; he is known, for example, to have played at the royal court of France.
Besides plays, he wrote essays on theatre; his prominent essay is "La supplica. Discorso famigliare a quelli che trattano de' comici" (1634), a passionate apology of theatre and actors, which is also an important source of information on the commedia culture.
As a "commedia" actor, Barbieri introduced the habit of acting while standing on a chair, which is supposedly the origin of the Italian word "saltimbanco" (which roughly translates to "s.o. who jumps on chairs") to refer to comic actors and jesters.

HMIS Hindustan (L80)

HMIS "Hindustan" (L80) was a "Folkestone" class (also known as "Hastings" class) sloop which served in the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) during World War II. Her pennant number was changed to U80 in 1940.
"Hindustan" was transferred to Pakistan in 1948 after the independence, and eventually renamed PNS "Karsaz". She was decommissioned from the Pakistan Navy in 1960.
Construction and design.
HMIS "Hindustan" was laid down at the Swan Hunter shipyard in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear England on 4 September 1929, was launched on 12 May 1930 and completed on 10 October 1930, commissioning into the Royal Indian Marine.
"Hindustan" was built to a modified and longer version of the "Hastings" class design. Her hull was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard. She was powered by geared steam turbines fed by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers, driving two shafts and rated at , sufficient to drive the ship to a speed of . The ship had a complement of 119 officers and men.
The ship's main armament consisted of two 4 inch (102 mm) QF Mk IV guns. Unlike in the "Hastings" class, which had one 4 inch gun in an anti-aircraft mount, both guns were in Low-Angle mountings only suitable for use against surface targets. In addition four 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were carried.
Service history.
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, "Hindustan" was deployed to the Persian Gulf, patrolling the Straits of Hormuz and operating as part of the East Indies Station of the Royal Navy. In August 1940, Italy invaded British Somaliland, and "Hindustan" was deployed to Berbera, landing three of her 3-pounder guns to aid the defences, and covering the evacuation of Commonwealth forces from Berbera from 15 to 19 September. "Hindustan" was then refitted at Bombay (now Mumbai), being fitted with Sonar, previous plans to re-arm her with anti-aircraft 4-inch guns being abandoned. 
During World War II, she was a part of the Eastern Fleet. She escorted numerous convoys in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf between 1942-45. She also supported various amphibious landings of the British Indian Army and the British Army in Burma, Malaya, etc.
In April 1945, with , , and , "Hindustan" supported the amphibious landings of the Indian and British Armies in Rangoon, as a part of Operation Dracula.
During the Royal Indian Navy mutiny of February 1946 "Hindustan" was berthed at Karachi, and occupied by mutineers. When ordered to debark the mutineers refused, but finally surrendered after a brief firefight with the 15th (King's) Parachute Battalion, supported by four 75mm pack howitzers of C Troop, 159 Parachute Light Regiment, Royal Artillery.
At the time of independence, "Hindustan" was among the vessels transferred to the Royal Pakistan Navy in 1948, being renamed "Karsaz".

Parade (French street entertainment)

A parade is a type of French street entertainment which originated during the Renaissance. It consisted of a group of entertainers, which could include actors, singers, dancers, jugglers, and other types of performers, who took part in parades (in the usual sense of the word) and entertained spectators at those times when the procession stopped moving.
In the 18th century the term was applied to short improvisational buffooneries, typically incorporating vulgarities, which were performed either on an outdoor platform or a balcony in order to entice passersby into show-booths and theatres at the fairs or on the Boulevard du Temple. The characters were often drawn from the "commedia dell'arte" tradition. According to M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet "the humour was of the crudest sort, relying on sexual innuendos or even explicit remarks and actions, obscene gestures and references to defecation and other bodily functions."
The "parades" strongly influenced the 18th-century genre of "comédie-parade", a type of play or "opéra-comique", usually in one act, which also used characters from the "commedia dell'arte". These pieces were a bit more refined and polite, at least when presented in public theatres.

Transcription activator-like effector nuclease

Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are artificial restriction enzymes generated by fusing a TAL effector DNA binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain.
Restriction enzymes are enzymes that cut DNA strands at a specific sequence. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be quickly engineered to bind practically any desired DNA sequence.
By combining such an engineered TALE with a DNA cleavage domain (which cuts DNA strands), one can engineer restriction enzymes that are specific for any desired DNA sequence. When these restriction enzymes are introduced into cells, they can be used for genome editing in situ, a technique known as genome editing with engineered nucleases.
TALE DNA binding domain.
TAL effectors are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria. The DNA binding domain contains a repeated highly conserved 33-34 amino acid sequence with the exception of the 12th and 13th amino acids. These two locations are highly variable (Repeat Variable Diresidue) and show a strong correlation with specific nucleotide recognition. This simple relationship between amino acid sequence and DNA recognition has allowed for the engineering of specific DNA binding domains by selecting a combination of repeat segments containing the appropriate RVDs.
DNA cleavage domain.
The non-specific DNA cleavage domain from the end of the FokI endonuclease can be used to construct hybrid nucleases that are active in a yeast assay. These reagents are also active in plant cells 
and in animal cells. Initial TALEN studies used the wild-type FokI cleavage domain, but some subsequent TALEN studies also used FokI cleavage domain variants with mutations designed to improve cleavage specificity and cleavage activity. The FokI domain functions as a dimer, requiring two constructs with unique DNA binding domains for sites in the target genome with proper orientation and spacing. Both the number of amino acid residues between the TALE DNA binding domain and the FokI cleavage domain and the number of bases between the two individual TALEN binding sites appear to be important parameters for achieving high levels of activity.
Engineering TALENs.
The simple relationship between amino acid sequence and DNA recognition of the TALE binding domain allows for designable proteins. In this case artificial gene synthesis is problematic because of improper annealing of the repetitive sequence found in the TALE binding domain. One solution to this is to use a publicly available software program (DNAWorks) to calculate oligonucleotides suitable for assembly in a two step PCR; oligonucleotide assembly followed by whole gene amplification. A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have also been reported. Both methods offer a systematic approach to engineering DNA binding domains that is conceptually similar to the modular assembly method for generating zinc finger DNA recognition domains.
Transfection.
Once the TALEN genes have been assembled they are inserted into plasmids; the plasmids are then used to transfect the target cell where the gene products are expressed and enter the nucleus to access the genome. Alternatively, TALENs can be delivered to the cell as mRNA, which removes the possibility of genomic integration of the TALEN-expressing protein. It can also dramatically increase the level of homology directed repair (HDR) and the success of introgression during gene editing.
Genome Editing.
TALENs can be used to edit genomes by inducing double-strand breaks (DSB), which cells respond to with repair mechanisms.
Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reconnects DNA from either side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This repair mechanism induces errors in the genome via insertion or deletion(indels), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional. Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems. A simple heteroduplex cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple agarose gels or slab gel systems.
Alternatively, DNA can be introduced into a genome through NHEJ in the presence of exogenous double-stranded DNA fragments.
Homology directed repair can also introduce foreign DNA at the DSB as the transfected double-stranded sequences are used as templates for the repair enzymes.
TALENs have been used to generate stably modified human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSCs) clones, to generate knockout "C. elegans", knockout rats, knockout mice, and knockout zebrafish. Moreover, the method can be used to generate knockin organisms. Thus, the method has been used to generate Knockin rats by TALEN mRNA microinjection in one-cell embryos.
Potential Problems.
If a TAL effector nuclease is not specific enough for its target site or does not target a unique site within the genome of interest, off-target cleavage may occur. Such off-target cleavage may lead to the production of enough double-strand breaks to overwhelm the repair machinery and consequently yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death. Off-target cleavage events are possible with other forms of engineered nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases, which have been more extensively researched for off-target activity.

Electoral regions of Victoria

Members of the Victorian Legislative Council, the upper house of the Parliament of the Australian State of Victoria, are elected from 8 multi-member electorates called regions. The Legislative Council has 40 members, 5 from each of the 8 regions. The last time electoral boundaries were drawn was in 2005. The Electoral Boundaries Commission is currently reviewing electoral boundaries.
Reform of 2003.
A major reform of the Parliament was made by the Labor government, led by Steve Bracks, with the passage of the "Constitution (Parliamentary Reform) Act" 2003. Under the new system, members of the Legislative Council serve fixed four-year terms linked to elections for the Legislative Assembly, unless if the Legislative Assembly is dissolved sooner. 
Each electoral region consists of 11 contiguous Legislative Assembly electoral districts with about 420,000 electors each, who elect five members to the Legislative Council by a single transferable vote. There are now 40 members of the Legislative Council, four fewer than before. The changes also introduced proportional representation. The opportunity was also taken to remove the Council's ability to block supply. The reforms have made it easier for minor parties to gain election to the Council and possibly gain the balance of power.
The Electoral Boundaries Commission drew the boundaries of the new regions in 2005. The new system came into effect for the 2006 Victorian election. 
Current Regions.
The state is divided into the following eight electoral regions:
Provinces 1856 to 2006.
The Legislative Council was formerly elected from 22 single-member electorates called "provinces". The members of the council sat for two assembly terms so two members sat for each province. This is a list of the provinces as of 2005:
The following provinces also existed but were abolished prior to 2002:
      # = Original Province of inaugural (upper-house chamber) Legislative Council 1856
The old system tended to favour the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia (often in coalition) over the Australian Labor Party and other parties . This caused many instances where a Labor-controlled Assembly faced an opposition-controlled Council — a rare occurrence elsewhere in Australia.
Electoral districts 1851 to 1856.
The Victorian Legislative Council was initially a single chamber (unicameral) when first created and consisted of members some of whom were nominated and some elected. The electoral districts were:

The King of Paris (1917 film)

The King of Paris (Russian:Король Парижа, translit:Korol' Parizha) is a 1917 Russian silent feature film directed by Yevgeni Bauer.
The film was shot in the cinema factory of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov in Yalta.
This film was the last work of Yevgeni Bauer. As he worked on his previous film, "For Happiness" (ru: «За счастьем») Bauer broke his leg, and he shot this film while in a bathchair, but soon fell ill with pneumonia. He began shooting in early summer of 1917. But he was soon placed in Yalta hospital and on 9 June 1917 he died. 
Actress Olga Rakhmanova finished the film.
The premiere was held one month after the October Revolution, 6 December 1917. Preoccupied by the revolution, the film was unnoticed by audiences and critics. 
The only known copy of the film has lain for almost 100 years in the Russian State archives. A screening of the film took place in Yalta at the 130th anniversary of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov in September 2007.
Plot.
In Paris, Raskol takes young Bremond under his protection. He tells him that if he treats women as slaves, men as enemies and businessmen as puppets, he will become King of Paris. The two men, now passing as Count de Saint-Venkov and Marquis de Predamond apply the recipe very successfully. However, when Bremond wants to marry the Duchess von Dorstein for her money, he will have to confront her son, who has changed his name to Jean Hiénard and lives a simple life as a sculptor.

Kartabhaja

The Kartabhaja (), also known as the Kartabhaja Sampradaya (), literally, the Worshippers of the Master, is a religious community of West Bengal in eastern India, which came into prominence in the mid 18th century. It had a significant following in the late 18th century and early 19th century, but its following declined considerably in the early 20th century.
The founder of this community was Aulchand or Aulechand ( 1686-1769), about whom very little is known, except a number of legends. Significant early leaders of this community were Ramsharan Pal, a disciple of Aulchand, his wife Sarasvati, popularly known as "Sati Ma" and their son Dulalchandra Pal. Under their leadership, Ghoshpara village (presently, a neighbourhood of Kalyani city) in Nadia district became a major centre of activities and later a "pitha" for the sect. An annual fair in Ghoshpara, known as the "Sati Mar Dol Mela", is held in honour of "Sati Ma" on the day of "Dol Purnima" in February/March every year. This fair is attended by a large number of followers of this sect.
Aulchand and his disciples.
Aulchand, founder of this community was also known as "Aule Mahaprabhu", "Kangali Mahaprabhu", "Fakir Thakur", "Siddha Purush", "Sain Gosain" and "Purnachandra" amongst his followers. Most of the legends on "Satyamahaprabhu" Aulchand or Aulechand are collected by Horace Hayman Wilson and Akshay Kumar Datta. According to these legends, in 1616 Saka era (1694), Mahadab Barui, a peasant of Ula village found Aulchand, an eight year boy in his betel vine and decided to adopt him. After 12 years Aulchand left Ula and stayed in the house of a "gandhabanik" (perfumer) for two years. Next, he resided in the house of a landlord for 14 years. Next one and half year he lived somewhere in eastern Bengal and then started travelling from one place to another. At the age of 37, he came to Bejra village and Hatu Ghosh became his disciple. Soon, Ramsharan Pal also became his disciple. Besides Ramsharan Pal and Hatu Ghosh, his principal disciples included Bechu Ghosh, Nayan Das, Laksmhikanta, Nityananda Das, Khelaram Udasin, Krishnadas, Hari Ghosh, Kanai Ghosh, Shankar, Nitai Ghosh, Anandaram, Manohar Das, Bishnu Das, Kinu, Gobinda, Shyam Kansari, Bhimray Rajput, Panchu Ruidas, Sidhiram Ghosh and Shishuram. He died in Boyale village (in the present day Nadia district) in 1691 Saka era (1769). In addition to his 22 principal disciples, Aulchand had a number of followers, both Hindu and Muslim. The disciples of Aulchand believed him as the reincarnation of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
After Aulchand's death, his followers were divided into two major groups. His principal eight disciples under the leadership of Ramsharan Pal established a center for religious activities at Ghoshpara. The other group founded their center at Parari village near Chakdaha and cremated Aulchand's body there. The leadership of the group led by Ramsharan Pal became hereditary after his death and his descendants were mentioned as the "Shriyut" or the "Shrishriyut". The sectarian literature of this community mention the "Guru"s (leaders) as the "Mahashaya"s (hosts) and the common members as the "Barati"s (guests).
Dulalchandra Pal.
In 1783, after the death of Ramsharan Pal, his wife "Sati Ma" became the leader of the community and she was succeeded by her son Ramdulal Pal or Dulalchandra Pal (1775–1852) after her death. His anthology of spiritual songs, mostly written between 1824-28 under the nome de plume "Lalshashi" were collected by his four disciples and known as "Bhaver Gita" (Spiritual Songs). Almost 500 spiritual poems and songs written by a number of poets belonging to this community were published in two volumes, titled, "Kartabhajar Gitavali" (1872) and "Shrishriyuter Padavali" (1893). These works include most of the songs of "Lalshashi". Dulalchandra Pal was succeeded by wife and she was succeeded by their son Ishvarchandra Pal.
Practices and beliefs.
According to H. H. Wilson, the distinctions of the Indian caste system were not followed by the members of this sect during their religious celebrations. According to Akshay Kumar Datta, the principal religious practices were chanting "mantra" and "premanushthan" (ritual of love), which they believe would lead to "siddhi" (perfection). The members of this sect met together regularly and these meetings, known as "baithak"s, continued till early morning. In these "baithak"s, they shared the expressions of "prem" (love) by crying, trembling, laughing loudly and grinding their teeth.
The four classes of the sect were Aul, Baul, Derveshes, and Sain.

DYJJ

"Radyo Budyong" (DYJJ-AM 1296 kHz Roxas City) is an AM station owned and operated by Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation in the Philippines. DYJJ-AM studio is located at Barangay Baybay, Arnaldo Boulevard, Roxas City. 
History.
IBC-DYJJ Radyo Budyong was established in Roxas City on April 1, 1981. It is one of the three provincial stations in the Visayas owned by Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC-13), a broadcast corporation then owned by the late Philippine Ambassador Roberto Salas – Benedicto (popularly known as RSB for his employees whom they considered as very supportive of their plight especially in terms of their benefits).
Shortly after the EDSA revolution in 1986, IBC-13 was among the properties surrendered by Benedicto to the government as part of the compromise settlement before he was allowed to return to the country. IBC-13 was considered part of the so-called “ill-gotten wealth” purportedly amassed by Benedicto, an alleged “Marcos crony.”
During IBC “glorious days” especially in the early 70’s and 80’s, DYJJ was among the most favorite radio stations in Roxas City especially in the absence of FM stations and cable TV. IBC-DYJJ, with the prominence of its television counterparts in Iloilo (IBC-TV12) and its relay station in Roxas City (TV-2) enjoyed publicity and preference among Capizenios.
However the instability of its leadership due to massive organizational changes and visions has brought havoc on its local operation. Shaky leadership and sudden changes of decision-makers at the central office contributed a lot on the deterioration of DYJJ for nearly two decades.
In 2004, DYJJ regained its strength when its tower was erected, its programming computerized and several positive structural changes and corporate policies were introduced. But due to its vintage radio transmitter, DYJJ audio output has been a very big problem not only on its programming but also its financial viability.
DYJJ programs were designed to be public service-oriented. It is also packed with hard news, straight commentaries and musical programs. Constant interaction with the public on relevant issues is given preferential attention on its public-affairs programs.
One of DYJJ's most popular programs is Budyong Kapehan. A radio-TV talk show production wherein talking points centered on governance, political issues, public policies, current news and community scenarios. It is also the pioneer in radio and Cable TV broadcasting in Capiz.
DYJJ had 7 station managers (including 2 OIC's) since it began its operation in 1981. They were: Lydia Depalobos – Station Manager (1981- 1986) Mera Tumlos – Yngcong – Station Manager (1987-1995) Dominique Hosalla – Station Manager (1996-1998) Noel Bergantinos – OIC (1998-1999) Bobby Rodriguez – Station Manager (1999- 2003) - Jun Arbolado – Station Manager (2003 to 2007) - Rexam Laguda - Station Manager (2007 to present).

Crimson Satan

Crimson Satan (1959–1982) was an American Thoroughbred Champion racehorse bred and raced by Peter W. Salmen Sr.'s Crimson King Farm at Lexington, Kentucky. His dam was Salmen's Argentine-bred mare Papila, and his sire was Charles Fisher's good runner Spy Song. Trained in his two-year-old season by Gordon Potter, Crimson Satan earned 1961 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors.
At age three, Crimson Satan competed in each of the U.S. Triple Crown races. He finished sixth in the Kentucky Derby, seventh in the Preakness Stakes, and a close third in the Belmont Stakes. In an overall difficult year, the colt won the 1962 Clark Handicap but was disqualified from his win in the Jersey Derby and set back to third. He won the June 23 Leonard Richards Stakes at Delaware Park Racetrack, but the win was negated following a positive drug test. As a result, trainer Potter was suspended for the remainder of 1962, and Charles Kerr took over as the trainer of Crimson Satan in September 1962.
Racing at age four in 1963, Crimson Satan had a very good year, earning five wins and five seconds in major stakes races at tracks across the United States. While racing in California, where he won the San Fernando Stakes and Charles H. Strub Stakes, Crimson Satan was handled by Kerr's assistant, J. W. King. He also had wins in Chicago's Washington Park Handicap and Boston's Massachusetts Handicap and set a new track record of 1:40 3/5 on dirt in winning the Michigan Mile and One Sixteenth Handicap at Detroit. In October 1963, Martin Fallon took over as trainer but after disappointing results, Crimson Satan was retired in early 1964.
Crimson Satan stood at stud at his birthplace in Lexington, Kentucky. Although a successful sire of numerous stakes winners such as Brilliant Sandy and Krislin, he is best remembered as the damsire of the 1990 Breeders' Cup Mile winner Royal Academy as well as multiple Graded stakes winners Terlingua and Mt. Livermore. Bred to Nijinsky, Crimson Satan's daughter Crimson Saint produced Laa Etaab, who sold at the 1985 Keeneland yearling sale for $7,000,000.
Crimson Satan died in 1982 and is buried at Crimson King Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.

Irish local elections, 1920

The 1920 Irish local elections provide an interesting barometer of opinion in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence (1919–21), and were the last local elections to be held before the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was passed at the end of the year.
They were held in two stages:
Background.
In the Irish general election, 1918, held as part of the United Kingdom general election, 1918, held in December, the newly reformed Sinn Féin party had secured a large majority of seats with slightly less than 50% of the vote because of the "First past the post" electoral system. This provided a propaganda coup for Sinn Féin, and so the British Government introduced the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1919, which allowed for parliamentary elections by proportional representation in all of Ireland for the first time, by the system of the Single transferable vote for multi-member electoral areas. The government hoped that the new system would reveal less-than-monolithic support for Sinn Féin, and it was first tested in the 1920 local elections.
The electoral method introduced by the 1919 Act is still used in Irish elections today.
January 1920.
The urban borough elections result for first preference votes were:
Excluding the more unionist province of Ulster, the urban results were:
June 1920.
The rural elections showed a much greater level of support for Sinn Féin in its core support area. It took control of 338 out of 393 local government bodies, county councils, boards of guardians and rural district councils across the whole island.

Prowler (satellite)

Prowler was an American reconnaissance satellite launched aboard in 1990 in order to study Soviet satellites in geosynchronous orbit. The government of the United States has never acknowledged its existence, however it has been identified by amateur observers and through leaked information.
Spacecraft.
Prowler was based on the HS-376 satellite bus, developed by Hughes. It had a mass of around and carried modifications to reduce its visibility to ground-based observers and to radar. Following the satellite's retirement these modifications ceased to be effective, allowing it to be found by amateur observers.
Prowler was designed to manoeuvre to within a few metres of satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Its purpose was either to monitor them and return data about them, or to perform a signals intelligence mission such as intercepting communications between those satellites and the ground.
Launch.
Prowler was deployed from Space Shuttle "Atlantis" during the STS-38 mission. STS-38 was launched from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 22:48:13 UTC on 15 November 1990. The mission was officially acknowledged to have deployed a single satellite, USA-67, which observers have since identified as part of the Satellite Data System. Prowler was deployed from "Atlantis" at around 04:37 UTC on 17 November 1990, and boosted into geosynchronous transfer orbit by a PAM-D upper stage. A second patch produced for the STS-38 mission showed a Shuttle orbiter in shadows above an illuminated orbiter; reversing the official mission patch; symbolising the covert nature of the mission.
Identification.
The nature of STS-38's payload was classified, however observers attempted to identify it. Due to Prowler's stealthy nature, USA-67 was initially believed to be the only satellite deployed. As a result of there being only one payload and two upper stages, it was identified as a Magnum satellite, deployed via a two-stage Inertial Upper Stage. Photographs released from later in the STS-38 mission have shown that "Atlantis" was not carrying the adaptor necessary to deploy an IUS.
In July 1998, amateur observers in Texas observed an unidentified object flashing in geosynchronous orbit. The object was subsequently lost, however it was rediscovered in June 2000 when its flashes became brighter; some even visible with the naked eye. Following the 2000 observations amateur observers were still unable to identify the satellite, so began referring to it by the pseudo International Designator 2000-653A and pseudo Satellite Catalog Number 90007.
In 2004 NBC published an article containing details about Prowler and its mission.
In January 2010, amateur observer Ted Molczan cross-referenced data from the European Space Agency's Classification of Geosynchronous Objects survey with amateur observations of classified spacecraft, noting that an unidentified object designated UI.139 by the survey corresponded with observations of 2000-653A, and that its orbit was close to that of USA-67 - speculating that they may have been from the same launch. Based on this, Molczan conducted a more detailed investigation, and in 2011 published a paper identifying 2000-653A as Prowler.

Ángel Vicente Peñaloza

Ángel Vicente "Chacho" Peñaloza (1796 – 1863) was a military officer and provincial leader prominent in both the history of La Rioja Province and the Argentine Civil Wars that preceded national unity.
Life and times.
Early life and military experience.
Peñaloza was born in Sierra de los Llanos, a rural community in southern La Rioja Province. Raised in privileged circumstances, he was educated by a priest. The priest, an uncle of the young Peñaloza's, nicknamed him "Chacho" (a diminutive form of "muchacho", or "guy"). He enrolled in the provincial militia, and fought under the command of Captain Juan Facundo Quiroga, reaching the rank of Captain by 1826.
That year, he fought in the Battle of La Ciudadela against Tucumán Province Governor Gregorio Aráoz de La Madrid. Aráoz was severely wounded and defeated, and Peñaloza's own wounds, as well as his role in the battle, earned him the rank of commanding Captain of the Militia. He fought in this capacity in the battles of Rincón de Valladares (1827), La Tablada (1829), and Oncativo (1830). His defeats in the latter two, however, enabled the formation of the Unitarian League by José María Paz, against which the La Rioja forces were little match.
Military leader of La Rioja.
Peñaloza returned to La Rioja, and helped oust Aráoz de La Madrid's proxy, Governor Domingo Villafañe, in 1831. Following Quiroga's 1836 assassination, Peñaloza secured an alliance with San Juan Province Governor Martín Yanzón, and though their attempted invasion of La Rioja failed, the victor, Tomás Brizuela, pardoned Peñaloza upon his election as governor in May 1837.
Peñaloza joined Brizuela, who was named commanding military officer in 1840 for the newly formed Northern Coalition. The group, an alliance of fellow Federalists opposed to the paramount Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Juan Manuel de Rosas, chose poorly in their alliances, supporting Juan Lavalle's failed revolt against Rosas, as well as their former foe, Aráoz de La Madrid, in a failed battle against a Rosas ally in Mendoza Province. Following these 1841 defeats, Peñaloza fled to Chile.
He returned in 1842 to join his erstwhile ally from San Juan, Martín Yanzón. They were ultimately routed by San Juan Governor Nazario Benavídez, however, and Peñaloza again fled to Chile. He returned in 1845, overthrew the Governor of La Rioja, formed an alliance with Benavídez, and installed Manuel Vicente Bustos as Governor of La Rioja in 1848. 
Bustos named him commander of his home district, Los Llanos, and by 1854, Peñaloza had regained his rank as commander of the La Rioja militia. Rosas had, by then, been defeated at the 1852 Battle of Caseros, and Peñaloza offered the new President of the Argentine Confederation, General Justo José de Urquiza, his support. Peñaloza became the effective ruler of La Rioja, becoming a "caudillo", or strongman, in his province. He earned respect for his accessibility, diligence, and gaucho persona.
Rebellion against the Unitarian government.
The 1858 assassination of Nazario Benavídez, San Juan's Federalist governor, by Liberals allied to Buenos Aires centralists inflamed tensions between the Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires, and President Urquiza commissioned Peñaloza to seize control of San Juan, which the latter would administer on a receivership basis. The breakdown of the peace obtained at the Pact of San José de Flores in 1859 prompted Peñaloza to seek an alliance with Tucumán governor Celedonio Gutiérrez. The invasion of Bartolomé Mitre's Unitarian Party forces led to their retreat during 1861 and 1862, culminating in a siege on the city of San Luis by Peñaloza's decimated troops. Peñaloza was deceived in the subsequent Treaty of La Banderita, receiving dead troops in exchange for prisoners of war.
Resolute in his losing struggle, Peñaloza wrote to Mitre (by then President of Argentina) in March 1863, to explain that:
Peñaloza won victories in La Rioja and entered the city of Córdoba on June 14, 1863. His refusal to fight within city limits led to his defeat on June 28, at Pajas Blancas. During the subsequent retreat, he was routed again in Los Gigantes, San Juan Province, by Colonel Pablo Irrazábal.
Peñaloza retreated to La Rioja, and manage to depose a military junta installed during his absence. Confronted again by Irrazábal at Olta, he was defeated and on November 12, surrendered, relinquishing a facón that remained as his only weapon. Irrazábal, however, killed Peñaloza with a tacuara spear, and his body was then riddled with gunfire. His severed head was displayed on a pike at Olta, and his wife, Victoria Romero, was forced into servitude, sweeping the streets of San Juan in chains.
Legacy.
Peñaloza represented barbarism to Domingo Sarmiento and a threat to national unity to Bartolomé Mitre. His supporters in the hinterland provinces, however, highlighted his role as a bulwark against what they saw as Buenos Aires hegemony over national affairs. Both celebrated and notorious in life, Peñaloza was commemorated by writer José Hernández, who wrote "Vida del Chacho" within weeks of Peñaloza's death, and by poet Olegario Víctor Andrade. His dagger was put on display at the La Rioja Historical Museum. The words carved on its handle told of his egalitarian cause and principles: ""no one worth more than another, no one worth less than another""

John Coney (engraver)

John Coney (1786–1833) was an English architectural draughtsman and engraver.
Life.
He was born at Ratcliffe Highway, London. He was apprenticed to an architect, but never followed the profession. He commenced making pencil drawings of the interior of Westminster Abbey and other Gothic buildings as early as the age of fifteen; these he sold to dealers, and other casual customers, at low prices.
He died in Camberwell in 1833.
Works.
In 1815, he published his first work, a series of eight views of the exterior and interior of Warwick Castle, drawn and etched by himself. Shortly afterwards he was employed by Harding to draw and engrave the series of exterior and interior views of the Cathedrals and Abbey Churches of England, to illustrate the new edition of William Dugdale's "Monasticon", edited by Sir Henry Ellis. These plates occupied a great portion of his time for fourteen years, and are executed with consummate skill. In 1829, he began the engravings of 'Ancient Cathedrals, Hôtels de Ville, and other public buildings in France, Holland, Germany, and Italy;' which were drawn from life by himself. This work was intended to be comprised in twelve parts, but only eight were published. Charles Heathcote Tatham wrote the descriptions. 
In 1831 Coney began a similar series of the "Architectural Beauties of Continental Europe", for which Hannibal Evans Lloyd wrote the descriptions. This work consists of 28 large plates of remarkable edifices in France, the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy, and 56 vignettes, all drawn and etched by himself. In addition to these laborious undertakings, he executed numerous drawings in pencil, and also in colours, for private commissions; and necessity often compelled him to part with many to picture-dealers and print-sellers. He was employed by Cockerell, the architect, to engrave a very large 'View of Rome,' and another plate as a companion to it, neither of which was published. His drawings exhibit all the minutest details without the appearance of labour, yet with a neatness that is 
truly surprising. A 'View of the Interior of Milan Cathedral' was published after his death for the benefit of his widow.

Pálffy Palace (Zámocká Street)

Pálffy Palace () is a 17th-century building on Zámocká Street in the Old Town of Bratislava, Slovakia, situated just underneath the Bratislava Castle. It is the summer pavilion of a large palace complex that was slowly demolished after the year 1900. Today, the building is used for cultural events.
History.
Pálffy Palace and Garden was a large complex built during the reconstruction of the Bratislava castle after 1635 by Pavol Pálffy, who decided to build a palace for himself on Schlosgrund. The service road, used to during the construction and later for supplying the palace later became today's Zámocká Street. This street was settled with Jewish settlers coming into the city from the lands of Mikuláš Pálffy. The city of Bratislava became owner of the palace in 1870 and artillery barracks were established there together with an orphanage and some flats for the poor. In 1900 the whole complex was gradually demolished to make room for new buildings, among others the student dormitory Svoradov and elementary school at Palisády Street.
The only part of the former Pálffy Palace and Garden that survived was the Summer Pavillon. It was later restored and today it is known as Pálffy Palace at Zámocká Street.
Today.
Today, the building serves as a cultural establishment with concerts of classical music taking place here, as well as design cultural events, exhibitions and international conferences. 
The restored palace is best accessed from the "Zochova" and "Kapucinska" public transport stops walking up the hill towards Bratislava Castle or from Palisády Street, walking downhill. Pálffy Palace is located approximately 5 minutes walking from the historical city center.

Domestic football.
Senior Club football.
There does not seem to be fixed clubs in Palau. Instead, teams are put together only once a year, for the Palau Soccer League. Team Bangladesh is the oldest club in Palau, founded in 2004.
Palau Soccer League.
The Palau Soccer Association currently runs one domestic football tournament for the amateur teams in the country. This tournament, the Palau Soccer League has been contested since 2004 with 3 of the 8 seasons so far won by Team Bangladesh.
Youth Club football.
Palau Youth Soccer League.
As well as the adult league, since 2013, the Palau Soccer Association has been running the Palau Youth Soccer League for young players to help their development.

Bioelectrochemical reactor

Bioelectrochemical reactors are a type of bioreactor where bioelectrochemical processes can take place. They are used in bioelectrochemical syntheses, environmental remediation and electrochemical energy conversion. Examples of bioelectrochemical reactors include microbial electrolysis cells, microbial fuel cells and enzymatic biofuel cells and electrolysis cells, microbial electrosynthesis cells, and biobatteries.
This bioreactor is divided in two parts: The anode, where the oxidation reaction takes place; And the cathode, where the reduction occurs.
History.
In 1911 M. Potter described how microbial conversions could create reducing power,and thus electrical current. Twenty years later Cohen (1931) investigate the capacity of bacteria to produce an electrical flow and he noted that the main limitation is the small capacity of microorganism to current generation. It tooks until the 60's since Berg and Canfield (1964) build the first Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC).
Nowadays the investigation on bioelectrochemical reactors is increasing exponentially. These devices have real application on fields like water treatment, energy production and storage, resources production recycling and recovery.
Principles.
Electron current is inherent to the microbial metabolism. Microorganism transfer electrons from an electron donor (lower potential species)to an electron acceptor (higher potential species) If the electron acceptor is an external ion or molecule the process is called respiration. If the process is internal electron transfer is called fermentation. The microorganism attempt to maximize their energy gain by selecting the electron acceptor with the highest potential available. In nature mainly mineral containing iron or manganese oxides are being reduced. Often soluble electron acceptors are depleted in the microbial environment. The microorganism can also maximize their energy selecting a good electron donor which can be easily metabolized. These processes are done by extracellular electron transfer (EET).
The theoretical energy gain ΔG for microorganism relates directly the potential difference between the electron acceptor and the donor. But the inefficiencies like internal resistances will decrease this energy gain. The advantage of these devices is their high selectivity and in high speed processes limited by kinetic factors.
The most common studied species are Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter sulfurreducens. However, more species have been studied in recent years.
In March 25, 2013, Scientists at the University of East Anglia were able to transfer electrical charge by letting the bacteria touch on a metal or mineral surface. The research shows that it is possible to 'tether' bacteria directly to electrodes.

Traditionally practicing nomadic pastoralism of sheep and camels in a triangular area with its apex at Ajdabiya, the Zuwayya conquered the richest oasis of the interior, Kufra, in 1840, subduing the indigenous Toubou tribes. The Zuwayya tribe owns most of the date palm groves of the Kufra oases, employing the Toubou tribesmen as labourers. 
The Zuwayya together with the Majabra tribe of Jalu converted to the Senussi order in the late 19th century, allowing the spread of this ideology into Wadai and Chad. 
The Zuwayya tribe took part in the Libyan civil war on the side of the opposition.

Charco del Palo

Charco del Palo is a naturist holiday village on the north-eastern coast of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands. The village was established around 1970 by the German entrepreneur Gregor Kaiser. In due course, it has developed into a popular naturist resort: nudity is permitted everywhere in the village, and practised universally. Its isolated location, at the end of a dedicated three kilometer long access road, helps to achieve privacy, while the village remains open to all. Visitors are mainly German, British, and Dutch. The village's population increased from 82 in the year 2000 to 229 in 2011.
The development was originally named Castillo de Papagayo, but since this causes confusion with the well-known Playa de Papagayo nude beach in the region of Playa Blanca in southern Lanzarote, the name Charco del Palo, which refers to a nearby prominent coastal pool now developed for bathing, has become standard.
Most of the bungalows and apartments are private property; many are being rented out when their owners are not using them. The German nudist travel organization Oböna owns an apartment complex here as well. The village has a few restaurants (Reiner's Pub, Jardin Tropical, and La Tunera) and a small supermarket; these can only be visited while clothed. The terraces of the restaurants do allow (and frequently see) naked use.
The village is built on pale sandy soil, but the coast is rocky, with no beaches. However, three sheltered coves have been developed for safe bathing.
Charco del Palo is located near the villages of Mala and Guatiza, both about 3 km away, which are served by a regular bus route between the island's capital Arrecife and the north of the island. The surrounding countryside is dominated by fields of prickly pear cactus (known locally as "tunera"), on which cochineal beetles are reared, and a few small extinct volcano cones.
The village lies mostly within the municipality of Haría, but the border with Teguise cuts through the southern part. All the public land in the area is owned by the original developer, who is responsible for providing public services. However, in recent times, residents have been complaining about neglect of public services such as sewerage, paving, and public lighting, and have been campaigning for the municipalities to assume responsibility for maintenance.

<doc id="31002435" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31002435" title="Knowledge extraction">
Knowledge extraction

Knowledge extraction is the creation of knowledge from structured (relational databases, XML) and unstructured (text, documents, images) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to information extraction (NLP) and ETL (data warehouse), the main criteria is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a relational schema. It requires either the reuse of existing formal knowledge (reusing identifiers or ontologies) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.
The RDB2RDF W3C group is currently standardizing a language for extraction of RDF from relational databases. Another popular example for knowledge extraction is the transformation of Wikipedia into structured data and also the mapping to existing knowledge (see DBpedia and Freebase).
Overview.
After the standardization of knowledge representation languages such as RDF and OWL, much research has been conducted in the area, especially regarding transforming relational databases into RDF, identity resolution, knowledge discovery and ontology learning. The general process uses traditional methods from information extraction and extract, transform, and load (ETL), which transform the data from the sources into structured formats.
The following criteria can be used to categorize approaches in this topic (some of them only account for extraction from relational databases):
Examples.
Entity linking.
President Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing that the policy provides more generous assistance. 
Extraction from structured sources to RDF.
1:1 Mapping from RDB Tables/Views to RDF Entities/Attributes/Values.
When building a RDB representation of a problem domain, the starting point is frequently an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). Typically, each entity is represented as a database table, each attribute of the entity becomes a column in that table, and relationships between entities are indicated by foreign keys. Each table typically defines a particular class of entity, each column one of its attributes. Each row in the table describes an entity
instance, uniquely identified by a primary key. The table rows collectively describe an entity set. In an equivalent RDF representation of the same entity set:
So, to render an equivalent view based on RDF semantics, the basic mapping algorithm would be as follows:
Early mentioning of this basic or direct mapping can be found in Tim Berners-Lee's comparison of the ER model to the RDF model.
Complex mappings of relational databases to RDF.
The 1:1 mapping mentioned above exposes the legacy data as RDF in a straightforward way, additional refinements can be employed to improve the usefulness of RDF output respective the given Use Cases. Normally, information is lost during the transformation of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to relational tables (Details can be found in object-relational impedance mismatch) and has to be reverse engineered. From a conceptual view, approaches for extraction can come from two directions. The first direction tries to extract or learn an OWL schema from the given database schema. Early approaches used a fixed amount of manually created mapping rules to refine the 1:1 mapping. More elaborate methods are employing heuristics or learning algorithms to induce schematic information (methods overlap with ontology learning). While some approaches try to extract the information from the structure inherent in the SQL schema (analysing e.g. foreign keys), others analyse the content and the values in the tables to create conceptual hierarchies (e.g. a columns with few values are candidates for becoming categories). The second direction tries to map the schema and its contents to a pre-existing domain ontology (see also: ontology alignment). Often, however, a suitable domain ontology does not exist and has to be created first.
XML.
As XML is structured as a tree, any data can be easily represented in RDF, which is structured as a graph. XML2RDF is one example of an approach that uses RDF blank nodes and transforms XML elements and attributes to RDF properties. The topic however is more complex as in the case of relational databases. In a relational table the primary key is an ideal candidate for becoming the subject of the extracted triples. An XML element, however, can be transformed - depending on the context- as a subject, a predicate or object of a triple. XSLT can be used a standard transformation language to manually convert XML to RDF.
Extraction from natural language sources.
The largest portion of information contained in business documents (about 80%) is encoded in natural language and therefore unstructured. Because unstructured data is rather a challenge for knowledge extraction, more sophisticated methods are required, which generally tend to supply worse results compared to structured data. The potential for a massive acquisition of extracted knowledge, however, should compensate the increased complexity and decreased quality of extraction. In the following, natural language sources are understood as sources of information, where the data is given in an unstructured fashion as plain text. If the given text is additionally embedded in a markup document (e. g. HTML document), the mentioned systems normally remove the markup elements automatically.
Traditional information extraction (IE).
Traditional information extraction is a technology of natural language processing, which extracts information from typically natural language texts and structures these in a suitable manner. The kinds of information to be identified must be specified in a model before beginning the process, which is why the whole process of traditional Information Extraction is domain dependent. The IE is split in the following five subtasks.
The task of named entity recognition is to recognize and to categorize all named entities contained in a text (assignment of a named entity to a predefined category). This works by application of grammar based methods or statistical models.
Coreference resolution identifies equivalent entities, which were recognized by NER, within a text. There are two relevant kinds of equivalence relationship. The first one relates to the relationship between two different represented entities (e.g. IBM Europe and IBM) and the second one to the relationship between an entity and their anaphoric references (e.g. it and IBM). Both kinds can be recognized by coreference resolution.
During template element construction the IE system identifies descriptive properties of entities, recognized by NER and CO. These properties correspond to ordinary qualities like red or big.
Template relation construction identifies relations, which exist between the template elements. These relations can be of several kinds, such as works-for or located-in, with the restriction, that both domain and range correspond to entities.
In the template scenario production events, which are described in the text, will be identified and structured with respect to the entities, recognized by NER and CO and relations, identified by TR.
Ontology-based information extraction (OBIE).
Ontology-based information extraction is a subfield of information extraction, with which at least one ontology is used to guide the process of information extraction from natural language text. The OBIE system uses methods of traditional information extraction to identify concepts, instances and relations of the used ontologies in the text, which will be structured to an ontology after the process. Thus, the input ontologies constitute the model of information to be extracted.
Ontology learning (OL).
Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting the corresponding domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.
Semantic annotation (SA).
During semantic annotation, natural language text is augmented with metadata (often represented in RDFa), which should make the semantics of contained terms machine-understandable. At this process, which is generally semi-automatic, knowledge is extracted in the sense, that a link between lexical terms and for example concepts from ontologies is established. Thus, knowledge is gained, which meaning of a term in the processed context was intended and therefore the meaning of the text is grounded in machine-readable data with the ability to draw inferences. Semantic annotation is typically split into the following two subtasks.
At the terminology extraction level, lexical terms from the text are extracted. For this purpose a tokenizer determines at first the word boundaries and solves abbreviations. Afterwards terms from the text, which correspond to a concept, are extracted with the help of a domain-specific lexicon to link these at entity linking.
In entity linking a link between the extracted lexical terms from the source text and the concepts from an ontology or knowledge base such as DBpedia is established. For this, candidate-concepts are detected appropriately to the several meanings of a term with the help of a lexicon. Finally, the context of the terms is analyzed to determine the most appropriate disambiguation and to assign the term to the correct concept.
Tools.
The following criteria can be used to categorize tools, which extract knowledge from natural language text.
The following table characterizes some tools for Knowledge Extraction from natural language sources.
Knowledge discovery.
Knowledge discovery describes the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns that can be considered knowledge "about" the data. It is often described as "deriving" knowledge from the input data. Knowledge discovery developed out of the data mining domain, and is closely related to it both in terms of methodology and terminology.
The most well-known branch of data mining is knowledge discovery, also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Just as many other forms of knowledge discovery it creates abstractions of the input data. The "knowledge" obtained through the process may become additional "data" that can be used for further usage and discovery.
Another promising application of knowledge discovery is in the area of software modernization, weakness discovery and compliance which involves understanding existing software artifacts. This process is related to a concept of reverse engineering. Usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary. An entity relationship is a frequent format of representing knowledge obtained from existing software. Object Management Group (OMG) developed specification Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) which defines an ontology for the software assets and their relationships for the purpose of performing knowledge discovery of existing code. Knowledge discovery from existing software systems, also known as software mining is closely related to data mining, since existing software artifacts contain enormous value for risk management and business value, key for the evaluation and evolution of software systems. Instead of mining individual data sets, software mining focuses on metadata, such as process flows (e.g. data flows, control flows, & call maps), architecture, database schemas, and business rules/terms/process.

Sa`ada and Murabtin

The Sa`ada (singular Sa`dawi) and Murabtin (singular Murabit) form a twofold social division within the Bedouins of western Egypt and eastern Libya. 
In modern times, the term "Murabit" contrasts with "Sa`dawi" and marks a division of social status among the Bedouin component of the population of this region, where the "Murabtin" are of lower status.
The existence of such a division is a sensitive issue, and its continued observation in Matruh is discouraged by the Egyptian government. Likewise, categorization of the Murabtin as either Arab Bedouins or Arab-Berber or Arabized Berber may be subject to disagreement. 
The etymology of "murābiṭ" is unclear. It is interpreted as "the tied" (c.f. marabout), but it is also derived from "ribaṭ", the term for a border fortress. 
Ethnographic literature has tended to describe the "Sa`ada"-"Murabtin" bifurcation in feudal terms, describing the Murabtin as clients or vassals. But during the 20th century, much of the original division has disappeared. This tendency was noted as early as in the 1920s, and by the 1940s, large groups of Murabtin were reported as living independently of the Sa`ada, without paying any tribute. 
By the late 20th century, the division has become mostly a matter of genealogical tradition without any direct societal or economic reality. Some Murabtin groups, such as the Qadhadhfa of Libya, have risen to political power, while some Sa`ada tribes have passed into oblivion.

Flatbush Town Hall at 35 Snyder Avenue between Flatbush and Bedford Avenues in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, is a historic town hall built in 1874-75 and designed by John Y. Culyer in the High Victorian Gothic style in the Ruskinian mode. It is a two story masonry building on a stone foundation, and features a three-story bell tower with a steep hip roof. The building dates from the time before the Town of Flatbush was integrated into the City of Brooklyn, in 1894, after which the building served as a magistrate's court and the New York City Police Department's 67th Police Precinct station.
Due to the efforts of the Town of Flatbush Civic and Cultural Association and the Flatbush Historical Society, the building was saved from a planned demolition, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1966, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. In the late 1980s it underwent a redesign and refurbishment by the New York City Department of Administrative Services, and it is now used as a public school focused on the needs of special education children.

Westye Parr Egeberg

Westye Parr Egeberg (21 April 1877 – 2 February 1959) was a Norwegian military officer, businessperson and politician for the Conservative Party.
Personal life.
He was born in Kristiania as a son of Ferdinand Julian Egeberg (1842–1921). He was an uncle of Ferdinand Finne, nephew of Einar Westye Egeberg, Sr., a great-grandson of Westye Egeberg and a grandnephew of Westye Martinus Egeberg, surgeon Christian Egeberg and composer Fredrikke Egeberg.
Career.
He finished his secondary education in 1896 and studied one year at the Norwegian Military Academy, earning the rank of Second Lieutenant in 1897. After a stay abroad from 1898 to 1900 he then took the cand.philol. degree in 1903, but continued his military career and became a Premier Lieutenant in 1905 and Captain in 1916.

Rehberg was born into a middle-class protestant family in Hanover in 1758, the son of a secretary for the estates of Calenberg (one of the duchies of Hannover). His elder brother, August Wilhelm Rehberg (1757–1836), became a notable politician, philosopher and writer. Friedrich, himself, studied first with Oeser in Leipzig, then with Giovanni Battista Casanova and Johann Eleazar Zeissig, in Dresden. In 1777, he went to Rome, where he studied the Old Masters, such as Caracci, Domenichino and Michelangelo, under Anton Raphael Mengs. Here he became a close friend of fellow-painter David.

John Lovelace, 3rd Baron Lovelace

John Lovelace, 3rd Baron Lovelace (1641 – 27 September 1693) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1661 to 1670 when he inherited the peerage as Baron Lovelace.
Life.
Lovelace was born at Hurley, Buckinghamshire, the son of John Lovelace, 2nd Baron Lovelace, and Lady Anne, 7th Baroness Wentworth and Baroness Le Despenser. 
He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 25 July 1655, and was awarded MA on 9 September 1661.
In 1661, Lovelace was elected Member of Parliament for Berkshire in the Cavalier Parliament, and sat until 1670 when he inherited the peerage on the death of his father. 
He developed a reputation as an ardent Whig; though he professed to be a Puritan in religion he was notorious as a heavy drinker and a sportsman and gambler.
Lovelace was also notoriously anti-Catholic: he created a scandal when a Catholic magistrate sent him a summons, and he used it in public to wipe his bottom, for which he was severely reprimanded by the Privy Council, and threatened with prosecution. Kenyon remarks that a more sensible ruler than James II would have let the matter pass as a rather tasteless joke. 
He was admitted into the confidence of those organising the Glorious Revolution to replace the Catholic James II with the Protestant William of Orange. 
In March 1688, he was summoned before the Privy Council, but was released on insufficient evidence. 
He arranged secret meetings in a cellar at his Ladye Place home in Hurley. 
Once he heard that William had landed in England, he set out with 70 men to join him, but was captured and imprisoned in Gloucester Castle. 
After his release he entered Oxford with a force of 300 cavalry to occupy the city for William.
Lovelace was Captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners in 1689 and was Chief Justice in Eyre south of Trent. 
In 1692, suffering from a life of alcoholic excess, Lovelace fell down a flight of stairs and never recovered. He died in 1693 in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London at the age of about 53.
Lovelace married in 1662 Martha Pye, the daughter and coheiress of Sir Edmund Pye, 1st Baronet, of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire. They had one son, John, who died in infancy, and three daughters. The peerage passed to his cousin William’s son, John Lovelace, 4th Baron Lovelace, who became a Governor of the New York colony. Their daughter Martha married Henry Johnson, said to be 'the greatest shipbuilder and shipowner of his day'; and succeeded her grandmother as the 8th Baroness Wentworth.

Franco Archibugi

Franco Archibugi (Rome, Italy 18 September 1926) is an Italian scholar in political, economic and social sciences, university professor in economic policy and spatial planning. He has largely been operating in Italy and in international governmental agencies, in the field of economic development, social welfare and cooperation policy. Author of several works in the subject of planning theory and methodology, is among the theorists (and promoters) of a new unitary discipline of planning - the “Planology”- aimed at creating a bridge between the theoretical scientific progress in economics and other social sciences with the actual political and administrative efficiency and management. He lives in Rome, retired from the University but still an active researcher as President of the Planning Studies Centre, and instructor in its and other educational activities.
Background education.
1944-1952. Sapienza University of Rome. Degree in History and Philosophy.
1947-1950. ISE- BCI- of Economic Studies. Rome department
1963-1964. London School of Economics (LSE). One year Diploma in 'Economics and Social Administration'.
Research and academic activities.
Franco Archibugi has constantly accompanied his technical-professional activities and experiences by research activities (which in their turn resulted into a systematic and scientific concept of planning methodology). After the decline of the experiences of economic planning in Italy (but also elsewhere, in the sixties and seventies, whether in developed or developing countries and in the UN activities), Franco Archibugi focused more intensively his attention and energy on the introduction of a unified approach to planning in the educational and academic world; he has been Full Professor at some Italian Universities and finally at the “Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione” School of Public Administration in Rome. He has been also active in an international networking of scholars who pursue the same intellectual path towards the integrative, socio-economic, unified planning; and for a new scientific experience – the “planology” (never implemented in its appropriate terms), and which he tried to illustrate like new disciplinary field, autonomous and free from its components disciplines (economics, sociology, physical planning, and so on) in a real meta-disciplinary approach: the ‘planological’ (or ‘programming’) approach.
Franco Archibugi has been member of the AESOP (Association of European Schools of Planning) and active in several of its Congresses, and also at the World Planning Schools Congress (WPSC) and to the activities of the GPEAN (Global Planning Education Association Network. He has also been associate at the EAEPE (European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy)participating in some of its Congress. He is also a member of other academic Italian associations like SIEDS (Società Italiana di Economia, Demografia e Statistica) and SGI, (Società Geografica Italiana); of which he is honorary member, and many others.
In his works, Archibugi has often expressed openly his intellectual debt and his derivations to thinking to some great scholars such as Gunnar Myrdal, Ragnar Frisch, Jan Tinbergen and Wassily Leontief. (Of the last three, he has also benefited from friendly personal relations). He believe he follows in their traces, tries to relaunch their thinking (never rightly known and understood); and he hopes to have updated, completed and made explicit the meaning of their work in some way.

Molchi, grust... molchi

Molchi, grust... molchi (Russian: "Молчи, грусть...молчи", English: "Be silent, sorrow...be silent") is Russian silent drama film directed by famous director Pyotr Chardynin and starring several big Russian silent film stars as Vera Kholodnaya, Ossip Runitsch, Vitold Polonsky and Vladimir Maksimov.
This film consisted of two parts, but survived just a 44 minutes long episode from the first part. However, the film is very famous now due to star cast.
Plot.
Paula is a circus performer married to clown-actobat Lorio. Lorio is drinks heavily and eventually he is critically injured when he performs drunk. The crippled Lorio and Paula are forced to become street musicians.
A group of wealthy young men who saw Paula at the circus before, decide to invite the two to perform at their private "bachelor" party, at which Paula is the main attraction.
The young men vie for her attention, give her an expensive necklace and offer Lorio money to turn her over to them. Outraged Paula leaves and refuses to return to the streets to perform. But when they are truly destitute, she returns to offer herself to one of the gentlemen, the artist Volyntsev.
As Lorio sinks deeper into poverty, Paula enjoys her life as a rich man's mistress-for a while. Eventually her lover becomes too possessive for her taste and temperament. He also tired of her. When Volyntsev attempts to offer her to a younger rival Telepnev, she pridefully departs to another young man-Zaritskiy, who is deeply in love with her. Zaritskiy is an inveterate gambler and playing against Telepnev he has lost a huge sum of money. Desperate, he devises a plot to steal a check he gave to Telepnev. While Paula unwittingly serves as decoy, distracting the party by singing for guests, her lover sets off alarm as he attempts to break safe. Telepnev didn't recognised Zaritskiy in the dark room and shot him.
Here we met the end of the first part. The second part is considered as lost.

Temptation (1946 film)

Temptation is a 1946 American drama film noir directed by Irving Pichel. The drama features Merle Oberon and George Brent. The film was based on Robert Smythe Hichens's novel "Bella Donna".
The 1923 film "Bella Donna", starring Pola Negri, which was directed by George Fitzmaurice is also based on that novel. Other versions were filmed in 1918 and 1935.
Plot.
Victorian melodrama, set in Egypt, where a down-on-her-luck courtesan (Oberon) snares a loving but naive Egyptologist (Brent), marries him and moves to Egypt. She quickly becomes bored and embarks on an affair with Mamhoud Baroudi (Korvin). She falls in love with him, and together, they plot to do away with her husband.
Production.
The movie was the first producer Edward Small had made away from United Artists for a number of years. He bought the rights to the novel in 1941 intending to make it as a vehicle for Ilona Massey who had just made "International Lady" for him. He intended to make the film for United Artists but other projects took priority. Over a five year period there were several near-starts and postponements; he almost managed to begin production in February 1946 but there was not enough studio space. Small's deal with United Artists expired so the film became the first shot at Universal by International under the new United World Pictures arrangement.
Reception.
Film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film when it was released, writing "True enough, Miss Oberon looks lovely, Mr. Korvin behaves with bold sang-froid and George Brent is sufficiently unimpressive to seem a husband that a dame would double-cross. Paul Lucas, Arnold Moss and Lenore Ulric also act as though they thought they had a script. But the whole thing is as claptrap in its nature as it was when Pola Negri played it back in 1923."
"Variety" magazine panned the screenplay, writing "Production is well-stacked with solid values in every department except for the screenplay, which falls short in its attempt to stretch an unsubstantial story line over so long a running time."

Jena West station

Jena West station is to the west of the centre of the city of Jena in the German state of Thuringia at the 22.59 km mark (from Weimar station) of the Weimar–Gera railway between Weimar, Jena-Göschwitz station and Gera Hauptbahnhof. This line is also called the "Holzland Railway" and it is part of the Mid-German Connection. The station is located in the suburb of Jena-Süd.
The station is 171.64 metres above sea level and was opened on 29 June 1876 simultaneously with the railway. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station.
History.
The original station building was opened with the line in 1876, but the building in its current form was built in 1878 by the "Weimar-Gera Railway Company" ("Weimar-Geraer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft"), apart from two changes described below. In 1908, the open staircase in the middle of the building was replaced by a new central building. In1981, the supervisory building was added on the platform side of the reception building. The station building was renovated in 2000 and attracted some retail outlets (shops selling magazines, flowers and model trains and several snack bars). The deportation of Jews, Sinti and Romani during the Second World War is commemorated by a flower-decked plaque at the track-side entrance of the entrance building. In the second half of 2006 the platforms were repainted, new safety systems were installed and a passage was opened that connects platform track 2 with the Schott glass works.
Since the operation of trains through the difficult terrain between Großschwabhausen and Jena West was difficult, especially in the early years of the Weimar–Gera line, it was necessary to use pusher locomotives to provide assistance. A shed was built at the station with accommodation for two pusher engines. Around 1926 the engine shed was closed down because the power of locomotives had increased significantly. It has since accommodated other activities, including a gymnasium. It is now used as a club and as the home of various cultural activities.
Freight facilities.
In 1878 the first siding was established, which was followed by another one in 1889 and by one to Schott & Gen., now Jena Glass Company ("JENAer Glas"), in 1894. At first the freight had to transferred on a narrow-gauge track to the glass works, but it later converted into a standard gauge track. There was also a brewery connection, on which wagons (mostly carrying coal) were moved up to the terminal and were then transferred to a light railway with 600 mm gauge. This connection existed until the 1970s.
Importance.
Jena West station is the busiest station on the Weimar–Gera line after Jena-Göschwitz station. It is the busiest of the Jena stations and it is currently used on average by about 5,000 passengers a day, so its ridership is higher than that of Jena Paradies station, which is an Intercity-Express stop on the Saal Railway, but has a comparatively low 3,500 passengers a day. Jena West station is heavily frequented by commuters and students on their way to the neighbouring cities of Erfurt and Weimar, which are about 30 and 15 minutes away respectively.
Nevertheless, in 2001 the station lost its InterRegio services on the Aachen / Düsseldorf–Paderborn–Bebra–Weimar–Jena West–Gera–Chemnitz route, its last long-distance service. It is now served by Regionalbahn and Regional-Express trains at regular intervals, operating on weekdays at intervals of 30 or 60 minutes each way. Freight operations and sidings are now closed and all freight tracks were torn up in 2004.
Station name.
The station was called "Jena Weimar-Geraer Bahnhof", as distinct from "Jena Saalbahnhof" (Jena Saal station) on the Saal line, until 30 June 1924, when its name was changed to its current name at the request of the city of Jena.
Location and connections.
The Jena Paradies station is situated about 600 metres to the east and the inner city of Jena is located about 800 metres from the station to the north-east. OVO bus route 102 runs between the two stations, as well as PVG Apolda route 280, which runs less regularly.
Three regional routes are operated by DB Regio Southeast. Together these provise a service of two trains per hour in each direction between Weimar and Göschwitz on weekdays.

Sindicato de Médicos de Asistencia Pública, the Spanish doctors' union, started on 22 August 1991, under the acronym SIMAP-CV. "SIMAP" is a union of doctors working in public health. Since its foundation has been involved in various initiatives to protect public health and the rights of physicians.
This union achieved notoriety by being the promoter of the SIMAP case before the European Court of Justice, referring to the working time of physicians. The SIMAP case (also known as "Sindicato de Médicos de Asistencia Pública v Conselleria de Sanidad y Consumo de la Generalidad Valenciana") is a European labour law and UK labour law case concerning the Working Time Directive, which is relevant for the Working Time Regulations 1998.
At the European level, the SIMAP case had a significant impact in the regulation of working time and the implementation of Working Time Directive.
A recent editorial in the British Medical Journal raises "reversing the SiMAP and Jaeger rulings, renegotiating the new deal, relaxing immigration rules, and enhancing mobility between specialties will all give the NHS more flexibility to cope with its ever increasing demands."

Chittaranjan Mitra, popularly known as CR Mitra and CRM, was an Indian scientist who is best remembered as the second Director of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS). He played a pivotal role in the transformation of the Institute from a local engineering college to a reputed university.
Education.
Born in 1926 in Allahabad in the erstwhile United Provinces of British India, C.R. Mitra studied at Allahabad University, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, did his Masters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then acquired a Doctorate in Engineering Science from Columbia University, New York.
Career.
Returning to India in the 1960s, Mitra first became the director of the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute. In 1969, he was offered the position of director of BITS Pilani by Ghanshyam Das Birla. At this time, the institute was undergoing major changes under the leadership of a committee of experts from MIT. He is credited with increasing the pace of those reforms, as well as for constituting a "practice school" program of industry internship "far more ambitious than anything MIT had done, as a requirement for all faculty and students". To address the human resource development needs of the Indian industry and the financial challenge of running higher degree programs at BITS Pilani, in the year 1979, he pioneered the Work Integrated Learning Programs, which provided education and training to employees of Indian Industries. Today, these programs have an enrollment of about 17,000 students throughout India and are responsible for earning two thirds of the revenue of the Institute.
Mitra was responsible for introducing innovative educational philosophies which made the educational system at BITS Pilani unique, including broad-based, multi-disciplinary approach, semester long course based curricula, practice school, industry-academia collaboration, choosing electives and many other features which were firsts in Indian higher education. He was widely respected by the students who affectionately referred to him as "Dynamic Diro" (Director) 
In 1989, he was invited by NIIT to be their education advisor. He was responsible for introducing the 'GNIIT' program that would become the flagship offering of the Institute. Under his advisory, NIIT rose as one of the leading IT education providers in India.
Death.
Mitra died on August 27, 2008. He is survived by his wife and children.

Beverage can printing

The first hint of beverage can printing goes all the way back to 1909, but it was not until 1935 before the first beer were sold in a can. A brewery in the United States inquired American Can Company about the possibility of packaging their beer in cans. American Can Company is a member of the Tin Can Trust and “controlled a large percentage of business in the United States in tin cans, containers, and packages of tin.” They failed to produce a successful can.
In 1931, American Can Company began to experiment the possibility of beer cans again due to their anticipation on the ending of the Prohibition period. The major obstacle in producing beer cans was that no current cans can withstand the excess pressure that was required in packaging beer. "After two years of research, American Can had overcome the problems of pressure and had developed a coating for the inside of the can to stop the beer reacting with the tinplate."
Now that they developed a successful tin can for packaging beer, American Can Company had to pitch their innovation to breweries, which was hard since this was such a different form of packaging at the time. The larger breweries in the United States “did not want to risk their reputations on such a radical innovation.” A smaller brewery, Gottfried Krueger Brewery, located at Newark, NJ, was in really bad shape due to the Prohibition and death of the founder, and American Can Company offered the canning equipment for free unless it became successful, so they decided to give the beer cans a try. The test results were extremely successful and on January 24, 1935, the first canned beer hit the public market as “Krueger’s Finest Beer. “By the end of 1935, no less than 37 US breweries were producing canned beer.
Felinfoel Brewery Company, located at Llanelli, Wales, became the first brewery outside the United States to sell canned beer, and it was also a success. The packaged beer in was is called a “conetop.” The interest in canned beer suddenly grew so fast that by 1937, 23 breweries were producing 40 brands of canned beer.
The World War II temporarily stopped this innovation until 1952. By this point, most breweries were using flat top cans instead. From the 1950s to the 1960s, all beer can were composed from three pieces of metal. Two-piece cans hit the market in 1974. Throughout the years, innovative ideas and development slowly changed the beer can into what it is today. According to Ball Corporation, beer cans weighed 83 grams in 1951, and was then reduced to 38 grams by 1974, to what it is now today at only 21 grams.
Coors examined many can coating curing methods and decided to implement an ultraviolet system, which they started to do in 1975. Coors is the only manufacturer to use the UV curing method in the United States. In 1986, they made further innovations to their UV coating lines to increase flexibility and efficiency.
How It Relates.
Beer cans have been printed with colored photographic images since 1956, “first was famous Scottish and English landmarks and then with pinup girls,” called the Lager Lovelies. These cans were popular all over the world. Extensive testing has been done with four color printing on the beers, but every attempt proved unsuccessful.
These cans were popular all over the world. Extensive testing has been done with four color printing on the beers, but every attempt proved unsuccessful. Metal Box Company, a United Kingdom company, developed a method called “Reprotherm” for two-piece cans. In this process, the image to be printed is transferred to the can through a printed medium. Recently, a company called Nacano developed a six color printing method for two-piece cans, “but the first cans to be produced by this process have looked faded and washed out.”
Currently, over 60 countries around the world are producing canned beer in every shape and size. In this book, we will explore a newer printing technology for beer cans that utilizes Ultraviolet curable ink and coating.
Benefits of UV Curing.
Prior to the UV curing and coating system, Coors used a conventional production method. The production line is similar, but a four-color offset printer is used and a blanket lays the image onto the can as it spins on a mandrel. The cans are pulled into a gas convention oven by pin chains to cure the inks and varnishes, which take “12 seconds at 400°F.” Afterwards, an internal coating is applied to the cans and it is sent to another gas oven to be cured. Some of the problems using this thermal process of coating and curing includes: “Speed of printing limited by length and speed of pin chain conveyors, high energy costs for gas ovens, and that cans a're damaged? when they become overheated? in the oven.” Also, the use of lubricants on the pin chains is kept to a minimum to prevent it from getting into the can. Because of this, pin chains “wear excessively and break frequently.” Before it can even be repaired, 20 minutes need to be spent to wait for the oven to cool down enough.
UV inks and varnishes contain a “photoinitiator and cure in about 500 milliseconds” when exposure to UV lamps. This method eliminates ALL three of the problems mentioned above that are found in a conventional process. The time it takes to cure the can is so quick that it is no longer limited by the coating process. Since gas ovens are not used, there are no possibility of the cans being damaged due to overheating. A vacuum system is put in place of the pin chains, which only touches the bottom of the can. This reduces the possibility of damaging the interior of the can.
The application of the UV curing process produced the following results (Center for Materials Fabrication, 1987):
While the conventional pin chain and gas oven can operate at up to 1400 cans per minute, the UV curing and vacuum system have the potential to run at much higher speeds, and that will only increase as technology to increase printer and other equipment speed is developed and implemented. The UV varnish coats the beer cans with a strong, abrasion-resistant layer, protecting it in the manufacturing and transportation process. Since there are no longer any pins sticking inside the cans, there is no chance of the interior being scratched or damaged, which can have a negative effect while applying the interior coating. A standard test that measured the interior coating of the UV curing system has “shown a tenfold improvement.”
The UV oven “contains 11 modular lamps and reflectors,” and the power supply is also modular. This makes it extremely quick to replace specific modules which a problem arises or a lamp burns out. 35 kilowatts of electricity is needed to power the UV lamps. This is the equivalent to the amount of electricity used by just the fans for a conventional gas oven. Coors reduced the amount of energy that they used by over 92%[cit?] The conventional oven produces gas that needs to be incinerated to minimize emissions. UV ovens, on the only hand, do not emit any fumes or poses and threats to the environment.
While conventional ovens occupy of floor space, UV ovens only require . This is a big difference in the amount of required floor space. Due to the fact that the UV curing process requires less space and no incineration, “capital costs are about half that of the thermal cure/pin chain conveying system.”
Coatings and inks.
The coatings on metals tend to fall into two categories: thermoplastic or thermoset. A thermoplastic coating does not chemically react when the substrate undergoes drying after the coating process. The drying of thermoplastic coatings is accomplished by evaporation or by applying heat to fuse the material to the metal. The key thing to remember about metals with thermoplastic coatings is that the coatings typically are not resistant to high heat or aggressive solvents. In other words, the coating on the metal can re-melt with exposure to heat or strong solvents from the screen-printing process. A thermoset coating cures by a chemical reaction called polymerization and/or crosslinking. The coating is cured by baking the coated metals at high temperatures for long periods of time. Thermoset coatings tend to be resistant to heat and remelting, and they generally provide excellent solvent and scuff resistance.
Utraviolet light (UV) curing technology-UV process was motivated by a desire to increase can printing speeds, to reduce energy consumption, and to lower air emissions.
Inks for metal printing Both solventbased and UV inks are available for decorating coated metals, but solvent-based formulations are the most commonly used. While advances have been made that allow UV inks to perform well on a growing range of metal materials, the chemical properties and curing characteristics of UV inks still limit their functionality compared to solvent-based varieties.
Solvent based coatings contain solvents at concentrations of approximately 70 to 75 percent by volume (1). The solvent composition is typically a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, ethers, cellosolves and acetates. This method produces significant VOC (volatile organic compound) and HAP (hazardous air pollutant) emissions. The coatings have good abrasion resistance and high quality, but the high VOC emissions have virtually eliminated their use in can plants.
Food Safety.
Metal beverage and food cans all have a thin coating on the inside to prevent corrosion of the metal and potential food contamination. Most can coatings are made from epoxy resins due to the following reasons:
These coatings have made it possible for both beverages and food products to maintain both taste and quality, therefore extending their shelf life. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a main component in epoxy resins. Due to the belief that BPA could migrate during the canning process, the Society of Plastics Industry conducted a study in 1995to figure out just how much BPA was migrating during the canning process. The results of that study were that the average human being would have to ingest 500 pounds of food every day for a lifetime in order to pass the safety level set by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. The average amount of BPA taken in a day is 0.00011 milligrams per kg body weight per day, about 450 times less than the ‘acceptable’ dose of 0.05 milligrams per kg body weight per day.
Other Innovative Beverage Can Technology.
Ball Corporation has been playing with a new kind of laser technology for brand identity on beverage can tabs. When branding is becoming a more and more evolutionary process, those involved in the business are attempting to find a new way to stand out. The can tabs can come in a variety of colors to best engrave high quality letters, numbers and designs right on the tab. Ball also has a market on the following printing techniques:

Traffic congestion reconstruction with Kerner's three-phase theory

Vehicular traffic can be either free or congested. Traffic occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a spatiotemporal process. However, usually traffic can be measured only at some road locations (for example, via road detectors, video cameras, probe vehicle data, or phone data). For efficient traffic control and other intelligent transportation systems, the reconstruction of traffic congestion is necessary at all other road locations at which traffic measurements are not available. Traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time (Fig. 1) based on Boris Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory with the use of the ASDA and FOTO models introduced by Kerner. Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory and, respectively, the ASDA/FOTO models are based on some "common" spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion observed in measured traffic data.
Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion.
Definition.
Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion, which are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. In particular, common features of traffic congestion are independent on weather, road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. 
Kerner’s definitions and [J, respectively, for the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases in congested traffic are examples of common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion.
Propagation of wide moving jams through highway bottlenecks.
In empirical observations, traffic congestion occurs usually at a highway bottleneck as a result of traffic breakdown in an initially free flow at the bottleneck. A highway bottleneck can result from on- and off-ramps, road curves and gradients, road works, etc.
In congested traffic (this is a synonym term to traffic congestion), a phenomenon of the propagation of a moving traffic jam (moving jam for short) is often observed. A moving jam is a local region of low speed and great density that propagates upstream as a whole localized structure. The jam is limited spatially by two jam fronts. At the downstream jam front, vehicles accelerate to a higher speed downstream of the jam. At the upstream jam front, vehicles decelerate while approaching the jam.
A wide moving jam is a moving jam that exhibits the characteristic jam feature which is a "common" spatiotemporal empirical feature of traffic congestion. The jam feature [J defines the wide moving jam traffic phase in congested traffic as follows.
Definition for wide moving jam.
A wide moving jam is a moving traffic jam, which exhibits the characteristic jam feature to propagate through any bottlenecks while maintaining the mean velocity of the downstream jam front denoted by formula_1. 
Kerner’s jam feature can be explained as follows. The motion of the downstream jam front results from acceleration of drivers from a standstill within the jam to traffic flow downstream of the jam. After a vehicle has begun to accelerate escaping from the jam, to satisfy safety driving, the following vehicle begins to accelerate with a time delay. We denote the mean value of this time delay in vehicle acceleration at the downstream jam front by formula_2. Because the average distance between vehicles within the jam, including average vehicle length, equals to formula_3 (where formula_4 is the average vehicle density within the jam), the mean velocity of the downstream jam front formula_1 is
formula_6. 
When traffic parameters (percentage of long vehicles, weather, driver characteristics, etc.) do not change over time, formula_2 and formula_4 are constant in time. This explains why the mean velocity of the downstream jam front formula_1 (1) is the characteristic parameter that does not depend of the flow rates and densities upstream and downstream of the jam.
Catch effect: pinning of downstream front of synchronized flow at bottleneck.
In contrast with the jam feature , the mean velocity of the downstream front of synchronized flow is not self-maintained during the front propagation. This is the "common" feature of synchronized flow that is one of the two phases of traffic congestion.
A particular case of this common feature of synchronized flow is that the downstream synchronized flow front is usually caught at a highway bottleneck. This pinning of the downstream front of synchronized flow at the bottleneck is called the "catch effect". Note that at this downstream front of synchronized flow, vehicles accelerate from a lower speed within synchronized flow upstream of the front to a higher speed in free flow downstream of the front.
Definition for synchronized flow.
Synchronized flow is defined as congested traffic that does not exhibit the jam feature ; in particular, the downstream front of synchronized flow is often fixed at the bottleneck.
Thus Kerner’s definitions and [S for the wide moving jam and synchronized flow phases of his three-phase traffic theory are indeed associated with common empirical features of traffic congestion.
Empirical example of wide moving jam and synchronized flow.
Vehicle speeds measured with road detectors (1 min averaged data) illustrate Kerner’s definitions and [S (Fig. 2 (a, b)). There are two spatiotemporal patterns of congested traffic with low vehicle speeds in Fig. 2 (a). One pattern of congested traffic propagates upstream with almost constant mean velocity of the downstream pattern front through the freeway bottleneck. According to the definition this pattern of congested traffic belongs to the "wide moving jam" traffic phase. In contrast, the downstream front of the other pattern of the congested traffic is fixed at the bottleneck. According to the definition [S this pattern of congested traffic belongs to the "synchronized flow" traffic phase (Fig. 2 (a) and (b)).
ASDA and FOTO models.
The FOTO (Forecasting of traffic objects) model reconstructs and tracks regions of synchronized flow in space and time. The ASDA (Automatische Staudynamikanalyse: Automatic Tracking of Moving Jams) model reconstructs and tracks wide moving jams. The ASDA/FOTO models are devoted to "on-line" applications without calibration of model parameters under different environment conditions, road infrastructure, percentage of long vehicles, etc.
General features.
Firstly, the ASDA/FOTO models identify the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases in measured data of congested traffic. 
One of the empirical features the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases used in the ASDA/FOTO models for traffic phase identification is as follows: Within a wide moving jam, both the speed and flow rate are very small (Fig. 2 (c-f)). In contrast, whereas the speed with the synchronized flow phase is considerably lower than in free flow (Fig. 2 (c, e)), the flow rate in synchronized flow can be as great as in free flow (Fig. 2 (d, f)).
Secondly, based on the abovementioned common features of wide moving jams and synchronized flow, the FOTO model tracks the downstream and upstream fronts of synchronized flow denoted by formula_10, formula_11, where formula_12 is time (Fig. 3). The ADSA model tracks the downstream and upstream fronts of wide moving jams denoted by formula_13, formula_14 (Fig. 3). This tracking is carried out between road locations at which the traffic phases have initially been identified in measured data, i.e., when synchronized flow and wide moving jams cannot be measured.
In other words, the tracking of synchronized flow by the FOTO model and wide moving jams by the ASDA model is performed at road locations at which "no" traffic measurements are available, i.e., the ASDA/FOTO models make the forecasting of the front locations of the traffic phases in time. The ASDA/FOTO models enable us to predict the merging and/or the dissolution of one or more initially different synchronized flow regions and of one or more initially different wide moving jams that occur between measurement locations.
ASDA/FOTO models for data measured by road detectors.
Cumulative flow approach for FOTO.
While the downstream front of synchronized flow at which vehicles accelerate to free flow is usually fixed at the bottleneck (see Fig. 2 (a, b)), the upstream front of synchronized flow at which vehicles moving initially in free flow must decelerate approaching synchronized flow can propagate upstream. In empirical (i.e., measured) traffic data, the velocity of the upstream front of synchronized flow depends usually considerably both on traffic variables within synchronized flow downstream of the front and within free flow just upstream of this front. A good correspondence with empirical data is achieved, if a time-dependence of the location of the synchronized flow front is calculated by the FOTO model with the use of a so-called cumulative flow approach:
formula_15
where formula_16 and formula_17 are respectively the flow rates upstream and downstream of the synchronized flow front, formula_18 is a model parameter [m/vehicles, and formula_19 is the number of road lanes.
Two approaches for jam tracking with ASDA.
There are two main approaches for the tracking of wide moving jams with the ASDA model:
The use of the Stokes-shock-wave formula in ASDA.
The current velocity formula_20 of a front of a wide moving jam is calculated though the use of the shock-wave formula derived by Stokes in 1848: 
formula_21,
where formula_22 and formula_23 the flow rate and density upstream of the jam front that velocity should be found; formula_24 and formula_25 are the flow rate and density downstream of this jam front. In (3) "no any" relationship, in particular, "no" fundamental diagram is used between the flow rates formula_22, formula_24 and vehicle densities formula_23, formula_25 found from measured data independent of each other.
The use of a characteristic velocity of wide moving jams.
If measured data are not available for the tracking of the downstream jam front with the Stokes-shock-wave formula (3), the formula
formula_30
is used in which formula_1 is the characteristic velocity of the downstream jam front associated with Kerner’s jam feature discussed above. This means that after the downstream front of a wide moving jam has been identified at a time instant formula_32, the location of the downstream front of the jam can be estimated with formula
formula_33
The characteristic jam velocity is illustrated in Fig. 4. Two wide moving jams propagate upstream while maintaining the mean velocity of their downstream fronts. There are two jams following each other in this empirical example. 
However, in contrast with the mean velocity of the downstream jam front, the mean velocity of the upstream jam front depends on the flow rate and density in traffic flow upstream of the jam. Therefore, in a general case the use of formula (5) can lead to a great error by the estimation of the mean velocity of the upstream jam front.
In many data measured on German highways has been found formula_34. However, although the mean velocity formula_1 of the downstream jam front is independent of the flow rates and densities upstream and downstream of the jam, formula_1 can depend considerably on traffic parameters like the percentage of long vehicles in traffic, weather, driver characteristics, etc. As a result, the mean velocity formula_1 found in different data measured over years of observations varies approximately within the range formula_38.
On-line applications of ASDA/FOTO models in traffic control centres.
Reconstruction and tracking of spatiotemporal congested patterns with the ASDA/FOTO models is done today online permanently in the traffic control centre of the federal state Hessen (Germany) for 1200 km of freeway network. Since April 2004 measured data of nearly 2500 detectors are automatically analyzed by ASDA/FOTO. The resulting spatiotemporal traffic patterns are illustrated in a space-time diagram showing congested pattern features like Fig. 5. The online system has also been installed in 2007 for North-Rhine Westphalia freeways. The raw traffic data are transferred to WDR, the major public radio broadcasting station from North-Rhine Westphalia in Cologne, who offers traffic messages to the end customer (e. g., radio listener or driver) via broadcast channel RDS. The application covers a part of the whole freeway network with 1900 km of freeway and more than 1000 double loop detectors. In addition, since 2009 ASDA/FOTO models are online in the northern part of Bavaria.
Average traffic flow characteristics and travel time.
In addition to spatiotemporal reconstruction of traffic congestion (Figs. 1 and 5), the ASDA/FOTO models can provide average traffic flow characteristics within synchronized flow and wide moving jams. In turn, this permits the estimation of either travel time on a road section or travel time along any vehicle trajectory (see examples of trajectories 1-4 in Fig. 5).
ASDA/FOTO models for data measured by probe vehicles.
Firstly, the ASDA and FOTO models identify transition points for phase transitions along the trajectory of a probe vehicle. Each of the transition points is associated to the front separating spatially two of the three different traffic phases each other (free flow (F), synchronized flow (S), wide moving jam (J)). After the transition points have been found, the ASDA/FOTO models reconstruct regions of synchronized flow and wide moving jams in space and time with the use of empirical features of these traffic phases discussed above (see Figs. 2 and 4).

Fontana a Pinocchio

The Fontana a Pinocchio ("Fountain dedicated to Pinocchio") is a fountain located in a traffic island in Corso Indipendenza, a central avenue of Milan, Italy. It is decorated with a complex of bronze statues based on Carlo Collodi's "The Adventures of Pinocchio", designed by Italian sculptor Attilio Fagioli (1877–1966) and realized by the "Fonderia Artistica Battaglia" foundry.
The statues were completed by Fagioli in 1955 and the fountain was inaugurated on May 19, 1956.
The main statue portrays Pinocchio, after his transformation into a child, looking down at the inanimate body of the puppet he used to be. Smaller statues of the Cat and the Fox characters from Collodi's book were part of the complex, but have since been partially vandalized. The pedestal on which child Pinocchio is standing bears an inscription by Milanese poet Antonio Negri (1881–1966) and based on a line in Collodi's book, reading:
In 1989, several prefabricated shopping stalls were placed in the traffic lane where the fountain is located, thus making it less visible than it used to be. Thereafter, the fountain has experienced a long period of decay, as the interior of the traffic lane has been used as a rubbish dump and repeated vandalisms have occurred; most notably, the statue of the Cat was stolen, and the nose of Pinocchio has been broken. In 2004, a parliamentary question was directed to the Ministry of Culture complaining about the state of decay of the fountain; also, a spontaneous local committee has formed to promote the requalification of the area. In 2010, the prefabricated stalls have been removed by the city authorities and the traffic island has been cleaned up. The fountain has been opened againt to the publuc on December 18, 2013.

Svoradov () is a university student campus on Svoradova Street in the Old Town of Bratislava, Slovakia. It was the first modern campus building in Bratislava, first parts being constructed in 1932. Svoradov was an important place for the forming of Slovak Catholic intelligentsia from its inception, until the end of Second World War and its founding fathers included the ultra-conservative Andrej Hlinka and the war criminal Jozef Tiso.
Currently it is operated by the Slovak Technical University; it contains 309 student rooms, 18 guest rooms and a gym. The student rooms contain 1-3 beds (guest rooms 1-2 beds) and they are free to rent for the public from July to August each year.
Svoradov is also the name of a grocery store nearby the campus at Palisády Street No. 2.
History.
After establishing the Comenius University in Bratislava in 1919 the problem of student housing emerged, because the city was essentially lacking a university campus. Priest Eugen Filkorn was tasked to establish a campus, because he already had experience in providing similar services under Austria-Hungary. In 1922, Filkorn made a deal with the Orphanage of Saint Elisabeth (), whose building stood at the site of surrent Svoradov, to house students. The premises soon turned out to be unsuited and wet and the construction of a new campus building was decided. For this reason, the Company of the Collegium of Saint Svorad () was established to collect money from the people. The Company was supervising both the construction and later the operation of the campus. Its prominent members included Andrej Hlinka, Jozef Tiso, Ferdiš Juriga and Tomáš Ružička.
During World War II, the campus housed the Higher leadership school of the Hlinka youth and the Academic Hlinka Guard, paramilitary organisations under the clerofascist regime of the Slovak State.
Priest Eugen Filkorn, who was the founder and later director of campus Svoradov was tried after war and he was sentenced to 2 years in prison in 1947.
Campus regime.

Isaiah Emmanuel Morter

Isaiah Emmanuel Morter (sometimes spelled Isiah) (1860 - 7 April 1924) was born in 1860 in the Freetown district of Belize. He was of Igbo descent (some say his parents were Ashanti royalty) coming from a line of slaves brought to America from Nigeria. Marcus Garvey wrote that "Morter grew up fighting the oppositions and difficulties generally surrounding one born to his condition, until he lifted himself to the highest pinnacle of service to his race and to his country." 
By planting and growing bananas and coconuts, Morter built a fortune and is widely regarded as Belize's first coloured millionaire. His nicknames included "the Coconut King" and "Guinea Sigar" and he owned Caye Chapel and other plantations. For his achievements he was honoured with the award of Knight Commander of Distinguished Service Order of Ethiopia. He was also a strong supporter of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association.
Morter died on 7 April 1924. 
A statue of Morter can be found at the end of Albert Street, near the Anglican cathedral, in Belize City. He is not widely known today by the public in Belize.

Multi-utility

Multi-utility relates to companies offering a wide range of services and/or products. In the business market, this type of service provision usually relates to energy, environmental services, waste issues, infrastructure and/or telecom services. In the consumer market, it often concerns a combined offering of services in the field of energy and digital products and services (telephony, internet and television). Providers like these are also referred to as multi-service providers. So it often concerns services and products in relation to public utilities. Multi-utility has a relation with cross-selling, offering complementary products and services.
Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, multi-utility became very popular amongst power companies in the nineties of the previous century. As a consequence of the liberalization of the energy market, these companies were looking for opportunities to widen their product range. In addition to energy, they started to offer products and services through cable (internet, television) as well; in the business market they also became active in the fields of environment and waste. They considered these markets as logical complements to the traditional energy supply. These markets had a strong association with public utilities, which led to the name multi-utility.
Cogeneration.
In the business markets, partnerships were often created as well with (large) customers, particularly in relation to cogeneration, the combined generation of heat (steam) and electricity (power). In the seventies, cogeneration expanded enormously. Large industries in particular invested in cogeneration, but smaller applications saw benefits as well. You could think of horticulture, swimming pools or hospitals. Cogeneration installations were placed at many companies, sometimes paid by the client, sometimes via a joint venture, but also often paid for by the power company. Management and maintenance of these installations are performed by the power company. Power that is not consumed by the client, is supplied to the electricity grid. The excess steam is also used for other applications.
Outsourcing.
The management of these cogeneration installations also fitted the trend of outsourcing. In case of outsourcing, the activities and/or business units that are not considered the core business, or are considered as complementary activities, are contracted out. This phenomenon particularly occurred at ICT departments of companies, but also administrative tasks, the contact with customers (through a call center) and facility services were often outsourced. They would preferably choose a party for whom these activities concerned were part of their core activities.
Current situation.
By now, most of the Dutch power companies have abandoned this multi-utility strategy. They have chosen to focus on energy: mono-utility. By doing so, they are returning to their roots as it were. An exception to this is DELTA, from the Dutch province of Zeeland. Due to the increase in scale that has taken place in the energy sector, DELTA has explicitly chosen to further deepen their relationship with their customers through a combined service provision.
"This service provision has various manifestation in the business market:"
Outside of the Netherlands.
Outside of the Netherlands, there are various other multi-utility companies. The best known examples are Stadtwerke in Germany and Austria. In order to stand their ground against large power companies (Eon, RWE), these companies have developed themselves to become versatile enterprises. In addition to energy and water, these companies are also involved with the exploitation of traffic light installations, public swimming pools. Shareholders are municipalities. In Norway, Hafslund and Lyse Energi refer to themselves as multi-utility companies.
Another example is GDF Suez, an international industrial and service group. This company was created in 2007 and originated from France. It is active in the field of energy, energy related services and environment. In 2008 it had a turnover of more than 80 billion Euros. In the Netherlands, the company is active in energy (under the name of Electrabel), waste (SITA) and industrial service provision (Cofely, called GTI until 2009).
