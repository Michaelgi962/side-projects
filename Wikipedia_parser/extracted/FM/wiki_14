Before You Say I Do

Before You Say "I Do" (working title "Then Again") is an American television movie directed by Paul Fox. It premiered on Hallmark Channel on February 14, 2009.
Plot.
George Murray has been dating his girlfriend Jane Gardner for a while now, and is ready to propose. But Jane can’t bring herself to marry again after her first husband Doug broke her heart by cheating on her with the wedding coordinator. Desperately in love, George wishes things were different: that he had met Jane before she married Doug, making her not so jaded. After a car incident, George finds himself exactly ten years back in time, just a few days before Doug and Jane’s wedding. He goes to her work, which is at a building for the "Don't Throw Away" newspaper, and Jane "meets" him. George also gets revenge on a guy at work who took (his colleague) Harvey's plans and caused him not to get the promotion he'd been wanting. Jane's friend, Mary Brown, knows all about Doug cheating on Jane, but she can't bring herself to tell Jane. She and George talk about it and plan to get Jane to find out about Doug and the wedding coordinator. Mary wants Jane to go with George, since she despises Doug for cheating on her best friend. At Doug and Jane's wedding, Jane figures out about Doug and dumps him for George. They run off in his car, getting chased the whole time by Doug. They get into a minor crash and George wakes up ten years into the future, from where he is. He and Jane are married and are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a renewal of their vows. Mary got married to George's friend, Harvey.
Reviews.
"Star Magazine" gave the film only two stars, stating:This romantic comedy...has the romance angle covered, but comes up short when it comes to the jokes. That's not to mention all the time-travel questions it casually skips right over in pursuit of a happy ending. Meanwhile, paging the show-biz doctor: What's happened to Lauren Holly's career that she's not playing the girl here but, instead, her wacky, future-telling best friend?

Yury

Yury, Yuri, Youri, Yuriy or Yurij is the East Slavic (, or ) form of the masculine given name George; it is derived directly from the Greek form Georgios and related to Polish Jerzy and Czech/Slovak Jiří. 
The Slavic form of the name originates with Yuriy Dolgorukiy, Grand Prince of Kiev and founder of Moscow (c. 1099 – 1157), in early accounts recorded as "Gyurgi, Dyurgi".
Its popularity reflects the veneration of Saint George in the Kievan Rus'. Yaroslav the Wise, great-grandfather of Yuriy Dolgorukiy, was the first Russian ruler whose patron saint was Saint George. The saint is now depicted on the coat of arms of Moscow.

Rock the World Youth Mission Alliance

Rock the World Youth Mission Alliance is a Christian ministry that trains young people as leaders. Their core training programs create an ongoing network of relationships where the grads and trainees collaborate to offer events and conferences, generate new ministries, and support one another in life and ministry. 
Among other programs, Rock the World currently runs the Josiah Project, a summer collegiate leadership initiative; re:mix, an annual conference for young people ages 14–30; Ambridge Youth Ignite, a local ministry with kids in Rock the World’s home town of Ambridge, PA; and "Next Step" retreats for kids in middle school through high school. Rock the World's activities exist predominantly inside the USA but extend globally. 
Mission of Rock the World
The stated mission of Rock the World is to “multiply young Christian leaders.” The longer version of their mission states “Rock the World’s mission is to mobilize young people to follow Jesus, grow together in knowledge and love of God, serve in the power of the Spirit, and impact the world for the Kingdom of God.” Both versions emphasize the capacity of Jesus' young disciples to make more disciples. The long-term goal of RTWYMA is to ignite a spiritual awakening among young people on every continent.
Rock the World is not legally a part of any denomination. At its founding, Rock the World was informally associated with the Episcopal Church. By the end of the 1990s this association had broadened to include a wide range of denominations. Although Rock the World is officially independent of any denomination, Anglican influence still finds expression through the involvement of so many Anglicans in the ministry.
Founder.
The Rev. Whis Hays founded Rock the World in 1989. After 14 years in ministry with college, high school, and middle school young people, he saw the need for a new ministry that gave leverage to the energy, dedication, and fresh insight of young Christian leaders. His published works include numerous articles and films, the best known of which are his 1995 article “Arresting the New Sexual McCarthyism” and his 1980 film, “Jesus, Head of the Church.” He is also known for 16 years of teaching youth ministry courses as Associate Professor of Youth Ministry at Trinity School for Ministry, teaching there while serving in his position as Rock the World’s Executive Director. 
Name.
The organization derives its name from the Bible's book of Acts, chapter 17 verse 6. The story makes it clear that Paul and his friends were not trying to make trouble, but only trying to speak about Jesus and act according to the Kingdom of God. Obviously, sometimes this shook up things around them! When young followers of Jesus do the same thing today, it's not unusual for them to get the same result.
Primary Ministries.
Rock the World has offered 3 core training programs:
1. In 1990 Rock the World launched the Josiah Project, a two-summer leadership program for college students. The main focus of this program is preparing students for a lifetime of leadership by giving them classroom training, hands-on experience, and the opportunity to launch new ministries. Josiah graduates are proving to be effective leaders: more than 90% of Josiah graduates continue to be involved in Christian ministry leadership today.
2. Epicenter is a one-year internship program, launched in 2004. This one-year internship focused on student ministry leadership training, also including elements of cross-cultural ministry and planting of micro-church movements.
3. Beginning in 1991, Rock the World's Student Ministry Professionals Program offered the first Master's Degree in youth ministry anywhere in the worldwide Anglican Communion in partnership with Trinity School for Ministry. Graduates prepared for a career in youth ministry through the local church. This program is currently in a state of transition.
Incubated Ministries.
Rock the World has become the platform for a number of new ministries launched by their graduates and trainees, some of which become a permanent part of Rock the World. One of these is Ambridge Youth Ignite (AYI), a holistic outreach to children and middle school youth in Rock the World's hometown of Ambridge, PA. AYI was created in 2004 by Josiah Project students Eric and Shea Rankin Geisbert who met while participating in Rock the World's Josiah Project. 
re:mix is an annual "Kingdom Outbreak" conference launched in 2003 for young adults and high school youth. The re:mix founder who is also a Josiah Project graduate, says “re:mix helps young people go further in with God and further out to spread Jesus' message of the Kingdom of God both locally and globally.”
Other programs that started within Rock the World have spun off to become their own ministries, such as inneracts. Incubation of new ministries is continuing as trainees and graduates are inspired to pursue fresh initiatives.
Other ministries.
Rock the World also offers various retreats and weekend leadership training seminars, such as Striking Fire, a weekend training event, and Next Step, a retreat for middle school and high school kids themed on following Jesus. Rock the World also engages in various global initiatives, having consistent partnerships with All Nations Family and Anglican Global Mission Partners.
Network.
Rock the World’s trainees and graduates are spread out across most of the United States and several foreign countries, serving in churches, schools, and other contexts. Aside from founder Whis Hays, Rock the World’s longest-serving employees have been (in order of longevity) Meredith B., Steven Tighe, Carol Jaros, and Cynthia Seeliger Seifert. Some graduates especially well known in student ministry circles include Holly Rankin Zaher, Aran Walter, Joel Tassie, Dixon Kinser and Jack Gabig. Thousands of young people are touched by the ministries of their graduates, and hundreds decide to follow Jesus every year.

David Bachrach

David Bachrach (1845–1921) was an American commercial photographer based in Baltimore, Maryland. He made contributions to the technical, artistic, and professional advancements in the field as well as being the founder of a photographic dynasty that became a unique institution in the United States. He became the spokesman for photographers at the turn of the 20th century who were confronted with a welter of technical and artistic choices. He regularly published in the leading photographic journals of the time and experimented with self-toning papers. He developed the first practical process for photographic printing on canvas, and a forerunner of the present-day photoengraving system. Bachrach, Inc., which was founded in 1910 and is still headed by the Bachrach family, had studios in all the major east coast cities. The Bachrachs, beginning with David, established the idea of "official portraiture," becoming the leading portrait photographers in the United States well into the 1960s.
One of his earliest photographs is of the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 1863, when he was 18 years old.
He was an uncle of Gertrude Stein.
His home in Baltimore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Roberto Reyes Barreiro

Roberto Reyes Barreiro (Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico 1877—Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico 1928) was an activist, surgeon, and political leader in the Mexican states of Yucatán and Veracruz. Reyes Barreiro was the founder of the local Red Cross chapter in Veracruz, as well as a 33rd Degree Mason. He was a published author and poet, and wrote articles, essays, short stories, and editorials for the Veracruz newspaper, "El Dictamen".
Early life.
Born into a family of doctors, attorneys, and intellectuals, Roberto Reyes Barreiro was the sixth of 12 children. He graduated with honors from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán in Mérida, where he excelled academically as well as in campus politics. It was there that he discovered his oratorical ability and his admiration for Left-leaning politicos, especially Marx and Engels; Reyes Barreiro leaned to the political Left for the entirety of his adult life.
Publications.
Farsa política en Yucatán. La lucha entre el gobierno y el pueblo, Campeche, Imprenta 
“El Criterio Público”, 1909, prefacio.
“El pueblo de hoy no es el de hace treinta años: conoce sus obligaciones y sus derechos.” Roberto Reyes Barreiro, 1909.(Political Farce In Yucatán. The Struggle Between The Government and the People, Compeche, Printed in "The Public Criterion", 1909, preface.) ("The citizenry of today is not what it was 30 years ago: it knows its obligations and its rights"—English Translation)
Medicine and activism.
He practiced medicine in Yucatán following his graduation for a short period before his socialist views got him into trouble with the government, and he was expelled from the state. Moving first to Mexico City with relatives, then later to the port city of Veracruz, he met and married a young nurse, Edilberta Baquedano, and started a practice to treat the city's poorest residents. True to his heart, Reyes Barreiro preached the gospel of Left politics to his patients and to anyone who would listen. He spent many long hours making his rounds on horseback and, when possible, by carriage, often toting his doctor bag and several books on politics, poetry, science and medicine. During the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), Reyes Barreiro was often one of the few people allowed on the streets after dark during the curfew, to tend to his patients, revolutionaries, friends and foes alike.
Doctor to an icon.
On May 1, 1914, during the invasion of Veracruz by the American Frank Friday Fletcher, Reyes Barreiro was among the surgeons attending to the noted Mexican hero José Azueta. When Fletcher's U.S. Marine forces shot and injured Azueta, it was doctors Reyes Barreiro and Rafael Cuervo Xicoy who tended Azueta's wounds. When Fletcher heard of Azueta's bravery in battle, he sent an envoy to ask for Azueta's permission to call and pay his respects. Azueta, receiving Fletcher's request, relayed his answer through Reyes Barreiro (the surgeon on duty when the envoy called): "I am armed only with my service pistol, but if the American sets one foot in my house I will take either his life or mine." Fletcher, upon hearing this response from Azueta, then offered to send his personal physician to care for Azueta and his wounds. Azueta's answer was "Please tell the admiral that I am in the best care that medicine has to offer, either in Mexico or the United States." Azueta died on May 10, 1914 from his wounds, a week after his 20th birthday.
Veracruz Red Cross.
In 1918, Reyes Barreiro and several other doctors gathered to discuss the founding of a Red Cross chapter in Veracruz. On January 2, 1919, a formal sub-chapter of the Red Cross in Veracruz was granted by the main Red Cross chapter in Orizaba, Mexico. For the first time in the almost 400 years since its founding, the people of Veracruz had a formal place to turn in the time of emergencies, revolution and chaos.
Tenant advocacy.
Reyes Barreiro was later noted as the leader of the "Movimiento Inquilinario"—the "Tenant's Union" of Veracruz. In 1927, the rents in Veracruz were climbing higher and higher, with the majority of an average citizen's wage going toward rent. Tenants grew increasingly agitated by the situation and decided to go on ‘‘strike’’ by ceasing rent payments, electing Reyes Barreiro as their leader. Reyes Barreiro was opposed by another local activist, communist Heron Proal, who would later lead the group of tenants in their struggle against the injustices of the landlords. Reyes Barreiro is noted as the source of the quote "The citizenry of today is not as it was 30 years ago—it knows its rights and responsibilities." The Tenants' Strike in Veracruz served as a model for later strikers in Mexico, the United States and around the world. From that point forward tenants, dockworkers, revolutionaries and even prostitutes used the example set by the Veracruz Renters to model their own strikes against perceived oppressors.
Personal life.
Reyes Barreiro was a founding member of one of Veracruz' Freemason temples and, throughout his life in that city, wrote extensively for the newspaper "El Dictamen". He favored poetry—most notably love poems—but also distinguished himself as a keen observer of life while making his rounds in revolutionary Veracruz.
Death.
Reyes Barreiro died in 1928 at the age of 51 in Veracruz, leaving behind a wife and ten adult children. Police ruled Reyes Barreiro's death a suicide, however he was found with two lethal gunshot wounds to the head from two different angles. Due to the suspicious circumstances of his death, it is speculated that he was assassinated by the (then) federal government in Mexico.

Archibald K. Gardner

Archibald K. Gardner (December 3, 1867 - January 21, 1962) was a United States federal judge.
Gardner was born in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. In 1892, he received an A.B. from the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. The following year, he procured an LL.B. from that same institution. From 1893 to 1895, he was engaged in the private practice of law in Greenfield in Dade County in southwestern Missouri.From 1895 to 1897, he practiced in Rapid City, South Dakota, where he was the city attorney from 1897 until 1904. He was thereafter from 1907 to 1929 the general attorney for the South Dakota division of the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company.
On April 18, 1929, U.S. President Herbert Hoover nominated Gardner to a new seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, created by 45 Stat. 1346.
Gardner was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 23, 1929, and received his commission on May 23, 1929. He served as chief judge of the Eighth Circuit from 1948 to 1959. In 1957, Gardner assigned Ronald N. Davies of North Dakota to preside over the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas in Little Rock, Arkansas. It was Davies whose orders led to the Little Rock Integration Crisis in which then Governor Orval Faubus made a vain attempt to stop the desegregation of Central High School in the Arkansas capital city. 
Gardner assumed senior status on September 30, 1960, and thereafter served until his death in Huron in Beadle County in eastern South Dakota.

Alphonse Lami

Alphonse Lami (22 June 1822, Paris-17 July 1867, Alexandria) was a French sculptor of Italian descent.
Life.
He was the son of François Lami (illegitimate son of prince Francesco Borghese) and Louise Hélène Heim (granddaughter of Jean-Baptiste Nicolet. He joined the Ecole des Beaux-Arts on 7 October 1846, studying under Abel de Pujol and Francisque Duret. He first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1850 with a marble statue entitled "Liseuse". He then went to Egypt where from 1852 to 1853 he took part in the excavation of the Serapeum at Saqqarah, which were headed by his friend Auguste Mariette. Returning to Paris, he married Alexandrine-Marie Bidauld (granddaughter of the rural painter and member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts Jean-Joseph-Xavier Bidauld) in 1853 - their son Stanislas Lami was a noted sculptor and art writer - and devoted himself to studying artistic anatomy and produced a flayed or "écorche" figure in the pose of a 'becheur', which he exhibited at the Salon in 1857. This work was also presented at the Académie des Sciences and was the report of an eology written in the name of MM. Claude Bernard, Pierre Rayer, Horace Vernet and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau. Later, in 1861, Lami published an album of engravings after this écorché under the title ""Myologie superficielle du corps humain"". Lami was made a knight of the Légion d'honneur on 12 August 1859.
In 1865, Alphonse Lami took part in the scientific commission sent to Mexico by the ministry of public instruction. Suffering from a liver disease he had caught from his stay in the tropics, he unwisely undertook a new trip to Egypt on his return to France from Mexico. He arrived in Alexandria when his condition suddenly worsened and he died there in July 1867.

Sikhism in Singapore

Sikhism in Singapore has its roots in the military and policing forces of the British Empire. Currently, there are 12,000-15,000 Sikhs in Singapore
Introduction.
Early Sikh pioneers.
The first Sikh to migrate to Singapore was Maharaj Singh in 1849; he was sent there as a political prisoner by the British Empire after the Second Anglo-Sikh War. The Central Sikh Temple[http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/what_to_see/places_of_worship/central_sikh_temple.html] was built to commemorate the 518th anniversary of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru. The temple boasts a skilful blend of modern and traditional architecture. The Guru Granth Sahib, or holy book, is enshrined in a magnificent prayer hall which has a 13-metre wide dome.
History.
Some Sikhs in Singapore are immigrants from India (mainly from the Punjab region in India). 
Others are the descendants of Sikh prisoners from British India who were sent to Singapore by the British Army for protesting, attacking or killing British Soldiers, attacks; assaults; and vandalism of British buildings and property. They lived in British prisons in Singapore.
A substantial amount of Sikhs in Singapore are also descendants of Indian Sikh Businessmen who immigrated to Singapore

Nate Hatred

Nate Hatred is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his current tenure in the Philadelphia-based hardcore wrestling promotion Combat Zone Wrestling where he is a member of the H8 Club. Since competing in CZW, he has been a three time World Tag Team Champion with fellow H8 Club member Nick Gage and a one time Iron Man Champion.
Professional wrestling career.
In addition to CZW, Hatred has also wrestled in Japan as one of the "CZW warriors" to compete for Big Japan Pro Wrestling, a well-known hardcore wrestling promotion based in Yokohama, Japan, with his fellow wrestlers such as Justice Pain Wifebeater, Mad Man Pondo, and John Zandig.
For being part of the H8 Club tag team. Before teaming with Nick Gage as the H8 Club, Hatred won the CZW World Tag Team Championship with Nick Gage. He would later team up with Gage and wrestle such teams as the Briscoe Brothers, VD, and The Backseat Boyz. Together, they won the tag team championship from the original H8 Club of Wifebeater and Justice Pain. Gage and Hatred would break up in 2003 when Hatred joined Messiah's stable, the Hi-V. They feuded for nearly one year, and met in the Cage of Death match at "Cage of Death V". Nick Gage was on Zandig's team to face the Hi-V. At the end of the match, Hatred turned on Messiah and rejoined Gage. After reforming, they regained the tag championship, but lost it to The Blackout. At "Cage of Death VI", The H8 Club of Nick Gage and Nate Hatred faced the H8 Club of Wifebeater and Justice Pain, with the winners winning the right to the H8 Club name. That night, Nick Gage and Justice Pain turned on their partners joined each other.
After Cage of Death 6, Hatred would not return to the company till later in the year. Nate would then have a few sporadic appearances from late 2005 to 2008. He would return in late 2008 and rejoin with his former tag team partner, Nick Gage, to form, The H8 Club. Together, they would face the likes of BLKOUT, at Cage of Death X, as well as Cult Fiction, led by Billy Gram, from January 2009, to June, when Gage would defeat Deranged in a No Ropes Barbed Wire "Fire" Match at the annual Tournament of Death 8.

<doc id="21386220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21386220" title="Horses in the Napoleonic Wars">
Horses in the Napoleonic Wars

Horses were widely used during the Napoleonic Wars for combat, patrol and reconnaissance, and for logistical support. Vast numbers were used throughout the wars. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, depletion of the French cavalry arm through attrition (mainly suffered during the Russian Campaign) and loss of horse-producing allies to provide remounts contributed significantly to the gradual French defeat and downfall of the French Empire. During the Waterloo Campaign, the "Armee du Nord" had 47,000 horses: 25,000 cavalry, 12,000 for artillery, 10,000 for infantry and supply columns.
Cavalry.
The traditional distinction between heavy and light cavalry reduced during the modern period and by the end of the Peninsular War, heavy cavalry were performing the scouting and outpost duties previously undertaken by light cavalry.
On the battlefield, the cavalry's main offensive role was as shock troops, providing a mounted charge. Charges were carefully managed for speed, with a charge's maximum speed being . Faster progress resulted in a break in formation and blown horses. Charges were undertaken across clear, rising ground, with the cavalry deploying in line or column, and often accompanied by horse artillery. Frequently, infantry followed behind, in order to secure any ground won. Once an enemy army had quit the field of battle and was on the retreat, cavalry would invariably be utilized in pursuit to further exploit a beaten foe's withdrawal and harass that army's rearguard. In defence, cavalry could be used to attack and harass the enemy's infantry flanks as they advanced. In addition, cavalry were used to break up enemy lines following successful infantry action.
Cavalry were extremely effective against infantry on the march, or when formed in line or column. A battalion formed in line was particularly vulnerable to cavalry, and could be broken or destroyed by a well-formed cavalry charge, such as when Lt-Col Colborne's brigade was destroyed during the Battle of Albuera in 1811, with the loss of 1,250 out of his 1,650 men. 
For protection, infantry sought their own cavalry screens and support. Otherwise, the infantry's only defence was to form square: a tight four-sided formation, presenting walls of muskets and bayonets, each side protecting the others' flanks. These were generally impenetrable to cavalry, but vulnerable to artillery or other infantry. Cavalry were frequently used prior to an infantry assault, so that their charges might force an infantry line to break and reform, into formations vulnerable to infantry or artillery. During these manoeuvres, they remained especially vulnerable to cavalry.
Artillery.
Another major use of horses throughout the period was as draught animals for the heavy artillery.
In addition to field artillery, where horse-drawn guns were attended by gunners on foot, the armies generally had horse batteries, where each of the gunners were provided with mounts. Horse artillery generally used lighter pieces, although the British had some 9-pounder (medium-weight) horse batteries; for added speed, these had a team of 8 horses to pull them, rather than 6. In addition, horse artillery ammunition wagons were harnessed with an extra pair (6 horse instead of 4). Heavy artillery pieces needed a team of 12 horses, while Congreve rockets required about 25 horses. With the horses required for officers, surgeons and other support staff, as well as those pulling guns and wagons, each British artillery battery (6 guns) required 160–200 horses.
Horse artillery was generally used to support the cavalry units, and so came under the command of cavalry divisions, but in some battles, such as at Waterloo, the horse artillery were used by the British as a rapid response force, successfully repulsing attacks from the French, and assisting the infantry recapture of La Haye Sainte from the French.
Horse types and breeds.
The war horse was traditionally of moderate size for both officers and troopers, since heavy horses were logistically difficult to maintain, and less adaptable to varied terrains. Most armies at the time preferred cavalry horses to be 15.2 hh and 450–500 kg, although cuirassiers frequently had heavier horses. Napoleon's Imperial Guard dragoons' mounts had an average size of 15hh. Lighter horses were restricted to scouting and raiding. Cavalry horses were generally obtained at 5 years, from 10 or 12 years service (barring loss) could be expected. Mares and geldings were used in preference to the less-easily managed stallions. Losses of 30–40% were common during a campaign, due to conditions of the march as well as enemy action.
As regimental structures developed, many units selected horses of uniform type, some, such as the Royal Scots Greys even specifying colour. Trumpeters, too, often rode distinctive horses, so they might stand out. Regional armies developed preferences, such as the British 15 hh hunters, the Germans' hanoverians, and the Cossacks' steppe ponies, but the low supplies available in wartime resulted in horses of all types being used.

Citizenship.
Ejup Ganić was a citizen of former Yugoslavia by birth. Ganić has been living in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1981, and as such is also a citizen of Bosnia since that time.
Arrest and Release.
On 1 March 2010 Ganić was arrested on Heathrow Airport in London after Serbian judicial authorities issued an extradition warrant. He was accused for conspiracy to murder 40 Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) soldiers in the Dobrovoljačka Street attack in May 1992. He was released on 12 March after Sanela Diana Jenkins had paid his bail. Judge John Laws remarked that the arrest warrant by Serbia was politically motivated and therefore granted Ganić bail. It was also claimed by Ganić's defenders that Serbia had yet to produce any real evidence, and that most of their supposed evidence was made up of news articles regarding the Dobrovoljačka incident. However, Serbian prosecutor's office claims that case contains additional evidence. On 27 July 2010, the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court blocked his extradition and released him, the judge saying that he was led to believe the extradition proceedings were "brought and being used for political purposes, and as such amount to an abuse of the process of this court".

Congressional Digest

The Congressional Digest, published by Congressional Digest Corporation, is an independent monthly publication with offices in Washington, DC. Congressional Digest was founded in 1921 by suffragette Alice Gram Robinson with the goal of presenting, in her words, “an impartial view of controversial issues.”
A major source of inspiration for the publication’s format was the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, granting women the right to vote. Robinson believed that the best way to prevent newly franchised voters from being unduly swayed or intimidated by the actions or rhetoric of Congress was to provide them with side-by-side arguments on pending legislation.
Congressional Digest has continued for three generations and is now led by Robinson’s granddaughter, Page Robinson Thomas. The publication has stayed true to its original concept, presenting excerpted verbatim statements from current congressional debates in a pro-and-con format, along with digested government material to put the controversy in historical and legislative context. 
Congressional Digest Corporation publishes two additional publications: Supreme Court Debates, started in 1997, and International Debates, started in 2003. All three are available online; Congressional Digest is also available in print.
The publications’ subscribers include high school and university libraries, debate organizations, and other groups and individuals interested in current events.

Plot.
Tracy Strauss is captured by armed men, while a TV interview with the new chairman of Senate Homeland Security Committee, Nathan Petrelli, plays in the background. The leader of the group (referred to as The Hunter and played by Zeljko Ivanek) calls to tell Nathan they have the first one. 
Hiro tries to make Ando into a superhero. Ando is unimpressed as he feels his power is worthless, and leaves when Hiro injects him with a GPS implant. Later, when Hiro tracks Ando and calls him to apologize, Ando overhears Hiro being kidnapped. 
Having earned her GED, Claire Bennet is looking into an elite college education with Angela Petrelli, but is more concerned with Sylar and the fact they never found his body. As Claire is leaving, she listens in on a phone call where Nathan tells Angela to keep Claire away from Matt Parkman and Peter. Angela spots Claire, who promptly leaves. 
Peter is working as a paramedic and attending to a car accident victim. His partner Hesam has to pull Peter away from the casualty, with Peter insisting he could have saved him, had he been stronger. As the dead man is taken away, Hesam mentions that Peter's brother is in town for the day. Peter receives a call from Claire warning him about Nathan’s plans. Peter goes to talk to Angela while Claire goes to warn Matt. Peter catches a yellow cab, which happens to be driven by Mohinder Suresh. In a scene similar to the first episode, Peter asks Mohinder if he ever had the feeling like he was meant to do something extraordinary. Mohinder points out that everyone is keeping a low profile, except for Nathan. They get to their destination and Mohinder lets him out. 
Once Peter is gone, The Hunter gets in the cab behind him, and forces Mohinder to drive to a parking garage. As Mohinder gets out of the cab, he rips off the car door, knocks out The Hunter, and uses the door as a shield. He runs away and Noah arrives in a SUV and rescues him. As they escape, Noah asks him with whom has he been in contact. They get to the exit only to discover that The Hunter and his men have cut them off. Noah apologizes and then tasers Mohinder, who staggers out of the car and collapses. 
Peter arrives at Angela’s home and finds Nathan waiting for him. Nathan informs his brother that their mother is not there. He explains that he has a plan of his own and would like Peter's input. Peter expresses his disinterest and leaves. When Peter arrives at his own apartment, he finds Nathan waiting for him. Nathan apologizes for disowning him and emphasizes the importance of what he is doing, again asking Peter to join him. When Peter refuses, Noah tasers him from behind. 
Sylar, alive and well, goes to see Martin Gray, the watchmaker he believed to be his father. He questions Martin and discovers that Martin purchased Sylar from his brother, who was in need of money. He gives Sylar the address, then tells him to leave, which Sylar does. When Sylar arrives at Samson Gray's home, he finds the door is open and enters. A group of armed men appear and attempt to immobilize him with tranquilizer darts. Sylar overpowers them and starts to torture one for information.
Daphne superspeeds back into her apartment where Matt is eating. They discuss using their powers to make life easier and Matt persuades her to lead a normal life while Usutu, visible only to Matt, stands nearby. Later, Usutu appears to Matt with a message, explaining he is an illusion. Usutu says that Matt is on a journey to become a prophet and the world needs him to tell the future. Matt’s eyes turn white and he starts to sketch. 
While inspecting the finished work, Claire arrives to warn him that people will be coming to get him. The drawings show Matt being shot in the neck while looking at some drawings. Suddenly, someone shoots a dart through the window into his neck. The men in black arrive and capture Claire as Matt goes down. 
At an airplane hangar, Nathan reviews his prisoners, all hooded and confined to negate their powers. The Hunter arrives and reports that Sylar escaped. He also shows Nathan that one of the prisoners is Claire. Nathan takes her and puts her in a car to be driven home, telling her to forget what she has seen. While the rest of the prisoners are led onto a cargo plane, Claire escapes from the car and sneaks aboard. Once airborne, Claire finds that the prisoners include Hiro, Peter, and Mohinder, and she removes the drug feeds from the latter two. Peter manages to touch Mohinder and take his power, using it to break his shackles. As Peter attacks the guards, Claire grabs a taser and goes to the cockpit, stunning one guard and threatening the pilot. She discovers that Noah is in the copilot’s seat. 
Peter tries to free Tracy as another guard attacks him. He gains Tracy’s power and inadvertently touches the side of the plane. It freezes and shatters, and the guards and at least one prisoner are swept out. As the plane starts to go down, the netting onto which Peter is holding comes unfastened and he starts to get swept away before Mohinder grabs hold of him. In the cockpit, the pilot loses control and the plane plummets towards the ground. The final shot shows Mohinder losing his grip on Peter's hand, a direct reference to the cliffhanger of the pilot episode, "Genesis".
Critical reception.
Josh Modell of "The A.V. Club" rated this episode a B-.
Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7.8 out of 10.

Heroes Wiki

Heroes Wiki is a wiki-powered reference site for NBC's science fiction drama "Heroes". Launched on October 10, 2006, the site uses MediaWiki software to maintain a user-created database of information. Heroes Wiki is supported by revenue from advertising, part of which is donated to various charities. As of June 28, 2010, the site contained over 5,500 articles created and edited by approximately 9,400 registered users, with over 157 million page views.
On October 18, 2008, Heroes Wiki announced that it had officially partnered with NBC. NBC now directs those interested in a wiki on "Heroes" to Heroes Wiki, and directly funds the site in exchange for on-site advertisements.
Overview.
Heroes Wiki was launched on October 10, 2006, several weeks after "Heroes" premiered in North America. Content includes articles on episodes, characters, cast and crew, cultural references, along with interviews with members of the "Heroes" cast and crew. Episode spoilers and user-contributed theories are permitted on certain areas within the wiki. The site's main page features upcoming "Heroes" events and news, and links to articles summarizing the latest "Heroes" episode and online content. There are also links to "Heroes"-related websites, including official websites affiliated with the show and its producers, websites used in Heroes Evolutions, and unofficial fan sites. On September 18, 2008, the site became WAP-enabled for cell phones and other mobile devices.
The site has also established nine projects containing translations of the main English language version of the wiki: Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
When Heroes Wiki began its partnership with NBC in October 2008, links were added pointing to Heroes Wiki on NBC's "Heroes" and "Heroes Evolutions" sites. NBC also discontinued promoting its own wiki for "Heroes", instead redirecting readers to Heroes Wiki through links at the top of related pages. In December 2008, the wiki was also referenced in several segments of NBC's "Heroes" Insider Interactive SMS, which uses text messaging to send facts, pose trivia questions, and conduct polling during the airing of episodes of the show.
Role in "Heroes Evolutions".
As part of the alternate reality game in "Heroes Evolutions", a mysterious "Heroes" character known only as answered a number of fan-submitted questions posed by e-mail by Heroes Wiki administrator . The interview was posted at Heroes Wiki on July 24, 2008.
Reaction.
Beyond its partnership with NBC, Heroes Wiki has been recognized by other media outlets, including "New York Magazine", the "New York Times", and E! Online. "Washington Times" writer Joseph Szadkowski notes that the site is "obviously created by some very hard-core fans." He describes Heroes Wiki as a "dense online encyclopedia offers more than 1,600 entries on the show's mythology."
Content about "Heroes" cast and crew members has also been referenced elsewhere, including interviews with actor (Comic Book Resources), senior producer (BuddyTV), and the behind the "Root and Branch" graphic novels (Comic Book Resources).

Joseph III (Chaldean Patriarch)

Mar Joseph III Timothy Maroge (or "Youssef III Timotheos Maraugin" or "Maroghin") was the third incumbent of the "Josephite" line of Church of the East, a patriarchate in Full Communion with the pope mainly active in the areas of Amid and Mardin, thus being the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1713 to 1757.
Life.
Timothy Maroge was born in Baghdad and educated by the Capuchin missionaries in Amid. He was consecrated bishop of Mardin by Joseph II Sliba Maruf in 1705.
He became patriarch after his predecessor death, being the only Chaldean bishop who survived the 1708-1713 plague. 
He was confirmed by the Holy See on March 18, 1714 and took the name of Joseph III.
During his patriarchate the there was a growth of the number of faithfuls of the patriarchate, mainly in the area of the Alqosh's patriarchate. Joseph III was a skilful preacher, and it is remembered that more than three thousands people of Mosul entered in his patriarchate in 1723. This success caused a strong reaction of the traditionalist Patriarch of Alqosh, Eliya XII (XI) Denkha, who succeeded to have Joseph III imprisoned many times by the Turkish authorities. Shortly after some problems arose in also Amid, where the traditionalists occupied Joseph's cathedral and the Capuchins left the town in 1726. 
The patriarchate struggled with financial difficulties due to the tax burden imposed by the Turkish authorities and to the ransoms required to free Joseph from the prison. Furthermore according to the Ottoman law the Chaldean community was administratively subject to traditionalist Patriarchate of Alqosh, resulting so to be in a weak position and exposed to vexations.
In 1734 Joseph left for Europe to try to raise funds to pay his debts, and during the next seven years visited the Catholic courts of Poland, Austria and Rome asking for financial support. He was given some money, but far less than he had hoped for. While he was abroad, the Chaldeans in Istanbul obtained from the Ottoman authorities recognition of his authority over Amid and Mardin, but Mosul and Aleppo were assigned to the traditionalist patriarchate of Alqosh, thus creating many difficulties for the growing numbers of Chaldeans who lived there.
In 1754 Joseph appointed as successor Mar Antun Galla, but the Holy See objected and did not allow him to resign: thus he remained the incumbent till his death on 23 January 1757.

Everyday Life in a Syrian Village () is a Syrian documentary film by the director Omar Amiralay. 
The documentary presents an unabashed critique of the impact of the Syrian government's agricultural and land reforms, and the state's conceit of redressing social and economic inequities. Interviews with farmers, health workers and a police officer contrast the peasants’ regard for the state with the mindset of state representatives toward those peasants.

Pedra da Mina is the fifth highest mountain in Brazil and the second in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain ranges located in the border of the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo.
With 2798.39 m elevation (revised measurement satellite / GPS by IBGE in 2004), is the highest point of Serra da Mantiqueira and the state of São Paulo, and the third highest mountain in the state of Minas Gerais.
Near the mountain, there is the Ruah valley, the highest valley in Brazil and the Rio Claro spring, located at 2,500 metres above sea level, the highest river spring in Brazil.
First ascension.
The summit of Pedra da Mina was first reached by a group of eight people, in July 1955. Until 1990, the place remained a quite untouched spot, due to the difficulty of reaching the summit. During this first expedition, the height measured by a barometer was 2,718 metres. Until the new measurement in 2000, Pico das Agulhas Negras was still considered the highest point of Serra da Mantiqueira.

Stephanie Pratt

Stephanie Lynn Pratt (born April 11, 1986) is an American television personality. In 2007, she came to prominence after being cast as a supporting position in the reality television series "The Hills", which documented the personal and professional lives of Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. In 2010, the series underwent several casting adjustments and saw Pratt become a primary cast member, joining Patridge, Lo Bosworth, and Kristin Cavallari.
Life and career.
Career.
Stephanie Lynn Pratt was born in Los Angeles, California, on April 11, 1986. She is the younger sibling of her brother Spencer, also a television personality.
In 2006, MTV developed the reality television series "The Hills" as the spin-off of "". It originally chronicled the lives of Lauren Conrad, who appeared on its predecessor, her housemate Heidi Montag, and friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port. In 2007, Pratt's brother Spencer began dating and later moved into an apartment with Montag, which led to the deterioration of her friendship with Conrad.
During the third season, Conrad ended her friendship with Montag after she suspected that the male Pratt was responsible for rumors of a sex tape involving her and her former boyfriend Jason Wahler; the ensuing feud between the three carried through each subsequent season. During production of the third season, the female Pratt first appeared on the series while angrily confronting Conrad at a club. However, upon the realization that they attend the same college, they became friends. Their relationship put a burden on Pratt's relationship with her brother and Montag, who reacted by beginning to alienate her.
The fourth season saw Pratt's role increased, with more emphasis placed on her personal life and her past drug abuse. During the fifth season, Stephanie worked with Lauren at Kelly Cutrone's People's Revolution, though Lauren ended Pratt's internship, per Cutrone's orders, due to poor performance. Conrad left the series after the first half of the season.
The second half of the season continued with Kristin Cavallari hired as the replacement narrator. Pratt and Cavallari began as rivals due to conflicts about Audrina Patridge's ex-boyfriend and a report linking Cavallari to drug use, though they would become friends during the following season. Pratt also became friends with Audrina and Lo Bosworth during the season.
Despite rumors of not returning after the fifth, Pratt returned and was featured as a main cast member in the sixth and final season. Stephanie talks of her DUI arrest, and her sibling rivalry with Spencer became more intense as his behavior became more erratic. Stephanie and the rest of the cast either did not mention Spencer or Heidi after the two were permanently axed from the series, or kept their comments focused on how no one knew what the couple were up to, and had avoided any recent contact with them. "The Hills" ended its series run on July 13, 2010.
In 2013, Pratt made several appearances on television in the United Kingdom. This included being a guest on the spin-off of Celebrity Big Brother as well as making a special appearance from episodes two onwards on season 6 of E4's Made in Chelsea, a British equivalent of "The Hills".
Personal life.
Pratt is the younger sister of Spencer Pratt, and the sister-in-law of Heidi Montag (both of whom are on "The Hills".) She has struggled with bulimia in the past due to the pressure to be thin stemming from appearing alongside very thin co-stars on the show.
In April, 2010, Pratt posed nude for PETA's "Be Nice to Bunnies" iPhone application, which is intended to help the public find stores and products that are kind to animals.
Stephanie Pratt has stated in many public appearances that she has not seen her brother or his wife Heidi Montag in more than a year.
Stephanie Pratt remains close friends with her former Hills co-stars, Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth.
In July 2013 there were pictures of Stephanie and Spencer Matthews (Made in Chelsea cast member) that stated they were together.
Legal troubles.
In a 2007 US Magazine interview, Pratt revealed previous substance abuse problems and discussed an incident in which she shoplifted $1,300 worth of merchandise from a Neiman Marcus in Honolulu in 2006, while working as a production assistant on ABC’s "LOST".
On October 18, 2009, Pratt was arrested in Hollywood, California, on suspicion of drunk driving, and booked into jail in Van Nuys. She took two breathalyzer tests, first blowing 0.08, then blowing 0.09. The legal limit in California is 0.08. She was released several hours later after posting a $5,000 bail.
On August 4, 2012 Pratt's boyfriend, Line Snob app co-founder Julien Chabbott was arrested in New York City for driving over a police officer's foot, following Chabbot's attempts at avoiding a parking ticket. The incident was caught on camera and later uploaded to YouTube. In the video, Pratt is seen intervening and then driving Chabbott's Ferrari 458 away from the scene after the arrest.

A Flood in Baath Country

A Flood in Baath Country () is a Syrian documentary film by the director Omar Amiralay.
The documentary explores the implications of Baath Party policies in Syria. Without commentary or criticism, Amiralay's film exposes Baath party propaganda and its debilitating effects on the people of al-Mashi village, northeast of Damascus. The film moves slowly from students to teachers to government officials, with everyone reciting exactly the same praise for the president and slogans glorifying the Baath party. The film is a harsh indictment of the regime, portraying the devastating effects of 35 years of rigid Baath party rule on Syrian society.

Donal Sullivan

Donal Sullivan (1838 – 3 March 1907), was an Irish nationalist politician and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1885-1907. He was the younger brother of Alexander Martin Sullivan and of Timothy Daniel Sullivan, who were both prominent members of parliament. Like the Healy brothers Timothy and Maurice, the Sullivans were from Bantry, Co. Cork.
Donal Sullivan was first elected as an Irish Parliamentary Party MP for the new constituency of South Westmeath at the 1885 general election. His brother T. D. Sullivan was sitting as one of the two Westmeath MPs until that election, when he moved to Dublin College Green, and Donal had no difficulty in defeating a Loyalist candidate who won only 200 votes. Donal held the seat unopposed in 1886. When the Irish Party split over Parnell's leadership in 1890, Donal and T. D. both joined the Anti-Parnellites, and at the general election of 1892 Donal was opposed by a Parnellite candidate who took almost one third of the vote. Thereafter, Donal was returned unopposed until his death in 1907.
His nephew Serjeant Sullivan described him in 1927 as 'still well remembered at Westminster as the man who never made a speech and never missed a division during his long years of membership'. This does not seem to be quite true; for instance, Hansard records a speech on 14 September 1886. But most of his contributions appear to have been questions.

George Whitcombe

George Charles Whitcombe (21 January 1902 – 30 April 1986) was a Welsh footballer. He also captained Wales at baseball, winning a total of five caps.
He began his football career at Cardiff City in 1922, before he was sold on to Stockport County in 1925. In August 1926, he moved on to Port Vale. He would remain at the club for five years, playing 55 games, as the club topped the Third Division North in 1929–30. On 27 June 1928 George took a break from football to marry Gwendoline Thomas in Grangetown, Cardiff. He was then sold on to Notts County in December 1930, a club that won the Third Division South title in 1930–31. He later turned out for non-league sides Ashton National Gas and Colwyn Bay. After retiring he became a publican.
He was part of a famous sporting family; his brother Frank represented Great Britain and Wales at rugby league, his nephew Frank Whitcombe Jr played rugby union for Bradford RFC and Yorkshire, and his great-nephew Martin Whitcombe played rugby union for Leicester Tigers and England Saxons.
Football career.
A "dogged, hard working" right-half, who could also play at centre-half, Whitcombe began his football career with local side Grange Albion in 1921. In summer 1922, Whitcombe signed for First Division Cardiff City. He spent three years at Ninian Park, during which time, in 1923–24, the "Bluebirds" finished second in the Football League. However following the Welsh Senior Cup tie with Swansea City on 2 March 1925, which Cardiff lost 4–0, he was sold on to Stockport County of the Second Division.
The "Hatters" were relegated in last place in 1925–26, and Whitcombe left the club due to a dispute over wages. In total he played fifteen times for County, before joining Port Vale back in the Second Division in August 1926.
He made his Port Vale debut in a 3–1 home win against Southampton on 27 September. He later appeared for the "Valiants" in the FA Cup Fourth Round clash with Arsenal, which ended in a 1–0 defeat at Highbury, following a 2–2 draw at The Old Recreation Ground.

He played fourteen games in 1927–28, and appeared twelve times in 1928–29, as the club were relegated into the Third Division North. Following the death of manager Joe Schofield, Vale won promotion as the division's champions under Tom Morgan in 1929–30; however Whitcombe made just the one appearance throughout the season. Despite only playing a further three games in 1930–31, he was sold to Notts County for a 'substantial amount' in December 1930, having played a total of 55 matches for the club (51 in the league).
He made only seven appearances for Notts County, having been sent off, for the only time in his career, in a county cup game against Frickley Colliery, and hit with a month long suspension as punishment. Despite this, the "Magpies" topped the Third Division South table by the end of the season.
Whitcombe returned to Cardiff, though his playing days were not quite over. He moved to be player-coach to a works team in Ashton-under-Lyne called Ashton National Gas, before ending his football career at Colwyn Bay.

Shane Hurlbut

Shane Hurlbut, (born 1964) also credited as L. Shane Hurlbut, is an American cinematographer. Originally from Ithaca, New York, he grew up near Cayuga Lake, and graduated from Southern Cayuga High School in 1982. Hurlbut studied film at Emerson College, graduating with a degree in film and television in 1986. His early career included work on music videos for Gloria Estefan and Smashing Pumpkins. He met director Rob Cohen while working on a music video for the 1996 disaster film "Daylight", and again worked with Cohen as cinematographer for the television pilot of "The Guardian".
Hurlbut received a nomination for an award from the American Society of Cinematographers for his work as director of cinematography on the 1998 television movie "The Rat Pack" – he was the youngest cinematographer ever to have been nominated for an American Society of Cinematographers award for a debut film.
He has received positive comments from film critics for his cinematography work on films including "Drumline" and "Mr. 3000", and in a review of the film "Into the Blue" Roger Ebert highlighted Hurlbut's work. In a review of the 2005 film "The Greatest Game Ever Played" Joan E. Vadeboncoeur of "The Post-Standard" described Hurlbut as a "splendid cinematographer" who contributed "beauty and atmosphere" to the film's shots. His work on the 2006 romantic comedy "Something New" where he collaborated with director Sanaa Hamri was positively received in "The Times-Picayune" and "The Journal News", and his cinematography work on the 2006 film "Waist Deep" with director Vondie Curtis-Hall was well received in "The Seattle Times".
Early life.
Hurlbut was raised in Ithaca, New York. His mother taught sixth grade, and his father worked as a professor's assistant at Cornell University. He grew up on a farm in Aurora, New York near Cayuga Lake, and graduated from Southern Cayuga High School in 1982. He married Lydia Kunkler, a fellow graduate of Southern Cayuga.
Hurlbut attended Herkimer County Community College, graduating with a degree in radio and television broadcasting in 1984, and he was inducted into the Alumni Hall of Honor by the Herkimer County Community College Alumni Association on April 4, 2008. Hurlbut received a bachelor's degree from Emerson College, where he majored in film and television. He graduated from Emerson College in 1986.
Career.
1987–2004.
Hurlbut moved to Los Angeles in 1987, where he began work in film as a driver, key grip, and gaffer, before becoming a cinematographer. He was a grip truck driver for the 1988 film "Phantasm II". His early career included work on music videos for Gloria Estefan and Smashing Pumpkins, photo shoot work with photographer Herb Ritts for an April 1997 Absolut Vodka spread in "Vogue" magazine, and work on a Nissan "Enjoy the Ride" commercial. He met director Rob Cohen while working on the Donna Summer/Bruce Roberts music video for the 1996 disaster film "Daylight". Hurlbut again worked with Cohen as cinematographer for the 1997 NBC television pilot "The Guardian". In 1997 Hurlbut's career focused on light as applied to photography and film, and he owned a lighting business in Pasadena, California. Hurlbut assisted friends from Southern Cayuga in their film careers, including Dan Wade and Tim Carr.
Cohen selected Hurlbut as his cinematographer for the 1998 television movie "The Rat Pack", which was Hurlbut's feature film debut. His lighting style for the movie was heavily influenced by the glamour photography of George Hurrell. Hurlbut received a nomination for an award from the American Society of Cinematographers for his cinematography work on the movie, becoming the youngest cinematographer ever to have been nominated for an American Society of Cinematographers award for a debut film. Hurlbut worked again with Cohen on the 2000 film "The Skulls", which was his first theatrical feature film.
He received positive comments for his work on the 2002 film "Drumline", directed by Charles Stone III. Lou Lumenick of the "New York Post" wrote that the film was "Handsomely photographed by Shane Hurlbut". "With 300 students dancing, running, jumping, singing and playing, Stone and cinematographer Shane Hurlbut bring you right inside the brassy band, nudged between the tubas, saxophones and clarinets," wrote Clint O'Connor of "The Plain Dealer". Charles Taylor of "Salon" commented "The movie was shot by Shane Hurlbut and none of the shots call attention to themselves. Instead you're struck by the beauty of watching a row of drummers' hands as they blur with the rhythm their sticks are beating out." Hurlbut worked with director Barry Levinson, as cinematographer for "The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman" advertisements for American Express.
In 2004, Hurlbut teamed up with director Charles Stone III again to work on the film "Mr. 3000". In a positive review of the film, Harper Barnes of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" highlighted Hurlbut, noting he had previously worked with the film's editor, Bill Pankow, on "Drumline". In a review of "Mr. 3000" for "The Manhattan Mercury", arts critic G.W. Clift specifically highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film, commenting: "Mr. 3000 has several attractions, even unexpected ones like Shane Hurlbut's heart-stopping photography. ... one doesn't mind that it lingers over scenes, in part because the scenes look so very good." In his review "Mr. 3000" for the "Intelligencer Journal", Jack Roberts also highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film.
2005–present.
Hurlbut's cinematography work on the 2005 film "Into the Blue" received positive reception from film critic Roger Ebert. In a review of "Into the Blue" for the "San Francisco Chronicle", Peter Hartlaub noted "director of photography Shane Hurlbut does some nice work in tight places". Lou Lumenick wrote in the "New York Post" that the "watery interludes" in "Into the Blue" were "gorgeously photographed by Shane Hurlbut". Though Associated Press writer David Germain gave a negative review overall of "Into the Blue", he wrote positively of Hurlbut's cinematography work, commenting: "Shane Hurlbut's cinematography buoys the movie, but his lovely pictures of the actors swimming among jellyfish and shimmery aquatic vegetation cannot compensate for everything else."
Bob Strauss of the "Los Angeles Daily News" also wrote positively of Hurlbut's work in his review of "Into the Blue", writing: "The undersea photography, much of it shot amid schools of wild sharks, is exquisite..." Strauss also commented positively on Hurlbut's work on the 2005 film "The Greatest Game Ever Played", writing he "does a great job of making golf look cinematic". Soren Andersen of "The News Tribune" wrote of Hurlbut's work on "The Greatest Game Ever Played": "Shot by cinematographer Shane Hurlbut, the picture is extraordinarily handsome, with its velvety green fairways and its burnished, candlelit interiors." Joan E. Vadeboncoeur of "The Post-Standard" was critical of the film's script, but praised Hurlbut's work: "Director Bill Paxton does have a splendid cinematographer, Shane Hurlbut, contributing beauty and atmosphere."
In 2005, Hurlbut became the first cinematographer to utilize the InDI process developed by LaserPacific, while working on the film "Something New". In 2006, Hurlbut became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers. Hurlbut's cinematography work on the 2006 romantic comedy was positively received by film critic Michael H. Kleinschrodt of "The Times-Picayune", who wrote: "Cinematographer Shane Hurlbut finds interesting angles from which to shoot and photographs a formal cotillion with panache." Kevin Canfield of "The Journal News" noted that Hurlbut assisted director Sanaa Hamri with "one lovely scene of the lovers bathed in the orangy light of morning and another, shot from overhead, of couples twirling on a dance floor".
Hurlbut worked on the 2006 film "Waist Deep" with director Vondie Curtis-Hall, and Tom Keogh of "The Seattle Times" described their work on shots prior to a kidnapping scene in the film as "close to breathtaking". Hurlbut worked as cinematographer on the 2008 film "Semi-Pro" starring Will Ferrell, and Steven Boone of "The Star-Ledger" noted: "...Shane Hurlbut's widescreen sports cinematography does conspire with two notorious disco covers of classical music to give us a thrill along with the cheap laughs." Hurlbut collaborated with director McG as director of photography on the 2006 film "We Are Marshall". Hurlbut and McG decided to use vintage lenses and film stock from the time period to evoke a feeling of the 1970s.
In 2008, Hurlbut again worked with director McG, as director of photography on the film "Terminator Salvation". During shooting for the film in July 2008, Hurlbut faced an expletive-ridden tirade from actor Christian Bale, who berated Hurlbut for walking into a scene involving Bale and actress Bryce Dallas Howard. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident. On February 6, 2009, Bale told KROQ-FM radio that he and Hurlbut talked after the incident and "resolved this completely". Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the incident, and "at least a month after that", and noted "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic".
Charles Stone III, director of the original "Whassup?" commercial for commercial campaign for Anheuser-Busch Budweiser beer, remembered Hurlbut from their work together on "Drumline", and contacted him in 2008 to make a video in support of Barack Obama's 2008 campaign for President. The video, "Wassup 2008" was posted to YouTube in October 2008 and received over 1.8 million views.

Jim Dandy (song)

"Jim Dandy" (sometimes known as "Jim Dandy to the Rescue") is a song written by Lincoln Chase, and was first recorded by American R&B singer LaVern Baker in 1956. It reached the top of the R&B chart and #17 on the pop charts in the U.S. It was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and was ranked #343 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
The song is about a man (Jim Dandy) who rescues women from improbable or impossible predicaments. It proved popular enough that Chase wrote a second song for Baker entitled "Jim Dandy Got Married.".
The American English term jim-dandy for an outstanding person or thing predates the song; first attested in 1844, it may itself come from the title of an old song, "Dandy Jim of Caroline".
Black Oak Arkansas cover.
The song was covered by southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas. It hit #25 on the pop chart and featured Jim "Dandy" Mangrum and female vocalist Ruby Starr trading off vocals. It was the first single from their 1973 album "High on the Hog", Black Oak's most commercially successful album.
The song has been featured in two movies. The Black Oak Arkansas version was used in the 1993 film "Dazed and Confused", while the Wright Brothers Band version was used in the 1987 film "Overboard". In the early-to-mid 2000's, a used car lot called JD Byrider produced a version replacing "Jim Dandy" with "JD" to advertise that they would "rescue" buyers with bad credit.

<doc id="21387040" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21387040" title="Urse d'Abetot">
Urse d'Abetot

Urse d'Abetot (sometimes Urse of Abetot, Urse de Abetot, Urse d'Abitot or Urse of Abitôt) ("c." 1040 – 1108) was a Norman as well as a medieval Sheriff of Worcestershire and royal official under Kings William I, William II and Henry I. He was a native of Normandy and came to England shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, and was appointed sheriff in about 1069. Little is known of his family in Normandy, who were not prominent. Although Urse's lord in Normandy was present at the Battle of Hastings, there is no evidence that Urse took part in the invasion of England in 1066.
Urse built a castle in the town of Worcester, which encroached on the cathedral cemetery there, earning him a curse from the Archbishop of York. Urse helped to put down a rebellion against King William I in 1075, and quarrelled with the Church in his county over the jurisdiction of the sheriffs. He continued in the service of William's sons after the king's death, and was appointed constable under William II and marshal under Henry. Urse was known for his acquisitiveness, and during William II's reign was considered second only to Ranulf Flambard, another royal official, in his rapacity. Urse's son succeeded him as sheriff but was subsequently exiled, thus forfeiting the office. Through his daughter, Urse is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family, who eventually became Earls of Warwick.
Background.
Norman Conquest of England.
On 5 January 1066 Edward the Confessor, King of England, died. Edward's lack of children meant there was no clear legitimate successor, leading eventually to a succession dispute. Some medieval writers state that shortly before Edward's death he named his brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, as his heir. Others claim that Edward had promised the throne to his distant cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, a powerful autonomous ruler in northern France. Harold, the most powerful English noble, took the initiative and was crowned king on 6 January. William, lacking Harold's proximity to the centres of English royal government, gathered troops and prepared an invasion fleet. He invaded England in October, and subsequently defeated and killed Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. William was crowned on Christmas Day at Westminster, becoming William I.
Between his coronation and 1071, William consolidated his hold over England, defeating a number of rebellions that arose particularly in the north and west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.
Sources.
The main sources for Urse's life are English documents such as charters and writs which mention his activities. Often these are contained in collections of such documents, known as cartularies, which were assembled by monasteries and cathedral chapters to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which is the case with many of the documents mentioning Urse. Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's "Gesta pontificum Anglorum", Florence of Worcester's "Chronicon ex chronicis", and "Hemming's Cartulary", a mixed chronicle and cartulary from Worcester Cathedral. There are also mentions of Urse in Norman sources, such as charters for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey.
Family and early life.
Urse came from an undistinguished family, and made his way on military reputation. He was probably born in about 1040, but the exact date is unknown. He was from St Jean d'Abbetot in Normandy, where his family had lands, and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of Tancarville. Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d'Abetot and his wife Lesza, who held lands close to St Jean d'Abbetot in the early 12th century; despite the name, it is not certain that Robert d'Abetot was related to Urse. Urse had a brother usually called Robert Despenser, sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin, who also became a royal official. The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a forename, perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament. Urse's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy. His brother's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office, that of "dispenser", in the royal household.
Ralph, the Lord of Tancarville during the reign of King William I of England and Urse's overlord in Normandy, fought at the Battle of Hastings, but there is no evidence that Urse himself was present. He is probably the same person as the "Urse d'Abetot" who was a witness to a charter of William before the invasion of England. The historian Lewis Loyd refers to Urse as "in origin a man of no importance who made his way as a soldier of fortune".
Service to William I.
Sheriff of Worcester.
Urse arrived in England after Hastings, but it is unknown if his brother Robert arrived with him or separately. Urse was appointed Sheriff of Worcestershire some time after the Norman Conquest of England, probably in about 1069, part of the wholesale replacement of English royal officials with Norman and other immigrants that took place in the early part of William's reign. As sheriff, Urse was responsible for collecting taxes and forwarding them to the treasury, and was empowered to raise armies if rebellion or invasion threatened. The sheriff presided over the shire court, and was accountable for the shire's annual payments to the king. During the reigns of William the Conqueror and his sons, the office of sheriff was a powerful one, as it did not share power with any other official in the shire, unless there was an earl in overall control. Because of their control of the courts for the hundreds – which were subdivisions of the shire – sheriffs had opportunities for patronage and also had a large say in who became members of the hundred and shire court juries. The death of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, who held power in Worcestershire until his death in 1071 during a rebellion against William, allowed Urse to accumulate more authority in Worcestershire, as Edwin was the last Earl of Mercia.
Urse also oversaw the construction of a new castle at the town of Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse had control of the castle after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester.
In 1075, three earls rebelled, for reasons unknown, and sought aid from the King of Denmark, Sweyn II Estridsson, who had a distant claim to the English throne. Among the rebels was Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, whose lands neighboured those of Urse. Along with Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester, Abbot Æthelwig of Evesham, and Walter de Lacy, Urse prevented de Breteuil from crossing the River Severn. Urse's actions kept the rebels from seizing control of the Severn Valley and joining up with the other English rebels, Waltheof, the Earl of Northumbria, and Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk. Urse and the magnates fighting alongside him, in addition to their obvious desire to suppress rebellion, had an interest in defeating de Breteuil, as he was the most powerful lord in the area. De Breteuil was caught, tried, and imprisoned for life, increasing the power of his rivals.
Urse, along with his contemporaries, benefited from the increasing power wielded by the sheriffs. Although royal officials, including the sheriffs, had been appropriating ecclesiastical lands since the late 10th century, in the immediate years after the Norman Conquest churchmen complained about the increased amount of land seized by the sheriffs. Urse received his share of complaints, but he was part of a wider trend during the early years of William I's reign. The appropriation of land led to an increase in the recording of rights and possessions not only by clergy but also by laymen, culminating in the recording of all possessions and the rights held by the king over them in the Domesday Survey of 1086. This behaviour was not limited to the sheriffs, as other nobles were also accused in contemporary chronicles of appropriating land from churches and from native Englishmen.
Disputes with Wulfstan and Ealdred.
During the reign of William I, Urse became involved in a dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over the rights of the sheriff in the lands of the diocese. By the time of Domesday Book in 1086, Urse's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the Oswaldslaw, the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester. Domesday Book records that the Oswaldslaw was regarded as an immunity, exempt from judicial actions by royal officials. Urse complained that this immunity reduced his income, but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan, who prevailed. Although Wulfstan claimed that the immunity dated from before the Conquest, it actually owed its existence to the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters, and thus influence the findings of the court.
Urse was also involved in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, Beorhtheah. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk Hemming recorded the loss of the lands to Urse in "Hemming's Cartulary", a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. "Hemmings' Cartulary" mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means, when William I's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse during the course of the lawsuit.
The 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story, in which shortly after Urse was appointed sheriff, he encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter of Worcester Cathedral. Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse, declaring "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse." Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop, and still retained an interest in the diocese. Gerald of Wales, a late 12th- and early 13th-century writer, wrote that Wulfstan uttered the curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop. Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it, William I's predecessor, Edward the Confessor. Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward's tomb, a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate. Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan, and although there are certainly embellishments added in Gerald's story, it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire, and were thus great rivals.
The Archbishop's curse had no discernible effect, either on Urse's career or the castle. Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands, including some from Evesham Abbey. Urse gained a reputation for greed and avarice, especially with regard to church lands. Great Malvern Priory, however, claimed him as a founder in a 14th-century document.
Domesday lands.
In 1086, the Domesday Survey documents that while the majority of Urse's lands were in Worcestershire, he also held land in Warwickshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire. His lands in Warwickshire were held directly from the king, as a tenant-in-chief, while others were held as an under-tenant of others who had their lands directly from the king. Urse's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant-in-chief and sub-tenant, as was also the case in Gloucester. Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire, he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester. Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire. This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester, as Urse was also responsible for payments of £23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the Borough of Worcester, £17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £16 or a hunting hawk, specifically a "Norway hawk"; also due from the courts. Urse also had to pay the queen £5 plus £1 additional for a "sumpter horse". All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse, who had to make up any shortfall.
Domesday makes it obvious that Urse was the most powerful layman in Worcester, and the only person who could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.
Service to William II and Henry I.
After the death of King William I of England, Urse continued to serve William's sons and successors, Kings William II Rufus and Henry I. While William I granted the duchy of Normandy to his eldest son, Robert Curthose, England went to his second surviving son, William Rufus. Henry (later Henry I), the youngest son, was given a sum of money. In 1088, shortly after William Rufus became king, Urse was present at the trial of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, and is mentioned in "De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi", a contemporary account of the trial. During William I's reign, Urse had served the king mainly as a regional official, but during William II's reign Urse began to take a broader role in the kingdom as a whole. Urse became a constable in the king's household for both William II and Henry I, and under William II, he ascended to the office of marshal.
Urse was an assistant to William II's main minister, Ranulf Flambard, and frequently served as a royal judge. The historian Emma Mason argues that Urse, along with Flambard, Robert Fitzhamon, Roger Bigod, Haimo the dapifer, or seneschal, and Eudo, another dapifer, were the first recognizable barons of the Exchequer. During his absence from England, the king addressed a number of writs to Urse, along with Haimo, Eudo, and Robert Bloet, ordering them to enforce William's decisions in England. The historian Francis West, who studied the office of the justiciarship, asserts that Haimo, Eudo, and Urse, along with Flambard, could be considered the first English justiciars.
Urse's estates grew under William II, partly as a result of the inheritance of some of the lands of his brother, Robert Despenser, who died about 1097. Later, Urse consolidated his holdings by exchanging some of Robert's lands in Lincolnshire with Robert de Lacy for lands closer to his base in Worcestershire. Urse d'Abetot gained and passed to his heirs an estate that later became the Barony of Salwarpe, Worcestershire.
William II died in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100. His younger brother Henry immediately rode to Winchester and had himself crowned king before his elder brother, Robert Curthose, could claim the throne. Although Urse did not attest the charter Henry issued after he seized the throne, Urse was at court shortly afterwards. When Robert Curthose invaded England in 1101 in an attempt to take the English throne, Urse supported Henry. Urse was present at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101, when a peace treaty was ratified between the brothers. During Henry's reign, the king regranted Urse's lands to him, with some of them now granted as a tenant-in-chief when previously Urse had held those lands as an under-tenant, and not directly from the king. Urse's lands at Salwarpe were previously held by Roger of Montgomery, but were granted to Urse as a direct tenant of the king when Roger's son, Robert of Belesme, was outlawed in 1102. Urse continued to attest many of Henry's charters until 1108, although he did not use the title of "constable" in those charters.
Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry addressed a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates other than those normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining those who did not attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure that could be used in what type of case.
Death and legacy.
Urse died some time in 1108. Little is known of his wife, Alice, whose death is unrecorded. Urse was succeeded as sheriff by his son Roger d'Abetot, who was exiled in about 1110 and forfeited the office of sheriff. Roger's successor, Osbert d'Abetot, was probably Urse's brother. Urse also had a daughter, probably named Emmeline, who married Walter de Beauchamp. Walter succeeded to Urse's lands after Roger's exile. A charter for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey may indicate that Urse had a second son, named Robert. Urse may also have had another daughter, who married Robert Marmion, as some of Urse's estates went to Marmion's family and others to the Beauchamps.
Urse earned a reputation for extortion and financial exactions. During the reign of William II, he was considered second only to the king's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity. The first mention of his exactions is in "Hemming's Cartulary". Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales, both of whom relate Ealdred's curse. His exactions were also mentioned in "Domesday Book", where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents. He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates, Greenhill and Eastbury. Urse was one of a new breed of royal official, one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it, as it helped his own position.
Through his daughter, he is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family of Elmley in Worcestershire, a scion of which, William de Beauchamp, became Earl of Warwick. It is likely that the Beauchamp family's symbol, a bear, derives from their relationship to Urse.

The Birthday Party (novel)

The Birthday Party is a biographical novel by Panos Karnezis first published in 2007.
Plot introduction.
Set on a single day in late summer of 1975, it is about the rise to wealth and fame of Marco Timoleon, a 72 year-old Greek shipping magnate who for that end of August day has arranged a grand party on his private island in the Aegean to celebrate his daughter's 25th birthday. In a series of flashbacks, the omniscient narrator of the novel chronicles the businessman's life from his childhood days in İzmir to his present cosmopolitan existence and status as one of the richest men in the world. However, being a master at deception, the billionaire has rewritten his own history so often that there are patches of his past his family know next to nothing about and of which even his official biographer cannot make head or tail. Sensing now that his life is gradually drawing to a close, Timoleon plans to use the birthday party as his final attempt to take influence on his daughter's extravagant life and, by doing so, to ensure that his accumulated wealth stays in the family.
Practically all reviewers have pointed out the numerous parallels between the fictional protagonist and Aristotle Onassis.
Plot summary.
Marco Timoleon is born somewhere in Anatolia in 1903 to a railway engineer father and a schoolteacher mother. When he is one year old, his parents move to İzmir, where he spends his childhood and adolescence. A mediocre pupil, he drops out of high school at 18, only months before graduation, having already proven his business acumen at the age of 15 by buying a dilapidated boat, repairing it himself and then renting it out. One day his father walks out on his family, never to be seen, or heard of, again, and in 1921, during the Greco-Turkish War, Timoleon decides to seek his fortune in Argentina. Leaving his mother behind, he travels to Buenos Aires and starts working for a telephone company. It is in South America that he lays the foundation of his wealth, operating on both sides of the law and increasingly applying as yet unheard of business practices such as closing contracts to transport oil on tankers that have not been built yet. During that time he also makes the acquaintance of Dr Aristide Patrikios, a physician and fellow Greek who will become his only lifelong friend. As far as his private life is concerned, in his younger years it never occurs to Timoleon to get married, but he has countless love affairs, also with married women.
In 1939, already a rich man, and—erroneously—known to business rivals and competitors as "The Turk," he moves his company headquarters to New York City, and during the Second World War his growing fleet services both the Allies and the Axis powers, resulting in even greater profit. All the time carrying on with his turbulent love life, only after his 40th birthday does Timoleon think the time has come for him to get married and have offspring. From a bourgeois background himself, he has always been in awe of old money and aristocracy and resentful of, and at the same time attracted by, the upper crust, so he starts courting the 16 year-old daughter of shipping tycoon Daniel Negri, Miranda, who is still attending prep school. In 1948, against her father's wish, the couple get married when Miranda is 19 and Timoleon is 44 years old.
The Timoleons move to London, and Miranda gives birth to two children, Sofia (in 1950) and Daniel (in 1954). While Timoleon's business prospers in the wake of the Suez Crisis, making him one of the richest men in the world, his marriage soon disintegrates, and the children are left in the care of a nanny and a governess while the two spouses increasingly go their separate ways. Miranda Timoleon, unprepared for life's harsh realities due to an over-protective Catholic upbringing, seeks solace in tranquillizers but eventually tries to combat her husband's continued womanising by having love affairs herself. In 1964, at a point where the couple consider divorce and a legal battle over custody of the children is likely to break out, Miranda Timoleon, aged 35, dies of a drug overdose on the private island her husband has recently bought. A carefully planned suicide, her death nevertheless stirs rumours, notably in the yellow press, that Marco Timoleon may have killed his wife, either intentionally or unintentionally, and the tycoon himself feels no need ever to disperse them.
As his children grow up, Timoleon tries to prepare them for adult life but soon realizes that there is little he can do to mould their characters and influence their decisions. He finds out that Sofia is more and more taking after him, especially as far as her voracious sexual appetite is concerned. Moving out of the family home, which is now in Paris, France, at the age of 18, she embarks on a life described by the narrator as a "permanent holiday":
Sofia was interested in business even less than her brother was. She had struggled through boarding-school, graduating only thanks to a generous donation from Marco Timoleon and refusing to continue to university despite her father's pressure and the pleas of Miss Rees, whom Marco had asked to mediate knowing the retired governess still wielded influence over his daughter.
These days Sofia passed her time travelling with an ever-growing group of friends, who depended on her generosity and agreed with everything that she said before she said it. They stayed at exclusive hotels where they demanded the best rooms without having made reservations. Marco Timoleon's reputation and money meant that foreign dignitaries in curlers, half-shaved ambassadors with lather on their cheeks and honeymooners in bathrobes were asked to vacate their suites with the excuse that a mistake had been made in allocating their rooms. [...]
The world in the morning was an unknown planet to her: no matter when she went to bed, at midnight or at dawn, she woke up in late afternoon, usually with company, having inherited her father's sexual energy. She had lunch in bed, naked, letting her ephemeral lover feed her, and then took a long bath, not to cleanse herself of sin, for she believed neither in sin nor retribution, but to give the stranger time to dress and leave the room. Not caring about social class, she slept with waiters, bellboys and security guards as long as they had a nice face and a good body. [...] (Chapter 4)
Daniel Timoleon, on the other hand, has developed into an inconspicuous introvert whose only passion is flying planes: he shows no interest whatsoever in his father's business and ignores each of the eligible young women presented to him by his father. The family is ripped further apart when, in 1969, Timoleon, now 66, meets 33 year-old American divorcee Olivia Andersen and in the following year decides to marry her. Sofia takes an instant dislike to her stepmother, and it only takes a few years for Timoleon's second marriage to show signs of failure, too, so much so that in the end Olivia, whose permanent residence is a penthouse apartment in New York City, is not allowed to enter her husband's island without his prior consent.
In early 1973 Ian Forster, an eager British journalist, approaches Timoleon with the proposal to write his authorised biography. Timoleon agrees to the project and pays all of Forster's expenses although he soon turns out to be far less co-operative than Forster would have wished. Also, he has him sign a confidentiality agreement so that the young would-be author lives in constant fear of never being able to publish his extensively researched book. While interviewing everyone still alive who has ever been close to the shipping magnate, Forster also makes the acquaintance of Sofia Timoleon, who, without her knowledge, is being spied on by her father's private investigators. Probably out of boredom, Sofia adds Forster to her long list of lovers, but their unexpected mutual attraction leads to a longer love affair conducted in what they believe is absolute secrecy. In truth, however, Timoleon is informed about each and every move the two lovers make.
Despite the 1973 oil crisis, which affects his business badly, the biggest blow to Timoleon's life is his son's death in a plane crash in the summer of 1974. While entertaining a married woman half his age in his earthly paradise for the weekend, Timoleon sees one of his old Piaggio seaplanes piloted by Daniel approaching the island in bad weather and actually becomes an eye-witness to his son's fatal accident when the plane is overturned during the landing procedure. Timoleon is shattered by the loss of his child, and his robust health slowly starts to deteriorate, the most obvious sign for the ageing tycoon being the realisation of his sudden impotence.
Naturally, Timoleon turns his attention to his daughter as his last hope. When he is informed in the spring of 1975 that Sofia has seen her gynaecologist and he listens to a taped telephone conversation between her and Forster in which she informs her lover that she is pregnant, he feels the urgent need to do something about this uncalled for situation before it is too late. Intending to persuade Sofia to have an abortion right during her stay on the island, he has one of the many guest rooms of his villa converted into an operating theatre, hires Dr Patrikios and a nurse to perform the operation, and, to her great surprise, sends Sofia an invitation to a lavish birthday party in honour of her 25th birthday. On the day of the party, he arranges a private talk with Ian Forster during which he threateningly explains to him that he will be allowed to publish anything about his life on condition that he can persuade Sofia to have an abortion and that he subsequently vanish from her life forever. When Forster cautiously broaches the subject to Sofia, she realises how little her love for him is reciprocated. She tells Forster that she has never been pregnant, that she only wanted to put his loyalty to the test, and that he has failed that test as far as she is concerned. Then she breaks off their relationship and retires to her room while the party is still in full swing. There, having inherited her mother's melancholy disposition, Sofia swallows an overdose of pills. She survives her suicide attempt because on the following day she is rescued by Dr Patrikios and the nurse.
Marco Timoleon dies two years later, aged 74.

Mykhailo Krychevsky

Mykhailo Krychevsky or Stanisław Krzyczewski or Krzeczowski (died 3 August 1649) was a Polish noble, military officer and Cossack commander.
Biography.
He was born Stanisław Krzeczowski or Krzyczewski (sources vary) to a Roman Catholic family of nobility ("szlachta"), polonized around the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries in the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship. His year of birth is unknown, but in mid-1640s he likely served in the Commonwealth army for 10 to 20 years. Hence it can be conjectured that he was close to 30 years old if not older at this time. Thus he was likely born no later than mid-1610s, and possibly earlier.
Little is known about his early life. Polish historian, Wacław Lipiński, in his 1912 biography of Krychevsky, speculated that with the rank of rotmistrz he fought in the Polish-Swedish wars (1627–1629) under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, where he led a chorągiew (unit) of Polish hussars. However more recent Polish studies dispute this, noting that the rotmistrz, known in some sources only by his surname Krzeczowski and in others as Mikołaj Krzyczewski, was probably another person.
It is much more likely that Krychevsky was present in the sejm of 1632 which elected Władysław IV Waza the king of Poland. He also probably helped quell the Cossack Pawluk Uprising in 1637, fighting in a Cossack chorągiew loyal to the King, under prince Zachariasz Czetwertyński and was wounded in that campaign. In 1643 Hetman Koniecpolski, who considered him a valuable commander, gave him the rank of polkovnyk (colonel) and made him the leader of a registered Cossacks unit (pułk) based in Chyhyryn. He replaced the previous commander of that unit, Jan Zakrzewski, who was removed after fraud or mistreatment of those under his command. As a polkovnyk Krychevsky was known for his favorable attitude towards the Cossacks.
In 1644 he was given the task of gathering information on the Tatar invasion; it is possible that he fought in the battle of Okhmativ under Hetman Koniecpolski against Tatars of Tugay Bey. In 1646 and in 1647 he took part in another series of hostilities with the Tatars.
Eventually Krychevsky became a friend and a sympathizer of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and even became a godfather to Khmelnytsky's child. He met Khmelnytsky while both were serving in the Chyryryn Cossack unit. In 1647 he helped Khmelnytsky, who had been arrested and sentenced to death under a suspicion of preparing another Cossack uprising. After receiving guarantees of Khmelnytsky's innocence (from Krychevsky and others), Koniecpolski allowed Khmelnytsky to go free. Khmelnytsky's promptly went to Zaporizhian Sich where he started the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Nonetheless Krychevsky did not join the uprising and remained in command of his unit and was known as a supporter of official Commonwealth policies. Krychevsky himself informed Koniecpolski of Khmelnytsky's escape, and then started gathering information about the situation in Zaphoroze. He took part in scouting missions, captured Cossack prisoners, and participated in negotiations early that year. During this time he was assaulted and battered by the Cossacks.
According to an account given in Polski Słownik Biograficzny, in April, while securing a fortification in Bucki, a Cossack unit under his command rebelled and he was taken prisoner. Unlike some of his fellow officers, however, he was not killed but instead given to the Tatars. He was ransomed from them by Khmelnytsky (for 4,000 talars), and joined his side becoming a respected commander.
A different account of how Krychevsky joined Khmelnytsky is present in other sources. Taken prisoner by Tatars during the Battle of Zhovti Vody (Yellow Waters) in April/May 1648, where he still fought on the Polish-Lithuanian side against the Cossacks, he was liberated by Khmelnytsky, who convinced him to join his side. Other sources even accuse Krychevsky of joining Khmelnytsky in the midst of the battle, and of meeting (or planning to meet) with him before the battle.
In either case, all accounts agree that Krychevsky converted to Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism, adopting a new name, Mykahilo (Michael).
He was given the title of acting Hetman and was considered a very able and promising commander by Khmelnytsky. Very likely he acted as a close adviser to the rebel leader. He was defeated and mortally wounded in the battle of Loyew on 31 July 1649. Polish hetman Janusz Radziwiłł wanted to save his life, so he could be put on trial for joining the uprising, but his wounds were too great and he died soon afterwords, on 3 August 1649.
In fiction.
Krychevsky was a minor character in Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel "With Fire and Sword (Ogniem i Mieczem)".

Freak show

A freak show is an exhibition of biological rarities, referred to as "freaks of nature". Typical features would be physically unusual humans, such as those uncommonly large or small, those with both male and female secondary sexual characteristics, people with other extraordinary diseases and conditions, and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers. Heavily tattooed or pierced people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have attention-getting physical performers such as fire-eating and sword-swallowing acts.
History.
In the mid-16th century, freak shows began to become popular pastimes in England. Deformities began to be treated as objects of interest and entertainment, and the crowds flocked to see them exhibited. A famous early modern example was the exhibition at the court of Charles I of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo, two conjoined brothers born in Genoa, Italy. While Lazarus was handsome and functioning, his parasitic brother just dangled before him in a mass of limbs from his chest. When Lazarus was not exhibiting himself, he covered his brother with his cloak to avoid unnecessary attention.
As well as crazy exhibitions, freak shows were popular in the taverns and fairgrounds where the freaks were often combined with talent displays. For example in the 18th century, Matthias Buchinger, born without arms or lower legs, entertained crowds with astonishing displays of magic and musical ability, both in England and later, Ireland.
It was in the 19th century, both in England and the United States, where freak shows finally reached maturity as successful commercially run enterprises.
P. T. Barnum in the United States was a major figure in popularizing the entertainment.
In 1842, Barnum introduced his first major hoax, a creature with the head of a monkey and the tail of a fish, known as the "Feejee" mermaid. Barnum followed that with the exhibition of Charles Stratton, the dwarf "General Tom Thumb" who was then four years of age but was stated to be 11. Charles had stopped growing after the first six months of his life, at which point he was 25 inches (64 cm) tall and weighed 15 pounds (6.8 kg). With heavy coaching and natural talent, the boy was taught to imitate people from Hercules to Napoleon. By five, he was drinking wine and by seven smoking cigars for the public's amusement. During 1844–45, Barnum toured with Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria, who was amused and saddened by the little man, and the event was a publicity coup.
In 1860, Barnum introduced the "man-monkey" William Henry Johnson, a microcephalic black dwarf who spoke a mysterious language created by Barnum. In 1862, he discovered the giantess Anna Swan and Commodore Nutt, a new Tom Thumb, with whom Barnum visited President Abraham Lincoln at the White House. During the Civil War, Barnum's museum drew large audiences seeking diversion from the conflict.
Barnum's English counterpart was Tom Norman, a renowned Victorian showman, whose traveling exhibitions featured Eliza Jenkins, the "Skeleton Woman", a "Balloon Headed Baby" and a woman who bit off the heads of live rats—the "most gruesome" act Norman claimed to have seen. Other acts included fleas, fat ladies, giants, dwarves and retired white seamen, painted black and speaking in an invented language, billed "savage Zulus". He displayed a "family of midgets" which in reality was composed of two men and a borrowed baby. He operated a number of shops in London and Nottingham, and exhibited travelling shows throughout the country.
Most famously, in 1884, Norman came into contact with Joseph Merrick the Elephant Man, a young man from Leicester who suffered from extreme deformities. Merrick arrived in London and into Norman's care. Norman, initially shocked by Merrick's appearance and reluctant to display him, nonetheless exhibited him at his penny gaff shop at 123 Whitechapel Road, directly across the road from the London Hospital. Because of its proximity to the hospital, the shop received medical students and doctors as visitors. One of these was a young surgeon named Frederick Treves who arranged to have Merrick brought to the hospital to be examined. The exhibition of the Elephant Man was reasonably successful, particularly with the added income from a printed pamphlet about Merrick's life and condition.
At this time, however, public opinion about freak shows was starting to change and the display of human novelties was beginning to be viewed as distasteful. After only a few weeks with Norman, the Elephant Man exhibition was shut down by the police, and Norman and Merrick parted ways. Treves later arranged for Merrick to live at the London Hospital until his death in 1890. In Treves' 1923 memoir, "The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences" made Norman infamous as a drunk who cruelly exploited Merrick. Norman counteracted these claims in a letter in the "World's Fair" newspaper that year, as well as his own autobiography. Norman's opinion was that he provided Merrick (and his other exhibits) a way of making a living and remaining independent, but that on entering the London Hospital, Merrick remained a freak on display, only with no control over how or when he was viewed.
These changing attitudes about physical differences led to the decline of the freak show as a form of entertainment towards the end of the 19th century. As previously mysterious anomalies were scientifically explained as genetic mutations or diseases, freaks became the objects of sympathy rather than fear or disdain. Laws were passed restricting freak shows for these reasons. For example, Michigan law forbids the "exhibition any deformed human being or human monstrosity, except as used for scientific purposes". However, in many places freak shows are still popular features.
Historical timeline.
The exhibition of human oddities has a long history:
Modern freak shows.
The entertainment appeal of the traditional "freak shows" is arguably echoed in numerous programmes made for television. "Extraordinary People" on the British television channel Five or BodyShock show the lives of severely disabled or deformed people, and can be seen as the modern equivalent of circus freak shows. However in order to make the shows respectable, the subjects are usually portrayed as heroic and attention is given to their family and friends and the way they help them overcome their disabilities. On "The Guardian", Chris Shaw however comments that "one man's freak show is another man's portrayal of heroic triumph over medical adversity" and carries on with "call me prejudiced but I suspect your typical twentysomething watched this show with their jaw on the floor rather than a tear in their eye".

First Presbyterian Church and Manse (Baltimore, Maryland)

First Presbyterian Church and Manse is a historic Presbyterian church located at West Madison Street and Park Avenue in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The church is a rectangular brick building with a central tower flanked by protruding octagonal turrets at each corner. At the north end of the church is a two story building appearing to be a transept and sharing a common roof with the church, but is separated from the auditorium by a bearing wall. The manse is a three story stone-faced building. The church was begun about 1854 by Nathan G. Starkweather and finished by his assistant Edmund G. Lind around 1873. It is a notable example of Gothic Revival architecture and a landmark in the City of Baltimore.
The steeple is the tallest in Baltimore at and was completed by 1875, supported by clusters of cast iron columns. A subsidiary spire to the right is high, and the smaller, on the southwest corner, is 78 feet high. Wendel Bollman fabricated much of the ironwork at his Patapsco Bridge and Ironworks and is famous for several iron truss bridges throughout the region especially on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The manse, or rectory, is located to the left, or west of the entrance. Stonework is a red freestone or sandstone from New Brunswick.
First Presbyterian Church and Manse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is now known as the First and Franklin Presbyterian Church, after merging in 1973 with the former Franklin Street Presbyterian Church several blocks to the south at the northwest corner of West Franklin and Cathedral Streets, across from the central Enoch Pratt Free Library and the Old Baltimore Cathedral (now the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary which was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist Protestant congregation. Franklin Street Church was built in 1847 and designed in English Tudor Revival style by Robert Cary Long, Jr. and Col. Robert Snowden Andrews, C.S.A. (who also designed the earliest Eastern High School on Aisquith and Orleans Streets).
First Presbyterian Church is the oldest Presbyterian congregation in Baltimore, founded in 1761, then located after 1763 at East Fayette and North Streets (later Guilford Avenue) on the northwest corner in downtown which was the site for three its succeeding buildings until 1859, when the site was purchased by the Federaql Government and constructed a U.S. Courthouse there, dedicated by President James Buchanan in 1860, later replace by another courthouse on the entire block in 1889 and finally the current one in 1932, which is now "Courthouse East" for the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. It was instrumental in the establishment of the local Presbytery of Baltimore and many "daughter congregations" such as Second Presbyterian Church and others. The church and manse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1973. They are included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

False map turtle

The false map turtle (Graptemys pseudogeographica) is a species of turtle endemic to the United States. It is a common pet species. Two subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies described here.
Description.
Also known as a “sawback” turtle, the carapace features a vertebral row of low spines, and is serrated on the posterior rim. The carapace is olive to brown in color with light yellowish markings with dark borders. The plastron color varies from cream to yellow and is patterned with dark lines along the seams in juveniles. The body color of the false map turtle is grayish brown to blackish and is marked with light brown, yellow, or whitish stripes. The eye can be light yellow, white, or green and is crossed with a dark bar. Narrow hooked marks behind the eye fuse with dorsal lines on the head and neck. There are also small light-colored spots below the eye and on the chin.
Geographic range.
The false map turtle lives in large streams of the Missouri and Mississippi River systems, ranging from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, through the Dakotas southward to southwestern Alabama, southern and western Mississippi, through Louisiana and eastern Texas. 
Conservation status.
In the Midwest, the False Map Turtle is a species of Special Interest in Ohio.
Behavior.
Map turtles of all kinds are avid baskers, spending many hours during the day in the sun. When with other turtles, they also are very communal, sharing space and using each other for predator watching, increasing the odds of surviving an attack.
Ecology.
The false map turtle is a strong swimmer and prefers rivers and large creeks with moderate currents, containing aquatic vegetation, as well as snags or floating logs. They are also comfortable in deep and swift water. The turtles are present in oxbow lakes and sloughs, but are absent from lakes, ponds, or small streams. Basking is important to the sawbacks, and they may even be found on steep, slippery snags.
Threats and management issues.
A variety of threats face this species, including the destruction of its nests of eggs by animals and insects, falling victim to gill nets, as well as being shot. False map turtles, much like red-eared sliders "(Trachemys scripta elegans)", have also been collected for the pet trade.

Battle of Abancay

The Battle of Abancay was a battle that took place during the Spanish conquest of Peru.
After emerging as the victor both in the siege of Cuzco and from initial disputes between the Pizarro brothers with allies and the Almagristas under Diego de Almagro, who had seized the former Inca capital upon rescuing Hernando Pizarro and Gonzalo Pizarro from emerging defeat, imprisoning them both.
Unable to break the siege on his own, and having lost his youngest brother, Pizarro gathered a new army from Spanish settlers traveling to New Castile to find further wealth. The expedition force, commanded by Alonso de Alvarado, was completely defeated by Almagrist forces.
Alvarado was captured during the battle but managed to escape with Gonzalo Pizarro when Marshal Almagro left the main force with Hernando under his control. Hernando was later released as well with the condition that he would return to Spain within six weeks to ensure Francisco would not interfere in Almagro's future reign in Peru. This proved to be a mistake as the Pizarro brothers and Alvarado raised another army and faced Almagro yet again in a struggle for power at Las Salinas.

Shinaki

Shinaki is the name given to the people living in the Lower Hunza, Pakistan. 
Hunza Valley has generally three parts, namely "Lower Hunza", "Centre Hunza" and "Upper Hunza". The lower part includes mainly four villages namely Hussainabad, Mayon, Khanabad and Nasirabad (old name Hini- in Shina and Hindi- in Brushiski).
Historically Shinakis are considered straightforward, brave and loyal. In older times, "Mir" (The ruler of Hunza) had special army mostly consisted of Shinakis.
Shinakis were the last to convert into Ismaili Muslims (99% of Hunza's population is Ismaili).
Currently, Hunza Shinaki is composed of five villages: Nasirabad, Mayoon, Khanabad, Hussainabad and Khizerabad. Among these Nasirabad and Mayoon are old settlements, These two villages used to be the first bastions of defense of Hunza in old times. People from Nasirabad and Mayoon bore the brunt of wars and battles of Hunza with Sikhs, British and other forces in late 19th century. There is a gorge where people of Mayoon wiped out an army of 500 Sikhs in a single night. This area is famous as ‘Sikh Mara Jung’. Colonel Durand got wounded from a gunshot reportedly fired from Mayoon Fort. Incessant engagement with outside threat kept Shinaki people in combative mood all the time. The modern stereotyping of Shinakis as straightforward and aggressive stems from the centuries old tradition. Besides warfare, the region of Hunza Shinaki was famous for its simplicity. The King of Hunza had a special respect for lower Hunza. In the modern era people of these areas are well educated, simple, and financially strong, they contribute their knowledge, wisdom and skills not only in Hunza, but also in Gilgit-Baltistan(fifth newly established province of Pakistan).

Tollackson Mound Group, referred to as 47VE927, is an archeological site located in the town of Harmony, in Vernon County, Wisconsin, United States, that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and expanded in its borders in 1998.
History.
The mounds were built by an Effigy Mound tribe, ancestors of the Oneota, between 500 and 1050 CE. About 950 years ago mound construction stopped, and Effigy Mound people seem to have abandoned most if not all of the interior hill country of western Wisconsin. Archaeologists have suggested that human populations in the region became too large to be supported by wild resources. 
White-tailed deer may have become scarce in the open oak savannas and prairies of western Wisconsin, and the Effigy Mound people might have had too few deer to survive the winters. It is at the end of Effigy Mound time that these people begin to grow corn, suggesting that their needs were no longer met by wild resources.

Forbidden years

Forbidden Years (ru: Заповедные лета) were part of a tightening of the service obligations of serfs in Russia leading to full-scale serfdom in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. They were first instituted by Tsar Ivan IV (r. 1533-1584) in 1581 as a temporary measure, but eventually became permanent.
Under the provisions of Article 57 of the Sudebnik of 1497 promulgated by Grand Prince Ivan III, serfs were permitted to transfer from one estate to another "once a year, during the week before and a week after St. George's Day in the autumn" (November 26, the Feast of the Dedication of the Church of St. George in Kiev) provided they had fulfilled all corvée (barshchina or барщина in Russian) and/or quitrent (obrok or оброк in Russian) obligations and had paid a fee, the "pozhiloe" (пожилое), to the landlord they were leaving. In Ivan IV's Sudebnik of 1550, this right of transfer remained (Article 88), but the "pozhiloe" was increased and a tax (the transition fee or "za povoz" - за повоз) was added.
Due to the hardships brought about by Ivan IV's Livonian War (1558-1582), the excesses of the Oprichnina (1565-1572), Tatar raids (such as the one on Moscow in 1571) and a series of crop failures and other natural disasters, the Tsar temporarily suspended this right of movement or transfer in an ukaz (decree) issued in 1581. This move, in fact, proved permanent, as it was never lifted. His son's government made this limitation permanent in an ukas of September 1, 1597 (thought on November 24 of that year, it made the statute of limitations (called "fixed years" - urochniye leta or урочные лета) on the return of run-away serfs five years). The Ulozhenie of 1649 did away with this statute of limitations, and this is often seen as the final element of full-blown serfdom in Russia.

Although it is culturally and physically similar to the Hebrides, it is separated from them by the Kintyre peninsula. Arran is divided into highland and lowland areas by the Highland Boundary Fault and it has been described as a "geologist's paradise".
Arran has been continuously inhabited since the early Neolithic period, and numerous prehistoric remains have been found. From the 6th century onwards, Goidelic-speaking peoples from Ireland colonised the island and it became a centre of religious activity. During the troubled Viking Age, Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown before becoming formally absorbed by the kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century. The 19th century "clearances" led to significant depopulation and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life.
The economy and population have recovered in recent years, the main industry being tourism. There is diversity of wildlife, including three species of tree endemic to the area.
Etymology.
Most of the islands of Scotland have been occupied by the speakers of at least four languages since the Iron Age, and many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning as a result. Arran is therefore not unusual in that the derivation of the name is far from clear. Mac an Tàilleir (2003) states that "it is said to be unrelated to the name Aran in Ireland" (which means "kidney shaped", cf Irish "ára" "kidney"). Unusually for a Scottish island, Haswell-Smith (2004) offers a Brythonic derivation and a meaning of "high place" which at least corresponds with the geography—Arran is significantly loftier than all the land that immediately surrounds it along the shores of the Firth of Clyde.
Any other Brythonic place names that may have existed were later replaced on Arran as the Goidelic-speaking Gaels spread from Ireland via their adjacent kingdom of Dál Riata. During the Viking Age the island, along with the vast majority of the Scottish islands, became the property of the Norwegian crown, at which time it may have been known as "Herrey" or "Hersey". As a result of this Norse influence, many current place names on Arran are of Viking origin.
Geography and geology.
The island lies in the Firth of Clyde between Ayr and Ardrossan, and Kintyre. The profile of the north Arran hills as seen from the Ayrshire coast is a well-known sight referred to as the "Sleeping Warrior" due to its resemblance to a resting human figure. The highest of these hills is Goat Fell at . There are three other Corbetts, all in the north east: Caisteal Abhail, Cìr Mhòr and Beinn Tarsuinn. Beinn Bharrain is the highest peak in the north west at .
The largest valley on the island is Glen Iorsa to the west, whilst narrow Glen Sannox (Gaelic: "Gleann Shannaig") and Glen Rosa (Gaelic: "Gleann Ròsa") to the east surround Goat Fell. The terrain to the south is less mountainous, although a considerable portion of the interior lies above , and A' Chruach reaches at its summit. There are two other Marilyns in the south, Tighvein and Beinn Bhreac.
Arran is sometimes referred to as "Scotland in miniature", as it is divided into "Highland" and "Lowland" areas by the Highland Boundary Fault which runs northeast to southwest across Scotland. Arran is a popular destination for geologists, who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Mesozoic.
Most of the interior of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial volcanic activity around 60 million years ago in the Paleogene period. There is an older outer ring of coarse granites and an inner core of finer grained material. Sedimentary rocks dominate the southern half of the island, especially Old and New Red Sandstone. Some of these sandstones contain fulgurites - pitted marks that may have been created by Permian lightning strikes. Sand dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick, there are localised outcrops of Triassic rocks and even a rare example of Cretaceous chalk. During the 19th century barytes was mined near Sannox. First discovered in 1840, nearly 5,000 tons were produced between 1853 and 1862. The mine was closed by the 11th Duke of Hamilton on the grounds that it "spoiled the solemn grandeur of the scene" but was reopened after the First World War and operated until 1938 when the vein ran out.
Visiting in 1787, the geologist James Hutton found his first example of an unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza, which provided evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism and about the age of the Earth. This spot is one of the most famous places in the study of geology.
The Pleistocene glaciations almost entirely covered Scotland in ice, and Arran's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time. After the last retreat of the ice at the close of the Pleistocene epoch sea levels were up to lower than at present and it is likely that circa 14,000 BP the island was connected to mainland Scotland. Sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post-glacial coastlines a complex task, but it is evident that the island is ringed by post glacial raised beaches. King's Cave on the south west coast is an example of an emergent landform on such a raised beach. This cave, which is over long and up to high, lies well above the present day sea level. There are tall sea cliffs to the north east including large rock slides under the heights of Torr Reamhar, Torr Meadhonach and at Scriden ("An Scriodan") at the far north end of the island.
Villages.
Arran has several villages, mainly around the shoreline. Brodick (Old Norse: "broad bay") is the site of the ferry terminal, several hotels, and the majority of shops. Brodick Castle is a seat of the Dukes of Hamilton. But Lamlash is the largest village on the island and in 2001 had a population of 1,010 compared to 621 for Brodick. Other villages include Lochranza and Catacol in the north, Corrie in the north east, Blackwaterfoot in the south west, Kildonan in the south and Whiting Bay in the south east.
Surrounding islands.
Arran has three smaller satellite islands: Holy Isle lies to the east opposite Lamlash, Pladda is located off Arran's south coast and tiny Hamilton Isle lies just off Clauchlands Point north of Holy Isle. Eilean na h-Àirde Bàine off the south west of Arran at Corriecravie is a skerry connected to Arran at low tide.
Other islands in the Firth of Clyde include Bute, Great Cumbrae and Inchmarnock.
Climate.
The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging about in January and in July at sea level. The southern half of the island, being less mountainous, has a more favourable climate than the north, and the east coast is more sheltered from the prevailing winds than the west and south.
Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are less frequent than on the mainland. As in most islands of the west coast of Scotland, annual rainfall is generally high at between in the south and west and in the north and east. The mountains are wetter still with the summits receiving over annually. May and June are the sunniest months, with upwards of 200 hours of bright sunshine being recorded on average.
History.
Prehistory.
Arran has a particular concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, which may have been an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: "Am Machaire").
Several Bronze Age sites have been excavated, including "Ossian's Mound" near Clachaig and a cairn near Blackwaterfoot that produced a bronze dagger and a gold fillet. Torr a' Chaisteal Dun in the south west near Sliddery is the ruin of an Iron Age fortified structure dating from about AD 200. The original walls would have been or more thick and enclosed a circular area about in diameter.
Gaels, Vikings and the medieval era.
An ancient Irish poem called "Agalllamh na Senorach", first recorded in the 13th century, describes the attractions of the island.
The monastery of "Aileach" founded by St. Brendan in the 6th century may have been on Arran and St. Molaise was also active, with Holy Isle being a centre of his activities. The caves below Keil Point (Gaelic: "Rubha na Cille") contain a slab which may have been an ancient altar. This stone has two petrosomatoglyphs on it, the prints of two right feet, said to be of Saint Columba.
In the 11th century Arran became part of the Sodor (Old Norse: 'Suðr-eyjar'), or South Isles of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, but on the death of Godred Crovan in 1095 all the isles came under the direct rule of Magnus III of Norway. Lagman (1103–1104) restored local rule. After the death of Somerled in 1164 Arran and Bute were ruled by his son Angus. In 1237, the Scottish isles broke away completely from the Isle of Man and became an independent kingdom. After the indecisive Battle of Largs between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland in 1263, Haakon Haakonsson, King of Norway reclaimed Norwegian lordship over the "provinces" of the west. Arriving at Mull, he rewarded a number of his Norse-Gaelic vassals with grants of lands. Bute was given to Ruadhri and Arran to Murchad MacSween. Following Haakon's death later that year Norway ceded the islands of western Scotland to the Scottish crown in 1266 by the Treaty of Perth. A substantial Viking grave has been discovered near King's Cross south of Lamlash, containing whalebone, iron rivets and nails, fragments of bronze and a 9th-century bronze coin, and another grave of similar date nearby yielded a sword and shield. Arran was also part of the medieval Bishopric of Sodor and Man. 
On the opposite side of the island near Blackwaterfoot is the King's Cave (see above) where Robert the Bruce is said to have taken shelter in the 14th century. Bruce returned to the island in 1326, having earlier granted lands to Fergus MacLouis for assistance rendered during his time of concealment there. Brodick Castle played a prominent part in the island's medieval history. Probably dating from the 13th century, it was captured by English forces during the Wars of Independence before being taken back by Scottish troops in 1307. It was badly damaged by action from English ships in 1406 and sustained an attack by John of Islay, the Lord of the Isles in 1455. Originally a seat of the Clan Stewart of Menteith it passed to the Boyd family in the 15th century. For a short time during the reign of King James V in the 16th century the Isle of Arran was under the regency of Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell.
Modern era.
At the commencement of the Early modern period James, 2nd Lord Hamilton became a privy counsellor to his first cousin, James IV of Scotland and helped to arrange his marriage to Princess Margaret Tudor of England. As a reward he was created Earl of Arran in 1503. The local economy for much of this period was based on the run rig system, the basic crops being oats, barley and potatoes. The population slowly grew to about 6,500. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on the island's population. These "improvements" typically led to land that had been rented out to as many as 27 families being converted into a single farm. In some cases, land was promised in Canada for each adult emigrant male. In April 1829, for example, 86 islanders boarded the brig "Caledonia" for the two-month journey, half their fares being paid for by the Duke. However, on arrival in Quebec only was made available to the heads of extended families. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island devastated. The writer James Hogg wrote: "Ah! Wae's me. I hear the Duke of Hamilton's crofters are a' gaun away, man and mother's son, frae the Isle o' Arran. Pity on us!". A memorial to this has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.
On 10 August 1941 a RAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator LB-30A AM261 was flying from RAF Heathfield in Ayrshire to Gander International Airport in Canada. However, the B-24 crashed into the hillside of Mullach Buidhe north of Goat Fell where all 22 passengers and crew died.
Arran's resident population was 4,629 in 2011, a decline of just over 8% from the figure of 5,045 recorded in 2001 against a background of Scottish island populations as a whole growing by 4% to 103,702 for the same period.
Gaelic.
Gaelic was still spoken widely on Arran at the beginning of the 20th century. The 1901 Census reported 25-49% Gaelic speakers on the eastern side of the island and 50-74% on the western side of the island. By 1921 the percentage for the whole island had dropped to less than 25%. From then onwards, the number of speakers fell into the vague 0-24.9% bracket. However, Nils Holmer quotes the Féillire (a Gaelic almanack) reporting 4,532 inhabitants on the island in 1931 with 605 Gaelic speakers, showing that Gaelic had declined to about 13% of the population. It continued to decline until the last native speakers of Arran Gaelic died in the 1990s. The 1.6% Gaelic speakers in the 1991 Census and the 1.5% in the 2001 Census represent Gaelic speakers from other areas settling on the island.
Arran Gaelic is reasonably well documented. Holmer carried out fieldwork on the island in 1938, reporting Gaelic being spoken by "a fair number of old inhabitants". He interviewed 53 informants from various locations and his description of the dialect, "The Gaelic of Arran", was published in 1957 and runs to 211 pages of phonological, grammatical and lexical information. The "Survey of the Gaelic Dialects of Scotland", which collected Gaelic dialect data in Scotland between 1950 and 1963 also interviewed 5 native speakers of Arran Gaelic.
The Arran dialect falls firmly into the southern group of Gaelic dialects (referred to as the "peripheral" dialects in Celtic studies) and thus shows:
The most unusual feature of Arran Gaelic is the glide after labials before a front vowel, e.g. "maith" 'good' (normally ).
Mac an Tàilleir (2003) notes that the island has a poetic name "Arainn nan Aighean Iomadh" - "Arran of the many stags" and that a native of the island or "Arainneach" is also nicknamed "coinean mòr" in Gaelic, meaning "big rabbit". Locally, "Arainn" was pronounced .
Local government.
From the seventeenth century to the late twentieth century Arran was part of the County of Bute. After the 1975 reorganisation of local government Arran became part of the district of Cunninghame in Strathclyde Region.
This two-tier system of local government lasted until 1996 when the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 came into effect, abolishing the regions and districts and replacing them with 32 unitary authorities. Arran is now in the North Ayrshire council area, along with some of the constituent islands of the old County of Bute.
For some statistical purposes Arran is within the registration county of Ayrshire and for ceremonial purposes within the lieutenancy area of Ayrshire and Arran.
In the House of Commons, since 2005 Arran has been part of the Ayrshire North and Arran constituency, represented by Katy Clark of the Labour Party. It was previously part of the constituency of Cunninghame North from 1983 to 2005, and of Ayrshire North and Bute from 1918 to 1983.
In the Scottish Parliament, Arran is part of the constituency of Cunninghame North, currently represented by Kenneth Gibson of the Scottish National Party (SNP). Labour held the seat until 2007, when the SNP gained it with a majority of just 48, making it the most marginal seat in Holyrood until 2011 when the SNP significantly increased their majority to 6117 over the Labour Party.
Transport.
Arran is connected with the Scottish mainland by two Caledonian MacBrayne ferries, one from Brodick to Ardrossan and the second (in summertime only) from Lochranza to Claonaig. Summer day trips are also available on board the paddle steamer PS "Waverley" and a summertime service operated by a local resident connects Lamlash to the neighbouring Holy Isle.
There are three roads on the island. The long coast road circumnavigates the island. In 2007, a stretch of this road, previously designated as the A841, was de-classified to a 'C' road. Travelling south from Whiting Bay, the C147 goes round the south coast continuing north up the west coast of the island to Lochranza. At this point the road becomes the A841 down the east coast back to Whiting Bay.
At one point the coast road ventures inland, this is to climb the pass at Boguillie between Creag Ghlas Laggan and Caisteal Abhail, located between Sannox and Lochranza.
The other two roads run across from the east to the west side of the island. The main cross-island road is the long B880 from Brodick to Blackwaterfoot called "The String", which climbs over Gleann an t-Suidhe. About along the B880 from Brodick, a minor road branches off to the right to Machrie. The single track road "The Ross" runs from Lamlash to Lagg and Sliddery via Glen Scorodale (Gaelic: "Gleann Sgoradail").
The island can be explored using public transport using a bus service operated by Stagecoach.
Economy.
The main industry of the island is tourism, one of the main attractions being the imposing Brodick Castle, owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The Auchrannie Resort, which contains 2 hotels, 3 restaurants and 2 leisure complexes, is one of biggest employers on the island. Local businesses include the Arran Distillery, which was opened in 1995 in Lochranza, and Arran Aromatics, which produces a range of toiletries. The island has a number of golf courses including the 12 hole Shiskine links course which was founded in 1896.
Farming and forestry are other important industries. 2008 plans for a large salmon farm holding 800,000 or more fish in Lamlash Bay have been criticised by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust. They feared the facility could jeopardise Scotland's first marine No Take Zone, which was announced in September 2008.
The Arran Brewery is a microbrewery founded in March 2000 in Cladach, near Brodick. The brewery produces 8 regular cask and bottled beers. The wheat beer, Arran Blonde (5.0% abv) is the most popular brand and others include Arran Dark and Arran Sunset, with a seasonal ale called Fireside only brewed in winter. The brewery is open for tours, with tastings in the shop. The business went into liquidation in May 2008 and was subsequently sold to Marketing Management Services International Ltd. in June 2008. The brewery is now back in production and the beers widely available in Scotland.
The northern part of Lamlash Bay is now Marine Protected Area and a "no take zone" under the terms of the Marine Act which means that no fish or shellfish may be taken in the designated area.
Culture, media and the arts.
The Scottish Gaelic dialect of Arran died out when the last speaker Donald Craig died in the 1970s. However, there is now a Gaelic House in Brodick, set up at the end of the 1990s. Brodick Castle features on the Royal Bank of Scotland £20 note and Lochranza Castle was used as the model for the castle in "The Adventures of Tintin" adventure "The Black Island".
Arran has one newspaper, "The Arran Banner". It was listed in the Guinness Book of Records in November 1984 under the title of "local newspaper which achieves the closest to a saturation circulation in its area". The entry reads "The Arran Banner, founded in 1974, has a readership of more than 97 per cent in Britain’s seventh largest off-shore island". There is also an online weekly publication called "Voice for Arran" that relies mainly on articles contributed by community members.
In 2010 an "Isle of Arran" version of the game Monopoly was launched.
The knitting style used to create Aran sweaters is often mistakenly associated with the Isle of Arran rather than the Irish Aran Islands.
Natural history.
The island has three endemic species of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These trees are the Scottish or Arran Whitebeam ("Sorbus arranensis"), the Bastard Mountain Ash or Cut-leaved Whitebeam ("Sorbus pseudofennica") and the Catacol Whitebeam ("Sorbus pseudomeinichii"). If rarity is measured by numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, at the north end of the island by a partly fenced off National Nature Reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 "Sorbus pseudofennica" and 283 "Sorbus arranensis" were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close to the tree line. However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.
Over 200 species of bird have been recorded on Arran including Black Guillemot, Eider, Peregrine Falcon and the Golden Eagle. In 1981 there were 28 Ptarmigan on Arran, but in 2009 it was reported that extensive surveys had been unable to record any. Similarly, the Red-billed Chough no longer breeds on the island.
Red Deer are numerous on the northern hills, and there are populations of Red Squirrel, Badger, Otter, Adder and Common Lizard. Offshore there are Harbour Porpoises, Basking Sharks and various species of dolphin.

New Sherwood Hotel

The New Sherwood Hotel is a historic property on the National Register of Historic Places in New Haven, Kentucky, in southernmost Nelson County, Kentucky. It is next door to the Kentucky Railway Museum on U.S. 31E..
The brick, two-story New Sherwood Hotel is one of the few buildings left in New Haven that has any historical integrity; only nine buildings from 1880-1940 remained in New Haven by 1978. It is made of "solid-masonry-brickwall" on top of a limestone foundation. A two-tiered porch was intended for the hotel but never built, but the front facade has a series of iron cleats intended for use with the porches. A private residence for the hotel's owners is in the rear of the ground floor; the kitchen was for use to feed guests and the owners. The hotel rooms featured odd geometric angles and natural sunlight for all rooms. In the bar room there is a "massive" oak and mahogany back-bar and counter that was originally used in Louisville's old Greenstreet Saloon; it was place in New Haven after the nearby town of Boston, Kentucky voted to be a "dry" town.
The New Sherwood Hotel replaced the previous Johnson Hotel/Sherwood Hotel, which burned down in 1913; it was placed on the same property, next to where the major road crossed the train track. The fact that the hotel was of masonry and concrete was to ward against future fires. It was also designed in a manner more fitting for larger cities like Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; not small towns like New Haven. The heyday of the hotel was from when it was built in 1914 to the year 1932, at the height of the Great Depression. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which controlled the track by the New Sherwood Hotel, stopped service to the station in 1954. The owners in 1992 were descendants of the original owner; six Johnsons bought control of the hotel from the other co-owner Johnsons. It was restored for the benefit of visitors to the next door Kentucky Railway Museum.
It was placed on the National Register on March 26, 1992.

<doc id="21387517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21387517" title="Uinyeo">
Uinyeo

Uinyeo (literally "medicine women") were female physicians who specialized in the treatment of women during the Joseon Dynasty (1392 – 1910) of Korea. The uinyeo were established as a solution to social taboos against women receiving treatment from male physicians. The "uinyeo" system first appeared in 1406 after King Taejong ordered its establishment within the "Jesaengwon" (濟生院 health care centers for commoners).
Establishment.
The proposal for establishing Uinyeo originated with Heo Do (許道), a government officer who held the title of "Jijesaengwonsa" (知濟生院事). He suggested to the king that a number of intelligent young women should receive medical training to treat women. Although the uinyeo system started to practise medicine, it was deeply related to a Korean traditional custom at the time. The Joseon Dynasty was a strict Confucian state that strengthened the distinction between the sexes which was called "naeoe" (內外; sex segregation). Therefore there were many cases in which female patients died without receiving proper treatment because they felt ashamed of being examined by a male doctor. On the other hand, "jungin" (middle-class people) and "sangmin" (commoners) did not want to become a "uinyeo" for the custom, so young girls who belonged to stores and offices in the palace as slaves were trained in medicine for this purpose.
Medical training and practice.
The "Jesaengwon" chose "uinyeo" and taught Maijing (脈經; Pulse Classic) and the practice of acupuncture and moxibustion.
In July 1434, the 16th year of Sejong the Great's reign, the government gave "uninyeo" of "Jesaengwon" a stipend of rice twice a year as an incentive, based upon precedents of payments to female slaves. In February 1498, the 9th year of the King Seongjong, Yejo (Ministry of Rites) revised six clauses of law to codify a system that divided "uinyeo" into the three grades: "naeuinyeo" (inner uineyo), "ganbyeong uinyeo" (nursing uinyeo) and "chohak uinyeo" (beginner uinyeo) according to their educational grade.
According to records of the "Sokdaejeon" (續大典, "Supplement to the Nation code") "uinyeo" were generally divided into two types; "naeguk yeoui" (內局女醫, female physicians at "naeuiwon") or called "naeuinyeo" and "hyeminseo yeoui" (惠民署女醫, female physicians at "hyeminseo"). The distinction was made to encourage "uinyeo" since King Yeongjo's reign and had lasted until the end of the Joseon Dynasty. While "naeuinyeo" worked within the palace, the other group of "uinyeo" worked for "hyeminseo", the state-sponsored health clinics located in certain areas of the country.
Mobilization as entertainers.
In the end of King Seongjong's reign, while "uinyeo" were sent to attend parties and feasts held for official and private occasions, they were not invited along with "gisaeng" (female entertainers). King Yeonsangun, however, was a tyrant ruler known for enjoying parties changed this practice. In June 1502, the king's 8th year, "uinyeo" were sent to families who were holding a wedding to investigate marriage presents on the day that the family sent the dowry. The rationale for the investigation was that the rich people at that time wasted money for too luxurious wedding items. From that time onward, whenever a feast was held, "uinyeo" participated openly together with "gisaeng", sitting on stone steps to the present of the king. They also began to learn music in addition to medicine. 
When the successor, King Jungjong ascended to the throne, "uinyeo" still served as "uigi" (medical entertainer) at court officers' parties. After 1510, the fifth year of the King's reign, the government prohibited "uinyeo" from attending parties by law several times, and forced them to go back to their original mission in medicine. In spite of this effort, the once strict morality was not rectified, and "uinyeo" still attended parties. At feasts, "uinyeo" who worked at "naeuiwon" (royal health clinic) wore a "garima" (a kind of crown) made with a black silk, while "gisaeng" wore a black "po" on their head. As "uinyeo" who belonged to "hyeminseo" (clinics for the public) were called ""yakbang gisaeng"" (entertainers of the medicine room) and regarded the first rated entertainers over other female official entertainers assigned to government offices.
Due to their lowborn origin, "uinyeo" did not gain the same social status as male doctors and barely retained their existence as a group of the lowest class of society.

Carl Robert Brown

Carl Robert Brown (November 26, 1930 – August 20, 1982) was an American teacher and mass murderer who killed eight people and injured another three with a shotgun in a Miami, Florida welding shop on August 20, 1982. He was later fatally shot and run down by two witnesses, when cycling away from the crime scene.
Biography.
Brown was born on November 26, 1930. He joined the Navy and was honorably discharged in 1954. People later stated that Brown always kept a military bearing about himself and was quite militaristic. In 1955 he moved from Chicago to Florida, where he graduated from the University of Miami in 1957 and in 1964 from East Carolina College in Greenville, North Carolina, earning a Master's degree in education. After working briefly for Keyes Realty he got a full-time job as history teacher at Hialeah Junior High School in 1962 and moonlighted at Miami-Dade Community College as an accounting instructor from 1964 to 1970.
Brown was married twice and had three children. His first wife died and his second marriage failed, according to his second wife, Sylvia, because he refused to seek psychological help. As a consequence his condition began to deteriorate, resulting in an increasingly disheveled and gaunt appearance, and, though once being a rather gregarious person, he began isolating himself more and more. A neighbor later described him looking "as if he were 80 years old". Reportedly one of his daughters once tried to have him hospitalized, though as his admission had to be voluntary her request was declined. Additionally his career began to suffer. Due to problems at Hialeah Junior High, Brown, who was well-known as a bigot and blatant racist who hated everyone, was transferred to Drew Middle School, a school with a black majority, in 1981. There he taught American history until March 3, 1982 when he was relieved of his teaching duties for medical leave to treat his psychiatric problems.
Though neighbors described Brown as a quiet, kind and helpful man, who was working hard to keep his duplex neat and clean, and praising him overall as a landlord, it was also said that he made a habit of walking into other peoples yards early in the morning, waking them by yelling "United States!" and that during the night shots were heard from his house. It was also reported that he once broke a window when firing a pellet gun, and picked grapefruits from a neighbor's tree wearing only his underwear. Apparently he also collected aluminum cans.
After a trip abroad, which he had taken shortly before the shooting, he came back in worse shape than before and stated that nothing in the United States stood for anything.
School problems.
While Brown wrote in his application for a job as a teacher in 1961 that he "always enjoyed being with younger people" and felt that he "could benefit these younger people with his abilities", his work began to suffer as his psychological problems aggravated over the years. Being seen as a competent teacher for a long time, more and more complaints were filed against him as his condition worsened. Students began to refuse to sit in his class as he rambled incoherently about his personal problems and topics unrelated to his curriculum and conducted confusing conversations where he stringed together completely unrelated things. Students would often take advantage of this by asking him a question that resulted in him talking for the rest of the period. On one occasion, on May 5, 1977, Brown sent three girls to detention because they refused to sit in his class, as they were "sick and tired of hearing him talk." He was also known to be very prejudiced, to make threatening remarks, and to insult people of other races.
During his time at Hialeah Junior High, Brown wrote a letter to the principal for "the enlightenment of the assistant principals" discussing the misbehavior of his students in rambling and poorly constructed sentences. "I don't read the students their rights as infants, you all do. (...) If you ever study business law, until a child is 18, the child can do just about anything the child desires to do and get away with the abuse. Any adult interfering, is accountable as an adult, but with infancy laws, the child is a child."
In the summer of 1981 Brown was transferred to Drew Middle School. There, on December 3, he had a dispute with two students, who he accused of throwing books. During the argument Brown described his sexual behavior with a girlfriend and chased the boys with a stapler. The School Board's director of personnel control, Pat Gray, described this as "a classroom incident (...) wherein Mr. Brown demonstrated a significant lack of adult judgment, an overtone of sexual fixation, and definitive aggression toward students." The school's principal wrote: "I found Mr. Brown to be incoherent and unable to grasp the severity of the situation at hand. I, also, fear for the safety of the students since during my conference with Mr. Brown he demonstrated no regret for his actions pointing to the fact that he is a 'man' and any man would have reacted in the same manner."
Principal Octavio Visiedo wrote in his last evaluation of Brown: "I find Mr. Brown to be a negative force. Today I did a follow-up observation of Mr. Brown's second-period class and I continue to be alarmed about the potential for disaster in that class. As you can see, from today's observation, there is absolutely no discipline or control in that class and I am concerned for the safety of the students and also Mr. Brown." Further, he stated that Brown's class was in "total and complete chaos", with students talking constantly, wandering about at will, and leaving without permission.
Brown reacted by writing a response in which he suggested that the principal "should seek the help" of the School Board's employee assistance program, to which he himself was referred to in January 1982.
Psychiatrist Dr. Robert A. Wainger examined Brown, saying that "Mr. Brown is suffering from rather severe anxiety associated with some paranoid and grandiose ideas" and that he also "demonstrates a probable thinking disorder". Though Wainger wrote that these symptoms would affect Brown's work, he was also of the opinion that he would be able to continue teaching if given psychotherapy and medication. Wainger also wrote that "although he may appear to be rather unusual and disorganized to the people around him, he (Brown) does not represent a danger to either.
After his examination, Brown wrote to Wainger: "I wish to thank you for the very interesting and informative meeting I experienced yesterday. Please stress blood analysis, heart cartograph and urine plus the other mental health features of your program." Finally, on March 3, Brown was relieved of his duties to seek psychiatric help and he agreed to seek further treatment from Wainger, though in a meeting with Pat Gray, Brown apparently said: "Wainger wants to study me, that's all. I can cure Dr. Wainger. I will treat him. I will change his seeds."
According to his former wife, Sylvia, Brown asked to return to work two days prior to the shooting, but his psychiatrist, who later stated that Brown showed no aggressiveness at that time, declined his request.
The shooting.
On August 19, the day before the shooting, Brown had a heated argument with Jorge Castalleda, an employee at "Bob Moore's Welding & Machine Service Inc.", about a $20 bill for repairing a lawnmower motor he wanted to use to power his bicycle, saying the work was poorly done. He was also angry, because his traveler's check was refused. Realizing that his complaints were of no avail, Brown left the shop, stating that he would come in and kill everybody; no one took him seriously.
Early the next day Brown went to a gun store a few blocks from his home in Hialeah and purchased two shotguns, a semi-automatic rifle and ammunition. An hour before starting his rampage, Brown invited his 10-year old son to join him in "killing a lot of people" telling that the final destination would be Hialeah Junior High School.
Shortly before 11:00 a.m. he arrived at the welding shop on his cycle, wearing a Panama hat and having one of the shotguns, which was variously identified as a 12 gauge Mosberg 500 Persuader or an Ithaca 37 with pistol grip, slung over his shoulder. He entered the shop through a side door and began shooting, saying that he would send everybody to Germany. According to police Brown walked through the building, methodically shooting everyone, most of the time at close range and sometimes twice, leaving three victims in the office and others in the work area and the driveway in front of the shop. In the end six of the eleven employees present lay dead and two more dying, while three who were injured managed to escape and jump into the car of a passing motorist, who brought them to a gasoline station a mile away and called for help. When his gun was emptied Carl Brown stepped out of the store, reloaded and reentered to shoot two more times, before leaving for good and cycling away, apparently towards Hialeah Junior High School. According to a witness Brown "looked very passive and very nonchalant" and "wasn't trying to escape, just strictly leaving the crime scene." Another witness put it this way: "He got on his bike and pedaled off as if he was going for a stroll on North River Drive."
When Mark Kram, an employee at a nearby metal shop, was told of the massacre, he grabbed a .38 revolver and set out to pursue the shooter in his car. Down the street he picked up Ernest Hammett, who was trying to flag down cars, and together they tried to get hold of the perpetrator. Six blocks away from the crime scene, near Miami International Airport, they caught up with Brown and Kram, according to himself, fired a warning shot "over his (Brown's) head", though the bullet hit Brown in the back and later proved to be the cause of his death. When Brown turned in his saddle, aiming at his pursuers with his shotgun, they ran him over, crashing him into a concrete light pole. Brown, who still had 20 shells in his pockets, died shortly afterward.
Aftermath.
Following the shooting Robert Steelman, whose wife Martha was among the dead, filed lawsuits against the Garcia Gun Center, where Brown had purchased his weapons, and the Ithaca Gun Company, the manufacturer of the shotgun used by Brown in his rampage.
Police found a cassette tape in Brown's house, where he called himself "Logos", a mythical figure he considered to be the controlling principle of the universe - "This is the Logos speaking. God through me is responsible for the good and bad sounds in your head." "Now I shall say a few good words in your head before I return you to the bad sounds in your head ... The Logos is the spark of God, the most logical. I am indestructable on Earth." No charges were filed against Kram.

Colonsay

Colonsay () is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, located north of Islay and south of Mull. The ancestral home of Clan Macfie and the Colonsay branch of Clan MacNeil, it is in the council area of Argyll and Bute and has an area of . Aligned on a south-west to north-east axis, it measures in length and reaches at its widest point.
Geography and geology.
Although Colonsay appears bare and somewhat forbidding on approach from the sea, its landscape is varied, with some sandy beaches, and a sheltered and fertile interior. It is linked by a tidal causeway (called The Strand) to Oronsay.
The Colonsay Group, which takes its name from the island, is an estimated 5,000 m thick sequence of mildy metamorphosed Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks that also outcrop on the islands of Islay and Oronsay and the surrounding seabed. The sequence has been correlated with the Grampian Group, the oldest part of the Dalradian Supergroup.
History.
Mesolithic food industry.
In 1995 evidence of large-scale Mesolithic nut shelling, some 9000 years ago, was found in a midden pit at Staosnaig on the island's sheltered east coast, in a large, shallow pit full of the remains of hundreds of thousands of burned hazelnut shells. Hazelnuts have been found on other Mesolithic sites, but rarely in such quantities or concentrated in one pit. The nuts were radiocarbon dated to 7720+/-110BP, which calibrates to circa 7000 BC. Similar sites in Britain and its dependencies are known only at Farnham in Surrey and Cass ny Hawin on the Isle of Man.
This discovery gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning of the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests that Colonsay's inhabitants were largely vegetarian Citation needed. The pit was originally on a beach close to the shore, and there were two smaller stone-lined pits, whose function remains obscure, a hearth, and a second cluster of pits.
Early history.
There are a variety of ruined hill forts on the island such as Dùn Cholla and Dùn Meadhonach. The eighth century Riasg Buidhe Cross has been re-erected in the gardens of Colonsay House. St Cathan's Chapel may date from the 14th century. The ruins of the Chapel of St. Mary are little more than foundations and may date to an even earlier period. in 1549 Dean Monro wrote that Colonsay was "seven myle lange from the northeist to the southwest, with twa myle bredthe, ane fertile ile guid for quhit fishing. It hath ane paroch kirke. This ile is bruikit be ane gentle capitane, callit M’Duffyhe, and pertened of auld to Clandonald of Kyntyre.
Ownership.
During the 18th century the lairds of the island were Macneils, and included Archibald Macneil. Colonsay House was first built by the Mcneil family in 1722. Since 1904 the house has been the property of the island's later owners, the Barons Strathcona. Colonsay is owned by Donald Howard, 4th Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal and Colonsay House is currently occupied by his eldest son, Alexander Howard and his family.
In 2013 Alexander Howard infuriated island ­residents, by accusing them of removing gravel from a beach without permission. Locals said that innocent people had been labelled "thieves" and "peasants". Howard later admitted the problem had been caused by builders from the mainland but failed to offer an apology to islanders.
Present day.
The island's population was 144 as recorded by the 2011 census an increase of nearly 15% since 2001 when there were 108 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. Colonsay's main settlement is Scalasaig (Gaelic: Sgalasaig) on the east coast, from where ferries sail to Oban and, between April and October, to Kennacraig via Port Askaig on Islay. 
Recently there has been a growth of tourism as the mainstay of the island's economy, with numerous holiday cottages, many of them owned and managed by the Isle of Colonsay Estate. The Colonsay Hotel, the only hotel on the island, is also estate owned.
The island has a tiny bookshop specialising in books of local interest; it is also the home of the House of Lochar publishing company specialising in Scottish history. There is a hotel overlooking the harbour, a cafe and bakery, and a shop and post office. In 2006 the former grass airstrip was upgraded and provided with a hard surface, in readiness for the introduction of a scheduled air service from Oban (Connel). This service began operating in June 2008 with morning and evening flights on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The service is provided by Hebridean Air Services
Colonsay Community Development Company, the local development trust is “engaged in a range of work which reflects a sustainable approach to the regeneration of our island”. Current projects include running the islands coal supply and only petrol pump, a major "Rhododendron ponticum" eradication programme and a feasibility study into the possibility of improving the harbour and surrounding area.
2007 saw the opening of the Colonsay Brewery, a micro-brewery offering three different products. Colonsay is the smallest island in the world with its own brewery. The business employs two people, roughly ten per cent of the island workforce.
The nature of island life was exemplified by a story reported in 1993 that, at that time, the last recorded crime was treachery against the King in 1623. In November 2006 a construction worker from Glasgow was arrested and confessed to theft by housebreaking having entered an unlocked house and stolen £60 in cash. Media interest was stirred when it was reported that this was the first recorded crime since 2004 and the "first ever theft from a house". The next reported crime was in 2013 involving vandalism to a car.
Colonsay may be the smallest island ever to host a rugby festival, all the more remarkable as there is no permanent rugby pitch.
The arts.
The 1945 film "I Know Where I'm Going!" directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger was principally shot on Mull and references the fictional "Isle of Kiloran", which was based on Colonsay. The American author John McPhee, descended from a Colonsay emigrant, spent a summer on Colonsay, out of which was published "The Crofter and the Laird" in 1969.
In 2008, Colonsay hosted the first ever "Ceòl Cholasa", the island's own folk festival. This has now become an annual event and has seen performances by numerous well-known artists including Phil Cunningham & Aly Bain, Karen Matheson, Gaberlunzie and Karine Polwart as well as performances from local island musicians.
Since 2011 the island has held a three week "Festival of Spring" annually in May. Its aim is to encourage tourism onto the island, with events and activities led by both local inhabitants and visiting guest "speakers/experts".
In 2012 the island staged its first book festival which featured, amongst others, Alexander McCall Smith, James Robertson, and Scots Makar Liz Lochhead. The line up for 2013 is to be headed by crime writer Ian Rankin.
Wildlife.
The island is home to a herd of wild goats, and is known for its bird life including Black-legged Kittiwake, Cormorant, Guillemot, Corncrake and Golden Eagle. 
Colonsay and Oronsay are home to about 50 colonies of the only native species of honeybee in Britain–"Apis mellifera mellifera". The Scottish Government introduced the Bee Keeping (Colonsay and Oronsay) Order 2013 to protect the species from cross-breeding and disease. This bee has suffered serious declines on the mainland and from 1 January 2014 it will be an offence to keep any other species of honeybee on either island. Paul Wheelhouse MSP said: "The order is a targeted measure to protect an important population of black bees on Colonsay from hybridisation with non-native bees. We are working in close collaboration with the Scottish Beekeepers Association and Bee Farmers Association to deliver the ten-year Honeybee Health Strategy, which aims to achieve a sustainable and healthy population of honeybees for pollination and honey production in Scotland."
Etymology.
Colonsay's name derives from Old Norse and means "Kolbein's island" (although Haswell-Smith offers "Columba's island"). In the 14th century the name was recorded as Coluynsay and by Dean Monro in the 16th century as Colvansay. The modern Gaelic is "Colbhasa". Scalasaig also has a Norse derivation and means "Skali's bay".

Jura, Scotland

Jura ( ; ) is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, adjacent and to the north-east of Islay. Compared with its fertile and more populous neighbour, Jura is mountainous, bare and infertile, covered largely by vast areas of blanket bog, hence its small population. In a list of the islands of Scotland ranked by size, Jura comes eighth, whereas ranked by population it comes thirty-first. It is in the council area of Argyll and Bute.
History.
Evidence of settlements on Jura dating from the Mesolithic period was first uncovered by the English archaeologist John Mercer in the 1960s. There is evidence of Neolithic settlement at Poll a' Cheo in the southwest of the island. The modern name "Jura" dates from the Norse-Gael era and is from the Old Norse "Dyrøy" meaning "beast animal island".
In the sixth century, it is believed that Jura may have been the location of Hinba, the island to which the Irish founder of the Christian Church in Scotland Saint Columba retreated for prayer and contemplation from the monastic community which he founded on Iona.
The Vikings.
The Viking occupation of the Hebrides began in the ninth century, and was formalised when sovereignty was secured in 1098. From this point, Norse rule continued until 1266, when the Hebrides, together with Kintyre and the Isle of Man, were ceded to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth. A key figure during the Norse period was the warlord Somerled, whose descendants, for around 150 years from the mid-fourteenth century, styled themselves Lords of the Isles.
The Lords of the Isles.
The Lordship of the Isles was dominated by Clan Donald, whose seat was at Finlaggan on Islay. The Lordship came to an end in 1493, but Clan Donald continued to rule the southern part of Jura, through the MacDonalds of Dunnyveg. The north of the island, however, was owned by this time by Clan Maclean, whose seat was at Aros Castle in Glengarrisdale. In 1647, this was to be the site of a notable battle between the Macleans and the Campbells of Craignish. For many years in the twentieth century, a human skull stood on a ledge in a nearby cave, and it was traditionally said to have been the remains of a Maclean who had been killed in this battle. The skull is no longer there, but the latest editions of Ordnance Survey maps still mark the location as 'Maclean's Skull Cave'.
The Campbells.
The demise of the Lords of the Isles at the end of the fifteenth century was shortly followed in 1506 by the Treaty of Camas an Staca, which removed MacDonald rights on Jura and gave them to the Campbells. Despite this, the sixteenth century was a period of skirmishing between the warring clans: McDonalds, Campbells, MacLeans and others. Then in 1607 the Campbells finally bought the island from the MacDonalds. This was the beginning of some three hundred years during which the island was ruled and largely owned by eleven successive Campbell lairds. The north of the island, however, remained in MacLean hands until 1737, when it was sold to Donald MacNeil of Colonsay.
Emigration.
From the mid-eighteenth century, long before the notorious Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century, there were a number of waves of emigration from Jura. In 1767, fifty people left Jura for Canada, and from that point the population gradually shrank from over a thousand to its twentieth century level of just a few hundred. Mercer notes that although relatively few forced clearances were recorded as taking place on Jura, the emigrations were far from voluntary, and were the result of factors such as hunger and spiralling rents.
Recent and Current Ownership.
During the first half of the twentieth century the Campbells gradually sold the island as a number of separate estates, and the Campbell connection with Jura ended in 1938 with the sale of Jura House and the Ardfin Estate. There are now seven estates on Jura, all in separate ownership: Ardfin, Inver, Jura Forest, Tarbert, Ruantallain, Ardlussa, and Barnhill. There is also a relatively small area owned by Forestry Commission Scotland.
The Ardfin Estate is situated at the southern tip of the island, between Feolin and Craighouse. For some seventy years from 1938, Ardfin belonged to the Riley-Smith family, brewers from Tadcaster in Yorkshire. In 2010 the estate was bought by Greg Coffey, an Australian hedge-fund manager. and since then the famous walled garden of Jura House, which had previously been a popular tourist attraction, has been closed to the public. However, Mr Coffey submitted proposals for the construction of an 18-hole golf course on the estate, and the proposal received planning consent from Argyll and Bute Council in May 2014.
North of Ardfin, and flanking the Paps of Jura, lie the estates of Forest and Inver. Forest Estate, on the east side of the Paps, belongs to Samuel, 3rd Baron Vestey, Chairman of the food and farming business Vestey Group Ltd, and Master of the Horse of the Royal Household. Below the west slopes of the Paps lies Inver Estate, which belongs to Sir William Lithgow, Vice-Chairman of the Glasgow shipbuilding group Lithgows.
North of the Corran River, and stretching as far as Loch Tarbert, is the Tarbert Estate. Prime Minister David Cameron has visited the estate on several occasions. It is sometimes reported that the 20,000-acre estate is "owned by his wife's stepfather Lord Astor" although the ownership of the Tarbert Estate is in the hands of Ginge Manor Estates Ltd based in Nassau in The Bahamas and there is "no means of verifying" who the beneficial owners are. North of Loch Tarbert is Ruantallain, which was created when the northern half of the Tarbert Estate was sold off in 1984. It is owned by businessman Lindsay Bury, who is a former president of the influential wildlife charity Flora and Fauna International. The north of Jura belongs to two members of the Fletcher family. The owner of Ardlussa is Andrew Fletcher, who lives at Ardlussa House with his family - they are the only estate owners to be permanently resident on Jura. And at the northernmost tip of Jura, overlooking the famous Corryvreckan Whirlpool is the Barnhill Estate, which is owned by Jamie Fletcher.
Geography.
With an area of 36,692 hectares, or , and only 196 inhabitants recorded in the 2011 census, Jura is much less densely populated than neighbouring Islay and is one of the least densely populated islands of Scotland. Census records show that Jura's population peaked at 1,312 in 1831, and that, in common with many areas of western Scotland, the island's population declined steadily over the ensuing decades. However, there has been a small increase since 2001. During the same decade Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. Alongside the long-term decline in Jura's population has been a decline in the number of Gaelic speakers. The 1881 census reported that 86.6% (out of 946 inhabitants) spoke Gaelic. In 1961, for the first time less than half (46.9%) spoke the language and by 2001, this figure had dropped to 10.6%.
The main settlement is the village of Craighouse on the east coast. Craighouse is home to the Jura distillery, producing Isle of Jura single malt whisky. The village is also home to the island's only hotel, shop and church.
Between the northern tip of Jura and the island of Scarba lies the Gulf of Corryvreckan where a whirlpool makes passage dangerous at certain states of the tide. The southern part of the island, from Loch Tarbert southwards, is one of 40 National Scenic Areas in Scotland.
Geology.
The isle of Jura is composed largely of Dalradian quartzite, a hard metamorphic rock which provides the jagged surface of the Paps. Throughout the western half of the island the quartzite has been penetrated by a number of linear basalt dikes which were formed during a period of intense volcanic activity in the Lower Tertiary period, some 56 million years ago. These dikes are most apparent on the west coast where erosion of the less-resistant rock into which they are intruded has left them exposed as natural walls. The west coast is also home to a number of raised beaches, which are regarded as a geological feature of international importance.
Economy.
In an economic survey published in 2005 by the now-defunct Feolin Study Centre on Jura, the gross turnover of the island was estimated to be just over £3.2 million. This figure covered production and services only, and took no account of public expenditure by government or local authority. In terms of financial size, the Jura distillery was the largest, and it was also the biggest individual employer, but the island's seven estates, taken together, employed the most full and part-time staff. The distillery is owned by Whyte and Mackay, which since 2007 has been part of the United Breweries Group of India, so very little of its considerable profits remain on Jura. The estates provide deer stalking and other field sports, together with forestry and a diminishing amount of agriculture. Tourism is the only other significant area of economic activity, and in 2005 over 20% of the island population was directly or indirectly employed in the tourist industry. The distillery, field sports and Jura House Gardens were listed as the main tourist attractions, although the gardens have since been closed to the public.
Jura Development Trust have purchased the island's only shop and are exploring renewable energy options.
Transport.
Jura lies close to the UK mainland, and yet it is often described as 'remote', and the island's most distinguished resident, George Orwell, famously described it as 'extremely ungetatable. This may be because it has no direct air or ferry link to the mainland, apart from a seasonal passenger ferry service which runs (in the summer only) from the village of Tayvallich near Lochgilphead. Most travellers to Jura go by CalMac car ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula to Islay, and then cross to Jura from Port Askaig on Islay by the MV Eilean Dhiura, a small vehicle ferry which is run by ASP Ships on behalf of Argyll and Bute Council. Islay can also be reached by air: Islay Airport is served by daily flights from Glasgow.
Jura has only one road of any significance, the single-track A846, which follows the southern and eastern coastline of the island from Feolin Ferry to Craighouse, a distance of around eight miles. The road then continues to Lagg, Tarbert, Ardlussa and beyond. A private track runs from the road end to the far north of the island. A local bus service on the island is operated by Garelochhead Coaches.
Wildlife.
The island has a large population of red deer and it is commonly believed that the name Jura is derived from "hjǫrtr", the Old Norse word for deer. (In Old Norse "dýr" was a euphemism for "hjǫrtr", as this was a sacred and tabooed word.) Through browsing, the deer prevent the vegetation on the island from turning back to woodland, which is the natural climax community; indeed an alternative explanation of the island's name is that it derives from 'the great quantity of yew trees which grew in the island' in earlier times.
Jura is also noted for its bird life, and especially for its raptors, including buzzards, golden eagles, white-tailed eagles and hen harriers. Since 2010 Jura has been designated by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Special Protection Area for golden eagles. Like many other parts of the Hebrides and western Scotland, the shores of Jura are frequented by grey seals, and the elusive otter is also relatively common here, as is the adder, the UK's only venomous snake.

The island is dominated by three steep-sided conical quartzite mountains on its western side – the Paps of Jura – which rise to . There are three major peaks:
The Paps dominate the landscape in the region and can be seen from the Mull of Kintyre and, on a clear day, Skye and Northern Ireland. The route of the annual Isle of Jura Fell Race includes all three Paps and four other hills.
These hills were the subject of William McTaggart's 1902 masterpiece "The Paps of Jura", now displayed in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
Writers on Jura.
In 1549, Donald Monro, Dean of the Isles wrote that the island was "ane ather fyne forrest for deire, inhabit and manurit at the coist syde", with "fresche water Loches, with meikell of profit" and an abundance of salmon. However, when the soldier and military historian Sir James Turner visited Jura in 1632, he was less impressed, reporting that 'is a horride ile and a habitation fit for deere and wild beastes'. But at the end of the seventeenth century, the writer and traveller Martin Martin went there and concluded that 'this isle is perhaps the wholesomest plot of ground either in the isles or continent of Scotland, as appears by the long life of the natives and their state of health'. Martin noted some extraordinary examples of longevity, including one Gillouir MacCrain, who was alleged to have kept one hundred and eighty Christmasses in his own house. And he was impressed by the good health of the inhabitants: 'There is no epidemical disease that prevails here. Fevers are but seldom observed by the natives, and any kind of flux is rare. The gout and agues are not so much as known by them, neither are they liable to sciatica. Convulsions, vapours, palsies, surfeits, lethargies, megrims, consumptions, rickets, pains of the stomach, or coughs, are not frequent here, and none of them are at any time observed to become mad.'
Culture.
Like all inhabited Hebridean islands, Jura has its own indigenous tradition of Gaelic song and poetry. Since 1993 it has also been the home to the Jura Music Festival, which takes place annually in September.
Towards the north end of Jura, some miles beyond the end of the metalled road, is Barnhill, a remote house where the novelist George Orwell spent much of the last three years of his life. Orwell was known to the residents of Jura by his real name, Eric Blair. It was at Barnhill that Orwell finished "Nineteen Eighty-Four", during 1947–48 while critically ill with tuberculosis. He sent the final typescript to his publishers, Secker and Warburg, on 4 December 1948, who published the book on 8 June 1949.
Jura is also known for an event that took place on 23 August 1994, when Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, known then as the music group The KLF, filmed themselves burning £1 million in banknotes in the Ardfin boathouse on the south coast of the island.
Jura is featured in the plot of the 2003 novel "A Question of Blood" by Ian Rankin, the 2007 novel "The Careful Use of Compliments" by the Scottish writer Alexander McCall Smith and is a setting for some of the narrative and action in Anne Michaels' 2008 novel "The Winter Vault".
In music, Jura is mentioned in: "Crossing to Jura", a song by R. Kennedy and D. MacDonald, recorded in 1997 by JCB with Jerry Holland on the album "A Trip to Cape Breton"; "The Bens of Jura", a song by Capercaillie; and "Isle of Jura", a song by Skyclad.
The 2010 album "Poets and Lighthouses" by Tuvan singer Albert Kuvezin of the band Yat Kha was recorded and produced by the British musician Giles Perring on Jura, with some of the performances being recorded in the forest at Lagg. The album reached Number 1 in the European World Music Charts in January 2011.

Willie Cole

Willie Cole (b. Newark, New Jersey, 1955) is a noted contemporary American sculptor and conceptual and visual artist.
Art.
Cole is best known for assembling and transforming ordinary domestic and used objects such as irons, ironing boards, high-heeled shoes, hair dryers, bicycle parts, wooden matches, lawn jockeys, and other discarded appliances and hardware, into imaginative and powerful works of art and installations.
Through the repetitive use of single objects in multiples, Cole’s assembled sculptures acquire a transcending and renewed metaphorical meaning, or become a critique of our consumer culture. Cole’s work is generally discussed in the context of postmodern eclecticism, combining references and appropriation ranging from African and African-American imagery, to Dada’s readymades and Surrealism’s transformed objects, and icons of American pop culture or African and Asian masks, into highly original and witty assemblages. Some of Cole’s interactive installations also draw on simple game board structures that include the element of chance while physically engaging the viewer.
Cole’s widely recurring symbolic and artistic object that was initially brought to the attention of the art world in the mid-1980s has been the steam iron. While Cole’s unique approach of imprinting the steam iron’s marks on a variety of media result in a wide-ranging decorative potential of his scorchings, these scorches are also to be viewed as a reference to Cole’s African-American heritage.
Life.
Willie Cole grew up in Newark, New Jersey. He attended the Boston University School of Fine Arts, received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1976, and continued his studies at the Art Students League of New York from 1976 to 1979.
Willie Cole is the recipient of many awards, including the 2006 Winner of the David C. Driskell Prize, the first national award to honor and celebrate contributions to the field of African-American art and art history, established by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. Cole is represented by Alexander and Bonin Gallery in New York; and by Guido Maus, beta pictoris gallery / Maus Contemporary in Birmingham, AL.

Islay

Islay ( ; , ), is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Known as "The Queen of the Hebrides", it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around north of the Irish coast. The island's capital and largest settlement is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located. Port Ellen is the main port.
Islay is the fifth-largest Scottish island and the seventh-largest island surrounding Great Britain, with a total area of almost . There is ample evidence of the prehistoric settlement of Islay and the first written reference may have come in the 1st century AD. The island had become part of the Gaelic Kingdom of Dál Riata during the Early Middle Ages before being absorbed into the Norse Kingdom of the Isles. The later medieval period marked a "cultural high point" with the transfer of the Hebrides to the Kingdom of Scotland and the emergence of the Clan Donald Lordship of the Isles, originally centred at Finlaggan. During the 17th century the Clan Donald star waned, but improvements to agriculture and transport led to a rising population, which peaked in the mid-19th century. This was followed by substantial forced displacements and declining resident numbers.
Today, it has over 3,000 inhabitants and the main commercial activities are agriculture, malt whisky distillation and tourism. The island has a long history of religious observance and Scottish Gaelic is spoken by about a quarter of the population. Its landscapes have been celebrated through various art forms and there is a growing interest in renewable energy. Islay is home to many bird species such as the wintering populations of Greenland White-fronted and Barnacle Goose, and is a popular destination throughout the year for birdwatchers. The climate is mild and ameliorated by the Gulf Stream.
Geography.
Islay is long from north to south and some broad. The east coast is rugged and mountainous, rising steeply from the Sound of Islay, the highest peak being Beinn Bheigier, which is a Marilyn at 1,612 feet (491 m). The western peninsulas are separated from the main bulk of the island by the waters of Loch Indaal to the south and Loch Gruinart to the north. The fertile and windswept south western arm is called The Rinns, and Ardnave Point is a conspicuous promontory on the northwest coast. The south coast is sheltered from the prevailing winds and, as a result, relatively wooded. The fractal coast has numerous bays and sea lochs, including Loch an t-Sailein, Aros Bay and Claggain Bay. In the far south-west is a rocky and now largely uninhabited peninsula called The Oa, the closest point in the Hebrides to Ireland.
The island's population is mainly centred around the villages of Bowmore and Port Ellen. Other smaller villages include Bridgend, Ballygrant, Port Charlotte, Portnahaven and Port Askaig. The rest of the island is sparsely populated and mainly agricultural. There are several small freshwater lochs in the interior including Loch Finlaggan, Loch Ballygrant, Loch Lossit and Loch Gorm and numerous burns throughout the island, many of which bear the name "river" despite their small size. The most significant of these are the River Laggan which discharges into the sea at the north end of Laggan Bay and the River Sorn which, draining Loch Finlaggan, enters the head of Loch Indaal at Bridgend.
There are numerous small uninhabited islands around the coasts, the largest of which are Eilean Mhic Coinnich and Orsay off the Rinns, Nave Island on the north west coast, Am Fraoch Eilean in the Sound of Islay and Texa off the south coast.
Geology and geomorphology.
The underlying geology of Islay is intricate for such a small area. The deformed Palaeoproterozoic igneous rock of the Rhinns complex is dominated by a course-grained gneiss cut by large intrusions of deformed gabbro. Once thought to be part of the Lewisian complex, it lies beneath the Colonsay Group of metasedimentary rocks which forms the bedrock at the northern end of the Rinns. It is a quartz-rich metamorphic marine sandstone that may be unique to Scotland and which is nearly 5,000 metres thick. South of Rubh' a' Mhail there are outcrops of quartzite, and a strip of mica schist and limestone cuts across the centre of the island from The Oa to Port Askaig. Further south is a band of metamorphic quartzite and granites, a continuation of the beds that underlie Jura. The geomorphology of these last two zones is dominated by a fold known as the Islay Anticline. To the south is a "shattered coastline" formed from mica schist and hornblende. The older Bowmore Group sandstones in the west-centre of the island are rich in feldspar and may be of Dalradian origin.
Loch Indaal was formed along a branch of the Great Glen Fault called the Loch Gruinart Fault; its main line passes just to the north of Colonsay. This separates the limestone, igneous intrusions and Bowmore sandstones from the Colonsay Group rocks of the Rhinns. The result is occasional minor earth tremors.
There is a tillite bed near Port Askaig that provides evidence of an ice age in the Pre-Cambrian. In comparatively recent times the island was ice-covered during the Pleistocene glaciations save for Beinn Tart a' Mhill on the Rinns, which was a nunatak on the edge of the ice sheet. The complex changes of sea level due to melting ice caps and isostasy since then have left a series of raised beaches around the coast. Throughout much of late prehistory the low-lying land between the Rinns and the rest of the island was flooded, creating two islands.
Climate.
The influence of the Gulf Stream keeps the climate mild compared to mainland Scotland. Snow is rarely seen at sea level and frosts are light and short-lived. However, wind speeds average annually and winter gales sweep in off the Atlantic, gusting up to . This can make travelling and living on the island during the winter difficult, while ferry and air links to the mainland can suffer delays. The driest months are April to July and the warmest are May to September, which as a result are the busiest times for tourism. Sunshine hours are typically highest around the coasts, especially to the west.
Etymology.
Islay was probably recorded by Ptolemy as "Epidion", the use of the "p" suggesting a Brittonic or Pictish tribal name. In the seventh century Adomnán referred to the island as "Ilea" and the name occurs in early Irish records as "Ile" and as "Íl" in Old Norse. The root is not Gaelic and of unknown origin. In seventeenth century maps the spelling appears as "Yla" or "Ila", a form still used in the name of the whisky Caol Ila. In poetic language Islay is known as "Banrìgh Innse Gall", or "Banrìgh nan Eilean" usually translated as "Queen of the Hebrides" and "Eilean uaine Ìle" – the "green isle of Islay" A native of Islay is called an "Ìleach", pronounced .
The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total and place names on the island are a mixture of Norse and later Gaelic and English influences. Port Askaig is from the Norse "ask-vík", meaning "ash tree bay" and the common suffix -bus is from the Norse "bólstaðr", meaning "farm". Gaelic names, or their anglicised versions such as Ardnave Point, from "Àird an Naoimh", "height of the saint" are very common. Several of the villages were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries and English is a stronger influence in their names as a result. Port Charlotte for example, was named after Lady Charlotte Campbell, daughter of the island's then owner, Daniel Campbell of Shawfield.
Prehistory.
The earliest settlers on Islay were nomadic hunter-gatherers who may have first arrived during the Mesolithic period after the retreat of the Pleistocene ice caps. A flint arrowhead, which was found in a field near Bridgend in 1993 and dates from 10,800 BC, is amongst the earliest evidence of a human presence found so far in Scotland. Other finds have been dated to 7000 BC using radiocarbon dating of shells and debris from kitchen middens. By the Neolithic, settlements had become more permanent, allowing for the construction of several communal monuments.
The most spectacular prehistoric structure on the island is Dun Nosebridge. This Iron Age fort occupies a prominent crag and has commanding views of the surrounding landscape. The name's origin is probably a mixture of Gaelic and Old Norse: "Dun" in the former language means "fort" and "knaus-borg" in the latter means "fort on the crag". There is no evidence that Islay was ever subject to Roman military control although small numbers of finds such as a coin and a brooch from the third century AD suggest links of some kind with the intermittent Roman presence on the mainland. The ruins of a broch at Dùn Bhoraraic south east of Ballygrant and the remains of numerous Atlantic roundhouses indicate the influences of northern Scotland, where these forms of building originate. There are also various crannogs on Islay, including sites in Loch Ardnave, Loch Ballygrant and Loch Allallaidh in the south east where a stone causeway leading out to two adjacent islands is visible beneath the surface of the water.
There is some controversy about the nature of the relationship between the indigenous peoples of Ireland and south west Scotland during the late Iron Age. The widely accepted theory is that the latter became populated by immigrants from the former, replacing an earlier culture, although it has also been suggested that the Gaels in this part of Scotland were indigenous to the area.
History.
Dalriada.
By the 6th century AD Islay, along with much of mainland Argyll, lay within the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata with strong links to Ireland and, according to the "Senchus fer n-Alban" ("The History of the Men of Scotland"), was ruled by the kin group Cenél nÓengusa. In 627 the son of a king of the Irish Uí Chóelbad, a branch of the Dál nAraidi kingdom of Ulster, was killed on Islay at the unidentified location of Ard-Corann by a warrior in an army led by King Connad Cerr of the Corcu Réti, a kindred based in Cowal on the mainland of Scotland. The "Senchus" also lists what is believed to be the oldest reference to a naval battle in the British Isles—a brief record of an engagement between rival Dál Riatan groups in 719.
There is evidence of another kindred on Islay, the Cenél Conchride, descended from a brother of the legendary Dál Riatan king Fergus Mór but its existence seems to have been brief and the four hundred and thirty households of the island are later said to have been divided between three great-grandsons of the eponymous founder of Cenél nÓengus: Lugaid, Connal and Galán.
Norse influence and the Kingdom of the Isles.
The arrival of Scandinavian settlers on the western seaboard of Scotland in the ninth century had a long-lasting effect. For the next four centuries and more all the islands of the west fell under the control of various rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles most of whom were of Norse origin. As is the case in the Northern Isles, the derivation of place names suggests a complete break from the past. Jennings and Kruse (2009) conclude that although there were settlements prior to the Norse arrival "there is no evidence from the onomasticon that the inhabitants of these settlements ever existed". Gaelic continued to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse period, but the place name evidence suggests it had a lowly status, possibly indicating an enslaved population.
Godred Crovan was one of the Norse-Gael rulers of this Hebridean sea kingdom who had a connection with Islay. His origins are obscure. The "Chronicles of Mann" call him the son of Harald the Black of Ysland, (his place or origin variously interpreted as Islay, Ireland or Iceland) and state he "so tamed the Scots that no one who built a ship or boat dared use more than three iron bolts". Godred also became King of Dublin at an unknown date although in 1094 he was driven out of the city by Muircheartach Ua Briain, later known as High King of Ireland, according to the "Annals of the Four Masters". He died "of pestilence" on Islay the following year. A local tradition suggests that a standing stone at Carragh Bhan near Kintra marks Godred Crovan's grave. A genuine 11th century Norse grave-slab was found at Dóid Mhàiri in 1838, although it was not associated with a burial. The slab is decorated with foliage in the style of Ringerike Viking art and an Irish-style cross, the former being unique in Scandinavian Scotland.
In the 12th century a granddaughter of Godred Crovan's married the ambitious Somerled, a Norse-Gael Argyll nobleman. Godred Olafsson, a grandson of Crovan, was an increasingly unpopular King of the Isles at the time and Somerled was spurred into action. The two fought the Battle of Epiphany in the seas off Islay in January 1156. The result was a bloody stalemate, and the island kingdom was temporarily divided, with Somerled taking control of the southern Hebrides. Two years later Somerled completely ousted Godred and re-united the kingdom, but the divide was re-established after the former's death in 1164. His Clann Somhairle descendants continued to describe themselves as "King of the Sudreys" until the 13th century but following the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland.
Scottish rule.
Lords of the Isles.
Somerled's descendants became the rulers of various powerful clans, including the MacDougalls, Clan Donald and the Macruaris. Alexander MacDougall's support of the opponents of King Robert the Bruce led to the forfeiture of his lands and they were distributed between Aonghas Óg MacDonald of Islay and the chief of the Macruaris, Ruaidhri mac Ailein, who also held much of Lorne, parts of Lochaber, Garmoran and the North Isles. These estates were eventually inherited by Amie Macruairi of Garmoran. She had married her MacDonald cousin John of Islay in the 1330s, and he now controlled significant stretches of the western seaboard of Scotland from Morvern to Loch Hourn and the whole of the Hebrides save for Skye. From 1336 onwards John began to style himself "Dominus Insularum"—"Lord of the Isles", a title that implied a connection to the earlier Kings of the Isles and by extension a degree of independence from the Scottish crown and this honorific was claimed by his heirs for several generations.
Initially, the MacDonald Lords' power base was on the shores of Loch Finlaggan in northeastern Islay. Successive chiefs of Clan Donald were proclaimed Lord of the Isles there and their advisory "Council of the Isles" met on Eilean na Comhairle. However as their control of the west grew in strength the twin castles of Aros and Ardtornish in the Sound of Mull had become the "heart of the Lordship" by the early 15th century.
The Islay Charter, a record of lands granted to an Islay resident, Brian Vicar MacKay, by Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles in 1408, is one of the earliest records of Gaelic in public use, and is a significant historical document. In 1462, John of Islay, Earl of Ross struck an alliance with Edward IV of England under the terms of the Treaty of Ardtornish-Westminster. The onset of the Wars of the Roses prevented Edward from fulfilling his obligations as an ally, and in 1493 MacDonald was compelled to forfeit his estates and titles to James IV. After the forfeiture, James ordered Finlaggan demolished, its buildings razed, and the coronation stone destroyed to discourage any attempts at restoration of the Lordship. When Martin Martin visited Islay in the late 17th century he recorded a description of the coronations Finlaggan had once seen.
16th and 17th centuries.
Initially dispossessed in the wake of royal opposition to the Lordship, Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg's holdings in Islay were restored in 1545. In 1549, Dean Monro observed that the island was fertile, fruitful, and full of natural pastures, with good hunting and plentiful salmon and seals. He also referred to Dunyvaig Castle in the south east, controlled by Clan Donald and Loch Gorm Castle on Eilean Mòr in Loch Gorm to the west, "now usurped be M’Gillayne of Doward". This implied dispute with the Macleans continued and they were expelled from Loch Gorm by force in 1578 and defeated at the Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart in 1598. However, a clash with the Irish branch of the family led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell and their unpopularity in Edinburgh (where their use of Gaelic was regarded as barbaric) weakened the MacDonald grip on their southern Hebridean possessions. In 1608 the Scottish crown mounted an expedition to subdue them and then in 1614 handed Islay over to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor in return for an undertaking to pacify the island. This the Campbells eventually achieved although a setback occurred during the Civil War when a Covenanter army under Sir David Leslie arrived on the island in 1647. They besieged a royalist garrison at Dunnyvaig and laid waste to the island. It was not until 1677 that the Campbells felt sufficiently at ease there to construct Islay House at Bridgend as their principal (and unfortified) island residence. The structure was built for Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor and is now a Category A listed building.
British era.
At the beginning of the 18th century much of the population of Argyll was to be found dispersed in small clachans of farming families and only two villages of any size—Killarow near Bridgend and Lagavulin—existed on Islay at the time. (Killarow had a church and tolbooth and houses for merchants and craft workers but was razed in the 1760s to "improve" the grounds of Islay House.) The agricultural economy was dependent on arable farming including staples such as barley and oats supplemented with stock-rearing. The carrying capacity of the island was recorded at over 6,600 cows and 2,200 horses in a 1722 rental listing.
In 1726 Islay was purchased by Daniel Campbell of Shawfield. It remained in his family's ownership until 1853 when it was sold to James Morrison of Berkshire, ancestor of the third Baron Margadale, who still owns a substantial portion of the island. A defining aspect of 19th century Argyll was the gradual improvement of transport infrastructure. Roads were built, the Crinan canal shortened the sea distance to Glasgow and the numerous traditional ferry crossings were augmented by new quays. Rubble piers were built at several locations on Islay and a new harbour was constructed at Port Askaig.
Initially, a sense of optimism in the fishing and cattle trades prevailed and the population expanded, partly as a result of the 18th century kelp boom and the introduction of the potato as a staple. The population of the island had been estimated at 5,344 in 1755 and grew to over 15,000 by 1841. However, the sundering of the relationship between the landowners and the island's residents proved consequential. When the estate owners realised they could make more money from sheep farming than from the indigenous small farmers, wholesale Clearances became commonplace. Four hundred people emigrated from Islay in 1863 alone, some for purely economic reasons, but many others having been forced off the land their predecessors had farmed for centuries. In 1891 the census recorded only 7,375 citizens, with many evictees making new homes in Canada, the United States and elsewhere. The population continued to decline for much of the 20th century and today is about 3,500.
During World War I two troop ships foundered off Islay within a few months of one another in 1918. The American vessel SS "Tuscania" was torpedoed by UB-77 on 5 February with the loss of over 160 lives and now lies in deep water west of the Mull of Oa. On 6 October HMS "Otranto" was involved in a collision with HMS "Kashmir" in heavy seas while convoying troops from New York. "Otranto" lost steering and drifted towards the west coast of the Rinns. Answering her SOS the destroyer HMS "Mounsey" attempted to come alongside and managed to rescue over 350 men. Nonetheless, the "Otranto" was wrecked on the shore near Machir Bay with a total loss of 431 lives. A monument was erected on the coast of The Oa by the American Red Cross to commemorate the sinking of these two ships.
During World War II, the RAF built an airfield at Glenegedale which later became the civil airport for Islay. There was also an RAF Coastal Command flying boat base at Bowmore from 13 March 1941 using Loch Indaal. In 1944 an RCAF 422 Squadron Sunderland flying boat's crew were rescued after their aircraft landed off Bowmore but broke from her moorings in a gale and sank. There was an RAF Chain Home radar station at Saligo Bay and RAF Chain Home Low station at Kilchiaran.
Economy.
The mainstays of the modern Islay economy are agriculture and fishing, distilling and tourism.
Agriculture and fishing.
Much of Islay remains owned by a few non-resident estate owners and sheep farming and the few dairy cattle herds are run by tenant farmers. Islay has some fine wild brown trout and salmon fishing and in September 2003 the European Fishing Competition was held on five of the island's numerous lochs: this was "the biggest fishing event ever to be held in Scotland". Sea angling is also popular especially off the west coast and over the many shipwrecks around the coast. There are about 20 commercial boats with crab, lobster and scallop fishing undertaken from Port Askaig, Port Ellen and Portnahaven.
Distilling.
Islay is one of five whisky distilling localities and regions in Scotland whose identity is protected by law. There are eight active distilleries and the industry is the island's second largest employer after agriculture. Those on the south of the island produce malts with a very strong peaty flavour, considered to be the most intensely flavoured of all whiskies. From east to west they are Ardbeg, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig. On the north of the island Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Caol Ila and Bunnahabhain are produced, which are substantially lighter in taste. Kilchoman is a microdistillery opened in 2005 toward the west coast of the Rinns.
The oldest record of a legal distillery on the island refers to Bowmore in 1779 and at one time there were up to 23 distilleries in operation. For example, Port Charlotte distillery operated from 1829 to 1929 and Port Ellen is also closed although it remains in business as a malting. In March 2007 Bruichladdich announced that they would reopen Port Charlotte distillery using equipment from the Inverleven distillery.
Tourism.
Some 45,000 summer visitors arrive per annum by ferry and a further 11,000 by air, the main attractions being the scenery, history, bird watching and the world famous whiskies. The distilleries operate various shops, tours, visitor centres etc. and the Finlaggan Trust has a visitor centre which is open daily during the summer.
Renewable energy.
The location of Islay, exposed to the full force of the North Atlantic, has led to it being the site of a pioneering, and Scotland's first, wave power station near Portnahaven. The Islay LIMPET (Land Installed Marine Powered Energy Transformer) wave power generator was designed and built by Wavegen and researchers from the Queen's University of Belfast, and was financially backed by the European Union. Known as Limpet 500, due to cabling constraints its capacity is limited to providing up to 150 kW of electricity into the island's grid. In 2000 it became the world's first commercial wave power station. In March 2011 the largest tidal array in the world was approved by the Scottish Government with 10 planned turbines predicted to generate enough power for over 5,000 homes. The project will be located in the Sound of Islay which offers both strong currents and shelter from storms.
Transport.
Many of the roads on the island are single-track with passing places. The two main roads are the A846 from Ardbeg to Port Askaig via Port Ellen and Bowmore, and the A847 which runs down the east coast of the Rhinns. The island has its own bus service provided by Islay Coaches and Glenegedale Airport offers flights to and from Glasgow International Airport and on a less regular basis to Oban and Colonsay.
Caledonian MacBrayne operate regular ferry services to Port Ellen and Port Askaig from Kennacraig, taking about two hours. Ferries to Port Askaig also run on to Scalasaig on Colonsay and, on summer Wednesdays, to Oban. The purpose-built vessel, entered service in 2011. ASP Ship Management Ltd operate a small car ferry on behalf of Argyll & Bute Council from Port Askaig to Feolin on Jura.
There are various lighthouses on and around Islay as an aid to navigation. These include the Rinns of Islay light built on Orsay in 1825 by Robert Stevenson, Ruvaal at the north western tip of Islay constructed in 1859, Carraig Fhada at Port Ellen, which has an unusual design, and Dubh Artach, an isolated rock tower some to the north west of Ruvaal.
Other activities.
Since 1973 the "Ileach" has been delivering news to the people of Islay every fortnight and was named community newspaper of the year in 2007. The Islay Ales Brewery brews various real ales at its premises near Bridgend. In the early 21st century a campus of Sabhal Mòr Ostaig was set up on Islay, Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle, which teaches Gaelic language, culture and heritage. The Port Mòr community centre at Port Charlotte, which is equipped with a micro wind turbine and a ground source heating system, is the creation of local development trust Iomairt Chille Chomain.
Gaelic language.
Islay has historically been a very strong Gaelic speaking area. Both in the 1901 and 1921 census, all parishes in Islay were reported to be over 75 per cent Gaelic speaking. By 1971, the Rhinns had dropped to 50-74% speakers and the rest of Islay to 25-49% overall. By 1991 about a third of the island's population were Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census this had dropped to 24% which, while a low figure overall, nonetheless made it the most strongly Gaelic-speaking island in Argyll and Bute after Tiree, with the highest percentage recorded in Portnahaven (32%) and the lowest in Gortontaoid (17%), with the far north and south of the island being the weakest areas in general.
The Islay dialect is distinctive. It patterns strongly with other Argyll dialects, especially those of Jura, Colonsay and Kintyre. Amongst its distinctive phonological features are the shift from long /aː/ to /ɛː/, a high degree of retention of long /eː/, the shift of dark /l̪ˠ/ to /t̪/, the lack of intrusive /t̪/ in "sr" groups (for example /s̪ɾoːn/ "nose" rather than /s̪t̪ɾoːn/) and the retention of the unlenited past-tense particle "d"' (for example, "d'èirich" "rose" instead of "dh'èirich"). It sits within a group of lexical isoglosses (i.e. words distinctive to a certain area) with strong similarities to southern Gaelic and northern Irish dialects. Examples are "dhuit" "to you" (instead of the more common "dhut"), the formula "gun robh math agad" "thank you" (instead of the more common "mòran taing" or "tapadh leat" but compare Irish "go raibh maith agat"), "mand" "able to" (instead of the more common "urrainn") or "deifir" "hurry" (instead of the more common "cabhag", Irish "deifir").
Religion.
Associated with various Islay churches are cupstones of uncertain age; these can be seen at Kilchoman Church, where the carved cross there is erected on one, and at Kilchiaran Church on the Rhinns. In historic times some may have been associated with pre-Christian wishing ceremonies or pagan beliefs in the "wee folk".
The early pioneers of Christianity in Dál Riata were Columba of Iona and Moluag of Lismore. The legacy of this period includes the 8th century Kildalton Cross, Islay's "most famous treasure", carved out of local epidiorite. A carved cross of similar age, but much more heavily weathered can be found at Kilnave, which may have served as a site of lay worship. Although the first Norse settlers were pagan, Islay has a substantial number of sites of drystone or clay-mortared chapels with small burial grounds from the later Norse era. In the 12th century the island became part of the Diocese of Sodor and the Isles, which was re-established by King Olaf Godredsson. The diocese fell within the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Nidaros and there were four principal churches on Islay in the Norwegian "prestegjeld" model: Kilnaughton, Kildalton, Kilarrow and Kilmany. In 1472 Islay became part of the Archdiocese of St Andrews.
Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll was a strong supporter of the Reformation, but there is little evidence that his beliefs were greeted with much enthusiasm by the islanders initially. At first there were only two reformed churches but in 1642 three parishes were created, based at Kilchoman, Kilarrow and a new church at Dunyvaig. By the end of the century there were seven churches including one on Nave Island. Kilarrow Parish Church is round, as local folklore has it, to leave no corner for the devil to hide in. This "architectural gem" was constructed in 1767 by Daniel Campbell, the laird of Islay. The kirk on the Rhinns of Islay is St Kiaran's, located just outside the village of Port Charlotte and Port Ellen is served by St John's. There are a variety of other Church of Scotland churches and various other congregations on the island. Baptists meet in Port Ellen and in Bowmore, the Scottish Episcopal Church of St. Columba is located in Bridgend and the Islay Roman Catholic congregation also uses St. Columba's for its services.
Media and the arts.
Islay was featured in some of the scenes of the 1954 film, "The Maggie" and the 1942 documentary "Coastal Command" was partly filmed in Bowmore.
In 1967–68, folk-rock singer Donovan included "The Isle of Islay" in his album, "A Gift from a Flower to a Garden", a song praising the pastoral beauties of the island. "Westering Home" is a 20th-century Scottish song about Islay written by Hugh S. Roberton, derived from an earlier Gaelic song.
In the 1990s the BBC adaptation of "Para Handy" was partly filmed in Port Charlotte and Bruichladdich and featured a race between the "Vital Spark" (Para Handy's puffer) and a rival along the length of Loch Indaal. In 2007, parts of the BBC Springwatch programme were recorded on Islay with Simon King being based on Islay. The British Channel 4 archaeological television programme "Time Team" excavated at Finlaggan, the episode being first broadcast in 1995.
In 2000, Japanese author Murakami Haruki visited the island to sample seven single malt whiskies on the island and later wrote a travel book called "If our language were whiskey".
Wildlife.
Islay is home to many different species of wildlife and is especially known for its birds. Winter visiting Barnacle Goose numbers have reached 35,000 in recent years with as many as 10,000 arriving in a single day. There are also up to 12,000 Greenland White-fronted Goose and smaller numbers of Brent, Pinkfooted and Canada Geese are often found amongst these flocks. Other water-fowl include Whooper and Mute Swans, Eider Duck, Slavonian Grebe, Goldeneye, Long-tailed Duck and Wigeon. The elusive Corncrake and Sanderling, Ringed Plover and Curlew Sandpiper are amongst the summer visitors. Resident birds include Red-billed Chough, Hen Harrier, Golden Eagle, Peregrine Falcon, Barn Owl, Raven, Oystercatcher and Guillemot. The re-introduced White-tailed Sea Eagle is now seen regularly around the coasts. In all, about 105 species breed on the island each year and between 100 and 120 different species can be seen at any one time.
A population of several thousand Red Deer inhabit the moors and hills, Fallow Deer can be found in the south east and Roe Deer are common on low-lying ground. Otter are common around the coasts along and Common and Grey Seal breed on Nave Island. Offshore, a variety of cetaceans are regularly recorded including Minke Whale, Pilot Whale, Killer Whale and Bottle-nosed Dolphin. The only snake on Islay is the Adder and the Common Lizard is widespread although not commonly seen. The island supports a significant population of the Marsh Fritillary along with numerous other moths and butterflies. The mild climate supports a diversity of flora, typical of the Inner Hebrides.

Lewis and Harris

Lewis and Harris (Scottish Gaelic: "Leòdhas agus na Hearadh") in the Outer Hebrides make up the largest island in Scotland. This is the third largest single island of the British Isles, after Great Britain and Ireland.
Geography.
The northern part of the island is called Lewis, the southern is Harris and both are frequently referred to as if they were separate islands. The boundary between Lewis and Harris is formed by a line with Loch Resort (Reasort) (opposite Scarp) on the west and Loch Seaforth (Shiphoirt) on the east. 
The island does not have a common name in either English or Scottish Gaelic and is referred to as 'Lewis and Harris', 'Lewis with Harris', 'Harris with Lewis' etc. Rarely, the collective name of the Long Island () is used, although this is normally applied to the entire Outer Hebrides. 
Most of Harris is very hilly, with more than thirty peaks above high and seven mountains, defined as Corbetts. It has an area of - slightly under one per cent of the area of Great Britain. It is from the nearest point of the mainland, from which it is separated by the Minch.
Lewis is comparatively flat, save in the south-east, where Ben More reaches , and in the south-west, where Mealasbhal is the highest point.
Until 1975, Lewis belonged to the county of Ross and Cromarty and Harris to Inverness-shire. The entire island group now belongs to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the Western Isles Council.
Smaller islands.
Other nearby inhabited islands in the Lewis and Harris group are Beàrnaraigh (Great Bernera) and Sgalpaigh (Scalpay). Tarasaigh (Taransay) and An Sgarp (Scarp) are now-uninhabited islands close to the shore of Harris.
Population.
Lewis and Harris is the most populous of the Scottish islands, and had just over 20,500 residents in 2011, a rise of 5.6% from the 2001 census total of 19,918. The civil parish of Stornoway, including the main town of the island itself and various nearby villages, has a population of approximately 12,000.
Transport links.
Stornoway ("Steòrnabhagh") has ferry links to Ullapool and air services to Benbecula, Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow-International and Edinburgh. "An Tairbeart" (Tarbert) is the ferry terminal in Harris with connections to Skye and North Uist.
History.
The island is the ancestral homeland of the Highland Clan MacLeod, with those individuals on Harris being referred to as from the clan MacLeod of Harris or MacLeod of MacLeod, and those on Lewis being referred to as from the clan MacLeod of Lewis.
Lewis is also the ancestral home of Clan Morrison.
Economy.
A major industry on the island is the production of Harris tweed fabric, which is handmade on the island; by law only fabric produced in the Outer Hebrides can be called Harris tweed.

Skye

Skye or the Isle of Skye (; or "Eilean a' Cheò") is the largest and most northerly large island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic "Sgitheanach" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.
The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th-century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001. About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline this aspect of island culture remains important.
The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and whisky-distilling. Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area. The island's largest settlement is Portree, known for its picturesque harbour. There are links to various nearby islands by ferry and, since 1995, to the mainland by a road bridge. The climate is mild, wet and windy. The abundant wildlife includes the golden eagle, red deer and Atlantic salmon. The local flora is dominated by heather moor, and there are nationally important invertebrate populations on the surrounding sea bed. Skye has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is celebrated in poetry and song.
Etymology.
The first written references to the island are Roman sources such as the "Ravenna Cosmography", which refers to "Scitis" and "Scetis", which can be found on a map by Ptolemy. One possible derivation comes from "skitis", an early Celtic word for "winged", which may describe how the island's peninsulas radiate out from a mountainous centre. Subsequent Gaelic-, Norse- and English-speaking peoples have influenced the history of Skye; the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward. Various etymologies have been proposed, such as the "winged isle" or "the notched isle" but no definitive solution has been found to date and the placename may be from an earlier, non-Gaelic language.
In the Norse sagas Skye is called "Skíð", for example in the "Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar" and a skaldic poem in the "Heimskringla" from c. 1230 contains a line that translates as "the hunger battle-birds were filled in Skye with blood of foemen killed". The island was also referred to by the Norse as "Skuy" (misty isle), "Skýey" or "Skuyö" (isle of cloud). The traditional Gaelic name is "An t-Eilean Sgitheanach" (the island of Skye), "An t-Eilean Sgiathanach" being a more recent and less common spelling. In 1549 Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles, wrote of "Sky": "This Ile is callit "Ellan Skiannach" in Irish, that is to say in Inglish the wyngit Ile, be reason it has mony wyngis and pointis lyand furth fra it, throw the dividing of thir foirsaid Lochis." but the meaning of this Gaelic name is unclear.
"Eilean a' Cheò", which means "island of the mist", is a poetic Gaelic name for the island.
Geography.
At , Skye is the second-largest island in Scotland after Lewis and Harris. The coastline of Skye is a series of peninsulas and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the Cuillin hills (Gaelic:"An Cuiltheann"). Malcolm Slesser suggested that its shape "sticks out of the west coast of northern Scotland like a lobster's claw ready to snap at the fish bone of Harris and Lewis" and W. H. Murray, commenting on its irregular coastline, stated that "Skye is sixty miles long, but what might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state".
Martin Martin, a native of the island, reported on it at length in a 1703 publication. His geological observations included a note that:
The Black Cuillin, which are mainly composed of basalt and gabbro, include twelve Munros and provide some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain terrain in Scotland. The ascent of Sgùrr a' Ghreadaidh is one of the longest rock climbs in Britain and the Inaccessible Pinnacle is the only peak in Scotland that requires technical climbing skills to reach the summit. These hills make demands of the hill walker that exceed any others found in Scotland and a full traverse of the Cuillin ridge may take 15–20 hours. The Red Hills (Gaelic: "Am Binnean Dearg") to the south are also known as the Red Cuillin. They are mainly composed of granite that has weathered into more rounded hills with many long scree slopes on their flanks. The highest point of these hills is Glamaig, one of only two Corbetts on Skye.
The northern peninsula of Trotternish is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the tartan-like patterns in the cliffs. The Quiraing is a spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of Storr.
Beyond Loch Snizort to the west of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is separated from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295 metres (967 ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.
Towns and villages.
Portree in the north at the base of Trotternish is the largest settlement (estimated population 2,264 in 2011) and is the main service centre on the island. Broadford, the location of the island's only airstrip, is on the east side of the island and Dunvegan in the north-west is well known for its castle and the nearby Three Chimneys restaurant. The 18th-century Stein Inn on the Waternish coast is the oldest pub on Skye. Kyleakin is linked to Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland by the Skye Bridge, which spans the narrows of Loch Alsh. Uig, the port for ferries to the Outer Hebrides, is on the west of the Trotternish peninsula and Edinbane is between Dunvegan and Portree. Much of the rest of the population lives in crofting townships scattered around the coastline.
Climate.
The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging in January and in July at Duntulm in Trotternish. Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are less frequent than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation. South-westerlies are the most common and speeds of have been recorded. High winds are especially likely on the exposed coasts of Trotternish and Waternish. In common with most islands of the west coast of Scotland, rainfall is generally high at per annum and the elevated Cuillin are wetter still. Variations can be considerable, with the north tending to be drier than the south. Broadford, for example, averages more than of rain per annum. Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month.
History.
Prehistory.
A Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at An Corran in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross where tools made of a mudstone from An Corran have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits. Finds of bloodstone microliths on the foreshore at Orbost on the west coast of the island near Dunvegan also suggest Mesolithic occupation. These tools probably originate from the nearby island of Rum.
Rubha an Dùnain, an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the Cuillin, has a variety of archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic onwards. There is a 2nd or 3rd millennium BC chambered cairn, an Iron Age promontory fort and the remains of other prehistoric settlement dating from the Bronze Age nearby. Loch na h-Airde on the peninsula is linked to the sea by an artificial "Viking" canal that may date from the later period of Norse settlement. Dun Ringill is a ruined Iron Age hill fort on the Strathaird peninsula, which was further fortified in the Middle Ages and may have become the seat of Clan MacKinnon.
Early history.
The late Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse. Three Pictish symbol stones have been found on Skye and a fourth on Raasay. More is known of the kingdom of Dál Riata to the south; Adomnán's life of Columba, written shortly before 697, portrays the saint visiting Skye (where he baptised a pagan leader using an interpreter) and Adomnán himself is thought to have been familiar with the island. The Irish annals record a number of events on Skye in the later 7th and early 8th centuries – mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the background to the Old Irish language romance "Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin".
The Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until after the Treaty of Perth in 1266. However, apart from placenames, little remains of their presence on Skye in the written or archaeological record. Apart from the name "Skye" itself, all pre-Norse placenames seem to have been obliterated by the Scandinavian settlers. Viking heritage is claimed by Clan MacLeod and Norse tradition is celebrated in the winter fire festival at Dunvegan, during which a replica Viking long boat is set alight.
Clans and Scottish rule.
The most powerful clans on Skye in the post–Norse period were Clan MacLeod, originally based in Trotternish, and Clan MacDonald of Sleat. Following the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on Strathaird. Clan MacNeacail also have a long association with Trotternish, and in the 16th century many of the MacInnes clan moved to Sleat. The MacDonalds of South Uist were bitter rivals of the MacLeods, and an attempt by the former to murder church-goers at Trumpan in retaliation for a previous massacre on Eigg, resulted in the Battle of the Spoiling Dyke of 1578.
After the failure of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. Although she was born on South Uist her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir in Trotternish. Samuel Johnson and James Boswell's visit to Skye in 1773 and their meeting with Flora MacDonald in Kilmuir is recorded in Boswell's "The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides". Boswell wrote, "To see Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora MacDonald in the isle of Sky, was a striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here". Johnson's words that Flora MacDonald was "A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour" are written on her gravestone. After this rebellion the clan system was broken up and Skye became a series of landed estates.
Of the island in general, Johnson observed:
Skye has a rich heritage of ancient monuments from this period. Dunvegan Castle has been the seat of Clan MacLeod since the 13th century. It contains the Fairy Flag and is reputed to have been inhabited by a single family for longer than any other house in Scotland. The 18th-century Armadale Castle, once home of Clan Donald of Sleat, was abandoned as a residence in 1925 but now hosts the Clan Donald Centre. Nearby are the ruins of two more MacDonald strongholds, Knock Castle, and Dunscaith Castle, the legendary home of warrior woman, martial arts instructor (and, according to some sources, Queen) Scáthach. Caisteal Maol, built in the late 15th century near Kyleakin and once a seat of Clan MacKinnon, is another ruin.
Clearances.
In the late 18th century the harvesting of kelp became a significant activity but from 1822 on cheap imports led to a collapse of this industry throughout the Hebrides. During the 19th century, the inhabitants of Skye were also devastated by famine and Clearances. Thirty thousand people were evicted between 1840 and 1880 alone, many of them forced to emigrate to the New World. For example, the settlement of Lorgill on the west coast of Duirinish was cleared on 4 August 1830. Every crofter under the age of seventy was removed and placed on board the "Midlothian" on threat of imprisonment, with those over that age being sent to the poorhouse. The "Battle of the Braes" involved a demonstration against a lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. The incident involved numerous crofters and about 50 police officers. This event was instrumental in the creation of the Napier Commission, which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters' Act and on one occasion 400 marines were deployed on Skye to maintain order. The ruins of cleared villages can still be seen at Lorgill, Boreraig and Suisnish in Strath Swordale, and Tusdale on Minginish.
Overview of population trends.
As with many Scottish islands, Skye's population peaked in the 19th century and then declined under the impact of the Clearances and the military losses in the First World War. From the 19th century until 1975 Skye was part of the county of Inverness-shire but the crofting economy languished and according to Slesser, "Generations of UK governments have treated the island people contemptuously." a charge that has been levelled at both Labour and Conservative administrations' policies in the Highlands and Islands. By 1971 the population was less than a third of its peak recorded figure in 1841. However, the number of residents then grew by over 28 per cent in the thirty years to 2001.
The changing relationship between the residents and the land is evidenced by Robert Carruthers's remark circa 1852 that, "There is now a village in Portree containing three hundred inhabitants." Even if this estimate is inexact the population of the island's largest settlement has probably increased sixfold or more since then. During the period the total number of island residents has declined by 50 per cent or more.
The island-wide population increase of 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 occurred against the background of an overall reduction in Scottish island populations of 3 per cent for the same period. By 2011 the population had risen a further 8.4% to 10,008 with Scottish island populations as a whole growing by 4% to 103,702.
Gaelic.
Historically, Skye was overwhelmingly Gaelic-speaking, but this changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes were more than 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers while the rest of Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.
Government and politics.
In terms of local government, from 1975 to 1996, Skye, along with the neighbouring mainland area of Lochalsh, constituted a local government district within the Highland administrative area. In 1996 the district was included into the unitary Highland Council, ("Comhairle na Gàidhealtachd") based in Inverness and formed one of the new council's area committees. Following the 2007 elections, Skye now forms a four-member ward called "Eilean a' Cheò"; it is currently represented by two independents, one Scottish National Party, and one Liberal Democrat councillor.
Skye is in the Highlands electoral region and comprises a part of the Ross, Skye and Inverness West constituency of the Scottish Parliament, which elects one member under the first past the post basis to represent it. Currently this is David Thompson for the SNP. In addition, Skye forms part of the wider Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency, which elects one member to the House of Commons in Westminster. The present Member of Parliament is Charles Kennedy MP for the Liberal Democrats, a former leader of the party who has represented the area since the 1983 general election.
Economy.
The largest employer on the island and its environs is the public sector, which accounts for about a third of the total workforce, principally in administration, education and health. The second largest employer in the area is the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, highlighting the importance of tourism. Key attractions include Dunvegan Castle, the Clan Donald Visitor Centre, and The Aros Experience arts and exhibition centre in Portree. There are about a dozen large landowners on Skye, the largest being the public sector, with the Scottish Government owning most of the northern part of the island. Glendale is a community-owned estate in Duirinish and the Sleat Community Trust, the local development trust, is active in various regeneration projects.
Small firms dominate employment in the private sector. The Talisker Distillery, which produces a single malt whisky, is beside Loch Harport on the west coast of the island. Three other whiskies—"Mac na Mara" ("son of the sea"), "Tè Bheag nan Eilean" ("wee dram of the isles") and "Poit Dhubh" ("black pot")—are produced by blender "Pràban na Linne" ("smugglers den by the Sound of Sleat"), based at Eilean Iarmain. These are marketed using predominantly Gaelic-language labels. There is also an established software presence on Skye, with Portree-based Sitekit having expanded in recent years.
Crofting is still important, but although there are about 2,000 crofts on Skye only 100 or so are large enough to enable a crofter to earn a livelihood entirely from the land. Cod and herring stocks have declined but commercial fishing remains important, especially fish farming of salmon and shellfish such as scampi. The west coast of Scotland has a considerable renewable energy potential and the Isle of Skye Renewables Co-op has recently bought a stake in the Ben Aketil wind farm near Dunvegan. There is a thriving arts and crafts sector.
The unemployment rate in the area tends to be higher than in the Highlands as a whole, and is seasonal in nature, in part due to the impact of tourism. The population is growing and in common with many other scenic rural areas in Scotland, significant increases are expected in the percentage of the population aged 45 to 64 years.
Transport.
Skye is linked to the mainland by the Skye Bridge, while ferries sail from Armadale on the island to Mallaig, and from Kylerhea to Glenelg. Ferries also run from Uig to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist, and from Sconser to Raasay.
The Skye Bridge opened in 1995 under a private finance initiative and the high tolls charged (£5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls). On 21 December 2004 it was announced that the Scottish Executive had purchased the bridge from its owners and the tolls were immediately removed.
Bus services run to Inverness and Glasgow, and there are local services on the island, mainly starting from Portree or Broadford. Train services run from Kyle of Lochalsh at the mainland end of the Skye Bridge to Inverness, as well as from Glasgow to Mallaig from where the ferry can be caught to Armadale.
The Isle of Skye Airfield at Ashaig, near Broadford, is used by private aircraft and occasionally by NHS Highland and the Scottish Ambulance Service for transferring patients to hospitals on the mainland.
The A87 trunk road traverses the island from the Skye Bridge to Uig, linking most of the major settlements. Many of the island's roads have been widened in the past forty years although there are still substantial sections of single track road.
Culture, media and the arts.
Students of Scottish Gaelic travel from all over the world to attend "Sabhal Mòr Ostaig", the Scottish Gaelic college based near Kilmore in Sleat. In addition to members of the Church of Scotland and a smaller number of Roman Catholics many residents of Skye belong to the Free Church of Scotland, known for its strict observance of the Sabbath.
Skye has a strong folk music tradition, although in recent years dance and rock music have been growing in popularity on the island. Gaelic folk rock band Runrig started in Skye and former singer Donnie Munro still works on the island. Runrig's second single and a concert staple is entitled "Skye", the lyrics being partly in English and partly in Gaelic and they have released other songs such as "Nightfall on Marsco" that were inspired by the island. Celtic fusion band the Peatbog Faeries are based on Skye. Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson owned an estate at Strathaird on Skye at one time. Several Tull songs are written about Skye, including "Dun Ringil", "Broadford Bazaar", and "Acres Wild" (which contains the lines "Come with me to the Winged Isle, / Northern father's western child..." in reference to the island itself). The Isle of Skye Music Festival featured sets from The Fun Lovin' Criminals and Sparks, but collapsed in 2007. Electronic musician Mylo was born on Skye.
The poet Sorley MacLean, a native of the Isle of Raasay, which lies off the island's east coast, lived much of his life on Skye. The island has been immortalised in the traditional song "The Skye Boat Song" and is the notional setting for the novel "To the Lighthouse" by Virginia Woolf, although the Skye of the novel bears little relation to the real island. John Buchan's descriptions of Skye, as featured in his Richard Hannay novel "Mr Standfast", are more true to life. "I Diari di Rubha Hunis" is a 2004 Italian language work of non-fiction by Davide Sapienza.
Skye has been used as a location for a number of feature films. The Ashaig aerodrome was used for the opening scenes of the 1980 film "Flash Gordon". "Stardust", released in 2007 and starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, featured scenes near Uig, Loch Coruisk and the Quiraing. Another 2007 film, "", was shot almost entirely in various locations on the island. Some of the opening scenes in Ridley Scott's 2012 feature film "Prometheus" were shot at the Old Man of Storr. In 1973 "The Highlands and Islands - a Royal Tour", a documentary about Prince Charles's visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by Oscar Marzaroli, was shot partly on Skye.
The "West Highland Free Press" is published at Broadford. This weekly newspaper takes as its motto "An Tìr, an Cànan 's na Daoine" ("The Land, the Language and the People"), which reflects its radical, campaigning priorities. The "Free Press" was founded in 1972 and circulates in Skye, Wester Ross and the Outer Hebrides. Shinty is a popular sport played throughout the island and Portree-based Skye Camanachd won the Camanachd Cup in 1990.
Wildlife.
The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote:
Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that:
In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle. The eggs of the last breeding pair of white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced. The chough last bred on the island in 1900. Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.
Heather moor containing ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, bog myrtle and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly to produce a soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is a fine example of "Brachypodium"-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.
The local Biodiversity Action Plan recommends land management measures to control the spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.

Prentice Marshall

Prentice Henry Marshall (August 7, 1926 – May 24, 2004) was a United States District judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Early life and education.
Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Marshall graduated from Oak Park High School (now Oak Park and River Forest High School) in 1944 and then served two years in the United States Navy. Under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, earning a bachelor's degree in 1949. While there he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Marshall then earned a law degree from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1951.
Marshall then served as a law clerk for Judge Walter C. Lindley on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 1951 until 1953.
Professional career.
A Democrat, Marshall worked in private legal practice in Chicago from 1953 until 1967 at Johnston, Thompson, Raymond & Mayer (which later became known as Jenner & Block), becoming partner in 1961. While at Jenner, Marshall also served as a special assistant attorney general for the state of Illinois from 1964 until 1967. Marshall also built a reputation for starting Jenner's pro bono legal program. Marshall then served as a law professor at the University of Illinois College of Law from 1967 until 1973 and as a hearing officer for the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission from 1967 until 1972.
In 1959, Marshall, then a resident of Wheaton, Illinois, ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for state's attorney in DuPage County, a Republican stronghold.
Federal judicial service.
On June 27, 1973, President Richard Nixon nominated Marshall to be a judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to replace Judge Alexander J. Napoli, who had died. The United States Senate confirmed Marshall just 16 days later, on July 13, 1973. Marshall was one of the few Democrats ever nominated to the federal bench by Nixon.
During his tenure on the bench, Marshall became known—by his own admission—as an activist judge, ordering the Chicago Police Department in 1976 to hire women and stop discrimination against black and Hispanic officers. He also ruled in 1982 that the random interrogation of Hispanics by what was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service was unconstitutional.
Perhaps Marshall's best-known case, however, was a 1982 trial that sent the then-president of the Teamsters Union, Roy L. Williams, to prison for three years. In that case, Williams, Chicago mob boss Joseph Lombardo and three other defendants—one of whom, Chicago insurance man Allan Dorfman, was shot to death while out on bond awaiting sentencing—were found to have conspired to bribe U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon.
Marshall took senior status on October 19, 1988, and then retired outright from the federal bench on April 15, 1996.
Death.
Marshall died of cardiac pulmonary failure and bladder cancer on May 24, 2004 in Ponce Inlet, Florida.
Personal.
Marshall married his high school sweetheart, Lorelei Towle, in 1948. The couple had four children: Prentice Marshall, Jr., Pamela Holcombe, Fred Marshall and Connie Pilato. Lorelei Marshall died in 2005 at age 78.
Marshall and his wife sold their house in Wheaton, Illinois in 1978 and moved to Chicago. They moved to Florida in 1990.
Marshall's wife told the New York Times in 2004 that he once interviewed for the job of commissioner of baseball.

River Street Streetcar

The River Street Streetcar is a heritage streetcar line in Savannah, Georgia, in the United States. It began regular operation on February 11, 2009, and shuttles between six stops along River Street, next to the Savannah River.
History.
The first horsecars began operation in Savannah in 1869. Electric streetcars started operation in 1890 but were discontinued on August 26, 1946. The Norfolk Southern Railway had owned the River Street branch line for years, operating the "River Street Rambler", which was a local freight train, until 2003. 
The city of Savannah purchased the River Street Branch line right-of-way from Norfolk Southern in 2004 for approximately $600,000. The streetcar now runs along the abandoned railroad tracks in the cobblestones on River Street east and west of City Hall.
To provide streetcar service a 1930s-era W5-class streetcar (#756), originally from Melbourne, Australia, was purchased by the city for about $207,000 and converted to power its motors with an onboard biodiesel-fueled generator and batteries as a hybrid drive for an additional $100,000. Hence it is a form of diesel railcar. The streetcar was nicknamed "Dottie'" — a reference to the Savannah DOT that completed the project. The service was initially introduced during the Climate Action Parade on December 9, 2008. Additional free rides were provided for a day on December 13, 2008. Regular operations started on February 11, 2009.
Schedule and stations.
The streetcar operates Thursday through Sunday from 12:00 noon to 9:00 p.m.
From west to east the station stops along the line are:
Future expansion.
In the spring of 2009 it was hoped that the operating schedule will be expanded to six days a week and operating hours will be extended hours to 10:00 p.m. each evening. A second car for the current single-car service will allow for operation of a two-car train that will be bidirectional.
Later, the River Street Line may be extended to the city's Roundhouse Railroad Museum and Visitor Center, provided that Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard could have new streetcar tracks laid along it. Other new lines have been planned, which most likely will run on abandoned railroad tracks throughout the city, such as on Fahm Street.
While the River Street Line's streetcar currently operates on a biodiesel fueled internal combustion engine, the future lines will probably be electrified by overhead wires. Either replica or vintage streetcars could be used for the future extensions. The restoration of Birney Safety Car #656, a single-truck streetcar, is another likelihood.

Ron Gordon

Education.
Though his success has been in high technology, Ronald F. Gordon actually received his degree in Philosophy at the University of Colorado. During a talk he once gave at Stanford one of the students asked where Gordon received his Engineering degree. He replied "Well I don’t have an engineering degree." The student asked, "How could you have invented and developed all of those products?" Gordon explained, "I think engineering is important and we must have engineers but that new products come from new ideas and new ideas come from one’s philosophy and not from engineering laws which often define what you cannot do instead of what you can do."
Atari.
In the mid-70's Ron Gordon took charge as President of Atari, Inc and made it into a leader in the video game industry. He then went on to pioneer the pocket language translator, the "HHC", a 6502 based hand-held computer, the world's first "Electronic University Network" (eLearning), and the 1st computer product operated by thought – The Mind Drive.
TeleLearning.
In September 1982 Ron Gordon came back from his third retirement and founded San Francisco-based TeleLearning Systems, Inc., thereby launching The Electronic University Network. Not only did he develop the technical and business concept, he also convinced major colleges and universities from around the country to join the system. One of the lesser known, John F. Kennedy University, became the first accredited institution to offer an entire degree program, an MBA, online.
MindDrive.
Alongside his commercial ventures, Ron Gordon has also operated his non-profit institute, The Other 90%. "I’ve always been fascinated by the brain and learning how to use the other 90 percent of our brain so we finally decided we’re going to get this." One of the products to come out of this research was the MindDrive - an interface technology to control devices, computers, games, wheelchairs, etc. with just one's thoughts.

Cash4Gold

Cash4Gold (sometimes stylized in advertising as Cash4Gold.com) serves as a mail-in refinery that buys gold, silver and platinum primarily from jewelry.
Cash4Gold.com's original ownership team was beset by Better Business Bureau complaints and filed for bankruptcy after overspending on large advertising efforts including a commercial which aired during the Super Bowl. In 2012 the assets of the company were purchased by Direct Holdings Global. The company changed its name in an effort to improve the Better Business Bureau rating; complaints, however, continue about their questionable business practices.
Process.
Consumers request a pre-paid envelope known as a “Refiner's Pack” online or by phone. Customers place their gold materials in the pack and ship it to the Cash4Gold refinery in Florida. A Cash4Gold employee weighs the items, photographs them and assesses the items using such tools as acids, X-rays and electronic testing devices. Then they send the customer a check for a value they determine. Customers are given 10 days from the date on the check to ask for their jewelry back if they are not satisfied with the amount of their check. 
Many people have complained about the fairness of this process and the valuations of the gold they mailed to the company. 
Cash4Gold also purchases diamonds, but will not pay for additional gem stones and recommends they be removed from jewelry prior to sending the jewelry for evaluation.
Security measures.
To ensure customers are the legal owners of the jewelry that is sent in, Florida passed legislation aimed at regulating the online gold-buying industry. Cash4Gold worked with Florida legislators to draft the bill. This new law also requires the company to get a driver’s license number and a sworn statement from customers stating that they own the items they are selling. Sellers must be at least 21 years old and the senders’ addresses are verified.
CNN visited Cash4Gold headquarters in March 2010 to see the company’s methods of collecting, processing and melting gold jewelry. In the visit, steps shown included customer background checks, a separation of the jewelry, then processing the items for evaluations before sending customers their checks and melting items into gold bars.
Company History.
Founding.
Cash4Gold (sometimes stylized in advertising as Cash4Gold.com) was a Pompano Beach, Florida based company derived from Albar Precious Metal Refining, created by former CEO Jeff Aronson. David Knight, SVP for international marketing and expansion, joined the team in 2009 from eBay. Shawn Kernes, a former Chief Technology Officer at StubHub, was the company’s COO.
In 2006, Cash4Gold had sales of $40 million with 14 employees. By May 2009, the company employed about 300 people with nearly 800,000 customer transactions. As of 2010, the company has received more than of gold per day with 94% of respondents accepting its cash offer.
Controversy.
Under the leadership of Jeff Aronson, the company claimed to pay between 20-80% of the melt value of the items to the seller though independent reports suggest less than 20% of the value is the norm. The norm for the gold-buying industry is for the seller to be paid more than 90% of the value of the gold.
Channel 10 News in San Diego did an investigation where they sent in a ring containing over 2 grams of gold worth $17 in weight to three different sites. The payout from Cash4Gold was $7.91. Consumer Reports, using its "mystery shopper" team, sent 24 identical gold pendants and chains (purchased for $175 each) to Cash4Gold.com and its competitors. The determined melt value of the jewelry was calculated at around $70 each when gold was above $900 an ounce. In comparison with Pawn shop and Jewelry store quotes (which ranged from $25 to $50), Cash4Gold.com quoted between $7.60~$12.72 melt value for the jewelry. Similar low quotes were also given by Cash4Gold.com competitors GoldKit (around $7.81~$20.59) and GoldPaq (around $8.22~$13.11).
When Rob Cockerham, a blogger, detailed drastic changes in Cash4Gold's valuation of jewelry after a complaint is made about an initial undervaluing, a search engine optimization consultant offered "a few thousand dollars" for Rob to remove the criticism. Cash4Gold CEO Jeff Aronson stated they had nothing to do with the incident, though the consultant stated "everyone (at Cash4Gold) was well aware of what was going on." On Cash4Gold’s blog, the company afterwards posted a “clarification statement” allegedly by the consultant contradicting that quote: “Cash4Gold was not aware of all of the tactics being using (sic) in my reputation management services.”
After a whistleblower posted on ComplaintsBoard.com discussing the inner workings of Cash4Gold.com, The Consumerist and other blogs were hit with a defamation suit by Cash4Gold.com after running the postings. In September 2009, Cash4Gold.com dropped Consumerist from their lawsuit.
Bankruptcy and New Management.
Cash4Gold filed for bankruptcy in July 2012 with its assets purchased by Direct Holdings Global for $440,000.
Direct Holdings Global instituted sweeping changes, including a new operations process and customer service center.
Advertising.
Super Bowl XLIII advertisement.
The Super Bowl XLIII advertisement featured Ed McMahon and MC Hammer, both of whom were well known for their financial troubles later on in their career. The 30-second advertisement was created and produced by Havas Edge (formerly known as Euro RSCG Edge) and directed by Super Bowl ad veteran Bryan Buckley and his Hungry Man Productions. Sources place the cost for the 30-second advertisement at $2.4-$3 million. Cash4Gold also played a 60-second ad in NBC's pre-game show, making it the first direct-response advertiser in that venue.
The spot received considerable news coverage and was seen by many commentators as a harbinger of the economic situation which was bottoming out in the United States at the time it aired. CNBC’s Sports Biz blog touted the Cash4Gold spot as “the most relevant ad in this entire Super Bowl.”
Commercial Sponsorships.
In the past Cash4Gold.com has signed sponsorships with Milwaukee Bucks, a multi-car sponsorship with JD Motorsports of NASCAR, Jim Dunn Racing of NHRA, and MMA competitor Randy 'The Natural' Couture.
In addition to sponsorships of Randy Couture, Cash4Gold also sponsored his charity, the Xtreme Couture G.I. Foundation which honors veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces
Cash4Gold sponsored MMA “Train the Troops” events at Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The event brought professional MMA fighters together with Marines to help them prepare for deployment. The three "Train The Troops" events were held at three Marine bases and included 12 pro fighters and trainers, as well as hundreds of Marines. There were six four-hour long training sessions.
Cash4Gold signed a one-year deal with UCMMA for their 2010 events, which adds to their interest in Mixed Martial Arts and sponsorship deals with Cristiane Santos ("The Cyborg"), Brandon Vera, Tim Kennedy, Gray Maynard, Leonard Garcia, and Damacio Page. UCMMA is an MMA organization based in the UK and has a history of more than 40 high profile, successful events.
Equity partner MC Hammer and Cash4Gold teamed up to donate resources to “Feed the Children” to help with relief efforts following storms in the Philippines, American Samoa, Indonesia and Georgia in the U.S. They also handed out meals to families affected by the recession in the Stockton, California area.
In December 2009, MC Hammer and Cash4Gold helped “Feed the Children” launch Breakfast2Live – “a new campaign to persuade schools to put on some early morning munchies to raise cash for developing countries and support more school breakfast clubs”.
For the 2009 holiday season, Cash4Gold and MC Hammer handed out toys at the Broward County, Florida Sheriff's Office’s annual "Toys for Tots and Teens" event. MC Hammer and Cash4Gold also helped Essie “Big Mama” Reed for her annual toy give-away, presenting hundreds of pre-selected children from local nursery schools with presents and taking photographs. They were partnered with the Fort Lauderdale Police Department and Fort Lauderdale Parks & Recreation.
Related businesses.
The Estate Buyer.
Cash4Gold launched a new division in 2009 called “The Estate Buyer” which caters to individual selling high-end jewelry from brand-name manufacturers. Unlike Cash4Gold, “The Estate Buyer” does not base its offers on the melt value of gold in an item, but upon reselling the items.
Operations for The Estate Buyer were not continued after the 2012 bankruptcy.
OroPorDinero.com.
Cash4Gold.com also offers a Spanish-language website called "OroPorDinero.com" which makes its services more accessible to Spanish speakers.
United Kingdom.
In July 2009, Cash4Gold launched their services in the United Kingdom, operating from processing sites in Sheffield, and within the first month, they received over 4,000 packets In 2012, the company was cited by the Advertising Standards Authority for misleading advertisements. 
Various UK media organisations have undertaken trials of Cash4Gold's UK service, and found their valuation greatly below the independently assessed fair market value. For instance, in November 2009, the BBC's "Newsbeat" programme had gold valued by an independent gold bullion dealer in Mayfair, London, at around £300. Three jewellers in Hatton Garden then offered similar amounts for the same collection; Cash4Gold's valuation cheque was for £63, raised to £100 when the researcher called to get their gold back.
Parody.
Cash4Gold has attracted parodies of their business and advertisement models. The Cats4Gold website parodies Cash4Gold by encouraging visitors to post their Gold in exchange for a cat or kitten (depending on the quantity of gold sent). South Park and That Mitchell and Webb Look have also parodied Cash4Gold and similar companies.

Charles N. Landon

Charles Nelson Landon (December 19, 1878 – May 17, 1937), also known as C.N. Landon, was an illustrator for "The Cleveland Press", art director for the Newspaper Enterprise Association and art editor of "Cosmopolitan". He is most notable as the founder of the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning, a mail-order correspondence course that trained a generation of leading syndicated cartoonists in drawing for publication.
Born in Norwalk, Ohio, Landon worked for "The Cleveland Press" from 1900 until 1912, managing the art department—and developing new talent—for the last five years of that time. Later, he became art director at the NEA syndicate. His involvement with his correspondence course, having begun in 1909, coincides with some of his time in both those positions.
Landon's comic strip artists.
While at NEA, he was able to train students through the correspondence course and then personally hire some upon graduation to draw features at the syndicate. Counted among Landon's most successful students were Carl Barks, Merrill Blosser, Gene Byrnes, Milton Caniff, Jack Cole, Roy Crane, V.T. Hamlin, Ethel Hays, Bill Holman and Chic Young. Their names were displayed in Landon's magazine advertisements which touted the accomplishments and high earnings of "former students who are now successful comic strip artists." No one was turned down for the course except applicants under the age of 15. Landon's main competitor was W. L. Evans.
In the case of Ethel Hays, Landon taught her by mail, subsequently hired her as a staff artist for "The Cleveland Press", then brought her to NEA to draw syndicated features. Roy Crane was another notable cartoonist whose investment in the course led to an assignment from Landon at NEA.
Charles N. Landon died in Cleveland at age 59. A facsimile edition of the Landon School course has been edited by John Garvin for the publisher Enchanted Images. It was reviewed by Erick Trickey for "Cleveland Magazine":
On completion of the correspondence course, students received a small booklet with tips on finding work called "How to Market Your Ability".

It's Nobody's Fault but Mine

"It's Nobody's Fault but Mine" or "Nobody's Fault but Mine" is a traditional song first recorded by gospel blues artist Blind Willie Johnson in 1927. The song is a solo performance with Johnson singing and playing slide guitar. It tells of a spiritual struggle, with reading the Bible as the path to salvation, or, rather, the failure to read it leading to damnation.
Blind Willie Johnson recorded "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine" in a time when illiteracy was common in the rural South. Blinded as a young child, Johnson was singing this song as a warning to those who had learned to read, but concerned themselves too much with earthly matters, but Johnson tries to point the way to salvation. He admits to having fault, and he blames himself for not taking advantage of the skill he has, reading, and saving himself. The context of this song is strictly religious. It is a melancholy expression of his spirit, as the blues style echoes the depths of his guilt and his struggle. An early review called the song "violent, tortured and abysmal shouts and groans and his inspired guitar playing in a primitive and frightening Negro religious song".
In performing this song, Johnson alternated between vocal and solo slide-guitar melody lines, using a bottleneck (or sometimes a jackknife) on the first and second or sometimes third and fourth strings. He also provided an alternating bass figure with his thumb.
Other versions.
"It's Nobody's Fault but Mine" has been interpreted and recorded by numerous blues and other musicians, usually using the title "Nobody's Fault but Mine" and often with variations in the lyrics or music. English rock band Led Zeppelin recorded "Nobody's Fault but Mine", which is credited to Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, for their "Presence" album. The following lists those versions credited as "Traditional" or to Johnson.

<doc id="21387879" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21387879" title="Pierre Le Roy">
Pierre Le Roy

Pierre Le Roy (1717–1785) was a French clockmaker. He was the inventor of the detent escapement, the temperature-compensated balance and the isochronous balance spring. His developments are considered as the foundation of the modern precision clock. Le Roy was born in Paris, eldest son of Julien Le Roy, a clockmaker to Louis XV who had worked with Henry Sully, in which place Pierre Le Roy succeeded his father.
Invention of the detent escapement.
In 1748, he invented a pivoted detent type of escapement, which makes him the inventor of the detent escapement: "The invention of the detached escapement belongs to P. Le Roy".
He was distinguished principally in his mastery and improvement of the clock and chronograph, above all of the marine chronometer, in which he carried forward the pioneering work of John Harrison. He took a different approach from that of Harrison, believing that the way to achieve seaworthiness was to detach the escapement from the balance. He also differed from Harrison regarding his temperature compensation method, which used the variation of the rotation radius of the balance by modifying the diameter of the balance through bi-metallic components, a method which would become a standard in chronometers. His technique for temperature compensation was highly efficient in that it worked without changing the length of the spiral balance spring, which he had discovered to be isochronous only at a precise given length (i.e. when frequency is independent of amplitude, so that a mechanical clock or watch runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so it keeps correct time as the mainspring unwinds).
Development of the modern marine chronometer.
After having designed plans in 1754, he constructed his first chronometers by 1756, and accomplished his masterpiece in 1766. This remarkable chronometer incorporated a detached escapement, a temperature-compensated balance and an isochronous balance spring, innovations which would be adopted in subsequent chronometers. Harrison demonstrated a reliable chronometer at sea, but these developments by Le Roy are considered by Rupert Gould to be the foundation of the modern chronometer. Pierre Le Roy's chronometer had a performance equivalent to that of the Harrison H4 chronometer.
In 1769 he was awarded the double prize offered by the Académie française for the best method of measuring time at sea. He succeeded in giving his instruments the greatest possible regularity by the discovery of the isochronous spiral spring, in which he was in competition with Ferdinand Berthoud, but which he published first.
He was the author of several valuable publications on the art and science of clock-making and chronography, among them the "Étrennes chronométriques" of 1760. He also became "Horloger du Roi" in 1760.
The work of Le Roy was not fully recognized in France however, and his contemporary Ferdinand Berthoud became more famous, obtaining the prestigious title of "Horloger de Marine", which left Le Roy desillusioned and led him to retire. He died in Vitry in 1785.

Fixed years

Fixed years (ru: Урочные лета, or urochniye leta) was the term used in Russian documents for the statute of limitations during which a run-away serf could be sought out and returned to his landlord. They were fixed at five years by an ukaz (decree) of Tsar Fedor Ivanovich issued on November 24, 1597. They were done away with as part of the Ulozhenie of 1649, where there was no limit on the time a serf could be sought out and returned to his estate.

Charles D. Anderson

Charles David Anderson (May 22, 1827 – February 22, 1901) was an American planter, businessman, legislator, and soldier. He served an an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, in which he was wounded three times. After the war Anderson was a tax collector in Georgia.
Early life and career.
Charles D. Anderson was born in 1827 near Stone Mountain, located in DeKalb County, Georgia. He was a son of William Robert Anderson, a farmer and son of an American Revolution officer, and of Annie Coker. Charles Anderson made his home in Fort Valley in Houston County, where he engaged in planting, worked as a cotton merchant, and was a slaveholder. From 1857 to 1858 Anderson served as a justice of the court in Houston County, and prior to the American Civil War he served as mayor of Fort Valley, Georgia.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began in 1861, Anderson chose to follow his home state of Georgia and the Confederate cause. He was elected captain in the 6th Georgia Infantry on May 27, and assigned to command of the regiment's Company C. That October he led the forces guarding Choctaw and Owen Bluffs in Alabama. Anderson participated in the Maryland Campaign in the fall of 1862, fighting during the Battle of Antietam on September 17. In the fight he was wounded and captured by Union forces, and exchanged later that year. Upon release Anderson was promoted to major, effective back to the date of the Battle of Antietam. That December he took part in the Fredericksburg Campaign. 
In 1863 Anderson participated in the Chancellorsville Campaign and was seriously wounded on May 3. He was hit in his shoulder, his abdomen, as well as his left hand, losing a finger in the process. On May 15 Anderson was promoted to lieutenant colonel, but due to his injuries he resigned his commission in the Confederate Army on January 20, 1864. Upon returning home to Georgia, Anderson was appointed aide-de-camp to Gov. Joseph E. Brown.
During the summer of 1864 Anderson was appointed colonel of the 5th Georgia Militia, and by May he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 3rd Georgia Militia Brigade. His force was sent to augment the Army of Tennessee following the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in late June, and served throughout the remainder of the Atlanta Campaign. On July 22 in the Battle of Atlanta Anderson's command was only lightly engaged. When Atlanta fell the militia forces were detached from the Army of Tennessee and served during Sherman's March to the Sea that winter. He was part of the Confederate attack in the Battle of Griswoldville on November 22, where "Leading his brigade, Anderson had his clothes riddled with bullets and his horse was shot out from under him; his coolness and precision in that unfortunate battle were marked." Anderson was indeed wounded in this fight.
Anderson and his force was part of the garrison defending Savannah, Georgia, in December 1864. Following the surrender of Savannah his militia brigade was ordered to Augusta, and his last assignment was to defend Macon. Although he did not know nor did he serve, Anderson had been elected to Georgia's state senate near the end of 1863, a term that ended in 1865 as the war came to a close. He also had been mustered out of the volunteer Confederate forces in January.
Postbellum career.
After the war ended, Anderson remained in Macon, where he operated a cotton warehouse as well as a running a farm supply business, and he was pardoned by the U.S. Government on September 25, 1865. When both adventures failed he returned to Fort Valley, Georgia, where he was the tax collector of Houston County. He died in Fort Valley in 1901, and was buried in the city's Oak Lawn Cemetery.

<doc id="21388157" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21388157" title="Harriette Moore">
Harriette Moore

Harriette Vyda Simms Moore (June 19, 1902 – January 3, 1952) was an African-American teacher and civil rights worker. She was the wife of Harry T. Moore, who founded the first branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Brevard County, Florida.
Early life.
Harriette Vyda Simms was born in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 19, 1902, to David Ira Simms, (a wood lathe worker), and Annie Warren Simms. Her family also consisted of her sisters - Valerie Simms and Mae Mebane; her brothers included George Simms, Arnold Simms, Rupert Simms and David Simms Jr. The family then relocated to Mims, Florida. As a youth, she spent summers working in Massillon, Ohio with her father. Simms attended Daytona Normal Industrial Institute in Daytona Beach, Florida. She later graduated from Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach with an associate of arts degree in 1941 and a bachelor of science degree in 1950.
Simms taught elementary school classes for many years, in Brevard County in Merritt Island, Florida and in Mims at Mims Colored Elementary School, and in Lake Park, Florida until her death. In Mims, she helped to cook lunch every day for the students.
Simms met Titusville Colored School principal Harry Tyson Moore while teaching classes in Brevard County. They married on December 25, 1926, and had two daughters, Annie Rosalea (known as Peaches), (1928–1972) and Juanita Evangeline (known as Evangeline, born in 1930).
Civil rights activism.
Soon after the births of their daughters, the Moores founded the Brevard County chapter of the NAACP, in 1934. Harry Moore later helped to organize the statewide NAACP organization.
In 1946, Harriette Moore and her husband were both fired by the public school system and blacklisted due to their political activities.
Murder.
On Christmas night, 1951, the Moores were fatally injured at home by a bomb that went off beneath their house. It was their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Harry died on the way to the hospital in Mims, Florida. Harriette died from her injuries nine days later.
Although the state called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate, no one was indicted for the bombing and murders of the Moores. The Florida Attorney General re-opened the investigation 54 years after the murders, at the request of the Moore family. In its 2005-2006 re-investigation, the State of Florida concluded that the murder of the Moores by bombing their home had been the work of violent members of a central Florida Ku Klux Klan group and it named the chief suspects. There were eleven other bombings against black families in Florida the year that the Moores were killed. 
The risk to activists and any blacks in the South was high and remained so; according to a later report from the NAACP's Southern Regional Council in Atlanta, the homes of forty black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some, like the Moores, were activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who had refused to bow to racist convention, or were simply "innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random white terrorism."
Honors.
Although the story of the Moores' lives faded into obscurity for many years, the late 20th century re-opening of the case provided a new appreciation for their work.
In 1999, Florida approved designation of the homesite of the Moores as a Florida Heritage Landmark. Brevard County started restoring the site. Supplemented by independent funding, by 2004 the county had created the Harry T. and Harriette Moore Memorial Park and Interpretive Center at the homesite in Mims. Brevard County named its Justice Center after the Moores and included material there about their lives and work.
Recent developments.
The State of Florida twice returned to the case, but was unable to file charges, as most of the men suspected to have been involved in the crime had died. In 1999, journalist Ben Green published a book based on his research of the case, "Before His Time: The Untold Story of Harry T. Moore, America's First Civil Rights Martyr."
In 2005, Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist re-opened a state investigation of Harry and Harriette Moore's deaths. On August 16, 2006, Crist announced the results of the work of the state Office of Civil Rights and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Rumors which had linked Sheriff Willis V. McCall to the crime were proven false. Based on extensive evidence, the state concluded that the Moores were victims of a conspiracy by members of a central Florida Klavern of the Ku Klux Klan. The report named the following four individuals, all of whom had reputations for violence, as directly involved:
The Moores' only surviving daughter, Juanita Evangeline Moore, joined former Attorney General Crist in the efforts to uncover the identity of her parents' killers. She is a 1951 graduate of Bethune-Cookman College and a retired government employee.

Recording thermometer

A recording thermometer is a type of thermometer that records temperature changes over a period of time. 
The recording thermometer uses a strip that coils and uncoils as the temperature changes. One end of the strip is attached to a long, light metal lever that holds a special pen. Tiny movement of the bimetallic strip causes much larger movement of the free end of the lever and the pen. The pen traces a rising and falling line on a strip of paper attached to a slowly turning drum. The drum usually makes one turn every seven or so days, so afterwards each strip of paper contains a complete and accurate record of temperature changes for a whole week. There are normally two types of metal on the bimetallic strip. Mostly one is steel and one is copper.Because these metals expand and contract at different rates.When one of these metals expand it curls tighter, when one contracts it uncurl slightly. When it curls or uncurls, the data is converted into electric signals, which record the temperature change.

The band's 2008 full-length album was awarded Local Album of the Year by the University of Western Ontario's campus radio station CHRW-FM. The band has received extensive college radio play across Canada, and were featured nationwide on CBC Radio programs "Radio 2 Drive", "Q" (including a live, in-studio performance), "The Vinyl Cafe" and numerous provincial programs.
"Olenka and the Autumn Lovers" have toured both East and West in Canada as a full band, with Krakus occasionally participating in a few solo tours. In addition to touring, the band has also been featured in numerous festivals including NXNE (North by Northeast), Pop Montreal, Halifax Pop Explosion, CMW (Canadian Music Week), Rifflandia, Stereophonic, In The Dead Of Winter, Home County Folk Festival, and LOLA (The London Ontario Live Arts Festival).
In the summer of 2010 "O&AL" recorded their second album, "And Now We Sing", which was released in October 2010. The album was recorded by Andy Magoffin at "The House of Miracles", with additional recordings by Simon Larochette at "The London Music Club". It was mixed by Andy Magoffin and Simon Larochette, and mastered by Joao Carvalho at "JCM".
The band recorded its latest batch of songs in the summer of 2012 with Simon Larochette at his studio "The Sugar Shack" (former home of Andy Magoffin's "House of Miracles"). The songs were mixed and mastered by Dan Weston. Seven songs from the summer recording sessions were released on the "Hard Times" EP, with the other three released digitally in October of 2012 and released on vinyl on the "It's Alright" 7inch in May 2013.

A fourth site doubles as an emergency shelter but is designed as a drop-in center which offers youth ages 14–21 services, including education, employment, substance abuse and mental health counseling. In terms of basic needs, the drop-in center serves as a safe place for young people to eat a meal, use the telephone, do laundry, get clothing, or take a shower. In 2009, Spectrum served 3,000 youths.
Awards.
In 2009, the National Network for Youth named the group "Agency of the Year." And in 2010, Spectrum's Counseling Program was awarded an Innovation Award in Substance Abuse Services (iAward) sponsored by the State Associations of Addiction Services (SAAS) and NIATx. Spectrum was chosen for this national award for its rapid referral and assessment program, which reduces wait times for outpatient services, such as treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.

Mark Rossini

Mark Rossini is a former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who played a role in trying to track al-Qaeda before its attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.
Role in tracking al-Qaeda operatives in the US.
"The Spy Factory", an episode of the PBS series Nova, included segments of interviews with Rossini, who described his experience serving as one of the two FBI liaisons to the CIA's Bin Laden Issue Station, an inter-agency team assigned to track Osama bin Laden and his associates. Rossini described being aware in January 2000 that two al-Qaeda members, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, had valid US visas. However, a CIA employee, Michael Anne Casey, stopped him from passing the information to FBI headquarters. Rossini knew that if he reported this information to his FBI colleagues he would be breaking the law. The two men turned out to be hijackers of American Airlines flight 77 on 9/11.
Rossini also claims Alfreda Frances Bikowsky, a manager at the Bin Laden Issue Station, covered for Casey by telling congressional investigators that she walked from her office to FBI Headquarters to deliver the information about al-Mihdhar having a US visa. FBI log books proved this claim false.

Tamarama Rock Surfers

The Tamarama Rock Surfers are an independent theatre company who operate out of the Old Fitzroy Hotel in Woolloomooloo, New South Wales, Australia, and beyond. Formed by a collection of local actor/surfers in 1998, they felt at the time there was lack of a platform for new voices in the industry. The story behind the name is that some of the founding members were regular board riders in Tamarama, a notoriously dangerous surfing spot known for its hazardous rocks. The name was to become a metaphor for the edgy and risky plays these performers were to produce.
As of 2008, over 133 shows, including 53 new Australian pieces, that have been seen by over 88,000 audience members
Not confined to the space, the TRS have also performed in the Studio venue of the Sydney Opera House
Programmed a year in advance, the subscription submission cut off is October, after which a selected panel of industry experts select the chosen pieces, their decision based on a number of variables.
Many talented Australian actors, both veterans and newcomers, perform in plays at the Old Fitzroy Theatre such as Bojana Novakovic, Beejan Olfat, Jeremy Cumpston, Simon Burke, Pippa Grandison, Toby Schmitz, Victoria Hill, Damon Herriman, Carole Skinner, Leah Vandenberg, Danny Adcock.
In addition, many notable directors have recognised the space as one of Sydney's finest intimate venues, among them David Field, Simon Lyndon, Jason Clarke, Brendan Cowell, Van Badham, Jeremy Sims.
2002 saw the introduction of the innovative 'late shows'. Running on Sunday nights after the scheduled performance, the space was opened up to a variety of performances such as cabaret, multi-media, music and dance.
2006 - A particular highlight of the season was Sue Smith's "Thrall", directed by current CEO Leland Kean, starring Peta Sergeant, John McNeill, Tamara Cook and Bryce Youngman. "Sue Smith's beautiful, evocative and erotic play understands the necessary seduction of narrative set-up but, even better, knows how to develop bigger and universal ideas inside the reductive machinery of plot. It's a grounded work in which the thematic ideas transcend the narrative" 
2008 was a mixed year for the Company with the success of Toby Schmitz's Cu*t Pi, and the sudden tragic loss of company member Mark Priestley
The 2009 season opened with the Philip Ridley play Vincent River, starring Beejan Land and Elaine Hudson to encouraging reviews, "In a period of heatwaves in Sydney (turning the Fitz into an oven) and the distractions of the Sydney Festival, these two have risen above all to grip audiences by the throat and not let go for a minute"
TRS continually collaborate with other independent production companies both nationally and internationally.

Brewster's Millions (1945 film)

"Brewster's Millions" (1945) is one of a number of adaptations of the novel of the same name by George Barr McCutcheon. In the original "Brewster's Millions", the hero was a stockbroker; in this 1945 version, Brewster is a returning GI. The seventh and most recent adaptation of "Brewster's Millions" in 1985 starred Richard Pryor as a minor league baseball player.
The 1945 film was banned in Memphis, Tennessee because the character of an African-American servant, portrayed by Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, was treated too well.
Louis Forbes was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.
Plot.
Montague L. Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall.
His deceased uncle has left him $8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees.
Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster & Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable.
Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down.
During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise. When Brewster's chartered yacht is disabled by a leftover U-boat mine, he escapes from his containment and makes it to the bridge to order the captain to radio for help. Brewster is ecstatic to learn that getting a tow from a passing Brazilian freighter to a nearby Florida port will cost him a huge salvage fee of over a few hundred-thousand dollars (which Brewster offers to double the amount asked by the foreign ship). He learns that this is all of the last amount of money to spend.
In the final scene, set a few days later as the deadline approaches, Brewster thinks he has met his goal, only to have his friends present him with $40,012 that they have recovered from his failed ventures. Luckily as the clock to the deadline strikes 12 noon, he is able to get rid of the money by paying the executor's fee, an old $10 debt, and the last $2 for a cab fare, just before time runs out. Having secured his inheritance of $7,000,000, Brewster then takes Peggy out saying that they have to go downtown to the nearest justice of the peace to get married right away. On the way out the door he is confronted by a door-to-door salesman. The salesman is trying to sell the item for 2 cents more than it can be bought at the store. For this reason, Brewster throws him out, thus proving that his actions over the last 60 days had not changed him.
Production.
Edward Small originally wanted to film another farce, "Are You a Mason?" and bought the rights off Paramount in 1942 intending to make a vehicle for Jack Benny. However there was confusion over European rights so he decided to adapt "Brewster's Millions" instead. He bought the rights in June 1944.
Garry Moore was originally cast but was replaced after one day of filming by Mischa Auer.
Reception.
Small remade the film in 1961 as "Three on a Spree". In 1970 he announced he wanted to make a TV series based on the film but it did not result.

Vitaly Gamov

Major General Vitaly Ivanovich Gamov (; 1962 - 28 May 2002), was a Deputy Commander of the Pacific Regional Directorate of the Border Guard Service of Russia. He was killed in his house after refusing to take bribes and allow poachers to outsource their recourse to Japan.
Gamov was born to the family of a kolkhoz truck driver in Gorny Gigant near Almaty, Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union. He graduated from the school of border guards and served mostly in the Russian Far East. He took part in the First Chechen War, was a commander of the South Kurily Border Guards, then Yuzhnosakhalinsk Group of Border Guards. He became a Major General at the age of 39.
On May 21, 2002 his Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk apartment with was burnt by a flaming torch and three plastic canisters filled with petrol thrown through the window. At the time of the incident Vitaly Gamov, his wife Larissa and his son Ivan were in the apartment. As Vitaly Gamov struggled to put out the flames, his son opened a door to escape. A gust of air swept into the room, causing the burning petrol to explode. Ivan managed to escape with only minor burns, but his parents were less fortunate. From Sakhalin, Ivan's 38-year-old mother was eventually flown to a hospital in Tokyo. There, she underwent months of treatment for burns covering her entire body. 
Ivan's father only made it as far as Sapporo, on the neighbouring Japanese island of Hokkaido. "Vitaly never passed out, though his skin was flaking," a neighbour told Reuters. "I led him to the ambulance. His skin was grey and tough like wood. It was an awful sight." A week later, Gamov died in the hospital.
On November 17, 2006, four and a half years after the deadly attack, three men (Alexei Anikin, Alexei Britov and Sergei Malyutin) faced a Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk court and were declared guilty of arson and manslaughter. The persecutors insisted on the charges of intentional murder but the court found that they were not proven. The accused were sentenced to four years in prison.

Death Weekend

Death Weekend (released in the USA under the title The House by the Lake) is a 1976 Canadian horror/thriller film. It stars Brenda Vaccaro and Don Stroud and was one of the first films from Canadian director William Fruet. The low-budget production was shot in rural Canada and at a studio in Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada.
As of April 2014, the film has never had a DVD release.
Plot.
Diane (Brenda Vaccaro) is a former fashion model who meets a wealthy gentleman named Harry (Chuck Shamata). After a whirlwind romance, she decides to accompany Harry for a weekend getaway at Harry's remote country house by a lake. It soon gets obvious to them both, that they are not made for each other and they start arguing. 
On their way to Harry's country house in Harry's sports car, Diane asks Harry to let her drive the rest of the way. They soon encounter a car load of four drunken thugs, led by Lep (Don Stroud) and get into a fit of road rage where Diane forces the punks off the road, wrecking their car. Little do Diane and Harry know that the angry gang follows them, looking for some vicious revenge against the arguing, unhappy and unarmed couple. After the gang rampages through a camping park looking for the car that ran them off the road, they find Harry's sports car at a rural gas station where Harry left it to be looked after by the two owners whom he bribed with moonshine, and then took a less flashy station wagon to the country house. After intimidating the drunk station owners to give them the location to where Harry lives, Lep and his friends drive off to their destination. 
The four thugs break into the lake house and hold both Diane and Harry hostage. Over the rest of the day and night, Lep and his three cohorts (Runt, Frankie, and Stanley), terrorize, harass, and humiliate their two captives from vandalizing the house to stealing Harry's speedboat and wrecking it. When Diane attempts to escape, Lep recaptures her and, as punishment, rapes her.
At nightfall, with the gang becoming out of control with drinking and smoking dope, Harry tries to confront the gang with a pump-action shotgun, but he hesitates shooting any of the gang, which results in Lep snatching the weapon from his hands. Lep then uses it to kill Harry as he attempts to flee from the house, and Diane is taken to a bedroom to be raped again, this time by Runt. Diane fights back and eventually kills Runt by slashing his neck with a shard of mirror glass and she manages to flee from the house. She later traps Stanley in the boathouse and sets it on fire, allowing him to burn to death. She then lures the pursuing Frankie to a nearby bog where he falls into a quicksand pit and drowns.
In the morning, Diane and the shotgun-toting Lep face off in a final confrontation in an open field where she attempts to hotwire and escape in Harry's car (with Harry's dead body in the front seat) as Lep tries to shoot her with the shotgun. When Lep runs out of ammunition, he climbs on top of the moving car to stop Diane attempting to drive away. The confrontation ends when Diane manages to shake him off the hood, and then runs him over, killing him. 
Diane drives the bullet-ridden car to the road where the car stalls on the side of the road. Finally, Diane, looking exhausted and dazed, exits the totaled car and looks down the empty road.
US Release.
The film was released in the USA by American International Pictures under the title "House by the Lake". At the time of release, there was some controversy over the films intense scenes of violence. Still, the film was released with only minor cuts to the original version. 
Home video releases.
Over the years, the film has gained some acclaim among horror film buffs and though it was released on VHS at one point by Vestron Video (under the title "Death Weekend"), the film has yet to receive a DVD release.
Alternate versions.
The US and English Canadian VHS releases are cut. Edited from the film was an additional shot of Lep on top of Diane as he attempts to rape her, a more graphic shot of Diane slashing Runt's throat, and a longer shot of Stanley burning to death.
However, both the French Canadian and Spanish VHS versions were released uncut.

Christmas thrush

The Christmas thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus erythropleurus "), ia a subspecies of the island thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus"). It is endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.
Description.
The Christmas thrush has a mainly dark grey-brown head, paler grey-brown throat and upper breast, with olive-brown upperparts. The flanks, lower breast and sides of belly are orange, with a white belly and vent. It is about 21 cm in length, with a wingspan of 34 cm and a weight of 55 g. Its bill, orbital ring and legs are yellow-orange. Males and females are similar in size and appearance.
Distribution and habitat.
The subspecies is now limited to Christmas Island. Between 1885 and 1900 it was introduced to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, where it was plentiful for many years on three islands of the main atoll as well as on North Keeling. However, between the 1940s and 1980s it became extinct there. It is commonly found in most habitats on Christmas Island, including rainforest and gardens. It is less common in Pandanus thickets, dense regrowth and post-mining wasteland.
Behaviour.
Breeding.
The thrush breeds mainly from early October until the middle of March, though there are records from other months. It nests in trees, tree ferns and sometimes on the ledges of buildings. The clutch size is usually 2-3, the incubation period is 18 days, fledging in 17–19 days. Several broods may be raised in a season.
Feeding.
It forages mainly on the ground, in leaf litter in the forest and forest clearings, as well as on lawns, for small invertebrates, including insects, snails and earthworms, seeds and fallen fruit.
Status and conservation.
In 2000 the population of the Christmas thrush was estimated to comprise some 4000 birds. The main threat to the subspecies, as well as to other Christmas Island endemic birds, is predation of its nestlings by introduced yellow crazy ants. It is listed by the Australian Government as being Critically Endangered.

Eastern mud turtle

The eastern mud turtle ("Kinosternon subrubrum") or common mud turtle is a common species of turtle found in the United States.
Appearance.
The eastern mud turtle is a small and often hard to identify species. It measures 3-4 inches in length. The carapace is keel-less, lacks any pattern, and varies in color from yellowish to black. The plastron is large and double hinged, and can be yellowish to brown, and may sometimes have a dark pattern. The chin and throat are a yellowish grey, streaked and mottled with brown, while the limbs and tail are grayish. The eye, or iris, of the eastern mud turtle is yellow with dark clouding, and its feet are webbed.
Ecology.
Eastern mud turtles dwell in ponds and other freshwater habitats. They feed mainly on insects and small fish. Raccoons are known to eat this species' eggs, while herons and alligators often hunt the adults.
Distribution.
Eastern mud turtles are found in the US states of Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
In Indiana, the eastern mud turtle is listed as an endangered species.
Subspecies.
The Florida mud turtle ("Kinosternon steindachneri") is no longer recognized as a subspecies of "K.subrubrum"

Eriophyllum mohavense

Eriophyllum mohavense, also known as the Mojave woolly sunflower or the Barstow woolly sunflower is a rare species of small annual flowering plant in the aster family,found only (endemic) in the Mojave Desert of California. It is 
Range and Habitat.
It grows in open loamy, gravelly, or clay soils of the Mojave Desert. It grows between 1,500 and 3,000 feet. It can be found in creosote bush scrub and saltbush scrub plant communities. It has been found in the northeastern edge of Edwards Air Force Base, Kramer Hills, Boron, around Harper Dry Lake, Opal Mountain, Cuddleback Lake, and Kramer Junction.
Growth pattern and Visual Form.
This is a tiny annual herb forming woolly tufts only 1 to 3 centimeters tall. It is covered with long wooly hairs.
Leaves.
There are a few lobed, pointed leaves at the base of the tuft, no more than a centimeter long each. The leaves are spoon-shaped, sometimes having 3 pointed teeth near the wider tip.
Flowers.
The plant produces cylindrical flower head just a few millimeters wide containing usually 3-4 bright yellow disc flowers. The phyllaries (green bracts surrounding the flower head) are concave. The disc florets have raylike lobes, but there are no true ray flowers.
Fruit.
The fruit is an achene about half a centimeter long including a short pappus.
Additional information.
This plant is illustrative of problems with conducting botanical inventories of annuals in deserts. Seeds may lay in the ground for years, waiting for the right germination conditions. Aboveground plants may be absent for years, creating the false impression that plants populations are no longer present.
It is threatened in almost its entire range, by military activities, grazing, off road vehicles, and energy development. It meets the criteria for listing to be protected, but as of 2014 has not been given legal protection.

Edwin F. Harding

Edwin Forrest Harding (September 18, 1886June 5, 1970) commanded the 32nd Infantry Division at the beginning of World War II. He graduated 74th among his classmates from the United States Military Academy in 1909, who included John C. H. Lee (12), Jacob L. Devers (39), George S. Patton (46), Horace H. Fuller (59), Robert L. Eichelberger (68), and William H. Simpson (101). His first field command, the 32nd division was the first American unit, after the Battle for Guadalcanal, to engage in offensive operations in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The 32nd was understrength, ill-trained, poorly equipped, and thrust into its first battle against seasoned Japanese units. The unit finally logged a total of 654 days of combat during World War II, more than any other U.S. Army division. They were among the first to enter the war and were still engaging attacking Japanese after the Armistice was declared.
Education and early life.
Edwin Forrest Harding was born on September 18, 1886, in Franklin, Ohio, the son of Clarence Henry (Larry) Harding, the manager of the Harding Paper Division of the American Writing Paper Company, and his wife Lilly, née Woodward. Forrest was educated at Franklin High School and Phillips Exeter Academy. He also spent a year at Charles Braden Preparatory Academy, a special preparatory school for the United States Military Academy at West Point. He passed the entrance examination and was appointed to West Point by then Secretary of War, William Howard Taft. He graduated from West Point in the class of 1909, which also included future generals George S. Patton, Jacob L. Devers, John C. H. Lee, Robert L. Eichelberger, and William H. Simpson.
Early military service.
Prior to World War II, he was in 1938 a Colonel in command of 27th Infantry Regiment. In 1941 he was promoted to Brigadier General and Assistant commander of the 9th Infantry Division.
Harding had an agile mind. He could quote T. S. Eliot or Tennyson or Kipling, and discuss history or astronomy like an Ivy League professor. Harding understood the modern military and had literally written the book on it. During 1934, Col. George Marshall was assistant commandant at Fort Benning and selected Harding as an instructor and put him in charge of the Infantry School's publications. He edited "Infantry in Battle", a book that codified new ideas on how to organize infantry in battle. Harding was responsible for planning the book and supervising preparation and editing of the manuscript.
The triangular division structure it described was composed of three regimental combat teams each supported by its own simplified support and command structure. The organizational structure emphasized speed, agility, a lower casualty rate, and adaptability. This contrasted with the square division structure of World War I which was designed for attrition combat characteristic of trench warfare. "Infantry in Battle" is still used as an officer's training manual in the Infantry Officer's Course, and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II.
World War II commands.
The 32nd Infantry Division had been scheduled to receive a year of training before it left the United States. It was authorized to have a peace-time strength of about 11,600 soldiers, but like almost all units in the National Guard and the Regular Army prior to World War II, was not at full strength nor was it assigned all of the equipment it was authorized. Training for many soldiers was incomplete.
Harding was a leader who exuded confidence. The 2nd Battalion of the 126th Infantry Regiment, was deployed on an extremely arduous flanking maneuver on the Kapa Kapa Trail over a divide toward Jaure. The total distance over the mountains to the Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was barely a goat path. The Kapa Kapa trail across the Owen Stanley divide was a "dank and eerie place, rougher and more precipitous" than the Kokoda Track on which the Australians were then fighting the Japanese. It was "one of the most harrowing marches in American military history."
In a first for World War II, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the 128th Infantry Regiment to be flown from Australia to New Guinea, the greatest distance the Air Force had airlifted men up to that time. When he learned how the trek across the mountain divide was so debilitating and lengthy, Harding requested that the remainder of the division be flown to the Buna area, to join Australian units in an assault on the main Japanese beachheads in eastern New Guinea. A local priest informed the Allies that there was a landing field on the western slopes and MacArthur ordered the rest of the 32nd flown across the Owen Stanley Range, becoming the first U.S. Army artillery flown into combat in the Pacific in World War II.
Attacked Buna.
With no roads through the jungle, the only way to keep the troops furnished with the food, ammunition and other goods necessary to operate against the Japanese was via airborne supply. This proved to be very problematic in the deep razerback ridges of the Owen Stanley Mountains. Because of a lack of parachutes, material was shoved off airplanes at a height of 40 or more feet, and were often damaged or completely lost due to mis-drops.
His division was tasked with attacking Buna on November 19, 1942. General Douglas MacArthur received intelligence from Brigadier General Charles Willoughby, who told MacArthur before the operation that there was "little indication of an attempt to make a strong stand against the Allied advance." The intelligence that led him to believe that Buna was held by about 1000 sick and malnourished soldiers. Harding was nearly killed before the attack began. He was on board a coastal trawler with his headquarters company when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Harding saved himself by diving overboard and swimming to shore. The attack destroyed many of the supplies Harding was relying on for the upcoming attack.
Combat stalemate.
Harding accepted MacArthur's decision to rely on direct air support in place of tanks or heavy artillery, and his troops were stopped cold by formidable Japanese field fortifications. With the only artillery support provided by a single 25 pounder battery with limited ammunition, the division was unable to make further progress against these positions. A stalemate ensued. When the 32nd Division failed to advance, MacArthur became so concerned about the lack of progress that he sent General Robert Eichelberger, commander of I Corp, to report on the situation. MacArthur famously said to Eichelberger,
Harding sacked.
Eichelberger and his staff flew into Buna, and on December 2, he inspected the left or westward-lying U.S. front, the Urbana Force. Two of his staff officers, Colonels Martin and Rogers, inspected the right flank, which was designated the Warren Force. They found the troops were ill with malaria, dengue fever, tropical dysentery, and other ailments. They discovered the men had few rations causing them to lose weight, and lacked hot meals, vitamins, and cigarettes. Some were unshaven, their uniforms and boots were dirty and in tatters, and they showed "little discipline or military courtesy." Having been on the front at Buna for two weeks with virtually no progress to show for it except for hundreds of casualties, their morale was very poor.
Eichelberger relieved Harding on December 2, 1942. (Harding and Eichelberger had been West Point classmates in 1909.) Eichelberger also sacked the regimental commanders and most battalion commanders. He replaced Harding with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron. "Some of the 32nd's officers privately denounced Eichelberger as ruthless, Prussian."
Eichelberger later noted that after he relieved Harding he "ordered the medicos to take the temperature of an entire company of hollow-eyed men near the front. Every member, I repeat, every member of that company was running a fever." Eichelberger found the men lacked even the oil and patches require to keep their guns free of rust. He put an officer in charge of supply who ignored all protocols to obtain whatever the men needed. Eichelberger conspicuously wore his three stars on his shoulders among the front-line troops, ignoring the rule that officers remove their insignia at the front because they will attract the enemy. He lost thirty pounds in thirty days at the front.
Martin later admitted, after some experience with the Japanese defenses, that had attacks been continued on the day he conducted his inspection, they would not have been successful.
Later commands.
MacArthur had initially promised Harding a new assignment elsewhere in the Southwest Pacific, but Harding was recalled to the United States a few weeks later. In 1943, he was made Commander of the Mobile Force in the Panama Canal Zone, and in 1944 Commander of the Antilles Department in the Caribbean, an unimportant assignment comprising 20 forts, camps and fields in the lesser islands from Cuba, Haiti, Costa Rica to Aruba, and portions of northern South America. In 1945, he was made Director of the Historical Division at the War Department for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There he oversaw the planning of the Army's comprehensive history of World War II. He submitted a plan on December 18, 1945, in which he estimated that the full historical series would contain about 120 volumes, although only 101 of them were described.
Harding retired after 37 years of military service in 1946.

World's Wonder View Tower

The World's Wonder View Tower is a tourist trap and roadside attraction located in Genoa, Colorado. The tower was built in the mid-1920s by C.W. Gregory (known as Colorado's P.T. Barnum) and his partner Myrtle Le Bow. The promoters boasted that it is possible to see six states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, New Mexico, and South Dakota) from the top of the tower. 
The tower is 65 feet tall. The site it was built on was confirmed in 1934 to be the highest point between New York and Denver. The tower is also a museum and vintage shop containing curiosities and novelty items such as a two-headed calf, an eight-legged pig, and more than 50,000 types of glass bottles. The museum also contains historic American West artifacts and weapons, Native American arrowheads and other artifacts, and fossils.

Dress of the Year

The Dress of the Year is an annual fashion award run by the Fashion Museum, Bath from 1963. Each year since 1963, the Museum has asked a fashion journalist to select a dress or outfit that best represents the most important new ideas in contemporary fashion. For 2010 the Museum broke with tradition by asking the milliner Stephen Jones, rather than a journalist, to choose an outfit; and again in 2014 when the fashion blogger, Susanna Lau of "Style Bubble", was asked to choose an outfit for 2013. The outfit is then donated to the Fashion Museum along with an Adel Rootstein mannequin to represent that year's total look.

Orbita mouse

The Orbita mouse, sometimes unofficially nicknamed the round mouse, is a wireless 3-axis rotating mouse. The patented mouse was developed by Australian company Cyber Sport, and was released in January 2009. The Orbita mouse is the world’s first mouse to combine rotation input with normal mouse controls.
Development.
An evaluation of mice currently on the market reveals a discrepancy between mouse capabilities and computer applications. In order to control these programs, often computer mice are augmented by other input devices, for example 3D motion controllers, such as 3Dconnexion, or alternatively, users combine a traditional mouse with keyboard mapping. The Orbita Mouse seeks to overcome these shortcomings by enhancing the capabilities of the mouse to fulfill all the demands of applications.
Features.
The Orbita mouse is a 2.4Ghz zero lag wireless, USB mouse. The cylindrical design allows the mouse to be spun 360 degrees for continuous scrolling or jogging, replacing the jerky up-down finger movement required by a traditional scroll wheel and enhancing user control. The mouse employs an electronic compass to detect rotation and maintain its orientation, and an optical sensor to detect normal mouse movement. The soft silicone shell encases all the buttons, aiding the user’s ability to grip the mouse. The mouse is powered by a Lithium Ion rechargeable battery. The design is intended to be ergonomic and enhance efficiency and productivity of users.
Functionality.
The Orbita mouse is compatible with both Mac and Windows. The mouse reports rotation as scroll wheel commands and so it can be used by CAD software, web browsers, and other applications where multiple functions are mapped to the mouse.
Reception.
The 3D navigation style provided by the mouse was met with praise. Comments have been noted by the press on its innovativeness and functionality. Atomic Magazine highlighted its unique design and stated that it “is very good at providing an alternative way to mouse around pro applications...or even more mainstream apps”. Other publications, including Proclockers, Engadget and Sound on Sound, have praised specific advantages of the mouse, such as improvements in computer navigation via rotational scrolling and easier manipulation of 3D objects.
However, by general consumers the mouse was met with some uncertainty, confusing the Orbita with the unpopular puck Apple Mouse due to the round shape. Yet, this perceived similarity was misguided, for while the puck mouse was round purely for aesthetics the Orbita mouse is circular in order to allow rotation and enhance ergonomics.

Striped mud turtle

The striped mud turtle (Kinosternon baurii) is a species of turtle endemic to the United States.
Etymology.
The specific name, "baurii", is in honor of herpetologist Georg Baur.
Geographic range.
Striped mud turtles are found in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
Description.
They have three light-colored stripes along the length of the smooth carapace. They can grow to 8–12 cm (3-4¾ inches) carapace length.
Habitat and behavior.
"Kinosternon baurii" is a common species found in freshwater habitats. They wander about on land more than any other mud turtle and can sometimes be observed foraging for food in cow dung.
Diet.
Striped mud turtles are omnivorous. They eat insects, snails, fish, carrion, algae, and plants.
Captivity.
As pets they are easy to care for, readily eating commercial turtle foods, feeder fish, worms, or if all else fails, turkey cold cuts. They tend to have ornery yet strangely endearing personalities and enjoy sunning themselves more than other mud turtles.
Reproduction.
They nest from September to June. The eggs, which are slightly over 2,5 cm (1 in) long, hatch 13 to 19 weeks later. The hatchlings are about the size of the end of a typical man's thumb and, unlike the adult turtles, have keeled carapaces.

George Fowler (politician)

George Swan Fowler (9 March 1839 – 1 October 1896) was a South Australian politician and a Treasurer of South Australia.
Fowler was born in Kilrenny, Fife, Scotland, son of James Fowler (ca.1794 – 9 December 1872), who kept a general store in Anstruther, and here George learned the fundamentals of business. His older brothers James and David emigrated to South Australia (in 1853 and 1854 respectively) and had founded the highly successful grocery business of D. & J. Fowler in Rundle Street, Adelaide when in 1859 James died. George emigrated shortly after, arriving in Adelaide in July 1860 and was accepted as partner in the firm, which retained the name of D. & J. Fowler. By 1865 business had grown to such an extent that they decided to confine themselves to the wholesale trade and opened a branch office in London and a head office in King William Street, Adelaide, of which George had control. His brother David died in England on 11 November 1881 aged 55, leaving George as the senior partner.
Fowler was elected, with John Cox Bray, to the seat of East Adelaide in the South Australian House of Assembly on 2 April 1878, and was re-elected in April 1881 but resigned on 7 June 1881, the day he was sworn in, and was succeeded by Thomas Johnson. He served as treasurer from 10 March 1881 to 10 May 1881 in William Morgan's ministry. Moderate on most subjects, he was a staunch advocate of free trade, opposing protective duties and unbalanced electorates. He castigated the raising of government loans without close study of movements in the London money market. In 1884 he failed to win re-election because of his temperance views (he was a teetotaller). He ran for election at the 1892 East Adelaide by-election but was defeated by John McPherson.
For a time, Fowler and fellow Scotsman William Murray, invested in a pastoral property, "Pandurra", north of Port Augusta. Fowler was active in the Sunday school movement; he served as deacon and treasurer and helped to form the Baptist Association and the aged ministers' fund. As president of the Baptist Union he aimed at dissolving church debts and started a building fund and a mission in India. He substantially funded the construction of the Glen Osmond Baptist Church and the reading room of the Glen Osmond Institute. Fowler died at his home "Wooton Lea" in Glen Osmond, South Australia on 1 October 1896; he was survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, and left an estate valued at £80,000.
Family.
George Swan Fowler married Janet "Catherine" Lamb (ca.1839 – 7 April 1922) on 1 June 1864. Among their children were

Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad

The Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad is a defunct shortline railroad based in Kentucky. Despite its name, it had no connections with Cincinnati, Ohio.
The Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad ran between Frankfort, Kentucky and Paris, Kentucky, with a major stop in Georgetown, Kentucky; a distance of . It was at Georgetown that it crossed the Southern Railway. 
Early days.
The Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad was originally known as the Kentucky Midland Railway. Construction of the route began at Frankfort in the early months of 1888, and reached Georgetown in June 1889, and Paris in January 1890. Some of the route laid upon the Buffalo Trace. The total cost of the construction was over $500,000. Its name changed to the Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad in 1899. There were efforts to extend the route to Mount Sterling, Kentucky and Alton, Kentucky, but it never happened. The total length of the railroad was .
When it started, the Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad had "serious financial reverses" before it even laid its first piece of rail. It even went into receivership in 1894. But by 1899 it was touted as a major factor in the stimulation of Frankfort's 1890s growth. The route between Georgetown and Paris helped distribute the local fine Bourbon whiskey to markets. On October 28, 1909 the F&C was almost purchased by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, but the Kentucky Railroad Commission objected and the sale was annulled on April 22, 1912. In January 1927 the railroad was sold in public auction, with its owners a collection of citizens of Frankfort and Lexington, Kentucky.
End of the Railroad.
On December 31, 1952, the Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad abandoned passenger service, as the advent of wide-scale automobile usage made passenger trains unprofitable. "The Cardinal" broke an axle on Christmas Eve, and for the last week of passenger service the F&C Superintendent A.E. Parker used his own sedan to transport what few passengers the F&C still had from Frankfort to Paris. The line between Georgetown and Paris was abandoned by the F&C in 1967; pressure by bourbon manufacturers kept the rest of the line active. The Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the F&C to abandon more of the line, reducing the line to Frankfort to Elsinore, Kentucky. A trestle bridge was damaged by a derailment in 1985, and the F&C could not afford to fix the bridge, leaving the F&C to close. By 1987 all the rails of the F&C were removed.
"The Cardinal" was eventually placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. It is currently at the Kentucky Railway Museum in New Haven, Kentucky. Another reminder of the F&C was its Georgetown Station, which still stands.

Oliver Lanard Fassig

Oliver Lanard Fassig (1860–1936) was an American meteorologist and climatologist who worked for the United States Weather Bureau initially as part of the Signal Corps of the United States War Department and later affiliated with the United States Department of Agriculture.
Oliver Lanard Fassig was born at Columbus, Ohio, on April 5, 1860, son of Mathias and Elizabeth (Lanard) Fassig. He attended Ohio State University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1882. He then studied at Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of American geologist William Bullock Clark, where in 1899 he received the first PhD in meteorology ever earned in the United States. His doctoral thesis was on the broad pressure relations of distinctive types of March weather over North America. On September 14, 1898, he married Ann Green McCoy, of Annapolis, Maryland.
Meteorological Service.
Dr. Fassig's official meteorological service began on January 12, 1883, when he entered the Signal Corps of the United States War Department in Washington, D.C. In May 1883, he was assigned to Fort Myer in Arlington County, Virginia for instruction, but returned to the Central Office for duty in January 1884. In December 1885, he was sent to New Haven, Connecticut to work as an assistant and study electrical methods at Yale University. In August 1887 he returned to the Central Office in Washington, D.C., where he worked as a bibliographer and librarian from June 1888 to February 1896. In 1889, he published an extensive bibliography titled the “Bibliography of Meteorology – A classed catalogue of the printed literature of meteorology from the origin of printing to the close of 1881”. He then served as an assistant in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and at Mount Weather, which is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. He was made chairman of the section on History and Bibliography of the International Meteorological Congress, Chicago in 1893. His contacts with meteorologists from abroad led him to take a year's leave of absence to study in Germany, 1896-7, where he took special courses at the University of Berlin and became a member of the German Meteorological Society. He was in charge of the Baltimore station from June 5, 1900 to July 14, 1905; May 31, 1907 to April 2, 1909, and August 10, 1912 to April 14, 1919. While in Baltimore, he gave instruction in meteorology at the Johns Hopkins University and wrote "The Climate and Weather of Baltimore". He was in charge of the station at San Juan, Puerto Rico, from April 2, 1909 to August 10, 1912, and April 14, 1919 to June 10, 1930, where he had general charge of the West Indian and Caribbean service. On leaving San Juan he came once more to the Central Office, this time as Chief of the Climatological Division, which position he retained until his retirement on June 30, 1932.
Dr. Fassig was a quiet, unassuming, unhurried scientist. His interests embraced many phases of science. Absolute fairness and sympathetic understanding characterized his dealings not only with his equals but with those under him. He had the courage to do what he thought right even at considerable personal sacrifice, as when he refused to enter politics on behalf of his chief.
Dr. Fassig died at the Emergency Hospital in Washington, D.C. on Sunday evening, December 6, 1936, as a result of being struck by an automobile on November 20, 1936.

In 1962 Falck co-founded the influential postwar British poetry magazine "The Review" with Oxford University schoolmates Ian Hamilton, Michael Fried, and John Fuller. Falck's poetry would later appear in the first issue of Hamilton's magazine "The New Review". In January 1984 he set up, and has from that date acted as chair of, the Thurlow Road Poetry Workshop. Among the poets to have brought their work to the fortnightly (now monthly) meetings of the group are Hugo Williams, Jo Shapcott, Ruth Padel, Eva Salzman, Adam Thorpe, Michael Donaghy, Don Paterson, Jane Duran and Vicki Feaver.
His 1989 treatise "Myth, Truth and Literature: Towards a True Postmodernism", attempted to re-think the entire foundation of Romantic art criticism since Kant. The first chapter is a sustained polemic against what Falck argued was the nihilism and ontological emptiness of post-modernism and post-structuralist literary theory. The next chapter offers, in opposition to Saussure, a theory of the origin of language based on onomatopoeia. One critic said:He offers a Neo-Romantic, expressivist view influenced by Shelley. His view is "not" self-expressivist, however, since it denies the epistemological notion of a detached subject and situates the human being in the world in the manner of modern phenomenology...Art, for Falck, gives ontological truth. The book makes constant reference to Kant, Coleridge, Schiller, Shelley, Blake, Keats and Goethe. Author Camille Paglia hailed the book as "revealthe future of literary criticism." 
Falck criticized W. H. Auden's didactic theory of poetry: "Responsible poetry therefore becomes a kind of war-time fruit-cake, with the raisins of escape thinly distributed in a daily bread of parable."

<doc id="21388997" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21388997" title="Invasion of Salamaua–Lae">
Invasion of Salamaua–Lae

The Invasion of Lae-Salamaua, called "Operation SR" by the Japanese, was an operation by Imperial Japanese forces to occupy the Salamaua-Lae area in the Territory of New Guinea 8–13 March 1942 during the Pacific campaign of World War II. The Japanese invaded and occupied the location in order to construct an airfield and establish a base to cover and support the advance of Japanese forces into the eastern New Guinea and Coral Sea areas. The small Australian garrison in the area withdrew as the Japanese landed and did not contest the invasion.
In response to the Japanese landings, a United States Navy aircraft carrier task force including the carriers "Yorktown" and "Lexington" struck the invading Japanese naval forces with carrier aircraft on 10 March. Supporting the carrier aircraft were eight B-17 bombers of the 435th Bombardment Squadron of the 19th Bombardment Group from Garbutt Field, Townsville, Australia and eight Royal Australian Air Force Hudson bombers of No. 32 Squadron from Port Moresby, New Guinea. The raid sank three transports and damaged several other ships.
In spite of the damage sustained during the air raid, Japanese forces successfully occupied Lae and Salamaua and began the construction of a base and airfield. Air units based at the airfield later supported an air superiority campaign against Allied forces at Port Moresby. In July 1942 after the Japanese abandoned plans to invade Port Moresby from the sea, the base at Lae-Salamaua supported the ultimately unsuccessful Japanese land offensive towards Port Moresby along the Kokoda Track.
Invasion.
To support the operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy assigned the heavy cruisers "Aoba", "Kinugasa", "Furutaka" and "Kako" of Rear Admiral Goto's Cruiser Division 6, the light cruisers "Tenryu" and "Tatsuta" of Rear Admiral Marumo Kuninori's Cruiser Division 18, the destroyers "Mutsuki", "Mochizuki" and "Yoyoi" of Destroyer Division 30, and "Asanagi", "Oite", "Yūnagi" of Destroyer Division 29, along with the light cruiser "" of Rear Admiral Kajioka Sadamichi's Destroyer Squadron 6, fueled by the fleet oiler "Tōhō Maru".
The invasion fleet left Rabaul on 5 March 1942, escorted by the four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, eight destroyers and assorted auxiliary vessels. The troop transports "Yokohama Maru" and "China Maru" sailed for Salamaua, while the transports "Kongō Maru" and "Kokai Maru", along with the auxiliary minelayer were destined for Lae. The Japanese landed on 8 March 1942 at Lae and Salamaua. At Lae, the Japanese landed without opposition. A small detachment of the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles and the staff of the R.A.A.F. radio station at Salamaua set about the demolition of key infrastructure elements and then withdrew into the hills towards Mubo. Initial air interdiction by Hudsons from No. 32 Squadron and four B-17's from Garbutt were ineffectual.
Salamaua-Lae Raid.
In the early morning of 10 March 1942, Task Force 17 aircraft carriers "Lexington" and "Yorktown" launched their aircraft from the Gulf of Papua off the southern shore of New Guinea. The Task Force had avoided detection by the Japanese, and the approach of their aircraft from over the Owen Stanley Range enabled the attackers to appear seemingly out of nowhere. The distance from which the planes were launched provided security for the task force and helped ensure surprise against the Japanese.
Approaching the northern landing areas, the attack commenced with the SBD Dauntless dive bombers of Lexington's Scouting Squadron 2 (VS-2), which struck the Japanese shipping at Lae at 0922. They were soon followed by Dauntless dive bombers of Bombing Squadron 2 (VB-2) and the Douglas TBD Devastators of Lexington's Torpedo Squadron 2 (VT-2), which attacked shipping at Salamaua at 0938 while the Wildcats of Fighter Squadron 2 (VF-2) strafed Lae and Salamaua. Salamaua was struck again some 30 minutes later by Yorktown's Bombing Squadron 5 (VB-5), Torpedo Squadron 5 (VT-5) and Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), while the Dauntless dive bombers of VS-5 attacked the auxiliary ships along the shore at Lae. 
Following the carrier aircraft strike, eight B-17 bombers of the 435th Bombardment Squadron flying from Garbutt Field at Townsville arrived and bombed the target area as well, causing further damage.
Three transports ("Kongō Maru", "Tenyō Maru", and "Yokohama Maru") were sunk. In addition, the light cruiser "Yubari", two destroyers ("Asanagi" and "Yūnagi"), the transport "Kokai Maru", the minelayer "Tsugaru", the seaplane tender , and the auxillery minesweeper "Tama Maru No.2" were damaged. "Tama Maru No.2" ended up sinking three days later due to damage inflicted by the raid. Two of the transport losses were awarded to the carrier aircraft, while the cargo ship was awarded jointly to the carrier planes and the B-17's.
The raiders lost one SB3-2 Dauntless dive bomber of VS-2, shot down from Japanese anti-aircraft fire. Two more SBDs were damaged and landed at Port Moresby on their way back. The remaining 101 of the 104 aircraft launched returned safely to their carriers. 
The raid sunk or damaged two thirds of the invasion transports employed. Higher casualties among the Japanese Army personnel were only prevented by the fact that most of the transports had been close to shore and could beach themselves. The psychologic impact was greater, putting the Japanese on notice that the Americans were willing to place their carriers at risk to oppose their moves in the region.

Chaff cutter

A chaff cutter is a mechanical device for cutting straw or hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage and fed to horses and cattle. This aids the animal's digestion and prevents animals from rejecting any part of their food.
Chaff and hay played a vital role in most agricultural production as it was used for feeding horses. Horses were extensively used in farming operations until they were replaced by tractors in the 1940s.
Chaff cutters have evolved from the basic machines into commercial standard machines that can be driven at various speeds and can achieved various lengths of cuts of chaff with respect to animal preference type. New chaff cutter machines include portable tractor driven chaff cutter - where chaff cutter can be in the field and load trolleys (if required).

Paracryphiaceae

The Paracryphiaceae are a family of woody shrubs and trees native to Australia, southeast Asia, and New Caledonia. Under the APG II system, this family contains two genera: the monotypic "Paracryphia", endemic to New Caledonia; and "Quintinia", with 25 species in the Philippines, New Guinea, the east coast of Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is placed in the euasterids II (campanulids) clade, but unplaced as to order.
More recent research suggests a relationship between "Sphenostemon" and "Paracryphia", and therefore the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website recommends the former genus be included in Paracryphiaceae. This site also treats this family as comprising the order Paracryphiales which is distinguished by the APG III system, too.

1998 Prankote massacre

The 1998 Prankote massacre was the killing of 26 Hindus in the villages of Prankote and Dakikote in Udhampur district of Jammu and Kashmir on 17 April 1998.
Background.
In 1990, the majority of the 250,000 Pandit population left Kashmir after being selectively targeted by Islamist terrorists. Most live in refugee camps in Jammu.
The Attack.
Survivors said that the killers struck when the villagers refused demands from the terrorists to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef. Seven members were charred beyond recognition when their house was set on fire.
The aftermath.
It took 10 hours for news to reach the authorities and security forces reached only after a day. Then Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah said "This a shocking incident. I have seen tragedies earlier, but this was bloodcurdling. No bullets were fired, the villagers were butchered."
The massacre forced migration of nearly 1,000 people to Reasi, Pouni Thanpal, Chasana and other towns of the district.
In April 2008, the alleged mastermind Abdul Haque alias Jahangir, a militant belonging to Hizbul Mujahideen, was shot dead by Indian security forces.

Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham

The Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham, sometimes the Evesham Chronicle, is a medieval chronicle written at and about Evesham Abbey in England. 
Contents and authorship.
It covers the history of the abbey from 714 to 1539, and the early sections from 714 to 1214 were probably mostly composed by Thomas of Marlborough, who was abbot from 1230 to 1236. An unknown continuator brought the work down to 1418. The earliest parts of the chronicle concern St. Egwin, and were probably written by a prior of the house, Dominic, sometime before 1125. Egwin was a bishop of Worcester who died in 717. Also included in the "Chronicon" is a narrative of the translation of the relics of St Odulph, and the life of St Wigstan.
The historian R. R. Darlington felt that the account of Abbot Æthelwig that is part of the chronicle was not written by Thomas, and instead was written shortly after Æthelwig's death, which occurred in 1077 or 1078. The historian David Knowles felt that the account of Æthelwig was written instead by Dominic, but concurred with Darlington that the section was not composed by Thomas. Yet another continuator extended the history of the abbots until 1539.
Printing history.
The "Chronicon" has been printed a number of times, once in 1863 in the Rolls Series, edited by William Dunn Macray. This edition, number 29 in the Rolls Series, is titled "Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham, ad annum 1418", but it includes the continuation until 1539. Extracts from the period 1035 to 1236 were edited by Liebermann in the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica". Another version, with the continuation down to 1539, was published in 1965 by the Vale of Evesham Historical Society. A new edition with facing translation by Jane Sayers and Leslie Watkiss was published in 2003.

<doc id="21389139" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21389139" title="Greenwich armour">
Greenwich armour

Greenwich armour is the plate armour in a distinctively English style produced by the Royal Almain Armoury founded by Henry VIII in 1511 in Greenwich near London, which continued until the English Civil War. The armoury was formed from imported master armourers hired by Henry VIII, initially including some from Italy and Flanders, as well as the Germans who dominated during most of the 16th century. The most notable head armourer of the Greenwich workshop was Jacob Halder, who was master workman of the armoury from 1576 to 1607. This was the peak period of the armoury's production and it coincided with the elaborate, colourful fashion styles and decorative art characteristic of late Tudor England. As the use of full plate in actual combat had declined by the late 16th century, the Greenwich armours were primarily created not for battle but for the tournament. As such, this was a workshop which catered primarily to the nobility; the book of Greenwich armour designs for 24 different gentlemen, known as the "Jacob Album" after its creator, includes many of the most important figures of the Elizabethan court.
By the time of the mid-17th century, plate armour had adopted a stark and utilitarian form favoring thickness and protection (from the ever-more-powerful firearms which were redefining battle) over aesthetics and was generally only used by heavy cavalry; afterwards, it was to disappear more or less completely. Therefore, the Greenwich workshop represented the last flourishing of decorative armour-making in England, and comprises a unique genre of late-Renaissance art in its own right.
Characteristics.
Henrician Period.
Although there were certainly English armourers at work before 1511, indeed they had their own guild in London, it seems that they were both unable to cope with large volume orders, and not able to produce work of the finest quality, and in the latest styles, found in Europe. A payment to Milanese armourers at Greenwich, of £6 2/3 and two hogsheads of wine was made in July 1511; they were under contract for two years from March 1511, and other payments record the setting-up of a mill and the purchase of tools. Greenwich Palace was still an important royal residence, the birthplace of both Henry and his two daughters. By 1515 there were six German master armourers, with (perhaps working separately from) two apparently Flemish masters, two polishers and an apprentice, all working under the English King's Armourer, John Blewbury, and a "Clerk of the Stable". All were given damask livery clothes. In 1516 the workshop moved closer to London (but still outside the city itself, where guild regulation might have been an issue) to a mill in Southwark, while construction of a new mill at Greenwich began. On completion of this in 1520 they returned to Greenwich. 
The first Greenwich harnesses, created under Henry VIII, were typically of uniform colouration, either gilded or silvered all over and then etched with intricate motifs, often designed by Hans Holbein. The lines of these armours were typically not much different from Northern German designs of the same time period; the decorations, though, were often more extravagant. A good example of this early sort of Greenwich style is the harness which is thought to have belonged to Galiot de Genouillac, Constable of France, but was initially created for King Henry. The armour, currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has a specially designed corset built into the cuirass to support the weight of the burly king's large stomach. This harness also has very wide sabatons in the Maximilian style. Very similar in design, but ungilded, is another tournament harness made for Henry VIII which now resides at the Tower of London and which is famous for its large codpiece.
Golden Age.
After the reign of Henry VIII, the Greenwich armour began to evolve into a different and unique style. There were several defining characteristics of this second wave of armour. One was the mimicking of popular fashions of the time in the styles of the armour to reflect the individual wearer's taste in civilian clothing. From 1560 cuirasses were designed to imitate the curving "peascod" style of doublet which was immensely popular among gentlemen during the reign of Elizabeth. This type of cuirass curved outwards in front at a steep angle which culminated at the groin, where it tapered into a small horn-like protrusion. All-over gilding or silvering was replaced by strips of blued or gilded steel, typically running horizontally across the pauldrons at the edge of each lame, and vertically down the cuirass and tassets, which emulated the strips of colourful embroidered cloth that were popular in civilian fashion. Some armours were provided with an extra pair of tassets for use at the barriers which were very wide, not unlike the form of a pair of trunkhose. The extant armours of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and that of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke currently display these tassets. The armour of William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester is also similarly styled.
Another defining characteristic of Elizabethan-era Greenwich armour is the extravagant use of colour in general to decorate the steel. Older styles of armour-making, such as Maximilian and Gothic, emphasized the shaping of the metal itself, such as fluting and roping, to create artistic designs in the armour, rather than using colour. The Greenwich style, however, came at a time when complicated decoration of the metal with colour, texture and embossed designs was fashionable across Europe. Greenwich did not produce the highly modelled figurative designs of some Continental centres, but specialised in bold designs using different colours to form vibrant, striking patterns. Colour contrast became extremely important, as it was in civilian fashion. The extent to which a suit of armour was decorated depended on the wealth of the buyer, and ranged from wildly elaborate and artistic pieces such as George Clifford's famous gilded garniture to relatively simple harnesses of "white armour" overlaid with intersecting patterns of darker-coloured strips. In either case, the use of contrasting colours became a hallmark of the Greenwich style.
There were three main ways in which the steel of the armour was coloured: bluing, browning, and russeting. Bluing the steel gave it a deep, brilliant blue-black finish., as the name would suggest, coloured the steel a dark brown, which contrasted vividly with gilding as in the harness of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Finally, russeting imparted a dark-red or purple hue to the steel, which was also typically used in conjunction with gilding. All of these base colours would be applied uniformly to the steel of the armour, and then strips of differently coloured steel would be laid across to create patterns, or etched sections of the armour would be gilded. The Earl of Worcester's armour is one striking example of a scalloped design which was originally gilded over dark blued steel.
The Greenwich helmet for the field and tilt has a distinctive form. The typical Greenwich helm is an armet with a very high visor perforated on one or both sides by vertical slits, in the case of a field visor, or with small round holes in the case of a visor for the tilt (most Greenwich armours came with both types.) The rim of the upper bevor juts out forward gracefully, giving the helmet a characteristic "ship's prow" appearance. It also typically has a high raised comb from the rear of the skull extending up to the top of the visor, a feature influenced by the French style.
Finally, Greenwich armours were often made in the form of a garniture, which meant a large set of interchangeable armour pieces, referred to as pieces of exchange, with the same design which could be arranged to form a suit for either mounted combat such as jousting, or combat on foot in the tournament. A garniture would typically include a full plate harness plus an extra visor specially meant for tilting; a burgonet helmet which would be worn open-faced for a parade or ceremony, or with a removable "falling-buffe" visor for combat; a grandguard, which would reinforce the upper portion of the torso and neck for jousting; a passguard, which would reinforce the arm; and a manifer, a large gauntlet to protect the hand. It might also include a shaffron, which would cover the head of the knight's horse, and a set of decorated saddle steels.
Stuart Period.
The Greenwich workshop continued producing armours into the reign of James I and Charles I, although the heyday of grand tournaments and exaggerated chivalric pageantry which characterized Elizabethan England had largely passed after the death of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. This transition can be seen in the styling of the post-Jacobean Greenwich armour; gilded decoration and etching is now absent, and the steel is no longer russeted, polished "white" or boldly colored in any other way but is uniformly a simple blue-gray shade. Tassets are now frequently knee-length, in the cuirassier fashion. Also, in keeping with innovations in the field of armouring, the inner elbows are often fully protected by articulated lames. Nevertheless the Greenwich armours even into the period of the English Civil War retained some of the distinctive touches of the last century; the breastplates were still shaped in the peascod fashion and the pauldrons had the same graceful and rounded curves (while those of Continental armours tended towards square shapes). The "ship's prow" form of the close helmet also remained, and can be seen in many portraits of important military figures from the English Civil War.
The Jacob Album.
An album, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, was drawn up by Jacob Halder which contains full-colour illustrations of twenty-nine different Greenwich armours for various Elizabethan gentlemen of high rank; many of the armours are part of large garnitures with the additional pieces of exchange also depicted. The album displays a picture of each customer standing in the same stylized pose, with right hand on hip and left hand holding a staff of office, and wearing the armour which was to be furnished for him. The wearers listed in the album include some of the most illustrious and powerful nobles of Elizabeth's court. Among them are Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester; William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, Sir Thomas Bromley, Lord Chancellor of England; Sir Christopher Hatton, who succeeded Bromley as Lord Chancellor and was also rumored to be Queen Elizabeth's lover; Sir Henry Lee, Queen Elizabeth's first official jousting champion; and George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, the Queen's second official champion and also an important naval commander who briefly captured Fort San Felipe del Morro.
Other notable figures whose suits of armour are displayed in the album are Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (then "Lord Buckhurst", which survives in the Wallace Collection in London), who served as Lord High Treasurer but is perhaps best known as the co-author of "Gorboduc", one of the first tragedies written in blank verse, and Sir James Scudamore, a gentleman usher and tilting champion who was the basis for the character "Sir Scudamour" in "The Fairie Queene" by Edmund Spenser. One of the armours in the album is labeled as being for "John, Duke of Finland" - the future king John III of Sweden, who visited England in 1560 to promote a marriage between Queen Elizabeth and his brother Eric.
Another design is for a man named Bale Desena, the identity of whom remains a mystery to this day. This man was likely not an Englishman, as his name (which is probably misspelled in the album) suggests Spanish or Italian origin. It is unknown how he commissioned a Greenwich armour, though these armours were sometimes given to foreigners as gifts. Christian of Brunswick, cousin and friend to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, was given a beautiful gilded Greenwich armour which remained in the family of the Dukes of Brunswick before ultimately being purchased by Ronald Lauder.
Twenty-three of the twenty-nine armours in the album all belong to different individuals; Robert Dudley, Christopher Hatton and Henry Lee, probably owing to their status as favourites to Queen Elizabeth, all had two suits of armour each, in addition to large garnitures with many extra pieces. Several of the armours depicted in this album survive to the present day. The armours of Robert Dudley, William Somerset, and William Herbert are all at the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London, and Christopher Hatton's armour is at the Royal Armouries gallery in Leeds, along with the half-harness (the only one in the album) of a notable soldier, tactician and military writer of the Elizabethan era named John Smythe. The complete garniture of George Clifford is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, along with the armours of Sir James Scudamore and Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke.
When compared with extant examples of the armour to which they correspond, the drawings in Jacob Halder's album are nearly exact representations of the designs of the finished product. There is only one major difference, which is that the drawing for the armour of William Somerset, Earl of Worcester, shows a deep red russeted background with scalloped and gilded bands over it, whereas the portrait of the Earl clearly shows a black background. Other than that, the design matches the armour perfectly, including even the maille shoes. Several of the garnitures in the album feature an identical design - a series of gilt bands in a snaking S-shape pattern overlaid with interlacing diagonal lines in an X pattern, sometimes described as representing lightening, over a background of deeply russeted steel of a purplish colour. The garnitures with this design are those belonging to Sir James Scudamore, William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Thomas Sackville. However, comparison with surviving pieces shows that some details of the construction, such as the number of lames in a piece, are often different from the finished work - perhaps suggesting that the makers of the basic pieces were more free or ready to improve on designs as they worked than those working on the decoration.

Orlando Meléndez

Orlando Meléndez, a.k.a. "El Gato" (The Cat) (born February 14, 1979), is the first Puerto Rico-born basketball player ever to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.
Early years.
Meléndez was born in the City of Ponce, Puerto Rico, but lived and was raised in the town of Juana Díaz, where he also received his primary and secondary education. When he was 14 years old, he would go home after school and with his basketball under his arm make take a 2-mile jog through the sugar cane fields every day to the nearest basketball court and practice the sport with the local kids. Running was in his blood since father used to run marathons, and his grandfather is a track and field expert.
He always grabbed a snack to eat during his trek and would drop crumbs along the way. As a result, whenever he arrived at the court he would be accompanied by an entourage of cats, thus his nickname "El Gato" (the cat). Melendez tried out for his Juana Díaz high school basketball team and was accepted. Through an exchange student program, he was able to play at McDowell High School in Marion, North Carolina, where he finished his senior year.
North Carolina Tar Heels.
In 1997, Meléndez was awarded a scholarship to the University of North Carolina. There he began his college basketball career by playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels, where he appeared in the Final Fours in 1998 and 2000. From 1998 to 2007, Melendez played for UNC and professionally in Europe and Puerto Rico. He played for:
Harlem Globetrotters.
In 2007, Sam Worthen, the former Chicago Bulls and New Orleans Jazz guard, coached professionally in Puerto Rico. He also coached the Washington Generals the perennial Globetrotters punching bag. Worthen, impressed with Meléndez's ability to play and entertain suggested Meléndez try out for the Globetrotters after the two had bumped into each other outside the San Juan apartment building in which they both lived.
In 2008, Meléndez became the first Puerto Rico-born basketball player ever to play for the Harlem Globetrotters. He was not however, the first Hispanic of Puerto Rican descent to play for the Globetrotters. That distinction belongs to Orlando Antigua, whose mother is Puerto Rican and who in 1995 made Globetrotters history by becoming the first Hispanic and non-black to play for the team.
Meléndez whose position is that of "power forward", injured his knee during training camp. He had surgery to repair a torn lateral meniscus. Meléndez was well enough for the start of the December 26 domestic season.
Awards/Achievements.

His hope is to broaden the market of Japanese sake - bringing its taste to other parts of Asia, Europe, and North America - and to revive sake as the national, cultural drink of Japan. Harper is the author of two books on sake: "The Insider's Guide to Sake" (Kodansha International, 1998, ISBN 978-4-7700-2076-5), and "The Book of Sake: A Connoisseurs Guide" (Kodansha International, 2006, ISBN 978-4-7700-2998-0).
Early Life and Career.
Philip Harper was born in 1967 in Birmingham and was raised in Cornwall County, England, United Kingdom. In 1988, Harper earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature at Oxford University. After graduation, he moved to Osaka, Japan to participate in the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme (JET) where he taught English in public junior and high schools for two years. Harper, already a fan of European alcohol, was introduced to Japanese sake by his teaching colleagues at a party. He then joined a sake drinking club and frequented taverns in the Osaka area. 
After completing his two-year contract with the JET program, Harper opted to stay in Japan while working days at an English conversation school and nights at a local tavern. In 1991 he was introduced to Ume no Yado, a traditional Japanese sake brewery in a rural town within Nara Prefecture. There Harper worked as a general laborer. He spent his first year milling, machine-polishing, and bagging brown rice. He learned how to steam the rice in his second year. By his third year, he was put in charge of cultivating "koji" mold which allows the rice to ferment into sake. During the next ten years, Harper would spend every day during the sake brewing season - October through April - working at Ume no Yado. The owner of the brewery enrolled Harper in sake brewing classes and gave him material to study to improve his sake-making knowledge. Harper married a Japanese woman shortly after he began his work at the brewery. His marriage ceremony was his only day off during his ten-year employment at Ume no Yado. 
Harper published his first book in 1998 entitled "The Insider's Guide to Sake". The book drew on his years of experience in consuming and making sake. The small book, which by 2008 had sold over 20,000 copies, contains information about various types of sake including "nigori", "dai-ginjo", "ginjo", and "hon-jouzu". The book is targeted at novice-level overseas enjoyers of sake and thus contains many pictures and labels of the various drinks.
Becoming a Toji.
In 2001, Harper took and passed the Nanbu Brewer's Guild Exam thus earning him the title of "toji" or master sake brewer. This title has also earned him a place in Japanese history as Harper is the first and only non-Japanese to have earned the prestigious title. Also in 2001, Harper left Ume no Yado and began working at Daimon Brewery. Over the ensuing years, Harper worked at various breweries in Ibaraki, Osaka, and Kyoto.
From his experience working in Japanese sake breweries, Harper realized that sake needed to reach a wider audience in order to survive the modern world of liquor enthusiasts. To that end, he published his second book in 2006 entitled "The Book of Sake: A Connoisseurs Guide" with the intended audience being both national and international sake drinkers. This book, much like the one written before it, gives a guide to the many varieties and flavors of traditional Japanese sake but is aimed at a more refined audience than the previous work.
Current career.
In 2008, Kinoshita-Shuzou Brewery's master brewer died after 45 years of faithful service. The owner considered closing the brewery until Harper was recommended, and then hired, as a replacement. Harper used his expertise in brewing to create his own brand of sake for the brewery. He named it "Fukubukuro" after the gift bags sold during Japanese New-Years.
By 2009, Harper had received many awards both in Japan and the U.S. for his excellent brands of sake. Harper continues to brew sake at Kinoshita-Shuzou, hoping to spread the taste of the traditional Japanese drink throughout the world and revive the brew in its homeland.

Bear Lake (Washington)

Bear Lake is a lake in King County in Washington, United States. It is the source of the Taylor River.
The lake can be reached by hiking from Deer Lake along the Snoqualmie Lake Trail which eventually traverses into the Miller River system and reaches the shore of Lake Dorothy.
The lake is located just upstream from Deer Lake. The Taylor River actually drops over a small waterfall after exiting the lake which is said to be visible from across Deer Lake.

Lift (soaring)

Lift is a meteorological phenomenon used as an energy source by soaring aircraft and soaring birds. The most common human application of lift is in sport and recreation. The three air sports that use soaring flight are: gliding, hang gliding and paragliding. 
Energy can be gained by using rising air from four sources:
In dynamic soaring it is also possible to gain energy, though this uses differences in wind speeds rather than rising air.
Thermals.
Thermals are columns of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight. If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds. 
Thermal lift is often used by birds, such as raptors, vultures and storks. Although thermal lift was known to the Wright Brothers in 1901, it was not exploited by humans until 1921 by William Leusch at the Wasserkuppe in Germany. It was not until about 1930 that the use of thermals for soaring in gliders became commonplace.
Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot flies in circles to keep within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying off to the next thermal and towards the destination. This is known as "thermalling". Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating cloud streets. These can allow flying straight while climbing in continuous lift.
When the air has little moisture or when an inversion stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Typical locations to find thermals are over towns, freshly ploughed fields and asphalt roads, but thermals are often hard to associate with any feature on the ground. Occasionally thermals are caused by the exhaust gases from power stations or by fires.
As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is only effective in mid-latitudes from spring through into late summer. During winter the solar heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.
Ridge lift.
Ridge lift, or Orographic lift, is caused by rising air on the windward side of a slope. Ridge lift is used extensively by sea birds and by aircraft. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft.
With winds of 20 to , it is possible for aircraft to soar at an altitude up to two times the height of the obstacle. Ridge lift can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. 
Wave lift.
Lee waves occur when a wind of blows over a mountain. Provided that there is a steady increase in wind strength with altitude without a significant change in direction, standing waves may be created. They were discovered by a glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933.
These waves reach heights much greater than the original obstruction and so can permit gliders to climb to the stratosphere. Pilots use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia because gliders do not have pressurized cockpits. This lift is often marked by long, stationary lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind.
A mountain wave was used to set the record for highest altitude by a glider when Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldson, wearing pressure suits, soared to an altitude of on August 29, 2006 over El Calafate, Argentina in their modified DG-505. The current world distance record of 3,008 km (1,869 statute miles) by Klaus Ohlmann (set on 21 January 2003) was also flown using mountain waves in South America.
A rare wave phenomenon is known as Morning Glory, a roll cloud producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria make use of it in springtime.
Birds have been observed using wave lift to cross mountainous regions.
Convergence zones.
The boundaries where two air masses meet are known as convergence zones.
These can occur in sea breezes or in desert regions. A sea-breeze (or onshore breeze) is a wind from the sea that develops over land near coasts. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary like a shallow cold front along a shear line. This creates a narrow band of soarable lift with winds as light as . These permit the gaining of altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.
Dynamic soaring.
In dynamic soaring energy is gained by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity rather than by rising air. Such zones of high "wind gradient" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders, but Albatrosses and model gliders use this phenomenon.
Illusions of lift.
A pilot can create an indication of lift on certain uncompensated instruments by entering a climb by pulling back on the stick (hence “"stick" thermal”). This is not true lift, in that the energy to climb is being converted from decreasing airspeed, rather than being extracted from rising air. Inexperienced pilots can mistake this for actual lift.
