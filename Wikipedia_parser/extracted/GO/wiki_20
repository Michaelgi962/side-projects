Chameleon goby

Tridentiger trigonocephalus, the chameleon goby, is a species of ray-finned fish native to marine and brackish waters along the coasts of eastern Asia. It has also spread to other parts of the world where it is found in waters with varying degrees of salinity.
Description.
The chameleon goby can reach total length. It is pale greyish-brown with a white-speckled head and two longitudinal black bands extending along the flank from the head to the caudal peduncle. The two dorsal fins may be speckled with white and have a brown longitudinal stripe, and the anal fin an orange or grey band across the centre. Under certain circumstances, this fish can darken in colour so that the black bands are nearly invisible. It is very similar in appearance to the Shimofuri goby ("Tridentiger bifasciatus"), but it has no white spots on the underside of its head and has a white margin to the second dorsal fin and the anal fins. "T. bifasciatus" has white spots on both the upper and lower part of the head and an orange-red margin to the second dorsal fin and the anal fins, but lacks the distinctive stripes that "T. trigonocephalus" has on these fins. "T. bifasciatus" prefers waters with a salinity of less than 22 parts per thousand, while "T. trigonocephalus" prefers higher salinities.
Distribution and habitat.
The chameleon goby is native to the eastern coast of Asia where its range includes Japan, Korea, China and Siberia. There have been reports that it has been found in the Mediterranean Sea near the coasts of Israel and in the Black Sea, and it has also been inadvertently introduced to the coastal waters of California and Australia. It is a demersal fish, living and feeding near the seabed, both in bays and rocky coasts, in brackish water and freshwater lakes. It typically hides in crevices, under stones, in burrows or among seagrasses.
Biology.
The chameleon goby is mainly nocturnal and feeds mostly on invertebrates such as polychaete worms which it extracts from the sediment. It also consumes crustaceans including skeleton shrimps and crab larvae. Breeding takes place at intervals throughout the spring and summer. The male prepares a nest in a crevice, a mollusc shell or even a discarded bottle or can.
Invasiveness.
The chameleon goby was first detected in Los Angeles harbor in 1960 and was later found at other locations in California including Redwood City docks, the tidal lagoon of Lake Merritt in Oakland and San Diego Bay. It has also been reported from Australian waters. Possible means of introduction include being transported in a ship's ballast water, as a result of the commercial trade in Pacific oysters, or as eggs among the fouling organisms on the hull of a vessel. As an invasive species it is likely to compete with native species.

Simon Youth Foundation

Simon Youth Foundation (SYF) is a non-profit, 501 (c)(3) organization that supports efforts in the United States to improve the national academic dropout rate and increase college accessibility by partnering with established public school systems. The foundation's parent company is the Simon Property Group. Although SYF works closely with Simon Property Group, it is not a corporate or grant-making foundation. SYF is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Its current CEO is J. Michael Durnil, Ph.D.
Mission.
The mission of SYF is to “foster and improve educational opportunities, career development, and life skills that transform the lives of at-risk youth through focused programs and initiatives with our public school and post-secondary education partners.”
History.
In 1997, executives of Simon Property Group and Simon family members (Deborah J. Simon, specifically) began discussing the need for an initiative to improve education on the national level for at-risk youth. 
Simon Property Group established a committee to develop the idea of using Simon Malls as a location for alternative education. According to SYF, "The concept of placing schools in malls grew out of the belief that many at-risk students could and would graduate if provided the right support." In 1998, SYF became an independent, non-profit organization. Working with a public school district in San Antonio Texas, SYF launched its first alternative school at Rolling Oaks Mall. By the end of 1998, the Century III Mall opened its own program in association with the fifteen school districts that surround West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.
In 2000, SYF established a scholarship program. As of 2012, SYF has awarded $10 million to 3,300 students from 42 states. A new report is upcoming. 
Programs.
SYF’s efforts to improve the national drop-out rate and increase access to college are two-fold: through Simon Youth Academies and scholarships. Academies are alternative schools developed as a partnership between SYF and one or more public school districts. Academies are located primarily in Simon Malls. 
Academies differ from traditional schools in small class sizes, shorter class days, and use of technology. Students who are "at-risk" of not finishing school on time, or at all, can attend Academies and earn their high school diplomas.
In 2009-2010, the Academies program enrolled 3,359 students and had a graduation rate of 91%. Since 1998, 19,757 students have enrolled in Academies with a 90% cumulative graduation rate.
Awards and recognition.
SYF has received several awards and notable mentions for its efforts in education. In 2008, SYF’s partnership with CVS Caremark to offer job- and life-skills training and internships was selected as a finalist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Business Civic Leadership Center’s Partnership Award. SYF was also honored by the Education Commission of the States (ECS) that same year, along with receiving two Albert Sussman International Community Support Awards from International Council of Shopping Centers Foundation. The Crystal Star Award of Excellence in Dropout Recovery, Intervention and Prevention was presented to SYF on November 9, 2008 by the National Dropout Prevention Center/Network and the ERC program was honored as an “Exemplary Program” in 2009. In 2010, SYF was awarded Honorable Mention Community Partnership Award by the Mutual of America Foundation.

Suzanne Lacore

Suzanne Lacore was a French politician representing the SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International). She was born on 30 May 1875 in Beyssac (Corrèze, France); she died on 6 November 1975 in Milhac d'Auberoche (Dordogne, France).
Childhood and Education.
Suzanne Lacore was born to a rather well-off family. In 1887, she was sent to a boarding school run by nuns, preparing girls to the "Brevet élémentaire" ((French), approximately equivalent to the present British "GCSE" (General Certificate of Secondary Education) / Scottish "Standard Grade"), while giving them a substantial catholic education. Having passed this examination, she then passed in the competitive entrance examination for the "École normale d'institutrices" ((French), a school specifically intended to educate future primary school teachers), where she studied for three years (1891-1894) and passed the "Brevet supérieur".
Career.
In early life, Suzanne Lacore was a teacher (as of 1894) and, later – uninterruptedly until she retired (in 1930) –, head teacher of a primary school in the Dordogne. She managed her political activities alongside her teaching career.
She became a militant socialist in 1906. At that time, she was the only woman in her area to be a member of a political party. She was leader of the "Comité national des femmes socialistes" ((French) "National committee of socialist women") and wrote articles for local, regional and national newspapers.
On 4 June 1936 she became one of three women ministers in the Front populaire ((French) "Popular Front"), along with Cécile Brunschvicg and Irène Joliot-Curie, at a time when women could neither vote nor be elected. She was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Child Protection in Léon Blum's first government, reporting to Henri Sellier. She remained in office until June 21, 1937.
During her tenure, in addition to a reform of the "Assistance Publique" ((French) "Social care for abandoned children"), Suzanne Lacore, as a Minister, thought up a comprehensive set of measures relating to deficient children, deprived children, and to leisure. She instituted the "visiteuses sociales" ((French) "female social visitors") and training courses for young female workers. She also took measures to give support to abandoned children.
Afterwards, Suzanne continued to publish booklets, to write newspaper articles and to make speeches. In particular, she stressed the benefits of nursery schools, demonstrating why it was important for a child to be educated from an early age. Her last book was published when she was 75. There are several streets, schools and nurseries named after her in France.
Personal commitments.
All her life, Suzanne Lacore campaigned for women and children’s rights. In her speeches and newspaper articles, and in several books (see below), she expounded her socialist ideas as regards equality between women and men
"The complete liberation of women remains, in our mind, subjected to the revolutionary solution that will emancipate the workers' proletariat"
"The inferiority of women is a man-made concept ; it is not the echo of a natural law."
and child protection. Her efforts at improving the condition of juvenile offenders laid the foundations for the abolition, in 1945, of the "maisons de correction" ((French) literally "correction houses"), tough juvenile institutions where children were treated cruelly. She used to say : 
"The guilty one is not the child. The guilty one is society who has not given the child (who has often been mistreated) the help he/she needs".
Assessing the causes of wars, she came to the conclusion that "war is the inevitable outcome of the capitalist organization."

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1617

United Nations Security Council resolution 1617, adopted unanimously on 29 July 2005, after recalling resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), 1363 (2001), 1373 (2001), 1390 (2001), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526 (2004) and 1566 (2004) concerning terrorism, the Council renewed sanctions against Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and associated individuals and groups for a further seventeen months. 
The resolution, drafted by the United States, defined the terms of being "associated with" Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. 
Resolution.
Observations.
In the preamble of the resolution, the Council determined that terrorism posed a serious threat to international peace and security. It condemned Al-Qaeda and other associated groups for ongoing terrorist attacks and reiterated its overall condemnation of all terrorist acts. There was concern at the use of media – including the Internet – by the groups to incite terrorist violence and disseminate propaganda. 
The Council urged all states to implement Resolution 1373 and reaffirmed the need to combat terrorism. It stressed the importance of individuals and entities being listed subject to the nature of Al-Qaeda. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was preventing travel documents from being made available to terrorists, and the Council encouraged states to work with Interpol. Furthermore, there was concern at the use of man-portable air-defense systems by Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and associate groups. 
Acts.
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council urged states to continue sanctions against Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and associate groups. The sanctions included a freezing of assets, a travel ban and the prevention of the sale of weapons. It also defined the nature of entities to be "associated with" Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Osama bin Laden. 
The resolution then addressed the role of the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee and its subsidiary, the monitoring team, in dealing with terrorist suspects and groups. Measures included a checklist in order for states to fulfill their obligations to the Committee, and for states forwarding names to the list to use a "statement of case" describing the reasoning behind the request. 
The tasks of the monitoring team, whose mandate was extended by 17 months, were listed in the annex of the resolution.

John Grün

John (Johann) Grün, also known as Herkul Grün (1868–1912), a Luxembourger from Mondorf-les-Bains was believed to be the strongest man in the world at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.
Biography.
Grün, who maintained he was the champion of the world, was born in Mondorf-les-Bains on 27 August 1868 into a family of craftsmen who had long been established in the town. His father was a blacksmith but he was not keen to follow in his footsteps. He emigrated to the United States in 1889. While working in a St. Louis brewery, he came into contact with Aloysius Marx, a professional athlete, who noticed how easily he moved the beer barrels around. He persuaded him to become part of a strongman partnership called "The Marx Brothers" or "The Two Marks", attracting crowds of enthusiasts wherever they appeared. When Grün returned to Luxembourg in 1892, his status as the strongest man in the world was no longer in doubt.
After his initial association with Marx, then with the Belgian athlete Miss Fanny and finally when he was on his own, Grün appeared in all the circuses, music halls, and variety theatres of America and Europe with ever greater success. Known as the Luxembourg Hercules, his acts included tearing apart decks of cards and horse shoes, breaking a block of stone on his chest with a hammer or halting a moving car. While such performances could not be officially measured, Grün never found a better match during his career. To his dying day, no one was able to lift blocks of iron as easily as Grün. The magician Harry Houdini who frequently performed with Grün tells of how "he juggled hundreds, and toyed with thousands, of pounds as a child plays with a rattle".
In 1909, after a serious injury, he gave up his professional career and left America for London where he became the landlord of a public house. Struck by a mortal disease, he returned to Luxembourg in 1912 and died in Ettelbruck on 3 November 1912. He was the first of many Luxembourg sportsmen to demonstrate his abilities abroad. In recognition of his feats, his fellow artists erected a monument to his memory in his native Mondorf-les-Bains.

John Spencer (rugby)

John Clarence Spencer (1880–1936) was a New Zealand rugby football player who represented New Zealand in both rugby union and rugby league. His brother, George, also was a dual-international.
Early years.
Spencer attended Mt Cook School in Wellington.
Rugby union career.
From the Melrose club, Spencer represented Wellington along with four of his brothers. He, along with his brothers, contributed significantly to the club's six Wellington club championship wins between 1896 and 1908.
Spencer was only 17 when he first represented Wellington in 1898 and remains one of the youngest to ever have played for the union. Spencer played for Wellington against the 1903 New Zealand team before joining it for the tour of Australia. However Spencer injured himself aboard the ship and played in only two tour matches.
Spencer missed most of the 1904 season as a result but returned in 1905 to play for Wellington against the departing Originals side. He then captained a combined Wellington-Wairarapa-Horowhenua selection to a 23–7 win over the touring Australian side and was made captain of the New Zealand side which played an official test against the tourists, despite the absence of the Originals squad.
Spencer, along with his brother George, made the All Blacks' tour of Australia in 1907, playing in only three of the eight matches. In the first Test match he became the first New Zealander to win a test cap as a replacement when he came of the bench to replace an injured John Colman.
Rugby league career.
In 1908 he and his brother George switched to league, being part of the first ever provincial match in the country when they both played for Wellington against Auckland on 24 August.
In 1909 he toured Australia with the New Zealand rugby league side. He played in all three test matches. The Spencers are the only brothers to have been both All Blacks and Kiwis.
He played in Wellington's 1913 victory over Auckland.
Later years.
Spencer returned to rugby union in later years and became a club coach for Berhampore in Wellington.

Burgrecht

A Burgrecht ("ius burgense, ius civile") was a medieval agreement, most commonly in southern Germany and northern German-speaking Switzerland. It came to refer to an agreement between a town and surrounding settlements or to include the specific rights held by a city or town.
The word "Burgrecht" is first used by the St. Gall monk Notker the German in about 1000 AD to refer to the Roman civil law. Later, in the southern German region, it came to refer to inheritance laws and the rights that were tied to specific castle or town. In the territory, that would become Switzerland, starting in the 13th century, the term "Burgrecht" began to expand. It grew to mean any agreement between a town with other towns, monasteries, individuals (especially nobles with domination and ownership rights), organizations or personal corporations covenants and agreements that include a citizenship clause. These agreements could be indefinite or limited and renewable. The oath of citizenship with which the "Burgrecht" was sealed gave this agreement special weight in comparison to other alliances. The "Verburgrechteten" (those covered by the "Burgrecht" agreement) were allowed to enjoy, often limited, citizenship privileges including military and court protection was well as market access. The town or city received additional influence outside its borough and better coverage of their markets. The distribution of duties and rights in "Burgrecht" treaties reflects the power relationship between the parties.

Access network discovery and selection function

Access network discovery and selection function ("ANDSF") is an entity within an evolved packet core (EPC) of the system architecture evolution (SAE) for 3GPP compliant mobile networks. The purpose of the ANDSF is to assist user equipment (UE) to discover non-3GPP access networks – such as Wi-Fi or WIMAX – that can be used for data communications in addition to 3GPP access networks (such as HSPA or LTE) and to provide the UE with rules policing the connection to these networks. 
Information provided.
An ANDSF can provide the following information to a UE, based on operator configuration:
The ANDSF communicates with the UE over the S14 reference point, which is essentially a synchronization of an OMA-DM management object (MO) specific to ANDSF.
History.
The term ANDSF was first conceived by the 3GPP in Release 8 as part of the effort to standardise the behavior of the ever-growing abundance of 3GPP-compliant UEs (e.g. smartphones) that can also access non-3GPP data networks.

Harmen van Bol'es

Harmen van Bol'es (Amsterdam 1689 - Saint-Petersburg 1764) was royal master builder in Russia. 
Harmen's father was the travelling windmill builder, originating from a family of carpenters from South Holland, the Netherlands. Grandfather Harmen established himself as a carpenter in the village Bolnes, the origin of the family name. When Cornelis was appointed Town Carpenter in Schiedam in 1690 the family moved there. In his youth Harmen was taught by his father, the City Architect, but he did not follow in his footsteps; his younger brother, Arij van Bol'es became City Architect in 1724. This function was filled by his descendants until 1827. 
On 26 April 1713 Harmen van Bol'es signed a contract in The Hague entering into the service of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. In 1703 Tsar Peter had established Saint Petersburg at the mouth of the Neva River. This proposed new capital was to become the modern window on the western world but in 1713 it was not much more than a mud pool. Design and construction required skilled westerners including those from the much admired by the Tsar, Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The difficult and dangerous work was primarily performed by Russian forced labour. 
Van Bol'es soon became a success in Saint Petersburg thanks in part to the friendship and patronage of his old Swiss colleague Domenico Trezzini. Along with furniture (based on the original repertoire of his forefathers) for the royal palaces he also designed and built many structures in the city. Amongst these were typical Dutch specialities such as drawbridges, sluices, windmills and canals. He enhanced the Summer Gardens with fountains which were fed by a complex network of underground water tanks. He was also involved in large infrastructure projects around Saint Petersburg.
In modern Saint Petersburg he is most famous for the tower spires he specialised in, including the spires of the Peter and Paul Fortress. The wind vane in the form of a ship designed by van Bol'es shines on top of the thin spire of the Admiralty Building on the Nevsky prospect, the city's main street. The three-masted ship has become an emblem of the city of Saint Petersburg and is said to represent the Russian frigate Oryol. 
Harmen van Bol'es married twice and fathered at least twelve children in Saint Petersburg. His oldest son Cornelis, from his first marriage to Elisabeth Geldorp, returned to Schiedam. His second son Anthony was appointed as royal servant (probably in a construction capacity) of the court in Moscow. He died there in 1746. In a reference from 1750 Harmen is named as "her Royal Majesty's Master Builder of Saint Petersburg". The oldest son from his second marriage to Catharina Potter, also Cornelis, appears to have followed in this function after Harmen's death in 1764. Cornelis (the younger) van Bol'es died in Saint Petersburg in 1771.

Hedeia

"Hedeia" is a genus of early land plants of uncertain affinity. It comprises erect axes terminating in corymbose clusters of erect sporangia. Cookson gave no derivation of the generic name.
The type species, "H. corymbosa", was first described by Isabel Cookson from a few specimens in fine sandstone from near Alexandra, Victoria, Australia. At the time, the locality was regarded as being of Silurian age, but it is now known to be Early Devonian. It is claimed that an undescribed species, also from Victoria, extends from the Early Devonian back to the Late Silurian.
"H. parvula" from Kazakhstan and "H. sinica" from China are also of Early Devonian age.
It is sometimes suggested that "Hedeia" and "Yarravia" are merely different preservations of the same type of plant.

The Baise horse (also known as the Guangxi) is a pony-sized horse breed native to the autonomous region of Guangxi, in southeastern China. Like other Asian breeds (the Mongolian horse in particular), it thrives at high altitudes and roams freely when not working. Guangxi's mild climate has long favored horse breeding; bronze statues from the third to the first centuries BCE exist of horses very similar in conformation to the Baise.
Breed characteristics.
The Baise horse is small, with an average height of ; it is smaller than other breeds in northern and western China. Its head is heavy, with a straight profile and wide jaw; it has a medium-length neck, running down to straight shoulders. Its legs are strong and well-developed, with strong hooves The usual coat colors are black, chestnut, gray and bay. The Baise is strong and quick with a willing, able temperament. It is used as a riding and pack horse for tourism, on the farm and in harness; it is also used for meat.
Baise horses are an important part of Guangxi village life, and are included in traditional wedding celebrations. The National Baise Horse Genetic Resources Conservation Area is a protected area in Guangxi.

"The Judy Monologues" premiered at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto, Ontario in September 2010 and subsequently played The Pearl Company in Hamilton, Ontario. Performed by three male actors as a tribute to Garland's influence on the gay community, the original cast featured Philip Cairns, Ryan Fisher and Darren Stewart-Jones. Nigel Gough (1982–2010) was the understudy. A Garland lookalike, Kimberly Roberts, also appeared in silent vignettes.
An abridged version of the play was performed in London, Ontario as part of the London One Act Festival in April, 2011. Philip Cairns won Best Actor at the festival's awards ceremony. The play also received two additional awards - special mentions for the concept and the audio/visual content.
"The Judy Monologues" was performed at the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival. Michael Hughes replaced Ryan Fisher in his role.

The 2011 Tour du Haut Var was the 43rd edition of the Tour du Haut Var cycling stage race. It was being held 19–20 February 2011 in the French department of the Var, and was rated as a 2.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour.
Teams and cyclists.
There were 18 teams in the 2011 Tour du Haut Var. Among them were five UCI ProTeams, nine UCI Professional Continental teams, and four Continental teams. Each team was allowed eight riders on their squad, giving the event a peloton of 142 cyclists at its outset.
The 18 teams in the race were:
Classification leadership.
In the 2011 Tour du Haut Var, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The leader received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Tour du Haut Var, and the winner is considered the winner of the Tour.
Additionally, there was a youth classification, which awarded a white jersey. It is calculated in the same way as the general classification, but is only open to riders born in 1988 or later.
There was also a mountains classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the mountains classification, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, with the more difficult climbs awarding more points.
The points classification awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points based on the order at the finish line of each stage. The stage win afforded 25 points, second on the stage was worth 20, third 16, fourth 13, fifth 10, sixth 8, seventh 6, eighth 4, ninth 2, and tenth was worth a single point. The points awarded in the sprints classification counted equivalently for this classification. In addition, points were awarded for the intermediate sprints, with 6, 4 and 2 points rewarded to, respectively, the first, second and third place winners of the intermediate sprints.
The race also awarded a teams classification, which, too, was not represented by a jersey. The teams classification was calculated by adding the times of each team's best three riders per stage per day.

drop-in) 
History of Organization.
In January 1943, a riot involving more than 100 teens broke out on the corner of 85th and Greenwood in Seattle. 
Police responded to the incident and looked for an answer to the overall issue of juvenile crime and vandalism, a growing problem in the community.
In response, Deputy Joe Woelfert opened the first Boys & Girls Club (originally called the Boys Club) in Washington state—the North Seattle Boys & Girls Club. The Club was a great success, and within two years, eight Clubs sprouted up in the area. Today there are 13 Clubs around King County, each one focused on enriching the lives of kids every day.
History of National Organization.
Boys & Girls Clubs of America had its beginnings in 1860 with several women in Hartford, Connecticut. Believing that boys who roamed the streets should have a positive alternative, they organized the first Club. A cause was born. In 1906, several Boys Clubs decided to affiliate. The Federated Boys Clubs in Boston was formed with 53 member organizations, marking the start of a nationwide movement.
In 1931, the Boys Club Federation of America became Boys Clubs of America. 
To recognize the fact that girls have long been a part of our cause, the national organization's name was officially changed to Boys & Girls Clubs of America in 1990.
Boys & Girls Clubs of America marked its centennial year in 2006, celebrating 100 years of providing hope and opportunity to young people across the country.

Fiscal burden of government

In economics, the fiscal burden of government imposed onto its taxpayers is the influence of the tax levied on the purchasing power of the taxpayers.
The concept was introduced by an English clergyman and political writer John Brand. In his 1776 pamphlet, "Observations on some of the probable effects of Mr. Gilbert's Bill, to which are added Remarks on Dr. Price's account of the National Debt", he draw a distinction between "fiscal charge" and "fiscal burden". He argued that as long as prices steadily rose, though more money might be taken out of the taxpayer's pocket, the quantity of commodities which the sum levied by taxation would purchase steadily decreased, and thus if 'burden' were interpreted to be the amount of commodities of the power of purchasing which the community was deprived by taxation, its increase need not be and had not been at all proportionate to the increase of charge. 
To quantify the fiscal burden and to draw comparisons of different countries, the concept of "fiscal burden of government ratio" is used. Calculated according to certain methodologies, it basically means that the lower the score, the lower the involvement of the government in the economics of the country.

The Flee-Rekkers

The Flee-Rekkers - also known as The Fabulous Flee-Rakkers - were a British instrumental rock and roll band in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The spelling of the group's name varied between records. They were fronted by tenor saxophonist Peter Fleerakkers (or Fleerackers), and their records were produced by Joe Meek. Their biggest hit was "Green Jeans" in 1960.
History.
The group was influenced by saxophone-led bands like Johnny and the Hurricanes. They started under the names The Ramblers and The Statesiders, before taking a more permanent name derived from that of their leader, whose father was Dutch. Other members of the group were Dave Cameron (lead guitar), Alan Monger (rhythm guitar, baritone sax), Elmy Durrant (tenor sax), Derek Skinner (bass), and Mickey Waller (drums). 
They were spotted playing at a ballroom in Putney, west London, in late 1959, and successfully auditioned for record producer Joe Meek. He produced their first single, "Green Jeans", a rocked-up version of the traditional "Greensleeves" released on Meek's own label, Triumph Records, in early 1960. The record reached #23 on the UK Singles Chart, but demand outstripped Meek's capacity to supply copies. After the Triumph label collapsed, the record was reissued on the Top Rank label, which itself was then taken over by EMI. The group also featured on a single, "Hot Chick-A-Roo", by singer Ricky Wayne (born Learie Carasco), who became a prominent bodybuilder and, later, a noted writer and broadcaster in Saint Lucia. 
The Flee-Rekkers released several more singles and an EP with less success, at first on the Pye label, and then on Piccadilly. According to the liner notes of their EP, they "were the first 'rock' group to be signed for a long term contract with Mecca after making appearances at their ballrooms up and down the country, and in the London area." They toured Britain extensively in the early 1960s, with a reputedly "wild" live act. Their final single in 1963, "Fireball", a version of the theme music to the animated TV series "Fireball XL5", arranged by Tony Hatch, is regarded as one of their best.
The group broke up in 1963. Fleerakkers played in various unsuccessful bands before leaving the music business in the late 1960s. Cameron, Monger and Durrant formed a new group, The Giants, who mainly performed in Germany. Skinner became a member of the Spotnicks. Waller became a leading session drummer, playing with such musicians as Cyril Davies, Long John Baldry, Rod Stewart, Brian Auger, John Mayall and Jeff Beck; he died in 2008.
A CD containing most of the group's recordings was issued by C-Five Records in 1991, and later in expanded versions by See For Miles Records and Castle Records.

Kriegsschule (Austria)

The k.u.k. War College, also k.u.k. Staff College (Ge: "k.u.k. Kriegsschule") was the highest military facility to educate, instruct, train, and develop "general staff officers" of the Austrian Empire and later the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
It was located in Vienne, and active from 1852 to 1918.
Established in 1852, the "k.u.k. War College" was an outgrowth of the previous centers of Austrian military scholarship: the "Kriegsarchiv" and the "Österreichische militärische Zeitschrift" (Austrian Military Journal). Having been earlier suggested by the likes of officers including Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, it was organized early in the reign of Emperor Franz Josef. Among its students and faculty were such influential members of the Austro-Hungarian military as Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, who attended the school and later taught tactics there from 1888 to 1892.

John Cotton (author)

John Cotton (c. 12th century), "Johannes Afflighemensis" is the author of a valuable treatise on music, "De musica", first printed by Gerbert in 1784.
Of this work, there are two manuscripts at Vienna, and one each at Leipzig, Paris, Rome, and Antwerp. A sixth, from which Gerbert printed his edition, was destroyed in the fire at St. Blaise Abbey in 1768. The Vatican copy is said by Fétis to contain much of the best text. The exact date of the treatise is unknown. The Vienna and St. Blaise copies entitle it merely "Joannis Musica", while the Paris and Antwerp copies have the name of Cotton or Cottonius. The anonymous monk of Melk Abbey who copied the work, says that there was a learned English musician known as Joannes, and the English origin of the work is rendered more probable by the author's dedicating it "Domino et patri suo venerabili Anglorum antistiti Fulgentio," though the latter, like Cotton, cannot be identified. One theory attributes the work to Pope John XXII, but this rests on the very slight foundation that the author styles himself "Joannes servus servorum Dei."
Gerbert has pointed out that this title was not solely used by popes, and it seems unlikely that a pope would address a bishop with deference. The work is also clearly of earlier date, for it speaks of neums being in ordinary use at the time of writing. Another theory ascribes it to a certain "Joannes Scolasticus", a monk of St. Matthias' Abbey at Trier, all that is known of whom is that he was living about 1047, and that he wrote much music, but there seems to be no reason why the work should not have been written by the unknown Englishman, John Cotton. From internal evidence its date appears to be the latter part of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century. The work throws much light on the system of harmony of the period.

Vasily Seseman

Vasily Seseman (several other latinizations of his name exist, , ) (June 11, 1884, Vyborg — March 23, 1963, Vilnius) was a Russian and Lithuanian philosopher, a representative of Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism. He is mostly remembered for his role in fostering philosophy in newly independent Lithuania and developing Lithuanian philosophical vocabulary (most remarkable are his translations of Aristotle into Lithuanian and contributions to Lithuanian encyclopedias). A close associate of Viktor Zhirmunsky and Lev Karsavin, as a prisoner of Gulag he was also an informal philosophy tutor and supporter of Buddhist writer Bidia Dandaron.
Biography.
Born to the family of a medical doctor of Finnish Swedish descent and a Baltic German mother, he was initially named Wilhelm and attended the Lutheran school (Katharinenschule) in St Petersburg. As he grew up, he adopted a more Russian identity, changing Wilhelm to Wassilij (Vasily) and embracing Russian Orthodox Christianity. 
After 2 years of medical studies he turned to philosophy, fervently studying classical authors under Nikolay Lossky and classical languages under Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński in St Petersburg University. In 1909-1911 the University sent him to Germany to prepare him for the teaching career. In Berlin and Marburg, he took courses in philosophy, psychology, and pedagogics under Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, Ernst Cassirer, Hermann Alexander Diels, and Heinrich Wölfflin. In Germany he also met José Ortega y Gasset who made a great impression on him, and re-established a lifelong friendship with Nicolai Hartmann who in St Petersburg had influenced Vasily's decision to switch from medicine to philosophy.
Upon his return to St. Petersburg, Seseman taught philosophy and classical languages until World War I, when he enlisted as a volunteer in the Russian army. 
From 1915 to 1917 he taught philosophy as a Privatdozent at the University of St. Petersburg, and from 1918 to 1919 at the Viatka Pedagogical Institute. He received a docentship in Saratov, where he worked (together with Viktor Zhirmunsky) until 1921. 
Later Seseman, as a Finnish citizen, immigrated to Finland and then to Berlin, where he finally found a teaching position at the Russian Institute.
In 1923 Seseman was invited to become a visiting professor at Kaunas University in Lithuania. When Vilnius was regained by Lithuania, he moved there and worked at Vilnius University until the Nazis closed it down in 1943. He worked as a German language teacher during the German occupation, and led a philosophy course in the Jewish ghetto. 
According to his stepdaughter's interview, while living in poverty, at his place in central Vilnius he also hid from the Nazis a Jewish girl (who later disappeared), and supplied ghetto Jews with false documents allowing emigration. He made a narrow escape from being burnt alive for being a supporter of the Jews while the Nazi troops were abandoning the city for the Soviet troops. His efforts on behalf of the Jews were posthumously recognized by the Lithuanian government awarding him a medal. 
He spent 1945-1950 teaching in Vilnius University again, but then he was arrested by the Soviet authorities, accused of “anti-Soviet activities” and “relations with Zionist organizations” and sentenced to 15 years of labor camps. In Siberia he met a Buddhist tantra practitioner Bidia Dandaron who learned a lot from Seseman, as a result embracing Kantian ideas and developing his own synthesis of Tibetan Buddhist and European philosophical thought in his writings. Their friendship continued after they were released.
In 1956 Seseman was released, in 1958 rehabilitated and resumed his professorship in the Department of History and Philology at the University of Vilnius where he taught for the rest of his life.
Philosophy.
Seseman liked to call his philosophy “gnoseological idealism”, trying to revive metaphysics through a re-evaluation of the metaphysical tradition of ontology. His other philosophical aim was to overcome the dichotomies between the subjective-psychological and the objective-idealistic in the theory of knowledge and metaphysics in general. 
He deliberated on the dangers of materialism and positivism for the European thought. 
Seseman’s concern for formal questions in linguistics and aesthetics may make him a precursor of modern semiotics.
Bibliography.
The Lithuanian edition of Seseman’s works consists of two volumes:

Playwrights Guild of Canada

Playwrights Guild of Canada (PGC) is a registered national arts service association mandated to advance the creative rights and interests of professional Canadian playwrights, promote Canadian plays nationally and internationally, and foster an active, evolving community of writers for the stage. It was founded in 1972 as the Playwrights Co-op. The main purpose was to publish and distribute scripts to encourage more productions of Canadian plays. Since then, it has grown and now provides programs and services for playwrights across the country, and now includes more than 600 playwrights. PGC provides promotional and advocacy programs and services for the creative rights of Canadian playwrights.
Through its independently run subsidiary, Playwrights Canada Press, which was established in 2002, PGC is a primary source for unpublished Canadian plays, as well as information regarding performance rights.
To help support and advance Canadian playwriting, PGC offers the following services to its members: 
PGC also publishes "CanRevue", an electronic catalogue of Canadian Copyscript plays, on a monthly timetable. "CanRevue" promotes new Canadian plays and is sometimes released as a special edition pertaining to genre or geographical region. In 2011, PGC added a section within "CanRevue" entitled "Stage Ready". This is intended to narrow the gap between a written work and a production, and allows members to send PGC plays that have not yet been produced, but are ready to be promoted for the stage. "CanRevue" is sent out to over two hundred theatres (both professional and amateur) and to schools across Canada.
History.
PGC had its origins in a meeting held in 1971 by the Canada Council's theatre officer, David Gardner, with Carol Bolt, Tom Hendry and Len Peterson to discuss issues affecting English Canadian playwrights. Those present at the meeting determined that there was a need for a publishing house for Canadian plays. Following the meeting, Bolt, Hendry and Peterson established the Toronto Playwrights Circle to obtain funding for the project. This led to the founding of the Playwrights Co-op of Canada in the following year, for the purpose of publishing and distributing plays written by Canadian playwrights. In 1979, the Playwrights Co-op changed its name to Playwrights Canada, Inc.
In 1977, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights formed to advocate on behalf of playwrights and to lobby for suitable working conditions for Canadian playwrights. In 1982, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights and Playwrights Canada, Inc. merged to form the Playwrights Union of Canada. In 2002, the organization changed its name to the Playwrights Guild of Canada. That same year, it established its publishing arm, the Playwrights Canada Press.
The Playwrights Guild of Canada is a registered charitable organization. In 1986, PGC created the Canadian Drama Foundation (formerly known as the Foundation for Recognition of Excellence in Drama) as its charitable arm. Part of its funding comes from the Canada Council, the Ontario Arts Council, Ontario Ministry of Culture, and the City of Toronto through the Toronto Arts Council.
The Guild has a Women's Caucus, which awards the "Bra D'Or" ("Golden Bra") for supporting the work of female playwrights.
Awards.
PGC has an annual awards competition with several categories: Lifetime Membership, Honorary Membership, Post-Secondary Competition, the Bra D'Or Award, Carol Bolt Award for Playwrights, Stage West Pechet Family Comedy Award, and Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award. The awards were recently named the Tom Hendry Awards after Tom Hendry, a founding member of PGC who died in 2012. The awards carry generous cash prizes and winners are recognized in a ceremony occurring in the fall each year. Deadlines for the awards are April 30 and May 31.
As in previous years, in the future the awards ceremony will continue to forge relationships with other arts organizations and corporate sponsors, celebrating excellence in Canadian playwrighting.

Luis Barragán (painter)

Luis Barragán (December 17, 1914 – July 25, 2009) was an Argentine painter of the Abstract, Figurative, and Surrealist schools.
Life and work.
Luis Barragán was born in Buenos Aires in 1914, and studied at the National Art School and the Ernesto de la Cárcova School of Fine Arts. 
He secured his first gallery exhibition in 1939 as a member of the Orion Group. The Orion Group, which he founded with Vicente Forte, Orlando Pierri, Leopoldo Presas, Ideal Sánchez, and art critic Ernesto Rodríguez, became the leading local exponent of Surrealism in art. Art gallery catalogs featuring images of Barragán's canvases would feature his signature phrase: ""In art, each work, as it is being created, will make its own rules."" 
After the two exposures of Orion, Barragán worked on a series of small canvases with figures and heads, and these were displayed in his first solo exhibition, at the Galería Sintonía, in 1948. The geometric aesthetic in his works yielded to more toward the abstract during the 1950s, and broke with the Geometric, Concrete and Lyrical Abstraction trends prevailing among Argentine artists at the time.
Barragán was among the founders of the Twenty Painters and Sculptors group, with whom he worked between 1952 and 1963; the group also included Julián Althabe, Vicente Forte, Carlos Torrallardona, Bruno Venier, Líbero Badii, Aurelio Macchi and Juan Carlos Labourdette. He was given a second solo exhibition in 1957 at the Wildenstein Gallery, and he participated in the São Paulo Biennale in 1954 and 1973. The National Academy of Fine Arts awarded Barragán the Augusto Palanza Prize in 1971, and in 1977, he was incorporated as a distinguished academic.
He continued to exhibit work in local galleries in subsequent years, notably in a series hosted by the now defunct Banco Alas. Another artist regularly featured in this series, his younger brother Julio Barragán, also became well known in Argentina. The elder Barragán's art show appearances became less frequent in later years, though in September 2002, he was featured in a Van Eyck Gallery exhibition. Local critic Raúl Santana wrote on the occasion that his work ""appears more vital, prouder and more uncompromising than ever. The intensity of the color in both the backdrop and the lines provide a constant counterpoint, and reflects the artist's well-known love of music."" 
Barragán died on July 25, 2009, at age 94.

ʻAlipate Tuʻivanuavou Vaea (born September 19, 1957), known as Lord Vaea since June 2009, is a Tongan politician and member of the Tongan nobility.
He has served as Master of the Royal Household and "long-time palace archivist", as well as being Chairman of the Tonga Traditions Committee.
He was bestowed the title of Lord Vaea upon the death of his father, ʻAlipate Halakilangi Tau'alupeoko Vaea Tupou, the previous Vaea, in June 2009. His mother is Baroness Tuputupu Vaea. Vaea is the brother of the present Queen of Tonga Nanasipau'u Tuku'aho and the brother-in-law (and second cousin) of King Tupou VI.
This enabled him to rank among the small number of nobles entitled to elect, and be elected among, the Nobles' Representatives to Parliament. Thus he began his career in national politics when he was elected to Parliament as a Nobles' Representative for Tongatapu in the November 2010 general election. He was then appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food, Forests and Fisheries in the Cabinet of new Prime Minister Lord Tuʻivakanō. On 1 May 2012, he received in addition the Training, Employment, Youth and Sports portfolio.

Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch

The Hotel Grand Chancellor was a major four star hotel in the centre of Christchurch in New Zealand, one of eleven Hotel Grand Chancellor establishments across Australia and New Zealand. The hotel was located at 161 Cashel Street, close to the city's City Mall central shopping precinct.
For a long time, it was the city's tallest building at and 26 storeys, but was overtaken in 2009 by the tall Pacific Tower.
The building was built in 1986 for office use by Forbes Construction. In 1998 it was converted to a hotel by Fletchers Construction with 15 floors of hotel accommodation, and 12 floors of car parking, also housing conference facilities for businesses.
Christchurch earthquakes.
The hotel survived the 7.1 magnitude Canterbury earthquake in 2010 and continued operation without any known structural damage. Five months later, while fully in use, the hotel was badly damaged in the 6.3 magnitude February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.
The building suffered structural damage, caused by the collapse of a key supporting shear wall "D5-6" located in the south-east corner of the building. The shear wall was responsible for roughly one-eighth of the Hotel Grand Chancellor's mass, primarily providing vertical support to the building.
The damaged foundations lead to the visible leaning of the building to one side. Fear that the building would totally collapse hampered search and rescue missions in the vicinity. When searched, no survivors or bodies were found in the hotel.
A later investigation by the New Zealand Department of Building and Housing found that the risk of a staircase collapse and further serious structural damage could have occurred given the nature of the structural failure, but hadn't.
The building was eventually stabilised and on 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months using a complicated deconstruction processes from the top downwards. On the 25 May the public was told it would take over a year to demolish.
The roof of the hotel was removed in early November 2011. A protective fence was to be built around the building to catch debris from the demolition and then the demolition of the building was to proceed from January 2012.
The Hotel Grand Chancellor management intend on rebuilding a hotel in Christchurch, although it is unclear if it will be rebuilt on the current site and when it will be rebuilt.
The Building was demolished by Ward Demolition.
Rebuild.
The Grand Hotels International owners of the former Grand Chancellor hotel Christchurch had gained approval to rebuild on the same site by the city council. The new hotel would have been on base isolators at high and have 12 floors in the hotel and 5 floor office block in the front. The new design was from Warren and Mahoney architects and was to be built by Fletcher Construction, to be finished by 2015.
In April 2014, it was announced that the hotel would no longer be rebuilt on its original site, and would be replaced by shops and offices instead. The Grand Hotels International group expressed interest in building the hotel on a different site in the city, but have no official plans to do so at this time.

Canadian Forces Air Navigation School

From Observers to Navigators.
Canadian pilots in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) learned rudimentary navigation during World War I, but separate observer schools were not introduced until 1918. Right up until the outbreak of World War II there was still no category of air observer in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF).
World War II.
Royal Canadian Air Force specialty navigator training started in March 1942 as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan 1 Air Navigation Schools (1 ANS) moved to Rivers, Manitoba from Trenton, Ontario in November, 1940, and 2 ANS started in Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick in 1941. The two Air Navigation Schools, 1 ANS and 2 ANS, amalgamated on May 11, 1942 to form Central Navigation School. In early 1944 two other schools, 2 ANS and 3 ANS (re)opened. Central Navigation School disbanded on September 15, 1945.
Post War.
Central Navigation School was re-formed at Summerside, P.E.I., on August 1, 1951, and then moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1954.
In August 1967, CNS and Central Flying School (CFS) joined as Central Flying and Navigation School (CFNS) training both flying and navigation. In November 1968 navigator training was again separated from flying training, and became the specialty of the Canadian Forces Air Navigation School (CFANS).
In the early 21st century, CFANS expanded its role to include the training of Airborne Electronic Sensor Operators (AESOP).
Present.
On June 26, 2009 CFANS adopted the name of the Canadian Forces advanced pilot training school, 1 Canadian Forces Flying Training School (1 CFFTS), inheriting the histories of both advanced flying training and navigator training.

Michael Fadel

Michael II Fadel (1710-1795), (or Mikhail Fadil, ), was the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch from 1793 to his death in 1795.
Life.
Michael Fadel was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1710. Ordained priest at 21 years, from 1741 to 1753 he served the community of Acre where he erected a church. In 1754 he converted to Christianity the fist member of the governing Shihab family. In 1762 Michael Fadel was appointed and consecrated bishop of Tyre and Patriarchal Vicar by Patriarch Tobias El Khazen, who later appointed him also bishop of Beirut in place of Joseph Estephan.
After 1766, under the patriarchate of Joseph Estephan, Michael Fadel sided with the opponents to the Patriarch led by the Khazen Sheikhes, and he was one of supporters of the suspension of the Patriarch from 1779 to 1784, due to the Hindiyé's issue. Patriarch Estephan, in turn, appointed in 1768 Athanase Scenai and later in 1779 Joseph Najm (or Nujaym) in his place as bishop of Beirut. The solution of the dispute about the see of Beirut occurred only in the synod of 1786 where an agreement was found and Michael Fadel was confirmed as bishop of Beirut.
Patriarch Joseph Estephan died on April 22, 1793, but because of a pestilence the bishops could meet only in September. On September 10, 1793
Michael Fadel was elected Patriarch, and he choose to reside in the monastery of Dayr Harrash (in Keserwan District). As his predecessors, Michael Fadel asked the Pope to confirm his election. Michael Fadel anyway died on May 17, 1795 at Dayr Harrash, where he was buried, before the Vatican could confirm him.

Český Šternberk Castle

Český Šternberk Castle () is a Bohemian castle of the mid-13th century, located within the village with the same name of the Central Bohemian Region in Czech Republic. It is an early Gothic castle which was constructed, named and still owned by members of the same family. Český Šternberk Castle is today a residence that bears a long historical and architectural heritage and represents an attractive tourist destination open to the public. It is considered one of the best preserved Gothic Bohemian castles.
Name.
The name Šternberk derives from the German language and is the Czech spelling of the German composite word "Sternberg" (literally meaning "Starmountain": "Stern" meaning "star" and "Berg" meaning "mountain"). It originates from the founder of the castle, Zdeslav of Divisov's coat of arms, bearing an eight-pointed golden star. Eventually he changed his surname to Sternberg and the heraldic symbol was accompanied by the motto: ""The star that never falls down"".
History.
The castle was initially built in 1241 by Zdeslav of Divisov, later called Zdeslav Sternberg. The development of new firearms in the 14th century posed an unexpected threat to the defensibility of the castle. Its 13th century architects hadn't foreseen the danger of long-range firearms and its reinforcement became a necessity. During this period the Český Šternberk castle's fortifications were improved through the construction in the north of a three-story tower, which was connected to the castle by a rampart.
In 1467 the castle was seized by the royal armies of George of Poděbrady (). Later, the ruined castle was regained by Šternberk's aristocracy, who, by the turn of the 15th to 16th century, had reconstructed the castle, renewed its defensive system and expanded it with the construction of a new cylindrical tower in the south and the "Dungeon" in the north. The castle managed to survive the looting of the rebels in 1627, during the Thirty Years' War.
With the death of Jan Václav in 1712, the Holicý branch of the Sternberg family died out and its ownership passed to other families, who in 1751 built the lower palace next to the surrounding wall.
The ownership of the castle was returned to the Sternberg family in 1841 when Zdeněk of Sternberg from the Konopiště branch of the family bought it. It remained in Sternberg's ownership until 1949 when it was "nationalized" by the Communist government of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The family moved to a small flat in Prague and Jiří Sternberk, agreed to work as a steward in "his own" property and gave tours within the castle, which became a sightseeing spot.
After the fall of Communism and the Velvet Revolution, in 1992, thanks to the restitution's law, Český Šternberk castle returned to Jiří's son, the count Zdeněk Sternberg, the current owner of the castle.
Architecture.
Český Šternberk Castle was originally built as a Gothic castle Eventually it underwent several periods of reconstructions and further fortification and the Gothic architectural features were in parts concealed by the new reconstructions. Especially the interiors of the castle were realized under the Baroque and Rococo styles. In 1760, the master Carlo Brentano performed the elaborate stuccoing and renderings of the halls' interiors. The castle offers a rare collection of 545 copper engravings, depicting the entire history of the Thirty Years' War.
Also, historical weapons and hunting trophies are exhibited within the castle’s halls.
Location.
The castle is located within Benešov District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It stands on top of a steep granite cliff on the western banks of Sázava river in the market town of Český Šternberk, at driving distance southeast of the capital Prague ( as the crow flies) along D1 motorway.
The castle in popular culture.
Český Šternberk castle appears in several scenes throughout the Albanian-Czech romantic drama film "The Sorrow of Mrs. Schneider" (). The events of the film take place in 1961, in Český Šternberk and the role of the count Jiří Sternberg, the father of today's owner of the castle Zdenek Sternberg, is portrayed by the internationally acclaimed Italian actor Michele Placido. 
Count Zdenek Sternberg, happy to meet the Italian actor and after learning that he was interpreting his father in the movie, generously offered free use of the castle’s spaces. Anyway he couldn’t meet with Michele Placido after falling ill during the filming days.
There is a whole considerable scene within Český Šternberk castle, a remarkable dialogue between the movie’s main character and count Sternberg (Placido).

Echaskech

Echaskech are a British electronica / audio-visual act based in London. The band formed in 2004 and were originally a duo composed of Dom Hoare and Andy Gillham, who had previously worked together as a drum & bass DJ act touring with artists such as LTJ Bukem and Grooverider. Early in 2005 the music duo became a multimedia trio with the addition of visual artist Mach V, who provides visuals during live performances and whose prior work includes music festivals such as The Big Chill and a collaboration with Sounds from the Ground that exhibited at Tate Britain. Also in 2005 Echaskech performed along with Jon Hopkins at various events in London and as a result Jon introduced the band to Just Music who subsequently signed them.
Echaskech's eclectic style spans across the electronic music genre, as Ian Roullier from musicOMH says, "This is where Orbital, Brian Eno, The Radiophonic Workshop, Warp's Artificial Intelligence series from the early '90s and good old tuneful, contemporary, grimy dance music collide".
"Shatterproof", the act's second album on Just Music was compared to The Future Sound of London's "Lifeforms" by the BBC's Colin Buttimer and Ben Hogwood of DMC, who commented that "The band move between a spaced-out ambience, peppered with splintered beats, to darker moments" on this release. 
Musically, the duo have collaborated with numerous acts including Roots Manuva, James Yuill, Max Cooper, Kraddy, Posthuman and SBTRKT with festival performances at Glade, Blissfields, Secret Garden Party, Solfest, Big Chill and Festinho. Their performance at Festinho 2010 was nominated for the UK Festival Awards Critics’ Choice Award.
In November 2010, Echaskech collaborated with Traum Schallplatten artist Max Cooper on a remix of "Chaotisch Serie" for his "Expressions" EP.
In December 2013 the single 'Form | Function' was debuted on the Lauren Laverne show BBC Radio 6 Music, and officially announced by SPIN magazine on 14 Jan 2014 as being the first single to a new album "Origin" to be released 24 Feb 2014 on Just Music.

Quryna

Quryna (), formerly known as Yosberides (), is a privately owned Libyan newspaper published in print and on the internet. It is based in Benghazi, the country's second largest city. Reuters described it as "Libya's most reliable media outlet" during the Libyan civil war.
Its chief editor is Ramadan Briki. Technical staff are Ahmad Bin Jaber and Hani Altli.
History.
According to its website, Quryna was first published on 20 August 2007 as a limited print newspaper and grew to a 32-page media. It is currently published online and in print nationally on Mondays. According to The Lede blog, Quryna was named after the ancient Greek colony Cyrene, Libya. The name was changed to "Yosberides" on 3 March 2011, but was later changed back.
It was part of the Al-Ghad Media Corporation owned by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam until the state took it over. Its reporting then was sympathetic to Gaddafi. When Gaddafi lost control of Benghazi in early 2011, it began to report openly and claimed to be impartial to either side of the protests. Reports, however, emerged that the paper was seized by protesters. The web site of the newspaper was registered on 6 March 2011, and the head of the main page shows the flag of the Libyan Republic, used first by the rebels and now officially as the flag of the state.

List of Governors and Commandants of Sandhurst

This is a list of the Governors and Commandants of the Royal Military College, first at Great Marlow (1802–1812), then at Sandhurst (1813–1939), and of its succcessor on the same site, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (1947 to date). 
The Commandant of the Academy, as of the former Royal Military College, is its commanding officer and is always a senior officer of field rank. Most Commandants serve for between two and three years and many go on to further significant promotions.
History of the role.
The Royal Military College Sandhurst was originally led by a Governor (a figurehead), a Lieutenant Governor (in command of the college) and a Commandant (responsible for the cadets). In 1812 the posts of Lieutenant Governor and Commandant were merged into the role of Commandant. In 1888 the posts of Governor and Commandant were merged into the role of Governor and Commandant and in 1902 that single role was retitled Commandant.

Suits (TV series)

Suits is a USA Network drama created by Aaron Korsh that stars Patrick J. Adams as Michael "Mike" Ross and Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter. The series is set at Pearson Hardman, a fictitious law firm in New York City. Mike, once a college scholarship recipient and on his way to becoming a law student at Harvard University, was kicked out of college for selling the answers to a math test he had memorized, ruining his chances of attending law school. Mike instead makes a living as a bicycle messenger, and is convinced by his friend, Trevor, to take part in a marijuana deal. The deal happens to be a sting operation which Mike astutely discovers and narrowly avoids, instead stumbling into a job interview with Harvey, a lawyer at Pearson Hardman and arguably the "best closer in New York City". Recently made senior partner, Harvey must hire a Harvard-educated lawyer as an associate, as per firm policy. Using his eidetic memory and legal knowledge, Mike proves to Harvey he is undoubtedly the best candidate and is subsequently hired, despite neither receiving a college degree nor attending Harvard. The series focuses on Mike and Harvey as they try cases for the firm while maintaining Mike's secret.
The 12-episode first season debuted on June 23, 2011, with a 90-minute premiere. It was renewed for a second season of 16 episodes on August 11, 2011, which premiered on June 14, 2012, with the mid-season finale on August 23, 2012. The remaining six episodes of Season 2 began airing January 17, 2013, on USA and January 23 on Bravo Canada. On October 12, 2012, USA Network renewed "Suits" for a third season, consisting of 16 episodes. Season 3 premiered July 16, 2013, on USA, July 17, 2013, on Bravo Canada, and 15 October on Channel 7 Australia. The season was split, with six episodes airing after March 6, 2014. On October 24, 2013, Suits was renewed for a fourth season.
Overview.
Season 1 (2011).
Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant college dropout. With his natural intelligence and eidetic memory, he makes a living taking the LSAT for others. To make the extra money he needs to keep his grandmother in a private nursing home, he agrees to deliver a case of marijuana for his best friend Trevor (Tom Lipinski). Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) is one of New York's best attorneys. He hires Mike (who noticed that the delivery he has to do was a trap from policemen) and pretends that Mike is a Harvard Law graduate. Only Harvey's legal secretary and confidante Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) knows the secret at first.
At the firm, junior partner Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), Harvey's jealous rival and direct supervisor of the associates, is suspicious of Mike's Harvard credentials. Meanwhile, Mike struggles to distance himself from Trevor, who has stopped dealing drugs but cannot escape his past. When Trevor leaves the state, Mike begins dating Trevor's ex-girlfriend Jenny Griffith (Vanessa Ray). At the same time, Mike befriends paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle) at the office, and the two soon develop a mutual attraction, complicating his relationship with Jenny. Trevor returns to New York, only to learn that Mike is dating Jenny. In revenge, he tells the firm's managing partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) the truth about Mike.
Season 2 (2012–2013).
Co-founding partner, Daniel Hardman, returns to the firm, and Jessica and Harvey fear he wishes to return to his former position as managing partner. Jessica allows Mike to continue working, despite discovering his secret. Harvey is accused of burying evidence and faces being disbarred. Donna finds and destroys the document, and is fired by Jessica. Hardman and Jessica disagree over settling the case, eventually leading Hardman to challenge Jessica for the position as managing partner. Hardman becomes managing partner, but it is short lived as Mike and Harvey discover that Hardman forged and planted the document that Harvey and Donna supposedly buried. He is voted out of the firm, and Jessica regains the managing partner position. Mike's grandmother dies, and he finds himself in a romantic entanglement with his now-married first love. Rachel finds them together, leading to a rift in their relationship. Hardman returns to battle with his old firm, working as a contract lawyer for Rachel's father, well-known trial attorney Robert Zane, on multiple gender discrimination suits. Jessica agrees to a merger with the U.K. firm of Harvey's competitor, Scottie, headed by Edward Darby (Conleth Hill), enabling them to defeat Hardman. Harvey tries but fails to stop the merger. Mike reveals his secret to Rachel after she is denied admission to Harvard.
Season 3 (2013–2014).
The merger between Pearson and Darby International is complete. Harvey, stinging from Jessica's refusal to make him a named partner, begins plotting with Darby to take her down. Mike tries to mend his relationship with Harvey and seeks to clarify his new relationship with Rachel.
Harvey settles a case with his old mentor and nemesis, Cameron Dennis but his client, Ava Hessington (Michelle Fairley), is arrested for murder. Darby sends his "fixer", Stephen Huntley, to New York to help with the case, but Harvey realizes Darby wants Huntley to help him take the firm from Jessica. Harvey plans to take control from Jessica, but she confides her own plans to add him as named partner. Ava looks set to be convicted, until Mike discovers Huntley was actually responsible for the murders. Darby eventually agrees to testify against Huntley, only later realising his own plea bargain will leave him unable to practice law in the US. This allows Jessica to begin dissolution of the firm. Louis takes the lead on this, which leads to complications. Darby appoints Scottie to negotiate in the dissolution case, promising a named partnership if she wins.
Ava sues the firm for malpractice, with Travis Tanner as her attorney, but Harvey is eventually able to get her to withdraw the suit. Harvey tells Scottie he wants her in his life. Jessica learns of Mike and Rachel's relationship and threatens to fire Mike unless Rachel signs an affidavit saying she knew of Mike's fraud. She does so on the condition that Jessica waive the firm's "Harvard rule" so she can apply there on graduation. She is accepted to Stanford but eventually decides to go to Columbia. Mike's secret is nearly discovered by Louis, with the latter eventually being convinced that Mike only "fixed" a grade in a single class.
Mike realizes he will never be able to make a name for himself in law with the threat of his fraud being discovered, and considers a career change. In the season three finale, Mike is arrested, which may expose him, and Harvey and Louis try to free him. Mike realizes the problems his situation causes for the firm, however, and decides to take a job offer as an investment banker to resolve things. This new job makes Mike a client of the firm, and he jokes with Harvey, telling him that Harvey now technically works for him.
Season 4 (2014- ).
Suits was renewed for a fourth season. The first episode of Season 4 aired on 11 June 2014. The second episode of Season 4 aired on 18 June 2014. The third episode of the season was aired on 25 June 2014.
Development and production.
"Suits" first appeared on USA network's development slate under the title "A Legal Mind" in April 2010. In May, the network placed a cast-contingent pilot order from a pilot script written by Aaron Korsh. Patrick J. Adams was cast in the lead role of Mike Ross in July 2010. In late July, Gabriel Macht joined the cast as Harvey Specter, the attorney who hires Mike. Rick Hoffman came on board in mid-August to portray Harvey's competition at the law firm. Meghan Markle and Gina Torres joined the cast in late August. Torres was cast as Jessica Pearson, the managing partner at the firm, and Markle portrays Rachel Zane, a paralegal who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. Sarah Rafferty completed the main cast as Donna, Harvey's legal secretary and close confidant. The pilot was filmed in New York City in fall 2010.
The network gave a green-light to the series with a 12-episode order on January 19, 2011. The series began filming in Toronto, Ontario on April 25, 2011, and completed August 12, 2011.
"Greenback Boogie" by Ima Robot is the theme song of the show. It was released as a single on September 18, 2010, and is included on the band's third album, "Another Man's Treasure".
A deleted scene leaked onto YouTube shows Victor Garber as Phillip Hardman, originally part of the pilot, but which was decided by the USA Network to be cut out completely. It shows that Hardman was a kinder fellow who retired from the firm by his own choice. This scene was left in for the U.K. when it was first aired and continues to be included in re-runs.

Baculus of Sorrento

Saint Baculus of Sorrento () is venerated as a bishop of Sorrento. 
The "Life of Saint Antoninus, Abbot of Sorrento", composed in the 9th century or sometime after, mentions some patron saints of Sorrento: the bishops Renatus, Athanasius, and Baculus. The "Life" includes a description of the saints obtained from painting hanging at the time in the cathedral of Sorrento. 
The time when Baculus is supposed to have been bishop of the city is uncertain. Ferdinando Ughelli, basing his findings on a manuscript dating from after the 12th century found in Sorrento Cathedral, believed that Baculus’ episcopate occurred in the 7th century. The Bollandists believed Baculus lived around 660 AD. Francesco Lanzoni, however, writes that “the "Vita Sancti Baculi", in the section that concerns the episcopate of its hero, does not contain any chronological detail concerning the same. Nothing, therefore, can prevent us from believing that he may have lived in the fourth or fifth centuries.”
Veneration.
The traditional date of Baculus’ death was August 27, which became his feast day, celebrated by Sorrento. Baculus’ relics were initially buried in the wall of the city, but were then translated to the church of San Felice. From the 15th to 18th centuries, there existed a chapel dedicated to Baculus.
The church of Santi Felice e Baccolo in Sorrento, also known as the Chiesa del Rosario, is partly dedicated to him. His relics rest in this church.

Agenor Mafra-Neto

Agenor Mafra-Neto, PhD, is a chemical ecology researcher and entrepreneur in the entomological field of insect chemical ecology. He is the CEO of ISCA Technologies, a company specializing in the development semiochemical solutions for pest management, robotic smart traps and nanosensors. Dr Mafra-Neto is the CEO and Director of Research and Development at ISCA Technologies, Inc. which he founded in 1996 in Riverside, California. ISCA Tecnologias, Ltda was founded in Brazil in 1997.
Education.
Mafra-Neto came to the U.S. from Brazil in 1988 and received his PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, under the guidance of Ring T. Carde. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Thomas C. Baker at Iowa State University at Ames, and has worked at the Universidade de Alfenas Universidade de São Paulo Ribeirao Preto, Western Carolina University, and University of California, Riverside.
Mafra-Neto is known for his work in the chemical orientation of insects, both basic and applied research. Dr. Mafra-Neto’s expertise is in determining an insect’s responsiveness to pheromone-containing lures (pheromone trap) and in disrupting their orientation to a pheromone source (mating disruption). Dr. Mafra-Neto has worked on the modification of insect behavior using semiochemicals both in the lab and in the field.
Research work.
On a basic scientific level, his research has included the 1) the behavior of insects in the presence of complete and incomplete blends of pheromone at different doses, 2) the effect of combining pheromones with insecticides, and 3) different forms of pheromone presentation and their effect on flying males.
Career in chemical ecology/entomology.
In terms of applied science Dr. Mafra-Neto has developed and co-developed several semiochemical tools, devices and strategies for pest management. One such strategy is an inexpensive attract-and-kill system developed for small cotton growers in Brazil. Two examples of more technologically advanced strategies to release semiochemicals are the Metered Semiochemical Timed-Release System (MSTRS) and Specialized Pheromone & Lure Application Technology (SPLAT). The development of the MSTRS or Puffers, resulted in a novel, automated device that holds large quantities of pheromone under pressure, and actively releases exact doses of active ingredients at set intervals throughout a programmed period, proven to control pests in very diverse environments including storage facilities, grasslands and corn fields (Baker et al. 1997 J. Agric.and cranberry bogs SPLAT is a proprietary base matrix formulation of biologically inert materials used to control the release of semiochemicals and/or odors with or without pesticides. Extensive research on SPLAT using a variety of lures demonstrates that this matrix emits semiochemicals at effective pest suppression levels for a time interval ranging from 2–30 weeks, controlling larvae and adult insect pests.
Managing mosquitoes and the diseases they vector: Trojan Cows.
Dr. Mafra-Neto has developed an artificial scent, called Abate, that has the key semiochemical elements to provide a signature of human host smell to mosquitoes and other blood feeding insects. Spraying abate on an animal can trick anthropophilic disease-transmitting insects, such as malaria mosquitoes, into attacking animals rather than their preferred human hosts, thereby reducing infection rates. Malaria-causing parasites, carried by mosquitoes, identify the human hosts that help them reproduce by detecting the semiochemicals that now are contained in the Abate formulation. Cattle are resistant to malaria and many other human diseases transmitted by insects, and are often treated with deworming medication, which has a toxic effect on mosquitoes and their parasites. Abate opens up the possibility for novel ways to reduce the impact of insect vectored diseases, such as malaria. This is being tested with generous funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The use of Abate in tandem with area-wide deworming campaigns has the potential to disrupt the transmission cycle of insect vectored human diseases, like malaria, in the treated areas.
Smart traps and sensors.
Dr. Mafra-Neto has developed IP that resulted in several patents, including on autonomous, area-wide monitoring and reporting systems, on smart traps and pest identification sensors. His research on sensors, including nanosensors and sensor signals resulted in competitive awards from several agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DoD), US Army, Air Force, NIST Advanced Technologies Program (ATP) from the Department of Commerce, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) among others. Together with Dr. Eamonn Keogh, he received the first prize in the 2012 Vodafone Americas Foundation's Wireless Innovation Project and a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations Grant.

<doc id="30987811" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30987811" title="Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr">
Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr

Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr (Arabic: أبو بكر يونس جابر ) was the Libyan Minister of Defence under the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. His official position was Secretary of the Libyan General Interim Committee for Defence.
Early life and education.
There is disagreement about the year of Jabr's birth. According to the UN he was born in 1952 in Jalu, Libya. The German newspaper the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" gives the much earlier date of 1940. Educated at the Military Academy in Benghazi, Jabr shared classes with the young Muammar Gaddafi.
Career.
Later Gaddafi and Jabr became members of the Free Officers Movement which on 1 September 1969 removed King Idris from power in a bloodless coup and brought Gaddafi to power. Jabr has been head of the Libyan Army since the 1970s and was one of the original members of the 12 army officials of the Revolutionary Command Council led by Gaddafi.
Libyan civil war.
Jabr was reported to be under arrest and in prison for not obeying orders to kill protesters.
It was reported on 7 June 2011 that Jabr was executed by Gaddafi for refusing to carry out orders to kill protesters. On 13 June, Libyan state television showed footage of him for the first time, in what they claim was him greeting soldiers at the frontline in the oil town of Brega. On 2 August, "The Washington Post" wrote that on Libyan state television, Gaddafi’s defense minister, Jabr, announced that members of the army who defected to join the rebels and returned to the regime would be protected by a general pardon.
Death.
Jabr died in the Battle of Sirte. On 20 October 2011, Al Jazeera reported that Jabr was killed in Sirte. He was in a car convoy with Gaddafi trying to flee from the Siege of Sirte. After the convoy was attacked by NATO aircraft he sought shelter from shrapnel in drain pipes with Gaddafi. NTC fighters captured him and Gaddafi. Yunis Jabr was with a group of Gaddafi loyalists, when a guard saw a group of rebels approaching them, off in the distance. He then threw a grenade at them. However, the grenade then bounced off of a concrete wall, and landed back in front of them. The guard then attempted to pick the grenade up, but when he did so, it exploded, killing both the guard and Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr. Witnesses say that Yunis Jabr then died, on his way to a hospital. Abdul Hakim Al Jalil, commander of the NTC's 11th brigade, later showed a photo of Jabr's dead body to Reuters. Al Jazeera also aired footage of his body being driven away in an ambulance.
In January 2012, footage of Jabr's body being abused and spray painted by rebels appeared on YouTube.

Architect-led design–build

Design-build construction methods, where the designer and constructor are the same entity or are on the same team rather than being hired separately by the owner, began to make a resurgence in America at the end of the twentieth century. Most of these design-build projects were and are led by the contractor, who hires an architect to design its building, which the contractor then builds for its client, the owner.
More recently, some architects have begun to embrace a lead role in the design-build approach. They contract with the owner both to design and to construct a building, and they procure the construction services either by subcontracting to a general contractor or by contracting directly with the various construction trades. Ironically, although the notion of an architect leading a design-build team is considered new and innovative, it is really a return to the construction approach employed for the millennia prior to the twentieth century, in which the architect was the Masterbuilder, rather than merely the designer.
The following definition describes, assesses and compares the architect-led design–build (ALDB) process to other, related architectural project delivery methods. It focuses on the architect’s role in each method, and characterizes that role in terms of responsibility. Responsibility is interpreted in terms of how much direct contact with the client (building owner) and how much control over the project the architect has, and how much risk the architect bears. The architect's role and responsibilities may change in function of the geopolitical location of the development and other criteria.
This definition of ALDB outlines the broader context of design–build, presenting that as an alternative to the traditional design–bid–build process for making buildings. First, this traditional process is introduced, then the distinct forms of design–build are explained, and from there, the focus narrows to examine specific forms of the architect-led design build method, what distinguishes it, the benefits and limitations, the results that it can achieve.
While relevant parties are described here in the masculine or third person (as "he" or "they"), these references are for brevity, intended to be inclusive, representing architects, building owners and contractors.
Introduction and context.
Traditional design–bid–build projects.
Of various approaches to making buildings, the traditional design–bid–build process is one in which a building owner hires an architect to design a building and provide a complete set of design and construction documents (drawings); a pool of general contractors bid to deliver the project’s construction; the architect is hired by the building owner to aid in selecting a general contractor from those bidding on the job; the architect’s set of stamped, completed and approved plans are handed off to the contracted GC, to establish a contractual agreement which binds the contractor to build the building exactly as shown in the drawings, approved plans / blue prints. From the plans/blue prints and under the GC’s supervision, the project is built.
The traditional design–bid–build approach remains suitable for many projects, and where the architect remains in control of the project and beyond the design phase to supervise construction fully, or otherwise, it is definitely preferable. It is also comprehensively governed and endorsed by the American Institute of Architects.
The architect’s role in traditional design–bid–build.
This sequential process separates design and construction into independent tasks. Furthermore, the owner’s two contracts – the first with the architect and the second with the general contractor – sets up discrete teams of specialists. Each may take too narrow a view of the whole, and if, with respective responsibilities unclear, tasks overlap or are overlooked, the parties’ relationship can become more adversarial than collaborative. Fear of the resulting litigation that often targets the architect can drive architects to absent themselves from the hurly-burly of the construction process. If less involved on site, the architect may lose opportunities to inform construction, as an advocate for the client's vision and as a steward of the original design intent. Not only does this handover of responsibility diminish the architect's standing, the lack of continuity may also compromise the quality of the project outcomes.
Design–build as an alternative to design–bid–build.
Not all design–build projects are alike. Here, there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects. Architect-led Design Build is a form of ‘design–build’ that, according to the DBIA, has been rapidly gaining market share in the United States over the past 15 years. The Design Build Institute of America describes the design–build process as follows:
Taking singular responsibility, the design–build team is accountable for cost, schedule and performance, under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork, clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts. And, by closing warranty gaps, building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims.
The DBIA's 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the United States.
Architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name "Designer-led design–build." Although employed primarily by architects, architectural technologists and other architectural professions, the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an interior designer who is not an architect, and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural, civil, mechanical or other engineers. In addition, it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services.
Design–build continues to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction today.
In March 2011, industry consultants ZweigWhite published "Design-Bid-Build meets the opposition". In it, they suggest that while Design-Bid-Build "still rules", the traditional approach is losing favor as "alternative project delivery methods threaten design-bid-build model." While not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically, the article states that D/B already accounts for 27% of projects, according to their 2010 Project Management Survey and goes on to argue that,
The emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder, as exemplified by D/B and IPD Project Delivery.
Design–build workflow.
The dynamic architect-led design–build workflow reintroduces discursive coordination, collaboration and consistent, reflexive managerial oversight over the arc of a project schedule, maximizing project efficiency (time, cost, functionality) without compromising design performance or the quality of project outcomes. Design–build can be an iterative and dynamic method, reflecting an emergent design process in which decisions are made holistically and progressively refined as interdependencies are prioritized, identified and coordinated.
Contractor-led design–build projects: the architect's role.
On contractor-led design–build projects, management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who, in turn, coordinates subcontractors. Architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):
(1) Architect as employee of contractor.
The architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee. The architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches.
(2) Architect as a subcontractor.
Here, the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor. The architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control.
(3) Architect as second party in contractor-led integrated project delivery (IPD).
The architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. The contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to the contractor. The architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to the contractor.
Architect-led design–build projects.
Architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process, where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated, and the architect, as owner-advocate, project-steward and team-leader, ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes. In architect-led design–build projects, the architect works directly with the owner (the client), acts as the designer and builder, coordinating a team of consultants, subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle.
Architects lead design–build projects in several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):
(4) Architect as provider of extended services.
Contracted to the owner, the architect extends his services beyond the design phase, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner. The architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects.
(5) Architect as primary party in architect-led Integrated Project Delivery (IPD).
Again, as in (C) above, the architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement.
An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into further subcontracts with the trades. This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract. It is the "flip side of the coin" of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.
(6) Architect as full service leader of design build process.
Contracted to the owner, the architect offers full service to the owner, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors, consultants and vendors, and involving them throughout the project, start to finish, from design through construction. The architect’s role shifts during the project, from designer to site supervisor (effectively taking the role of a general contractor), but monitors the project vision, and is able to call upon his subcontractors’ construction expertise throughout. The architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach, or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects.
Workflow.
In design–build projects led by architects, the architect has the opportunity to lead the team through progressive iterations during the design–build process instead of producing sequential, schematic, design, construction drawings and construction administration documents. These continuous feedback loops extend the phase in which the team is dedicated to producing the most informed design. Each iteration is progressively informed by budgets, continuously improving information and the best efficient construction techniques.
The architect≠client relationship renegotiated
Together, client and architect can prioritize their decisions so choices can be made when the relevant information for making decisions is actually available. This is in contrast to the typical process in which architects are constrained to make speculative choices without accurate cost or technical information, and clients are invited to make decisions only at review milestones.
Here, the architect is able to co-design with the client in an ongoing exchange throughout a project, so the client retains more influence over the design, and once on site, is a more informed stakeholder during construction. This way, architect-led design–build can be co-creative, and the most appropriate project outcomes can emerge from this active dialogue between clients, designers and fabricators. The process allows clients the opportunity to participate with full transparency in the financials of the project throughout its time-line.
Over the arc of a building project, the architect’s strategic leadership role remains constant but their tasks may vary from:
Reintegrating practice, towards a modern architecture
Throughout an architect-led design–build project, design and construction considerations are inextricable from each other until each are optimized. This design–build approach allows for a dynamic, recursive process rather than a linear one, for construction expertise early and design expertise late. So, rather than designing-then-building, architect-led design–build works like this:
Key features.
Challenging the split between design and construction
Better business
In architect-led design–build projects, the leading architect:
Above all, the architect leading the design–build project empowers the architects and contractors to produce better, cost effective, higher quality, context-sensitive, high performance buildings. How? By comprehending, prioritizing, and designing according to specific relationships between scope, quality and time, and by optimizing cost to program.
So by inviting architects to lead, design–build methods give architects a platform for advocating clients, respecting craftsmanship and reasserting the value of architects’ expertise, improving the built environment, and for doing better business. The more functional and less fearful the architect's business, the more attention they can pay to producing high quality design outcomes.
Generating unique outcomes by replicable methods
Consistent and recursive, the design–build process can generate unique, high quality buildings that improve and optimize the broader built environment and work for and are tailored to clients beyond the construction schedule, within specific budgetary, scheduling and site constraints. By removing impediments mostly ascribed to aggressive risk management, the approach broadens the scope for greater architectural creativity. This way, outcomes are more likely to respond to functionality, synthesize context, social intent and artistic sensibility.
Appropriate and successful application across a broad range of projects
Architect-led design build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects (private residences, non-profit institutions, museums), for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords, particularly:
These less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the "broken buildings and busted budgets" described by Barry Lepatner. Rather, the less prescriptive the project, the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion. So it follows that for the broadest range of building projects, the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client.
Unifying strategy and practice
The Architect-led design build process synthesizes strategy and craft, so project outcomes cohere with client objectives. Connecting problem-solving (‘brains on’ design activities) to physical outcomes (‘hands on’ construction activities), as vernacular architecture and grand industrial crafts-led architecture have both done, the architect-led design–build approach assumes that design decisions are informed and improved by knowledge of fabrication options, tools and techniques, and that construction will more likely match a client’s project objectives if it follows an overall design intention. It is not a nostalgic endeavor but a reclamation of thinking and making, a reintegration after mid-twentieth century specialization.
Flexible
A design–build process led by an architect can be open, consistent, tolerant to inevitable or necessary changes during construction. Transparent to all participating consultants, it demystifies the decision-making process for clients. As co-creators, clients’ input informs design as it happens, not just during the design phase. In exchange, architects leading a design build process maintain oversight of what gets built on behalf of clients, rather than ceding control to contractors.
Generating recursive knowledge
The process and the knowledge it produces is recursive: Since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project, to assess efficiencies, opportunity costs, payback rates and quality options. Their input informs overall design decisions from the outset. Cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset. Building performance is measured early too, so that trade offs between budget, schedule, functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design.
Architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology and materials available to building professionals, and translate what they learn into their design work. This knowledge is fed back, not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams, throughout a studio, or more broadly to the profession, and can become an active source of insight in and of itself.
Contracts.
The architect leading the design–build project works with the client, acting as the single point of contact to a unified team of end-to-end service providers, including architects and construction trades people. The architect, as the “ALDB entity”, can guarantee the price for the complete structure to cover the building owner under a single contract, determining where funds are best spent.
A single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities, rather than two discrete contracts for each, acknowledges the interdependence of the architects’ and construction trades’ project responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of disputes.
"Advanced Design-Build Strategies for Architects" by Dorwin AJ Thomas, formerly chairman of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Design–build Knowledge Community, includes more detail on contracts for design–build projects, and further project examples.
Advantages.
According to the DBIA, the design–build approach offers advantages to owners, including:
"One team, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion."[http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/][http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html]
Overall benefits.
Design–build architects learn from experience in a dynamic, live process during an evolving project, to achieve design goals and yield authentic outcomes: From experience, they are able to work with placeholders, anticipating when to defer design decisions and trusting that as open-ended options become limited and details more precise, a robust, appropriate authentic design can and will emerge. In this sense, design–build is as much an art as it is a tried and trusted methodology.
Architect-led design–build: limitations and constraints.
Advocates of architect-led design build also offer critiques of the approach, highlighting:
Issues that an architect-led approach to design–build still does not overcome:

Immigrant Mother (sculpture)

Immigrant Mother is a public artwork by Croatian artist Ivan Meštrović located in Cathedral Square Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The bronze sculpture sits on a red granite base and depicts a mother with her children.
Description.
Meštrović's "Immigrant Mother" is located in Milwaukee's Cathedral Square, opposite the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. It stands 7 feet high on top of a 4 feet and 4 inches tall pedestal. The female figure carries a baby in her arms, while a young child stands beside her. An inscription on the front of the base states:
DEDICATED TO THE/
VALIANT IMMIGRANT MOTHERS/
BY WILLIAM GEORGE BRUCE/
IVAN Meštrović
SCULPTOR
Historical information.
William George Bruce (1856-1949) was the force behind the creation of "Immigrant Mother". Bruce was a newspaper business manager in Milwaukee born from German parents. He established the Bruce Publishing Company, and is best known for his efforts in developing and administering the Milwaukee Auditorium. The esteemed businessman was president of the Milwaukee Harbor Commission and instrumental in developing Milwaukee's position as a world port on the Seaway. He even published a three-volume history of the City of Milwaukee. "Due to his distinguished public service career, Bruce gained the sobriquet 'Mr. Milwaukee." 
Bruce bequeathed $30,000 to the city of Milwaukee for the creation of a sculpture that symbolized universal motherhood. It was to be dedicated to his mother, Apollonia Becker Bruce, as well as to all immigrant mothers bringing up children in the New World. "Bruce's heirs chose Ivan Meštrović to carry out this commission as Meštrović had immortalized his own mother's image in many of his religious sculptures; Milwaukee's "Immigrant Mother" may be an example of this homage." "Immigrant Mother" was placed in Cathedral Square in recognition of Bruce's lifelong devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. 
The sculpture demonstrates the dignity of motherhood. It depicts a mother carrying one child, with another child at her side, in a simple figural style. Tool marks are apparent on the sculpture's rough surface.

Scatarie Island

Scatarie Island is an island in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located off the coast of Baleine, Cape Breton Island.
History.
During the Anglo-French War (1627–1629), under Charles 1, by 1629 the Kirkes took Quebec City, Sir James Stewart of Killeith, Lord Ochiltree planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at Baleine, and Alexander’s son, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling established the first incarnation of “New Scotland” at Port Royal, Nova Scotia. This set of British triumphs which left only Cape Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia and area) as the only major French holding in North America was not destined to last. Charles 1’s haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632). 
Ochiltree arrived with 60 Brownists and built Fort Rosemar. It was a military colony, one that owed its origins to the exigencies of war, not a permanent agricultural settlement. Ochiltree's primary objective was to erect a military post to assert Charles 1 claims, and by extension the rights of the Merchant Adventures to Canada, in a crucial theatre that linked the St. Lawrence with Nova Scotia. Ochiltree's party carried a hefty supply of guns, ammunition, and heavy artillery. One of the first acts was to attack and capture a sixty-ton Portuguese barque that they found at anchor near the site of their proposed settlement. The ship was dismantled and stripped of its cannon, which were then used as additional artillery to guard Fort Rosemar. Ochiltree proceeded to capture French fishing vessels off the shores of Cape Breton. 
During this time when Nova Scotia briefly became a Scottish Colony, there were three battles between the Scots and the French: one at Saint John; another at Cape Sable Island; and the other at Baleine.
Siege of Baleine.
Charles Daniel arrived with 53 men and numerous friendly natives. He captured two shallops manned by fishermen from Rosemar, and imprisoned them. On September 10, he approached the fort and assured the British he was coming in peace. The French then attacked by bombarding the fort with cannon fire from the ships and Daniel conducting a land assault. Daniel was a harsh captor. He ordered Ochiltree and his company to demolish their fort and forced the prisoners to Grand Cibou (present-day Englishtown, Nova Scotia). There Daniel had Ochiltree and his men construct a new fort Fort Sainte Anne (Nova Scotia). Then he sailed the prisoners to France, where Ochiltree was thrown in jail for a month.
Naval blockade.
During the French and Indian War, in the build up to the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the British ran a naval blockade of Louisbourg off the coast of Baleine and Scatarie Island. Similarly the French were capturing British ships. Between August 1756 and October 1757, the French captured 39 British ships. The British pursued two French ships off of Scatarie Island: the Arc-end-Ciel (52 guns) and the frigate Concorde. The two ships had crossed the Atlantic together but got separated at the Grand Banks during a storm. The most significant single prize the British captured in 1756 was the Arc-en-Ciel. The ship was captured on 12 June off Scatarie after a long chase and a five-hour gun battle. The warship had on board sixty thousand livres in specie and as many as 200 recruits. The British kept the Arc-en-Ciel in Atlantic waters for the next few years, sailing ourt of Halifax. It would form part of the fleet the British put together to attack Louisbourg in 1758.
At the same time, the Concorde initially eluded the Royal Navy on two occasions. The ship had 50 passengers made up of troops and stonemasons and 30 thousand livres in coin. On June 10 the Concorde slipped into the protected by on Scatarie Island. When it sailed out, the pursuit began anew. The Concorde headed for Port Dauphin (Englishtown) but eventually unloaded everyone and the money on board to a schooner who could safely make it to Louisbourg.
Recent events.
On September 20, 2011, the 222m Great Lakes freighter MV Miner ran aground on the shoals on the North side of the Island. As of October 12, the majority of the fluids on the ship have been drained, but the wreck has developed a large hole and it is unlikely the ship will be able to be re-floated. Costs of the potential salvage job to remove the wreck have been quoted at approximately $24 million.

Alberta Banner Turner

Alberta Banner Turner (March 17, 1909 - January 31, 2008) is the first African American to receive a doctorate in Psychology from the Ohio State University, and a noted civil rights and women's rights activist in the field of Psychology.
Professional life.
Education.
Dr. Turner received her Ph.D. in 1935 for her dissertation entitled: "The Effect of Practice on the Perception and Memorization of Digits Presented in Single Exposures." Dr. Turner, was a dedicated OSU student and Alpha Kappa Alpha alumni, earned her bachelor's degree in 1929 and a master's degree in psychology in 1932 from the university 
Career.
Dr. Turner became the Department Head of the Home Economics department at what was then known as Winston-Salem College in North Carolina from 1935 through 1936 before moving on to become the Chair of the Home Economics Division at Lincoln University in Missouri from 1936 through 1937; from 1938-1939 Head of the Department of Home Economics at Southern University in Louisiana; 1939 Head of the home economics department at Bennett College for Women in North Carolina. During this period she lectured on consumer issues at the college and in the summer of 1941 was awarded a fellowship to Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri for study at the school's Institute of Consumer Education. She was the first black woman to do so. In 1944 Dr. Turner returned to Ohio as a Clinician at the Ohio Bureau of Juvenile Research (what is now known as the Ohio Department of Youth Services.
Upon her return to Ohio, Dr. Turner grew very active in her research and during the 1950s she lectured at the Ohio State University in the areas of psychopathology and juvenile delinquency while continuing as a psychologist at what is now known as Ohio Department of Youth Services. She earned the position of Supervising Psychologist at the Juvenile Diagnostic Center in 1953 and was promoted to Chief Psychologist in 1959. This period of her life is also marked her diligent work as a clinical psychologist working with juveniles at Marysville Reformatory for Women (now known as Ohio Reformatory for Women). In 1963 Dr. Turner was promoted to the Central Administrative Office of the Ohio Youth Commission and became the Director of Research for the Ohio Youth Commission, while continuing her work at the Ohio State University and the Ohio Reformatory for Women. Dr. Turner’s rigorous activities included her role with the Criminal Justice Supervisory Commission from 1972 to 1976. During this time, she also served as a consultant to the National Advisory Council on Vocational Rehabilitation.
Community involvement.
Dr. Turner was also active in African American social organizations. She served as the fourth president of the National Jack and Jill of America Foundation in 1953. Dr. Turner then became the founding president of the Columbus chapter and the first National Program Director of The Links Inc., which has 10,000 members nationwide. She has been instrumental in establishing the Prelude Scholarship and Recognition Program, a partnership of Links, Ohio State, and the Columbus Public Schools to honor minority students. Links also has funded an endowed scholarship at Ohio State to support minority students.
Recognition and awards.
In 1966, she was named one of the "Ten Women of the Year" by the Columbus Citizen-Journal. Upon her retirement in 1971 she was awarded a citation from the State of Ohio for a lifetime of work in the field of Juvenile Rehabilitation and Treatment. In 1999 The Ohio State University recognized Dr. Turner with Distinguished Service Award duly noting: "Through her professional and academic activities, Turner has served as a role model and counselor for young people, especially troubled teenagers, and she has been a pioneer for African Americans in the diagnosis and treatment of delinquent behavior. She has been a strong advocate for racial, civil and religious rights and has worked tirelessly to ensure them for others". Her tireless efforts were not overlooked by the Ohio Psychological Association who in 2003 awarded Dr. Turner the “Achievement Award for a Psychologist in the Public Interest.” The motivating stories of Dr. Turner’s lifelong accomplishments are well written about in articles ranging from Jet magazine to Psychology of Women Quarterly and in each and every instance Dr. Turner is righteously held out as role model and inspiration for today’s youth.

No Woman No Cry (painting)

No Woman No Cry is a painting created by Chris Ofili in 1998. It was one of the works included in the exhibition which won him the Turner Prize that year (the first painter to win the prize since Howard Hodgkin in 1985). The "Financial Times" has described it as "his masterpiece".
The painting is in mixed media, including acrylic paint, oil paint, and polyester resin. Against a golden background, it depicts the portrait of a black woman with braided hair weeping. Each tear includes an collaged image of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in 1993 and whose mother, Doreen, was leading a campaign in 1998 for an inquiry into the failed murder investigation; the campaign for the inquiry was successful, with the final report declaring in 1999 that the police department conducting the investigation was "institutionally racist". The painting is sometimes described as being a portrait of Doreen Lawrence. Barely visible in phosphorescent paint (but clearer in dark conditions) are the words "R.I.P. Stephen Lawrence 1974-1993".
The canvas measures high by wide, and is displayed leaning against the gallery wall, supported by two dried, varnished lumps of elephant dung. A third lump forms the pendant of the necklace. Map pins on the lower two lumps spell out the painting's title.
The painting is Ofili's tribute to Stephen Lawrence. Ofili was inspired by the dignity of Stephen's mother, Doreen Lawrence, in the face of her personal tragedy. He also intends it to be seen as a more general portrayal of melancholy and grief. The "Financial Times" has described it as "a modern Pietà". It takes its name from Bob Marley's reggae song, "No Woman, No Cry".
The painting was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1999. It was included in a mid-career retrospective of Ofili's work at Tate Britain in 2010, and selected by the Tate as its initial painting to have a high-resolution gigapixel image included in the Google Art Project, together with an image taken in the dark to highlight the phosphorescent paint.

West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm

West of Duddon Sands Wind Farm (WoDS), occasionally also known as West Duddon Wind Farm is an offshore wind farm located south west of Walney Island off the coast of Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, in the Irish Sea, England. It is being developed by Morecambe Wind Ltd, a partnership between Scottish Power, Dong Energy and Eurus Energy. 
Location.
The wind farm gets its name from a large sand bank uncovered at low water in the mouth of the estuary of the River Duddon to the north of the Furness Peninsula. The farm will actually lie to the south west of the Duddon Sands and will cover an area of approximately 67 km2.
It is situated in the vicinity of three other wind farms. It is to the south of the Walney Wind Farm and Ormonde Wind Farm, and to the west of the Barrow Offshore Wind Farm.
Planning.
In 2004 Morecambe Wind was awarded a 50-year lease from The Crown Estate to develop a wind farm at West of Duddon Sands as part of the second UK offshore wind farm tendering process known as "Round 2".
The project includes constructing the wind turbines and their foundations, building offshore substations, installing power cables both undersea and onshore, as well as an extension to the existing onshore Electrical substation to house the equipment needed for connection into the UK National Grid. This work is estimated to take about 2 years.
Cables are supplied by NKT, and are 82 km of 155 kV sea cables and 22 km land cables, at a price of DKK 600 million.
The wind farm planning application was filed in April 2006 and consent was granted in September 2008. The application was for between 83 and 139 turbines with a nameplate capacity of 500 MW. However permission was granted for only 108 turbines due to geological siting issues. This will provide up to 389 MW of power.
Construction.
The 108 Siemens Wind Power 3.6 MW geared turbines cost €700 million installed, bringing the cost per turbine to €6.5m, or €1.8m per MW. Adding maintenance, transformator platform and cabling to shore brings the cost to £1.6 billion. The project has a 5-year warranty. Electrical work is expected to start in 2012, turbines installed in 2013, and operating in 2014.
The wind farm began generating power on 28 January 2014 when four turbines were connected to the grid.

Geopora sepulta

Geopora sepulta is a species of fungus belonging to the family Pyronemataceae. It is an uncommon European species. The first accepted record for Britain was a specimen collected in Kent in 1995.
This fungus forms a rounded ascocarp underground on sandy loam soils. This fruiting body remains subterranean for most of the year but breaks the surface in the spring to form a creamy-grey cup (apothecium) up to 4.5 cm across and 3 cm tall. It usually occurs in small groups.

Seara (newspaper)

Seara (, meaning "The Evening") was a daily newspaper published in Bucharest, Romania, before and during World War I. Owned by politician Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino and, through most of its existence, managed by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, it was an unofficial and unorthodox tribune for the Conservative Party. Its involvement in politics sparked numerous scandals, the longest of which came during the neutrality period (1914–1916). Strongly anti-Slavic, "Seara" stood out in that context for supporting the German Empire and Central Powers, and was widely alleged of having been financed by a German propaganda machine. In 1914, it was purchased by German businessmen, but continued to register mediocre success in comparison with its pro-Entente competitors. In late 1916, after Romania decided in favor of the Entente, "Seara" was disestablished.
Noted for publishing the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi, "Seara" was closely associated with the Romanian Symbolist movement. Through Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești and other contributors, it campaigned in favor Symbolism and, after 1913, popularized modern art. Although paying tribute to political conservatism throughout its existence, "Seara" was also home to anti-establishment contributors, allies in the anti-Entente cause. The newspaper sympathized with the Romanian Social Democratic Party, regularly hosting opinion pieces by socialists and anarchists.
Before 1914.
Beginnings.
Like the daily "Minerva", "Seara" was originally a creation of G. G. Cantacuzino, the Romanian magnate. Cantacuzino, who supported the Conservative Party inner faction of Alexandru Marghiloman, refrained from attaching his name to "Seara", later entrusting Bogdan-Pitești with the position of manager. In 1910, the year of its foundation, "Seara" also followed the Conservative doyens Petre P. Carp and Nicolae Filipescu, supporting Carp's strict monarchism and suggesting that the "Carpist-Filipescan" line was one of moral superiority.
Early in its existence, "Seara" reported on various events agitating public opinion, such as the Romanian Orthodox Church division between the traditionalists and those who supported communion with Rome. In one of its first issues, it hosted a disclaimer by Roman Catholic chanoine Joseph Baud, who calmed enraged Orthodox believers by assuring them that their Metropolitan Bishop Iosif Gheorghian had not died a Catholic. Later, "Seara" gave significant coverage to what it called "scandals in the Vatican", particularly so in the 1911 controversy surrounding Father Verdesi's conversion to Methodism; this prompted the Romanian Catholic press to list "Seara" among those newspapers "at odds with Christian ideas". 
At that stage in its history, "Seara" was also sympathetic to the cause of ethnic Romanians living abroad, in Transylvania and other regions of Austria-Hungary: in August 1911, it sent special correspondents to cover the congress of Romanian activist groups in Blußendref (Blaj). The newspaper also reported with disapproval on the growth of nationalism among the Hungarians, covering for a Romanian public the division of Hungarian Socialists along pro- and anti-nationalist politics, and accusing the Károly Khuen-Héderváry administration of subverting the Romanian National Party (PNR). "Seara"s articles gave exposure to the PNR's official reaction, as voiced by that party's speaker Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. It called Vaida-Voevod "one of the [PNR's] brilliant leaders", responsible "to a great extent for the rescue of party discipline and national solidarity". 
In March of the next year, "Seara" published an homage to journalist and ideologue Constantin Stere, noted for having brought back together the two factions of the PNR, and concluded: "Mr. C. Stere, although involved in our country's partisan politics, [...] has transmitted to our quarrelsome brothers a peace message from all of us, proving that the foremost preoccupation of our minds is and will be national solidarity, the pure love for the holy cause of Romaniandom." It later discussed the conflict between PNR politicians and Khuen-Héderváry's successor, László Lukács. In his reply to the PNR (paraphrased by "Seara"), Lukács equated the Romanians' political emancipation in Transylvania with militant irredentism, and prophesied that Transylvania was in real danger of being invaded by the Kingdom of Romania. "Seara" retorted by accusing Lukács of supporting "preemptive" Magyarization in "the multilingual Kingdom of Hungary".
The paper was also taking an interest in the political affairs of the Balkans. Shortly before the Balkan Wars, it published the appeal of Simion, a Greek Romanian politician and editor of Bucharest's "Patris" gazette, who gathered support for a Greco–Romanian alliance against the South Slavs. Simion posited that Romania and the Kingdom of Greece would eventually reach an understanding over the litigious issue of Aromanian nationhood, and blamed the conflict on "shrewd" Slavic meddling.
Moderate Symbolism.
"Seara" also made known its artistic credo, placing itself in the margin of Romanian Symbolism. According to art historian Dan Grigorescu, its awareness of European literature and its cultural effervescence, like those of "Facla", "Viitorul" and other Romanian periodicals with special cultural pages, were impressive. Up to April 1911 (when he was made director of the National Theater Bucharest), Ioan Bacalbașa was "Seara"s theater columnist. According to his colleagues in the Transylvanian press, Bacalbașa's columns for "Seara" and "Epoca" were a courageous defense of national literature. 
During his time at "Seara", Bacalbașa was seconded by poet Dumitru Karnabatt, later a political chronicler for the same newspaper. Karnabatt introduced the stage work of Henry Bataille (Issue 271/1910) and the Aestheticism of Oscar Wilde (editorial piece, Issue 52, 1910). Elsewhere (Issue 425/1911), "Seara" covered the hitherto supposed discovery of an unknown novel by Honoré de Balzac. Around that time, Karnabatt's own literary contributions for "Seara" were samples of Symbolist, Decadent and Impressionist travel writing, sometimes written together with his novelist wife Lucrezzia. 
Lucrezzia stopped writing for the paper in 1911, probably as a result of conflicts she had with Bogdan-Pitești, her marriage to Dumitru on the brink of failure. Sometimes signing as "Don Ramiro", Dumitru remained affiliated with "Seara", and in charge of its artistic policies. The newspaper's traditional conservatism was still being reflected in its artistic choices. During late 1910, Karnabatt gave poor reviews to the more rebellious Symbolist painters to emerge from the "Tinerimea Artistică" salon, and deemed the primitivist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși a madman. 
In January 1911, the same author used the newspaper to publicize his dislike of Futurism, a modern art and anti-establishment current originating in Italy. Reviewing the "Futurist Manifesto", he called for "demented" author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti to be "tied down". Karnabatt further proposed that Marinetti's exacerbated modernism was an atavistic manifestation of the Barbarian Invasions: "an absurd heredity within the Italian people, this people of art and of idealism". Closely following similar developments in French culture, "Seara" supported Jean Richepin's protest against "excessive modernism" and the division of labor. The pro-Richepin article, signed by Prince Constantin de Brancovan, saw print in Issue 53/1911. 
In Decadent spirit, Karnabatt's essays in "Seara" advocate a reevaluation of Rococo and "fête galante" aesthetics. He was revolted by "the horrors of contemporary painting"—Pissarro, Monet, etc.—, citing as his reference "the fine and erudite art critic, the independent and courageous" Sâr Péladan (who was, incidentally, Bogdan-Pitești's mentor). In a September issue, "Don Ramiro" Karnabatt declared himself horrified that some were proposing to honor the inveterate gambler Avrillon with a public monument, announcing that France had given in to "vice". By then, he was giving positive reviews to "decadent poets" of the "dead cities" (Georges Rodenbach, Dimitrie Anghel), and enthusiastic about the establishment of community theaters to promote a "noble and pure art", away from "the platitudes and pettiness of modern life".
In "Seara", "Don Ramiro" was also contributing to the publicity campaigns mounted by Symbolist doyen Alexandru Macedonski and by Macedonski's painter son, Alexis. For Karnabatt, their contribution to Symbolism was a horizon "of violent and tormented passion". "Seara"s support for Macedonski's cosmopolitanism earned Karnabatt criticism from the anti-Symbolist Transylvanians.
Blackmail scandals.
During spring 1913, Cantacuzino formally liquidated his business, and Bogdan-Pitești was officially installed as manager of "Seara". According to the rival satirical magazine "Furnica", although "Seara" was "stillborn" when it came to commercial success, the move was intriguing for the reading public. The conservative principles stated by Cantacuzino seemed largely incompatible with the radical activism that had made Bogdan-Pitești a mistrusted public figure. Bogdan-Pitești, whose background was in French anarchism, announced that the new editorial line centered on some of Cantacuzino's bugbears: universal suffrage, feminism, land reform, Jewish emancipation etc. In March of that year, "Seara" was also joined by a most fervent contributor, the poet and lampoonist Arghezi. 
Although supporting the Conservative Party before and after that moment, "Seara" was focusing its efforts on attacking the Conservative-Democratic Party of Take Ionescu, with whom the Conservative Premier Titu Maiorescu had formed a coalition (one resented by Cantacuzino and Bogdan-Pitești). In this context, critic Ion Vianu notes, "Seara" became "an aggressive publication, with a history of base attacks and blackmail." The anti-Ionescu discourse was notably outlined in an Arghezi article of September 11, 1913. It collectively and disparagingly identified the Conservative-Democrats (or "Takists") as "ciocoi" ("upstarts"), accusing them of having repressed in blood the 1907 peasant revolt: "They are the symbol of 1907, when, his arms, chest, shoulders and back loaded with ravens, with "ciocoi", the peasant tore himself away from his field, split himself, fought to chase them away and [...] fell down murdered by the claws that clutched down, tore down into his flesh and reached inside to his soul and killed it as well. These "ciocoi", we will eradicate." In a 1913 issue, Romanian Land Forces General ștefan Stoica referred to Ionescu's men as "craii de Curtea-Veche" ("the Old Court rakes"), another colloquialism for "upstarts".
One of "Seara"s prime targets was Public Works Minister Alexandru Bădărău, called "filthy con man", accused of taking massive bribes from American investors in Romanian oil and of employing in his staff some 150 women in exchange for sexual favors. Nicolae Titulescu, the young Conservative Democrat politician and bureaucrat, was ridiculed for having acquired, through his foreign connections, an original tapestry from the Gobelins Manufactory. Notably, senior politician Nicolae Fleva lent his pen to these allegations, writing in "Seara" that Bădărău had serious psychiatric problems. Documenting Bogdan-Pitești's Catholic faith and Arghezi's anticlericalism, "Seara" lampooned the Orthodox Church, and was discredited as the offshoot of "Papist propaganda".
According to literary critics such as Barbu Cioculescu and Vianu, "Seara" may have had for its informant the Symbolist writer Mateiu Caragiale—a client of Bogdan-Pitești's, he had become a chief of staff for Bădărău. In diaries he kept after his split with Bogdan-Pitești, Caragiale himself alleged that "Seara"s publisher was being paid to harass "without pity, in biting manner, all those whom Cantacuzino would grace with his unfriendliness or antipathy", in particular the Conservative-Democrats. Although he never signed articles for "Seara", Caragiale was by then receiving regular payments from its patrons.
At the peak of Cantacuzino's negative campaign against the Conservative-Democrats, "Seara" also attacked private enterprises, including the Marmorosch Blank Bank. Bogdan-Pitești was taken to court by owner Aristide Blank, and N. Fleva organized his defense. According to the records kept by Caragiale, Blank effectively set a "trap" with the cooperation of Romanian Police, and Bogdan-Pitești, found guilty of blackmail, was sentenced to nine months in prison. "Seara" fared badly during the period, and was out of print by autumn 1913.
Modernist platform.
Before and after the 1913 hiatus, with Bogdan-Pitești and Arghezi at its helm, "Seara" expanded its range, encouraging the development of modernist literature, and playing a part in the transition from Romanian Symbolism to 20th century avant-garde. Its art chronicles celebrated the international success of modern artists Constantin Brâncuși and Pascin, both of whom, "Seara" argued, were culturally tied to Romania. Revising its stance, the newspaper published Arghezi's account of the new "Tinerimea Artistică" modern art exhibit (April 1913), mentioning Bogdan-Pitești's role as an art patron and instigator of change. The two intellectuals also promoted the works by young artist Theodor Pallady, most notably with a series of articles in which Arghezi spoke about Pallady paintings in the Bogdan-Pitești collection. The magazine, already noted for publishing political cartoons by Nicolae Petrescu Găină, was also joined by Marcel Janco, known later for his work as a Dada and Constructivist artist.
During those years, "Seara" also enlisted two poets formerly affiliated with "Simbolul" review: the Imagist Adrian Maniu and the experimental Symbolist Ion Vinea. By summer 1914, the latter's articles included jibes against the moderate Symbolist figure Ovid Densusianu, ridiculing his disciples at "Versuri și Proză" magazine (the beginning of a dispute which Vinea would pursue in more depth during his time at "Chemarea" magazine). In addition to poetry and prose fragments, Vinea was assigned a regular column about life in Bucharest. Also published by "Seara" was the Symbolist George Bacovia, with poetry pieces such as "Winter Lead", "Autumn Nerves" and "Poem in the Mirror"—generally second editions, previously published in "Noua Revistă Română" and other reviews; they were later included in Bacovia's lionized collection "Plumb".
Himself a literary chronicler, Tudor Arghezi investigated the cultural phenomena of the day. One of his articles denounced Edmond Rostand as a kitsch author, suited to the tastes of "chromolithograph buyers." He also reviewed Wilde's comedy "An Ideal Husband" (Issue 1/1914) and, unusually, ridiculed the Symbolist poetry of Mateiu Caragiale. Under Arghezi, "Seara" popularized international modern art, notably by publishing the Fauvist drawings of André Derain.
Arghezi's main focus was on satire, which he often directed at traditionalists and ethnic nationalists, particularly those arriving in from Transylvania. One such text attacked the poet laureate Octavian Goga, accusing him and other Transylvanian refugees of hoarding bureaucratic positions in the Kingdom of Romania. In a 1913 piece, Arghezi targeted scholar Ion Bianu for allegedly mismanaging the Romanian Academy Library: "From his longjohns and his cleated boots, Mr. Bianu has jumped straight into the aristocracy and [...] turned our library [...] into his own, Transylvanian, empire. [...] An impertinent voice submits one to a detailed interrogation. It is Mr. Bianu, a jaundiced liver with a moustache, with the evil gaze of a man who collects many salaries but is aware of his own voidness and dullness".
As part of its emancipation agenda, "Seara" expressed sympathy for the Romanian Jews, and, in contrast to the antisemitism of more traditionalist reviews, accepted works sent in by Jewish writers. In October 1913, "Seara" obtained and published a confidential order which gave Romanian Land Forces officers a free hand to discriminate against Jewish recruits. In September 1914, it hosted the journalistic debut of Jewish avant-garde author Jacques G. Costin, who was, with Vinea, caretaker of the cultural pages. Like Arghezi and Vinea, Costin experimented with satirical genres, his sketch story techniques borrowed from 19th century classic Ion Luca Caragiale (Mateiu's father). Some of the poems published in "Seara" were authored by Arghezi's Jewish wife, Constanța Zissu. "Seara" was also receiving contributions from Grigore Goilav, the Armenian Romanian ethnographer and art historian.
Neutrality years.
Germanophilia and propaganda.
A final period in "Seara"s history coincided with the start of World War I and Romania's neutrality period. As public opinion divided itself between supporters of the Entente Powers and those who favored the Central Powers, "Seara" and "Minerva" stood for the latter group, the "Germanophiles". The two papers reputedly entered this competition for the public eye with a handicap. An Ententist daily, "Adevărul", claimed that, together, "Seara" and "Minerva" had consumed 481 tons of paper in printing from January 1 to August 31, 1914 (for itself and "Dimineața", it claimed a figure of 1,284 tons). 
Like other samples of Germanophile media, "Seara" is widely alleged to have been the recipient of special propaganda funds from the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. According to historian Lucian Boia, Germanophile newspapers had little room for maneuver, given their unpopular agenda: "of little interest, boycotted and with their offices once in a while assaulted by the 'indignant' public, could never have supported themselves without an infusion of German money." Similarly, researcher Carmen Patricia Reneti argues: ""Seara" would [never have been the paper most useful to German propaganda. [...] "Minerva" and "Seara" were read by just about no one." Claims of German payments focus on Bogdan-Pitești's shady political dealings, the target of controversy since 1915. Boia notes that the patron, who had no reason for refusing German bribes, may have been genuinely committed to the Germanophile cause, regardless of such additional benefits. Boia also claims that, keeping in with a Romanian tradition of the "baksheesh", the Francophile press may also have received funds from the Entente. Contrarily, historian Ion Bulei argues that "fraudulent wheeler-dealer" Bogdan-Pitești and his "money obsessed" patron were merely directing their support toward the highest bidder. According to various accounts, Bogdan-Pitești was diverting much of his own political payments into increasing his prestigious art collection or supporting his retinue.
In contrast to other Germanophile mouthpieces, "Seara" stated its support for the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary about the effects of nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, "Seara" was taking a stand against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, "Seara" reported, was wrongly accused of a bomb attack on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.
During June, "Seara" also circulated a rumor about secret talks between King Carol I and Nicholas II of the Russian Empire, in Constanța. "Seara" claimed that the two royals had agreed to oversee a shift of power, forcing a union between the Serbian and Montenegrin kingdoms against the Central Powers' express wishes. Shortly after the Sarajevo Assassination, which offeered the Central Powers a "casus belli", "Seara" circulated rumors about the contradictions between Austrians and Hungarian subjects of the double monarchy. It alleged that, instead of mourning, the Hungarian colony of Ploiești had organized "a very merry celebration" at the consulate.
In the weeks and months following the assassination, Arghezi's articles blamed the push toward war on Serbian nationalism and the Balkans question at large: "Until such time as when Europe shall incorporate and enslave the Balkans, they will endure as the nest where all of Europe's assassinations are being organized"; "the Serbs have staged an attempt on Austria[-Hungary]'s existence, in dastardly manner." Arghezi had set his mind on continued neutrality, arguing that it could turn Romania into an arbiter and broker of peace. A similar position was held by Karnabatt.
In autumn 1914, "Seara" and "Minerva" were both purchased by a German consortium, although Bogdan-Pitești was probably still the former's (uncredited) manager. The two papers were brought under a single umbrella, the publishing house "Tiparul". Its board of directors included Bogdan-Pitești, publicist Josef B. Brociner, banker Roselius, and investor Josef Hennenvogel. The acquisition, which reputedly followed an increase in German propaganda and espionage all over Romania, was described as scandalous by "Acțiunea", an Ententist newspaper owned by Take Ionescu. In a September 24 piece called "La mezat" ("On Public Sale"), it claimed that "Minerva" cost the Germans 3 million lei, and "Seara" only 400,000 lei. This allegation was confirmed during later inquiries. 
One account has it that the Germans paid Bogdan-Pitești the cost of paper and printing, which had been hitherto provided, for free, by Cantacuzino. Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, "Cronica", launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, "Libertatea" ("Freedom"), presided upon, for a short while, by N. Fleva. According to one account, Fleva had earlier been approached to take over as "Seara" manager by German envoys Brociner and Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, but, realizing the implications, had refused.
Conservatives and socialists.
Cantacuzino ended his period of reflection in January 1915, when he openly supported Alexandru Marghiloman in creating a pro-German subgroup within the Conservative Party. Jeopardizing their standing in the party, both men cited irregularities in the Conservative caucus.
With many of its articles, "Seara" popularized Marghiloman's views on conservatism and geopolitics. Conservative in outlook, the Russophobic and anti-Slavic Karnabatt outlined his political vision in some detail, discussing the Entente's imminent "bankruptcy". Ilie Bărbulescu, a Slavist and Marghiloman Conservative who advocated pro-German neutralism, also published articles in "Seara" during 1915. Beyond this conservative core, "Seara" colored its pages in various shades of left-wing advocacies, from socialism and social democracy to anarchism. According to literary historian Paul Cernat, the ideological ambiguity and conjectural alliances between socialists and conservatives was motivated by a common enemy, the pro-Entente and "plutocratic" National Liberal Party.
The independent socialist Felix Aderca, later known as a novelist, expanded on his earlier theoretical articles for "Noua Revistă Română", depicting the German Empire as the "progressive" actor in the war. Through the voice of another contributor, the old anarchist scholar Zamfir Arbore, "Seara" was focusing its criticism on Russia's Tsarist autocracy, against whom Arbore had been fighting for decades. Similar ideals inspired Alexis Nour, who arrived to "Seara" from the home-grown leftist current, Poporanism. Bogdan-Pitești wrote with noted passion about his socialist allies, using the pseudonym "Al. Dodan". On October 6, 1914, Dodan saluted the Romanian Social Democratic Party for organizing internationalist peace rallies, as "emerging from the mind and soul of the entire Romanian people". According to legend, the "Seara" patron privately declared himself a Catholic anarchist, and was rather hostile to communism.
Avram Steuerman-Rodion, a socialist based in Iași, contributed a special series of articles documenting the growth of Germanophila in that city, and throughout Moldavia region. Titled "Scrisori din Iași" ("Letters from Iași"), it notably chronicled the conflicts between the enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their more skeptical University of Iași colleagues. "Seara" also enlisted contributions from physician Ottoi Călin, a member of the PSDR Executive Committee and author of its Zimmerwald pacifist manifesto. Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, but, as a practicing physician, held "Seara"s advice column.
Bessarabia vs. Transylvania.
The national dilemma confronting Romanians during the neutrality period was not just a choice of sides, but also one of irredenta: while the National Liberal overtures toward the Entente were supposed to grant Romania Transylvania and some other Romanian-inhabited regions of Austria-Hungary, the Conservatives wished to recover Bessarabia, occupied by the Russian Empire—in 1916, the two options seemed mutually exclusive. "Seara" and "Minerva" followed the principles of Marghiloman, who had reached the conclusion that the Entente did not in fact support the disestablishment of Austria-Hungary, and who postulated that Russification in Bessarabia was more serious than Magyarization in Transylvania. Ilie Bărbulescu's "Seara" articles, deemed "erudite and indigestible" by Boia, focused on the supposed indestructibility of Austria-Hungary, and consoled Transylvanian Romanians with the option of greater devolution ("see United States of Greater Austria"). Writer Ion Gorun, who hailed from an anti-Hungarian community but was also a Habsburg loyalist, was a distinct presence at "Seara". His articles favored the term "Austria" instead of "Austria-Hungary", and claimed that Romania could only find "triumph" as an Austrian ally. Gorun spoke of any alliance with Russia as dangerous and absurd; the implication of such a move, he argued, caught Transylvanian Romanians in a pincer and also meant Romania's subjugation to the Russian Empire.
The cause of Bessarabia was championed by Arbore, who at the time rejected all notion that the region could ever witness a Russian devolution, and expressed distress that Romanian intellectuals were more interested in the fate of France than in the freedoms of Bessarabian Romanians. Bogdan-Pitești's various articles also show his interest in the Bessarabian cause. Expressing regret that "most civilized" France stood by the world's "most savage, most ignorant and bloodiest oligarchy", "the Russia of pogroms and assassinations", he deemed Romania's overtures toward the Tsarist regime a "national crime". Additionally, "Dodan" suggested that Austria-Hungary was preferable as a friend, as Romania's only guarantee against the "Slavic deluge". Later, he argued that the cause of Transylvania was settled by, and within, Austria-Hungary. He mapped out an alternative strategy: neutral until the end of the war, Romania would eventually march its troops into Bessarabia, with Austrian acquiescence. In October 1915, Aderca added his voice to the Bessarabian chorus. He postulated that the Transylvanian cause was doomed, and, since the Germans were poised to win the war, constituted "a union of the losers"; instead, he urged Romania to take Bessarabia as the spoils of war. Karnabatt's own articles began by stating a minimalist objective in "the reincorporation of Bessarabia". Later, he advocated the extension of Romanian territory eastward, into Transnistria and down to the Dnieper River (as counterbalance to a foreseeable Greater Bulgaria).
An unusually vast and, according to Boia, naïve project was sketched by the Bessarabian-born Nour, who claimed that, even if granted a military victory, Austria-Hungary would still crumble into "developed nations". Nour was confident that, with the return of peace, Romania would still have an option to annex its Austrian irredenta: Transylvania, Bukovina, the Banat, Crișana and Maramureș. He speculated that a late entry into the war could also bring Romania possession of Bessarabia, large swathes of the Ukraine, and Odessa harbor; and even that, once victorious against the Entente, the Central Powers would award her an extra-European colonial empire.
Disestablishment and legacy.
On separate occasions in 1916, Bogdan-Pitești and Karnabatt toured the German Empire. Bogdan-Pitești was the first to travel there, together with his concubine Domnica and his favorite Mateiu Caragiale. During his own journey, Karnabatt described Germany as unified by civic order and the determination to win, in several letters that were published by "Seara" in June 1916. The newspaper's wrong bet on a German victory on the Western Front was strained by Alexis Nour who, in April 1916, wrote that a French capitulation would inevitably follow the Battle of Verdun. 
"Seara" disappeared, together with "Minerva", "Libertatea", "Steagul" and most other Germanophile papers, in late summer 1916, shortly after Romania declared war on the Central Powers. When the German and Austrian troops invaded southern Romania, forcing the Ententist government to flee for Iași, some of "Seara"s former staff remained in Bucharest and chose the path of collaborationism. This was notably pursued by Arghezi, Galaction, Bărbulescu and Karnabatt, all of whom wrote for the propaganda tribune "Gazeta Bucureștilor". According to popular rumors, Bogdan-Pitești fell out of favor with the occupiers, who eventually discovered that he had been squandering their grants.
In contrast, several former "Seara" contributors silenced their criticism of the Entente throughout the rest of the war. Nicolae Petrescu Găină made some contributions to the Entente's propaganda effort during the second half of 1916. He was captured by the Germans in Bucharest, allegedly after being turned over to them by Bogdan-Pitești. Avram Steuerman-Rodion was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces as a medic, earning distinction, but returned to Germanophile journalism after Romania sealed the separate peace of 1918; the victim of clinical depression, he committed suicide in autumn. An Order of the Star of Romania for his work as a military physician, Călin died of typhus in early 1917. Aderca too saw action on the front, and preserved his socialist-inspired neutralism—it later surfaced in his various fiction writings.
After the November 1918 Armistice with Germany changed Romania's fortunes, leading to the creation of Greater Romania, several former "Seara" journalists were prosecuted for treason. In March 1919, a military tribunal sentenced Karnabatt to ten, Arghezi to five years imprisonment. They were however pardoned by King Ferdinand I, in winter 1920. Bogdan-Pitești had joined them in prison: according to some accounts, he was also held for collaborationism, while others record, in more detail, that he was serving an earlier sentence for fraud. A while after, some of "Seara"s former contributors were retelling their encounters with Bogdan-Pitești and his brand of journalism by the means of autofiction. The "Seara" affair is notably retold in novels by Lucrezzia Karnabatt ("Demoniaca", 1922) and Ion Vinea ("May Venom", 1971). 
Arghezi's texts for "Seara" were largely unknown to later generations. They again saw print in 2003, in a critical edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, "Seara"s popularization of the expression "craii de Curtea-Veche" may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.

Kastellbakken

Kastellbakken, later renamed Husebybakken, is an abandoned ski jumping hill located at Ullern in Oslo, Norway. It was the venue of Husebyrennet, Norway's and the world's most prestigious Nordic skiing tournament between 1879 and 1891. With a K-point of 20 meters, two world records were set in the hill, at 20 and 22 meters.
History.
The hill originally hosted Husebyrennet ("The Huseby Race"), between 1879 and 1891, except for 1880 and 1882, when the event was held in Akershus. From 1892, the tournament moved to Holmenkollbakken and was renamed the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Two world records were set in the hill, both by Norwegians: 20 meters by Olaf Haugann in 1879 and 22 meters set by Sveinung Svalastoga in 1881.

Doe v. 2themart.com Inc.

Doe v. 2themart.com Inc. 140 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (2001), was a federal case decided by United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, on the issue of an individual's First Amendment right to speak anonymously on the Internet and a private party's right to disclose the identity of the anonymous Internet user by enforcing a civil subpoena. The court held that 2TheMart.com (TMRT) failed to show that the identities of these anonymous Internet users were directly and materially relevant to the core defense in the litigation, and thus the subpoena should not be issued. Therefore, Doe's motion to quash the subpoena was granted.
History.
In a previous case, the shareholders of 2TheMart.com (TMRT) brought a class action against the company, alleging fraud on the market. To establish a defense that the defendant did not cause any injury to the plaintiff, TMRT issued a subpoena to a local internet service provider, Silicon Investor/InfoSpace, Inc. (InfoSpace), on which TMRT has an Internet bulletin board, seeking to obtain the identities of twenty-three users who have posted on the TMRT bulletin board unfavorable messages about the company. InfoSpace Informed these users of receipt of the subpoena. One of the users moved to quash the subpoena under a pseudonym John Doe (Doe), alleging that enforcement of the subpoena would violate his or her First Amendment right to speak anonymously. This motion to quash is the subject of the present case.
This motion to quash raised an important issue on the First Amendment right of an Internet user, that is, whether and on what basis can a private party seek to discover the identity of anonymous Internet users through the enforcement of a civil subpoena?
District Court ruling.
Doe's motion to quash the subpoena was granted. In other words, the court supported Doe's contention that TMRT has no right to discover the identity of the anonymous users on the InfoSpace website.
Although the court did not find suitable federal court authority on the issue of a third-party seeking through a civil subpoena to reveal the identities of anonymous Internet users, the court maintained that the anonymity of Internet speech is protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, when requesting to identify anonymous users, the litigants are required to show that the need for the users' identification information outweighs the users' First Amendment rights.
In the case that the anonymous Internet user whose identity is being subpoenaed is also the defendant of the underlying litigation, the plaintiff is required to show that they are bringing the lawsuit in good faith, as well as the compelling need for the discovery of the identifying information. See also the previous cases "Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com" 185 F.R.D. 573 and "In re Subpoena Duces Tecum to America Online, Inc." 2000 WL 1210372(Va. Cir. Ct. 2000)
Since in this case the anonymous user is not the defendant, but is instead a non-party witness in the underlying litigation, the court chose to set a higher standard for disclosing the identity of the anonymous non-party. In particular, the court considered the following four factors to decide whether the subpoena should be issued:
After analyzing and weighing these four factors, the court held that TMRT failed to show that the identities of these anonymous Internet users were directly and materially relevant to the core defense in the litigation, and thus the subpoena should not be issued. Therefore, Doe's motion to quash the subpoena was granted.
Tests.
To solve the issue whether a civil subpoena can be issued to discover the identities of Internet anonymous users, several states courts have set forth different tests, each attempting to balance the First Amendment right of the users to speak anonymously and the plaintiff's right to remedy wrongful behavior on the Internet.

Comics journalism

Comics journalism, or Graphic journalism, is a form of journalism that covers news or non-fiction events using the framework of comics – a combination of words and drawn images. Although visual narrative storytelling has existed for thousands of years, the use of the comics medium to cover real-life events for news organizations, publications or publishers (in graphic novel format) is currently at an all-time peak. Historically, pictorial representation (typically engravings) of news events were commonly used before the proliferation of photography in publications such as "The Illustrated London News" and "Harper's Magazine".
More recent writers/journalists and illustrators have attempted to increase validity of the genre by bringing journalism to the field in more direct ways. This includes coverage of foreign and local affairs where word balloons are actual quotes and sources are actual people featured in each story. Many of these works are featured online and in collaboration with established publications as well as small press.
Joe Sacco is widely considered to be one of the pioneers of the form, along with some groups of authors that produced the first known magazines focused specifically on Comics Journalism. Among these publications is worth to mention Mamma!, a magazine of Comics Journalism printed in Italy since 2009 and produced by a group of authors, and Symbolia, a digital magazine of comics journalism for tablets.

Francis Knollys (admiral)

Sir Francis Knollys (c. 1552 – 1648) was an English privateer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1575 and 1648.
Knollys was the son of Sir Francis Knollys, of Greys Court in Oxfordshire, and of Reading, in Berkshire, and his wife, Catherine Carey and was generally known as Francis Knollys the younger. He attended Magdalen College, Oxford in and around 1564. He was a student of Gray's Inn in 1565.
In December 1575 Knollys was elected Member of Parliament for Oxford following the death of Edward Knollys, and held the seat unit 1589. In those early years he was involved in piracy with Sir Francis Drake, serving as a rear-admiral on privateering activities in the Caribbean, returning in 1586 with considerable booty. He soon after served with his brother-in-law, the Earl of Leicester, in the Netherlands campaign and was knighted by him at Flushing on 7 December 1587.
Knollys was once again elected MP in 1597, this time for Berkshire. He was awarded MA at Oxford on 10 July 1598. In 1604 he was re-elected MP for Berkshire and sat until 1611. He was elected MP for Berkshire again in 1625. In April 1640, Knollys was re-elected MP for Reading in the Short Parliament with his son, and was re-elected for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He sat until his death in 1648.
Knollys died before May 1648 at the age of about 90, described by his colleagues as "the ancientest Parliament man in England". He was one of the oldest ever members of parliament and has the record for the longest span of service as an MP, 73 years between first being elected and his death. He was buried at St Lawrence church, Reading. He had married in 1588 Lettice Barrett, daughter of John Barrett, of Hanham in Gloucestershire. Knollys had three sons and six daughters, amongst them, Francis, Robert and Lettice who married the parliamentarian, John Hampden.

Melanotaenia duboulayi

The crimson-spotted rainbowfish ("Melanotaenia duboulayi"), known less commonly as the Duboulay's rainbowfish, is a species of freshwater rainbowfish endemic to eastern Australia. "M. duboulayi" has also been kept in aquariums since the early 20th century, and is the original Australian rainbowfish.
Taxonomy.
"Melanotaenia duboulayi" was initially collected by Duboulay (du Boulay) in the 1870s from the Richmond River in northern New South Wales. It was scientifically described as "Atherinichthys duboulayi" by Castelnau in 1878. This study separated "M. splendida fluviatilis" into two species, "M. duboulayi" from the eastern coastal drainage systems of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and "M. fluviatilis" from the inland Murray-Darling basin system west of the Great Dividing Range.
Description.
Males reach maximum lengths of , but are usually less than , while the females are usually smaller. They have a slender and compressed body shape. Crimson-spotted rainbowfish have two dorsal fins very close together, with the first much smaller than the second. Their fin colours vary from clear to yellowish to red, with red flecks and dark margins which become intensely black in males during spawning activities. Larger males are distinguished from females by their brighter colours and can be identified from the elongation of posterior rays in the second dorsal and anal fins. Females have rounded dorsal and anal fins, which are smaller and lack the dark edges. A prominent spot of crimson red is seen on the operculum. Generally, the body is silvery-blue or green ranging through deep bluish or yellow tones. The scale rows are marked with narrow yellow lines and overlaid with orange to brilliant red. They exhibit considerable colour variations over a wide geographical range.
Behaviour.
"M.duboulayi" is omnivorous. Their diet comprises all kinds of foods, especially invertebrates and algae, and in captivity they eat flake food. They like open water and may form small groups around submerged logs and subsurface vegetation.
Spawning occurs prior to summer rains, and eggs adhere to filamentous subsurface vegetation and floating plant roots.
Domestication.
Crimson-spotted rainbowfish were favorably described by Castelnau in his initial description: "...He says the colours during life were most beautiful; that a broad stripe of magnificent blue ran along the sides, and two transverse bands of rich scarlet extended on the upper part of the fish towards the middle of the body."
Amandus Rudel introduced the species to international aquarium hobbyists when he sent specimens to Germany in 1927, and it went from there to North America. In 1930, it was found as an escapee in the Mississippi River.
Crimson-spotted rainbowfish are still very popular with aquarists internationally. Australian breeders place greater emphasis of preserving the local variants. In their native range, they are also released into Australian dams to control mosquitoes using local wild stock to prevent endemic variants of "M.duboulayi" from being lost by genetic contamination from non-local forms.

Bubu music

Bubu music is traditional music played by the Temne people in Sierra Leone. The music was originally used in witchcraft ceremonies, but later it turned into a popular religious processional style played during Ramadan. In its folk form, the music is played by blowing on bamboo cane flutes and on metal pipes -often repurposed auto parts.
During the Sierra Leone Civil War, Ahmed Janka Nabay became the first musician to record Bubu music. He modernized the sound by adding electric studio instrumentation. With songs like "Sabanoh" (We Own Here), Nabay asserted what he established as the underlying message of Bubu—peace, good governance and the empowerment of women or "ponchus". According to an NPR interview aired on August 22, 2012, Nabay's music became popular across the war-torn nation in the 1990s, particularly among young rebels trying to overthrow the government, which forced Nabay to flee the country.
In 2010, Nabay released the first-ever international Bubu record, "BUBU KING" on True Panther Records in New York City. He subsequently formed the first-ever international Bubu band, Janka Nabay and the Bubu Shnamu, from local musicians in Brooklyn.

Hangman Jury (band)

Hangman Jury is an American rock band formed by singer and songwriter Garrett Moore in 2006. The band is noted for its '90s rock style, sound, and straight-cut lyrics.
Since forming in 2006, Hangman Jury has played with acts such as Mötley Crüe, Theory of a Deadman, Rev Theory, Godsmack, Cavo, KC and the Sunshine Band, STEMM, Neurotica, and countless other bands. 
They are managed by, Brian Johnson from AC/DC's wife, Brenda Johnson and have gained recognition by people such as Harvey Leeds (Live Nation, ex-Sony Records Vice President), Scotti Hill (Skid Row), Robin Zander (Cheap Trick), "Creative Loafing", "The Herald Tribune", "Metal Examiner", and haves gotten rave reviews at every performance. Hangman Jury is also noted for having a groovy rock n' roll sound and chaotic stage shows.
Hangman says their influences come from band such as Rage Against the Machine, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Silvertide, Buckcherry, AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and Queen. 
"Hanging out next was Hangman Jury. I kept hearing about this band from all the high schoolers, they were even voted in by their high school. And you know what? They deserved it. High energy from start to finish. The vocalist, who looks like Jim Morrison with a Carrot Top wig, was one of the most energetic front men I've seen in years. Running around on stage, jumping into the crowd with a tambourine. What got me the most, the singer even used a bullhorn in one or two of their songs. Killer sound, killer performance."- "Metal Examiner"
History.
Origins.
In August 2006, Five 12-year-old school friends began a band they called Bad Sara. Two years in, avid AC/DC fans Moore and James Hyde approached Sarasota resident Brenda Johnson (wife of AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson), who invited them home to meet visiting nephews. Following a jam session that also included Skid Row axe-man Scotti Hill, Brian Johnson booked them into downtown's (former) Irish Rover Pub for a wildly successful, large-scale event. Shortly thereafter, Brenda assumed management and the band became Hangman Jury (after the Aerosmith song, I know pretty lame), a name it felt more befitting a national-level act. Subsequently, HJ begged for a slot at Mötley Crüe's "Crüe Fest 2" in August 2009, and got it $5,000 later. This year, it added rhythm guitarist McAllister and is growing into its larger-than-life experiences and music, coined "like a 'new rock' band with classic rock influences." Finally releasing two of 100 songs onto the "Trick to Murder" EP (see below), HJ—now driving age—hopes to spread its sound farther afield.
"We pretty much wanna be The Beatles of our generation, or Elvis, or Jesus, or something," Garrett says. "Well, we'd rather be The Rolling Stones than The Beatles, because the Rolling Stones are a little bit cooler than The Beatles. I'd prefer that." 
Music.
Along with a total of around 100 songs, Hangman Jury has released two singles to the internet for public view, to date: All My friends, and Trick to Murder.
In 2009, before performing at a festival including other local rock bands, Moore told the "Herald Tribune", "The local music scene sucks," said Moore, whose band performed at Crüe Fest in August at Tampa's Ford Amphitheatre. "Pretty much it's all hardcore metal bands, a bunch of people getting on that boat because it's popular here. Local bands need to be original and not try to copy anybody else.

Aarabia

Aarabia is a genus of extinct vascular plants found in central Morocco in outcrops of Early Devonian age (Emsian, around ). The leafless plant has a complex branching system with a main stem and at least three orders of side branches. In addition to these long branches, stems bore very short branches, which typically branched once into two curved sections. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne singly on reduced lateral branches in groups of at least three. The genus is thought to be related to the euphyllophytes – modern ferns and seed plants.
Description.
Fossils were found in an outcrop believed to be of Emsian age (around ) northwest of the town of Azrou in central Morocco. They were 'adpressions' – a mixture of compressed and chemically altered remains of the original plant and impressions of its shape. Only central parts of the plant were found, the longest being 9 cm.
Stems (axes) were bare of leaves, spines or other protrusions, and were between 1.5 and 5 mm in diameter. Branching was 'pseudomonopodial', i.e. resulted in a 'main' stem and a lateral branch. There were up to four orders of branching; the branches were borne in two rows on opposite sides of the stem, producing a relatively two-dimensional structure. All orders of branches appear to have borne distinctive short branches which typically divided only once, the final sections having tips which curved away from each other and back towards the stem which bore them. Meyer-Berthaud and Gerrienne were unable to decide whether these short branches were generally capable of further growth or had ceased to grow and were adapted for some particular function.
Only poorly preserved specimens had sporangia. Up to three sporangia were found on a "reduced lateral branch system". Individual sporangia were 1.8 to 4 mm long and 1 to 1.4 mm wide and probably hung downwards. No spores were found inside the sporangia, but large spores with an average diameter of 270 µm were found close to sporangia and may have been released from them. If so, "Aarabia" had megaspores and could be the earliest known plant with 'heterospory', i.e. two distinct sizes of spore.
Taxonomy.
"Aarabia brevicaulis" was named by Meyer-Berthaud and Gerrienne in 2001. The generic name is derived from the locality close to Jbel ben Aarab, near Azrou in Central Morocco. The specific epithet was chosen to reflect the short lateral branches.
Phylogeny.
"Aarabia" shares features with basal euphyllophytes (Banks' trimerophytes). Two of these are dichotomous branching, which results in a clear difference between a 'main' stem and a lateral stem, and elongated sporangia, taller than wide, borne at the ends of fertile branch systems which are differentiated from other branches. Like some "Psilophyton" species, "Aarabia" had short side branches in which the last sections curved back on themselves. On the other hand, "Aarabia" had relatively few sporangia in each fertile branching unit and they were single, not paired, whereas most trimerophytes had large clusters of sporangia carried in pairs which were often twisted around one another.
Meyer-Berthaud and Gerrienne added "Aarabia" to the data set which had been used by Kenrick and Crane in their analysis of the phylogeny of the polysporangiophytes, and generated a new phylogenetic tree. This placed "Aarabia" as the sister to the euphyllophytes. However, the analysis was regarded as "tentative", with 16 out of 33 chararacters which were used in constructing the tree being unknown. The diagram below is based on their results and the summary cladogram published by Crane et al.

USS SC-4

USS "SC-4, during her service life known as Submarine Chaser No. 4 or S.C. 4", was an "SC-1"-class submarine chaser built for the United States Navy during World War I. 
"SC-4" was a wooden-hulled 110-foot (34 m) submarine chaser built at Naval Station New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was commissioned on 19 February 1918 as USS "Submarine Chaser No. 4", abbreviated at the time as USS "S.C. 4".
During World War I, "S.C. 4" served in the Special Hunting Squadron, Group, on antisubmarine patrol duty against German submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, and was based at Key West, Florida.
On 19 March 1920, the Navy sold "S.C. 4" to David A. Clarkson of Nassau in the Bahamas.
The U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920. Although "Submarine Chaser No. 4" had already been sold by then, since that date she has been referred to retrospectively as USS "SC-4" - the shortened name she would have received under the new system had she still been in Navy service at that time.

MinKwon Center for Community Action

The MinKwon Center for Community Action is a nonprofit organization that serves the needs of the Korean American community in New York City. First established as YKASEC in 1984, the MinKwon Center is based in Flushing, Queens, which has a large Korean population. MinKwon focuses in particular on reaching marginalized community members, such as the elderly, recent immigrants, low-income residents, and residents with limited English proficiency. 
The MinKwon Center educates and provides services to its members through its primary program areas, which are community organizing and advocacy, social services, civic participation, youth empowerment and cultural education. These services are provided with the goal of increasing civic participation through community organizing to advocate to improve immigrants' rights and quality of life. Because some members of the community it serves are undocumented, the MinKwon Center mobilizes the Korean American community to organize on the issue of immigration reform at the national level as well through efforts such as busing people to the Rally for Immigration Reform and canvassing for the 2010 census. 
The name MinKwon comes from the Korean word for civil rights, 민권.
Community Advocacy.
In 2009, the MinKwon Center helped to form the 12% and Growing Coalition, which includes more than 40 Asian Pacific American community organizations. The Asian Pacific American community living in New York City comprises 12% of the population, yet receives less than 1% of government funding. The first-ever coalition comprising organizations that serve diverse ethnic groups among Asian Pacific Americans, the 12% and Growing Coalition advocates that the New York State and City governments pass fair budgets that protect vulnerable Asian Pacific Americans in New York.
Supporters and Recognition.
The MinKwon Center receives funding and support from individual donors, government, foundations and corporate sponsors including the Asian American Federation of New York, the Capital One Foundation, the New York Foundation, the New York State Division of Housing & Community Renewal, NYC Department of Youth and Community Development, Robin Hood Foundation, and Verizon Foundation.
The MinKwon Center is a recipient of a 2010 Union Square Award, an initiative of the Tides Center, which recognizes grassroots organizations serving neighborhoods in New York City.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credibility Corp

Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp is a private company headquartered in Malibu, California, USA that provides credit and credibility solutions for businesses throughout the U.S. and Canada. The company was formed in July 2010 when it acquired the North American Credit-on-Self division, also known as the Self Awareness Solutions (SAS) operating unit, of Dun & Bradstreet after raising approximately $200M from Great Hill Partners. Internet entrepreneur Jeff Stibel is the Chairman and CEO.
History.
In 2010, Dun and Bradstreet, formed in 1841, spun off assets that merged with newly created Credibility Solutions to form Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp, an independent company focused on credit and credibility for small businesses. The company has grown from 8 employees to over 600 since becoming an independent entity in 2010. Dun & Bradstreet said Dun & Bradstreet Credibility is a 'separate legal entity' that pays D&B royalties for certain intellectual-property rights. These include "a perpetual license to use the D&B brand".
On February 21, 2014, D&B Credibility Corp filed suit in New York State Supreme Court over the contentious relationship that exists between them and D&B. D&B Credibility Corp alleges that D&B is sabotaging the relationship because they are not happy with what D&B Credibility is doing with the D&B trademark, believe the royalties to be too low, and were upset by an unsolicited offer for D&B Credibility Corp to acquire D&B. The private offer was rejected without presenting it to shareholders. The case is Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp. v. Dun & Bradstreet Inc., 650568/2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County.
Products and Services.
Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp products and services include the DUNSFile, which establishes a business’s DUNS number, the CreditBuilder, which helps businesses monitor and build their credit, giving them full access to the D&B scores and reports, and adding credit references, the CreditAdvisor, which allows the businesses to see other company’s reports and receiving email alerts when competitors’ credit changes, Credibility Review, which allows businesses to control what others see about them and CreditSignal, a free product offering which provides companies with alerts, informing them of changes in their D&B credit scores and ratings.
Failure wall.
The company maintains a "failure wall" to acknowledge and learn from company and employee mistakes and failures. The failure wall first came about when Stibel had the idea to create a wall on which employees, himself included, would be able to write out a failure they had experienced.
Controversy.
The company had received some complaints from small businesses for their high pressure sales tactics including three businesses who raised questions about where the company was unfairly preying on their anxieties.
Attempted acquisition of Dun and Bradstreet.
In 2013, Dun and Bradstreet Credibility Corporation and “two of the world’s largest private equity firms” proposed to acquire Dun and Bradstreet Inc. for a price ranging from $115 to $125 a share. Dun and Bradstreet Inc. rejected the offer, and the parties are now in litigation in New York.
Notable Employees.
Notable Dun & Bradstreet employees include four U.S Presidents. Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley worked as credit reporters for the Mercantile Agency, a company that later became D&B. Note that these employees were never part of D&B Credibility Corporation, nor worked in the credit-on-self division of D&B, which didn't exist until the 1990s.

Euphebius

Saint Euphebius ("Ephebus, Euphemus, Efrimus") is venerated as a patron saint and bishop of Naples. Ferdinando Ughelli writes that the date of Euphebius' episcopate cannot be determined with certainty. There is no biography of Euphebius’ life. Paulus Regius and Baronius theorized that Euphebius died in 713 AD, but Joannes Diaconus considers Euphebius the eighth bishop of Naples, succeeding St. Eustasius (Eustathius), which would have his episcopate occur sometime in the 2nd century.

Hybrid Air Vehicles

Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd. is the designer and manufacturer of air vehicles known as hybrid airships. These vehicles, such as the prototype HAV-3, utilize both aerodynamics and lighter-than-air (LTA) technology to generate lift, potentially allowing the vehicle to stay aloft for several weeks.
The company, based in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, England, partnered with Northrop Grumman (NGC) in 2009 to win a US$500 million U.S.Army Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) contract which was delivered between 2009 and early 2013. The contract has since been cancelled as a result of US budget cuts. It used the HAV 304 platform, with NGC acting as the prime contractor and sensor system integrator and Hybrid Air Vehicles the lead for the design, development and manufacture of the aircraft platform. 
After the US project was cancelled the LEMV project, the HAV envelope and associated materials was then bought back by the company.
The company uses its different designs for multiple market opportunities, using its bi-hull configured design for long endurance surveillance & reconnaissance aircraft, its tri-hull configured design for heavy lift transportation and its more traditional airship configured designs for high altitude solutions. The HAV designs are often referred to as LTA Airships.
In 2014, the LEMV under the name "Airlander" was unveiled in Cardington following partial reassembly and inflation. It was reported as the world's largest aircraft.
The company has plans for a 50 tonne version of the design - Airlander 50 - which could with funding be built in 2016.

Mike Curtis (writer)

Mike Curtis is an American writer who scripts the Dick Tracy comic strip with Joe Staton as artist. He has been working professionally in comic books as a writer since the mid-1980s. He has also been a newspaper editor, deputy sheriff, comic book publisher, movie theater manager, TV horror movie host, Santa Claus for 39 years in the family tradition and is a Baptist minister.
Curtis is currently best known for Dick Tracy, but he is also the third largest collector of Superman memorabilia in the United States. He has been exhibiting and writing about Superman since 1973. In the 1970s he was a horror movie TV Host on Channel 6 in Jackson, Tennessee, as "Count Basil" on "Shock Theater". He brought back the character in 2010 as horror host guest at the "SIVADS OF MARCH" event in Memphis, Tennessee honoring that city's horror host.
In the 1980s, Curtis entered the comic book field by writing Richie Rich, Casper The Friendly Ghost and New Kids on the Block for Harvey Comics. While there, he also designed the Harvey Enchanted Forest map (based on Irish Bayou in Louisiana) and scripted several pilots for Casper TV series and specials.
In the 1990s, Curtis teamed up with artist Mike Sagara to produce his own comic, "Shanda the Panda", an anthropomorphic or "furry" comic about a theater manager.  With the first comic published by MU Press, the title moved to Antarctic Press for the second issue. There it ran for 14 issues, while Curtis' wife Carole produced a Native American cat adventure comic called "Katmandu" with artist Terrie Smith.
Later the Curtises took their titles to Vision Comics, while also beginning their own imprint, Shanda Fantasy Arts. Eventually. both flagship titles were reclaimed under the SFA Banner. SFA has published dozens of comic series and specials, including Extinctioners, Albedo and the non-furry "LAST KISS". Curtis has also written a short story and novella dealing with the adventures of George Reeves as Superman.
Curtis and Staton were selected by Tribune Media Services to continue the Dick Tracy comic strip, now in its 80th year as of January 2011. They are only the fifth team to ever do so. Shelley Pleger, inker, who has worked as an artist for Disney, and Shane Fisher, Sunday colorist and an extremely talented graduate of the Joe Kubert School of Cartooning, round out the team.
"Shanda" and "Katmandu" are still being published by the Curtises, but both series will end in 2012. They expect to publish an occasional comic or comic story, but the main focus is now on Dick Tracy.
When not at conventions, the Curtises live on a farm in Greenbrier, Arkansas. Mrs. Curtis makes jewelry, does costume work and is active in the local Society for Creative Anachronism. Curtis is now working on several novels and other projects with various projected print dates, including an alternate history novel with friend Richard Thatcher.
On May 2, 2011, the Tennessee Senate passed Resolution 30, congratulating Curtis and Staton on their professional accomplishments.
Staton and Curtis just had their first eBook collection, "CALLING DICK TRACY", published by Rabbit Hole Graphics. 
Staton and Curtis are the 2013 winners of the Harvey Award for Best Syndicated Strip for "Dick Tracy".

Henri Copponex

Henri Copponex (born 25 September 1907, in Geneva), is a naval architect, a Swiss regatta competitor and an Olympic bronze medal winner for yacht racing in Rome in 1960.
Biography.
As a teenager, he was already designing models and testing them on water. Having become a civil engineer (with a degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich), he was also to become an emeritus naval architect and helmsman.
At the request of the Geneva Society for the Promotion of Yachting, Copponex designed the "Moucheron" in 1934, then the "Lacustre" in 1938. He also produced plans for Swedish 30 m2, 15 m2 SNS (Swiss National Series), and about thirty 5.5 m IR (International Rule), including the famous "Ylliam X", "Tam-Tam" and "Ballerina IV" and "V".
Following the success of the "Lacustre", he designed the "Espadon", which was to be, in his view, a more successful version of the "Lacustre". In 1951, he again caused surprise by designing a catamaran. But Copponex was interested not only in racing boats. He also designed dinghies for life-saving societies, including those of Nyon, Saint-Prex, Morges and Le Bouveret. In 1969 Copponex designed his last boat, the "Paladin".
During his sporting career he won about twelve national titles in 6 m IR, in 15 m2 SNS and in "Lacustre". He took part in numerous international regattas: in 1928 at Cannes on a 6 m IR; at Genoa, where he won victory after victory in the 5.5 m IR series in 1952, 1958 and 1960. He represented Switzerland at the 1948 Olympic Games in Torquay (7th place in 6 m IR); then in 1952 at the Helsinki Olympic Games (10th place in 5.5 m IR). And it was at the Rome Olympic Games (Naples) in 1960 with the 5.5 m IR "Ballerina IV" that Henri Copponex, Manfred Metzger, the yacht’s owner, and Pierre Girard won a bronze medal. It was exceptional that five of the sailing boats in the competition had been designed by Copponex.
With such a record, the “prince of the lake”, as one sport newspaper used to call him, became a legend in his lifetime. With his talent and strong personality, Copponex influenced Geneva yachting from the 1930s to 1970s. He was also liked for his human qualities, his simplicity and modesty.
His premature death in 1970 deprived sailing enthusiasts of a great sportsman and a talented naval architect. Every year the Société Nautique de Genève holds the Copponex Memorial, a regatta in tribute of the deceased great architect and sportsman.
Association of Archives Henri Copponex.
The "Association of Archives Henri Copponex" was constituted in 2006. It is headed up by Françoise Copponex, the daughter of Henri Copponex, and it also includes among the members of its committee: Pierre Girard, team member and a friend of Henri Copponex, vice-president, and Carinne Bertola, the curator of Lake Geneva museum. The association aims to support the conservation of Henri Copponex's work and organize various events to make it endure. In order to conserve the work of the naval architect, the Association of AHC has for the first project to digitize all existing plans (about 700 pieces).

Adoption of Ala'a Eddeen

The Adoption of Ala'a Eddeen is an adoption of a then 9-year-old Iraqi boy, who could not walk because he suffered from cerebral palsy, by American Capt. Scott Southworth while he was deployed during the Iraq War.
This case became a beginning of the growing campaign for bringing more disabled and orphaned Iraqi children to the United States.
In 2007, CNN profiled Scott and Ala’a’s story in its "Heroes: An All-Star Tribute". The story was chosen as one of 6 finalists.
Scott Southworth.
Before his deployment to Iraq Scott Southworth did not own a home, was unmarried, worked long hours, and "squeezed in his service as a national guardsman". Scott's family considered it to be an honor to serve in the military. He continued the tradition set up by the three generations of his predecessors: his great-great-great grandfather, his grandfather and his father. An evangelical Christian Scott finished law school, and planned to run for district attorney's office after coming home from Iraq.
Meeting and adoption.
Scott Southworth was deployed to Iraq in 2003. His deployment was to last 13 months. On September 6, 2003, half-way into his deployment Capt. Southworth with his unit visited an orphanage named for Mother Teresa. There were 20 children in the orphanage, all with physical disabilities. A few nuns cared for the children and also taught them to speak some English.
During their visit to the orphanage the soldiers played with the children. They wanted to make the kids feel better, but it was also their way to forget the horror they faced every day on the streets of Baghdad: twenty soldiers of this unit were wounded, and one was killed. It was then that Scott first saw Ala'a. The boy, who lived in the orphanage since he was 4 years old, could not walk, but he dragged himself to Scott's side. The boy's English was limited, but he kept saying the word "bomb". Scott tried to assure the boy he was safe now.
After the first visit to the orphanage soldiers kept coming back. The attachment between Southworth and Ala'a was growing. 31-year old Scott looked at Ala'a as a younger brother, but for the boy Scott was "Baba," that is "Daddy" in Arabic.
Southworth was informed by staff of the orphanage that within a year Ala'a would be transferred to a less hospitable institution prompting Scott to begin adoption proceedings.
Iraqi law prohibits the adoption of Iraqi children by foreigners, but after returning home, Southworth was able to secure a humanitarian visa for the boy. By that time Southworth had been elected district attorney, and his income became steady. Southworth is grateful for the individuals and organizations that helped him to bring Ala'a to United States: "We crossed political boundaries. We crossed religious boundaries. There was just a massive effort — all on behalf of this little boy who desperately needed people to actually take some action and not just feel sorry for him." Since Jan. 20, 2005 Ala'a and Scott have been living together. The boy's health has improved significantly, he's attending a school, enjoys math, likes reading, but weeps during thunderstorms that remind him of bombs.
When Southworth is asked why he chose Ala’a, he explains that it was Ala’a who chose him. "Ala'a really adopted me." - Scott says.
In 2007 CNN profiled Southworth and Ala’a’s story in its “Heroes: An All-Star Tribute”. The story was chosen as one of 18 finalists. The money collected from the show was used to pay medical and legal bills for Ala'a. The pair have been the focus of a variety of media, including an article in the VFW Magazine, a full episode on PBS, and a presentation at St. Norbert College.
Southworth asked Lt. Gov. Barbara Lawton for help in bringing other disabled and orphaned children to the US.
By 2009, 16-year old Ala'a had become a United States citizen.
Southworth says:
Being upset just isn't enough. Sympathy just isn't enough. These kids need action, and we're in a position where we know these children, we know what can happen here in the United States if they're brought here, and we're going to do something about it.

Tudiya

Tudiya or Tudia is the earliest Assyrian king named on the Assyrian King List, and the first of the "seventeen kings who lived in tents". According to Georges Roux he would have lived in the latter half of the 25th century BC, i.e. somewhere between 2450 BC and 2400 BC. The list says he was succeeded by Adamu.
In initial archaeological reports from Ebla, it appeared that Tudiya's existence was confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a "karum" in Eblaite territory, with "king" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the vizier of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question was not with king Tudiya of Asshur at all, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called "Abarsal".

Ushpia

Ushpia was an early Assyrian king who ruled circa 2030 BC, according to the "Assyrian King List" ("AKL"). Like most other of the "kings who lived in tents", his name is not regarded as Semitic, but more likely Hurrian. 
Ushpia is also alleged to have founded the temple of Ashur at the city of Assur, according to the much later inscriptions of Shalmaneser I (13th century BC) and Esarhaddon (8th century BC). However, he has yet to be confirmed by contemporary artifacts and nothing else of him is known.
He was succeeded on the "AKL" by Apiashal.

Nosson Nochum Englard

Rabbi Nosson Nochum Englard of Radzin-Yerushalayim was born in Brooklyn, NY, to Rav Yeshayahu Englard, eldest son of Grand Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor Englard of Radzin. His mother is a daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Tewel, a prominent Rav and Rosh Yeshiva in Poland and in the USA. Rabbi Englard studied at Yeshivas Novominsk under the leadership of Grand Rabbi Yaakov Perlow of Novominsk. Until the present, Rabbi Englard remains a very close disciple of Rabbi Perlow.
Rabbi Englard shared a very close and unique relationship with his illustrious grandfather, Grand Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor Englard, the previous Rebbe of Radzin, being that he was his oldest grandson. Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor spent much time teaching and learning with his grandson, training him in the ways of his great heritage.
During the last years of Rabbi Avrohom Yissochor, Rav Nosson Nochum was appointed to guide and lead the young generation of Radziner chassidim in Yerushalayim. After the passing of his grandfather in 2005, Rabbi Englard was appointed to be Rav of the Radziner shtiebel and the Radziner chassidim in Yerushalayim. In 2009 he was also appointed to be the Rav of the new shtiebel in the Flatbush (Midwood\Marine Park) section of Brooklyn, NY.
In addition to serving as Rav to the above mentioned communities, Rav Englard gives discourses in the deep and unique Torah of Izhbitza-Radzyn dynasty. These lectures are usually given in the Radziner shtiebel in Yerushalayim, although he travels to many yeshivos and communities throughout Israel and abroad with a goal to spread the unique and original light of Izhbitza-Radzin to Jews of many different and diverse backgrounds. Rav Englard is known to be able to relate to every single type of Jew on a personal and an individual level, and to imbue them with a greater connection to Hashem and a greater sense of belonging and contentment. Many see his great Ahavas Yisroel - love of every Jew - as being an emulation of his grandfather, the previous Radziner Rebbe. Hence, Rabbi Englard is well known to many from different sects and circles, and is known to have touched the lives of so many in many different ways.

Julio Barragán

Julio Barragán (1928–2011) was an Argentine painter of the Concretist and Cubist schools.
Life and work.
Barragán was born in Buenos Aires. He began studying art at age 12, creating reproductions of Renaissance art masters such as El Greco. He studied at the National School of Ceramics, where he graduated in 1945 with a technical degree and met his future wife, Nieves Adeff (born 1926); Adeff, became an accomplished potter.
His work was first exhibited at the National Fine Arts Exhibition in 1946. His early work was Realist, and he rejected the contemporary genres that had already marked the careers of, among others, his elder brother, Luis Barragán. 
Barragán traveled to Paris in the late 1940s, however, and was influenced by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. He joined the "Twenty Painters and Sculptors" group with his brother, Bruno Venier, and Oscar Capristo, among others. The group, active in Argentina between 1952 and 1963, exhibited works in a number of Abstract genres, although Julio Barragán's Concrete phase contrasted with much of the group's more surreal work. His style of painting then shifted to Cubism, adopting a chiaroscuro tone that would become his trademark. The landscapes and cityscapes he painted in subsequent decades were marked by Cubist and Impressionist influences. These became his best-known works, and to meet growing demand, he adopted an "assembly line" routine at his Villa Urquiza atelier, whereby several easels were assembled in a row that allowed Barragán to alternate randomly from one work to another. 
Barragán's work was exhibited in most of the nation's leading art galleries, including the Gutiérrez y Guad, Sotheby's, Wildenstein, and Witcomb galleries, as well as in the Eduardo Sívori Museum and others. His work earned the Braque Prize at the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art (1964), the Grand Prize in Painting at the Belgrano Municipal Salon (1970), and First Prizes at the National Salon in 1976 and 1978. Local art critic Mauricio Neuman described him as a ""solitary aristocrat of beauty."" 
He retired from Buenos Aires' art shows in 2005, and died in his Almagro neighborhood home in 2011 at age 82.

Hsua

Hsua is a genus of extinct vascular plants, known from the Devonian. its name of the genus honours the Chinese palaeobotanist Jen Hsu.
Features.
The main stems (axes) of "Hsua robusta" are about an inch thick, with circinate, pseudo-monopodial side branches emerging from the sides.
The small side branches emerge immediately above a dichotomous branching point of the main axis. The lateral branches are in a plane (planar). In the centre of the axes is a protostele with an elliptical cross-section. The protoxylem was probably inside the xylem, maturing from the inside out. The tracheids have annular secondary wall thickening.
Round- to kidney-shaped sporangia lie on dichotomous branches at the end of the lateral branches, and open with symmetrical valves.
The trilete spores are 18 to 36 µm in size.
The gametophyte is unknown.
In "Hsua deflexa", the main axis was creeping with the lateral axes at right angles from it. The axes had thorny spikes.
Preservation.
"Hsua robusta" is very well preserved in cherts and as compression fossils in the Xujiachong Formation, Yunnan, China. "Hsua deflexa" comes from the same formation, which is Early Devonian (~Pragian to Emsian, around ).
Systematics.
The terminal sporangia of "Hsua robusta" placed it in the traditional family Cooksoniaceae (order Rhyniales). Kenrick and Crane, based on a cladistic analysis, placed it in its own family, Hsuaceae, in the order Sawdoniales, based on spore characteristics.

Uttar Pradesh food grain scam

Uttar Pradesh food grain scam took place between years 2002 and 2010, in Uttar Pradesh state in India, wherein food grain worth , meant to be distributed amongst the poor, through Public Distribution System (PDS) and other welfare schemes like "Antyodaya Anna Yojana" (AAY), "Jawahar Rozgar Yojana" and "Midday Meal Scheme" for Below Poverty Line (BPL) card holders, was diverted to the open market. Some of it was traced to the Nepal and Bangladesh borders, as in 2010 security forces seized Rs 11.7 million worth of foodgrains like paddy and pulses being smuggled to Nepal, another Rs 6062,000 worth of grains were confiscated on the Indo-Bangladesh border.
The scam first came into light in 2003, during the Chief Minister ship of Mulayam Singh, in Gonda district in the distribution of foodgrain meant for the "Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana" and soon complaints started pouring in from other districts as well. After initially ordering an inquiry into the scam Mulayam Singh withdrew it. The Special Investigation Team ( SIT) set up by the Mulayam Singh government in 2006, lodged over 5,000 FIRs. Subsequently the next UP chief minister Mayawati upon assuming office, ordered a CBI probe into the scam on 1 December 2007. Media dubbed it, "mother of all scams", and TV news channel, "Times Now" reported the scam which started in 2002, under the reign of following Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, estimated to be at over . Uttar Pradesh as with other states and UTs, is allocated a monthly quantity of foodgrains, i.e. rice and wheat, by the Central government for distribution amongst AAY, BPL and APL families, under TPDS managed by the state government. For the period from Apri1 2010 to March 2011, this quantity for the state was 528395 tons.
Overview.
The Central government allocates foodgrains to each state government for distribution through ration shops at subsidised rates to the poor. Under the PDS scheme, each BPL (Below Poverty Line) family is eligible for 35 kg of rice or wheat every month, while an APL (Above Poverty Line) household is entitled to 15 kg of foodgrains on a monthly basis.
According to a report in "Outlook" magazine:
History.
The Regional Food Controller's office in the state is responsible for procuring the food-grain, while the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) is in charge of its distribution. An embezzlement by a section of officers from the controller's office made news in March 2004, after 70 truckloads of rice meant for distribution was lifted from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and when FCI demanded its payment, a project director refused to verify the stock register, gradually it was revealed that they had been selling the grains in the black market and a probe was ordered. As per initial estimates at the time, foodgrain worth Rs 150 billion could have been diverted from the "Antyodaya Yojana" (food-for-work scheme) over the last five years. By December 2004, Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had suspended a district magistrate of Lakhimpur Kheri and several officials of the food department and political parties including the CPI, Congress and BJP were increasing pressure on the government to order a CBI probe.
First FIRs in the case were filed in January 2005, when the state government acknowledged the scam to be worth Rs. 450 billion under the Central government sponsored "Antyodaya Anna Yojana" (AAY). Apart 65 officials named in the FIR, further over 300 persons were suggested to involved in the preliminary reports. Apart from that a district magistrate, six ADMs and a few district food and supplies officials were suspended.
In April 2007, Union Minister, Kapil Sibal demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the illegal sale by private traders who procured the grains from the warehouses of Food Corporation of India, diverting food grains allotted to the state for the poor. Alleging that the scam took place from August to November 2004, when Rajpal Tyagi was leading the Rural Development ministry.
At first the scam was investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Uttar Pradesh Police (UPP), followed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Mulayam Singh government, after its investigations in three districts, Sitapur, Lakhimpur Kheri and Gonda, SIT lodged over 5,000 FIRs.
When Mayawati became Chief Minister, SIT investigations had revealed the scam to be larger in scale and multi-dimensional, covering many welfare schemes like "Antyodaya", "Sampurana Grameen Swarojgar Yojna" during 2002-2005, thus a CBI inquiry on ordered 1 December 2007; the scam was now worth Rs. 350 billion.
Two years later in early December 2009, CBI lodged 9 cases, identifying nearly 150 government officials, including some PCS officer as accused; in all nine people were arrested, with one of them being the chief finance and accounts officer of the District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) in Ballia and his junior.
The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court, responding to a PIL, on 23 December 2009, directed the Uttar Pradesh government to file a status report on all the nine food grain scams in the state from 2000 till 8 January 2010 being investigated by the CBI.
On 3 December 2010, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court, responding to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Vishwanath Chaturvedi, directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct and complete an inquiry within six months, into the foodgrain scam in Gonda, Lucknow, Varanasi, Ballia, Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur districts. It also stated, that "It shall not be necessary for the CBI or state agencies to obtain sanction under the statutory provision with regard to present controversy where from initial stage, prima facie intentionally, deliberately and in a planned manner, the foodgrains were lifted from godowns for sale either in the open market or to smuggle outside UP or to other countries, " The bench also asked the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government, to consider appropriate amendments in the "Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Though period under investigation is till 2007, the court also directed that "it should be open to the CBI and state agencies to proceed with investigation with regard to the scam not only up to 2007 but even beyond in case some link evidence/material is found with regard to continuance of diversion of foodgrain under various schemes of the state and Central governments."

Ashur-dugul

Aššūr-dugul, inscribed m"aš-šur-du-gul", “Look to (the god) Aššur!”, was the king of Assyria probably during the 18th century BC, a period of confusion in Assyrian history. He was the 44th ruler to be listed on the "Assyrian Kinglist", reigning for six years and was a usurper.
Biography.
He seized power in the aftermath of the overthrow of the dynasty first established by Šamši-Adad I, when native warlords jockeyed for power in the vacuum left by its demise. Šamši-Adad had been an Amorite who founded a brief, foreign dynasty apparently greatly resented by the locals judging by an alabaster slab inscription left by Puzur-Sîn, an otherwise unattested Assyrian monarch who had deposed the son of Asinum, descendant of Šamši-Adad. The "Assyrian Kinglist" says of Aššūr-dugul that he was a “son of a nobody, without right to the throne” meaning that he was not of royal descent and consequently unqualified to govern according to the patrilineal principle of legitimacy relied upon by later monarchs.
During his reign six other kings, “sons of nobodies also ruled at the time.” This may suggest a fragmentation in the small Assyrian kingdom, with rival claims to the throne. Alternatively, Newgrosh proposes that these may actually have been his limmu’s, the officials appointed each year who gave the year its name, providing the eponym dating system, and that a later scribe may have confused them for kings. The last of these, Adasi, was to go on to found the succeeding dynasty. Apart from the two copies of the kinglist, there are no other extant references to him.
He was succeeded by Bēl-bāni, the son of Adasi.

Big Dick Dudley Memorial Show

The Big Dick Dudley Memorial Show was an annual professional wrestling memorial event produced by the USA Pro Wrestling (USA Pro) promotion, held between 2002 and 2003. The show was held in memory of Big Dick Dudley, who died of kidney failure at his apartment in Copiague, New York on May 16, 2002, with a portion of the proceeds going to his family. A collection from the audience was taken up during the shows as well. The event also served as a reunion show for former alumni of Extreme Championship Wrestling, where Dudley had spent much of his career as a member of The Dudley Family, as many appeared at the show to pay their respects.
Predating the Hardcore Homecoming shows of later years, ECW wrestlers that participated were generally those already actively competing in the promotion and elsewhere on the independent circuit. It was also the first of many memorial shows held for former ECW stars followed by the Ted Petty Memorial Invitational Tournament (2002-2008), the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament (2005), Chris Candido Memorial Show (2005-2006), Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup (2005-) and the Pitbull/Public Enemy Tag Team Memorial Cup (2006).

Tom Sutcliffe (opera critic)

Tom Sutcliffe (born 4 June 1943) is an English opera critic, author and journalist. He is also a current member of the General Synod of the Church of England, first elected for the Diocese of Southwark in 1990. From 2002 until 2011 he was a member of the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England.
Early life.
Sutcliffe was born in Norwich, and saw his first opera, at the age of 4, at the Kings Theatre, Southsea. He was a boy chorister at Chichester Cathedral, and became head chorister there in 1955, near the end of the period during which Horace Hawkins was Organist and Master of the Choristers. He was educated with a choral scholarship at Hurstpierpoint College and then at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a tenor choral scholar and studied English literature.
His professional career as a countertenor commenced in 1964, while he taught English at what is now the Purcell School. He sang for Henry Washington at Brompton Oratory, and took singing lessons privately from Roy Hickman, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, whose students included the tenor Ian Partridge, the contralto Ruth Little, and the countertenor Kevin Smith. From 1965 to 1969, he played an important role in the management of the pioneering early music group Musica Reservata, founded by Michael Morrow and John S. Beckett. He was responsible for the first ever large-scale concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall involving an orchestra of authentic instruments in July 1967, as a result of which Musica Reservata was contracted to make a number of recordings with Philips Records. Between 1966 and 1970, he was the one countertenor in the choir of Westminster Cathedral (where the boy choristers also provide an alto line). He was a founder member alongside Paul Esswood, James Griffett and James Bowman of the men's voice vocal ensemble Pro Cantione Antiqua, making a series of recordings in 1970 for German radio stations conducted by Bruno Turner. Also in 1970 he made his professional opera debut at the Landestheater Darmstadt as Ottone in "L'incoronazione di Poppea" in a production by the Harro Dicks, conducted by Hans Drewanz using a new edition by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. In 1969 and 1970, he sang with the Concentus Musicus Wien, first as alto soloist in the Christmas Oratorio in Bremen, and then at the Vienna Festival in a Konzerthaus performance of two Bach alto cantatas. He also recorded the Machault "Messe de Nostre Dame" with James Bowman, and was a soloist in the first period instrument recording of the "St Matthew Passion", conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt.
Later career.
For two years from 1968, Sutcliffe sold advertising space on the magazine "Music & Musicians" which he edited from 1970 to 1973. In January 1975 he became music, opera and theatre critic for "Vogue", and continued to review music and opera for Vogue until 1987. Between 1973 and 1996, he worked on the staff of "The Guardian", where he was first commissioned as a critic in 1972 - covering Rudolf Bing's farewell Gala at the Met, and the new Bayreuth Festival "Tannhäuser" staged by Götz Friedrich. After 1979, when the Guardian's famous theatre and opera critic Philip Hope-Wallace died, Sutcliffe wrote frequently about opera, eventually becoming the main opera critic on the paper until 1993 and the replacement of Edward Greenfield on his retirement as chief music critic by Andrew Clements. In 1996 Sutcliffe left the Guardian, where he had also been a frequent writer of features and had edited the arts and obituaries pages. He has continued to write obituaries for The Guardian, including most recently the obituary of Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson, and in 2007 of Luciano Pavarotti. Two months after leaving the Guardian he was invited to become opera critic of the "Evening Standard", replacing Alexander Waugh in a post that he held until 2002 when Norman Lebrecht joined the paper as arts supremo on the retirement of editor Max Hastings. He also wrote regularly for "Opera News", among many other publications.
He contributed to the "Cambridge Companion to Twentieth Century Opera" and has also written for the programme books of San Francisco Opera, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Welsh National Opera, Garsington Opera, Grange Park Opera, the Aldeburgh Festival, Opera Holland Park, La Monnaie, the Edinburgh Festival, Opera Australia, Frankfurt Opera, the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. His appearances on television have included a 1991 film about Benjamin Britten in the BBC's "J'Accuse" series. In 1994 he took an important part in Lindsay Anderson's last film, an entertaining and autobiographical documentary titled "Is That All There Is?". He has twice been elected to a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship, and from 1999 to 2009 chaired the Music section of The Critics' Circle, of which he is President until the end of 2012. In 2007 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Rose Bruford College. He worked as a dramaturg in collaboration with opera director Keith Warner at the Monnaie in Brussels in 1998 and at the Theater an der Wien in 2003 and 2006. He currently writes for "Opera Now" and "Opernwelt".
Personal life.
Sutcliffe is married to the author, playwright and librettist Meredith Oakes. Their son Walter Sutcliffe is an opera and theatre director, and their daughter Chloe Sutcliffe is working on her doctorate on climate change vulnerability assessments for dryland farming (for the School of Earth and Environment at Leeds University).

The Borgward BFK-1 Kolibri, aka Borgward-Focke BFK-1 Kolibri, (Kolibri meaning "hummingbird" in German) was a German three-seated utility helicopter built by Borgward, designed by Heinrich Focke. It was the first German helicopter after World War II. The helicopter first flew on July 8, 1958 in Bremen, piloted by Ewald Rohlfs. Two prototypes were built. The helicopter had a steel tubing fuselage, and was covered with metal. It had a fabric-covered v-tail the end of which would have rotors. The main rotor had three blades with steel tubing for the centre, covered with wood. The helicopter had a six-cylinder air-cooled Lycoming VO-435-A1B engine, producing 260 hp. The fuel tank was capable of holding 180L. The helicopter could be used for spraying in agriculture, and could carry up to 300 lbs. Development ended after two prototypes were built, as Borgward went bankrupt shortly after in 1961.

Collegial Centre for Educational Materials Development

The Collegial Centre for Educational Materials Development (CCDMD) produces computer-based resources and printed documents for teaching staff and students throughout the Quebec college network, and is managed by Collège de Maisonneuve.
History.
The CCDMD was founded in 1993 further to a major revamping of the Direction générale de l’enseignement collégial (directorate of college education) in Quebec. It was previously a division of the Department of Education, called Service de développement de matériel didactique (department for educational materials development), whose role was to provide educational, technical and financial support to college teachers wishing to produce quality printed or computer-based educational material. When its administration was transferred to Collège de Maisonneuve in 1993, it became the CCDMD.
The centre is funded mainly by the ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport du Québec, and some of its services are also supported by funding from the Canada-Quebec Agreement on Minority-Language Education and Second Languages Instruction.
Mandate.
The mandate of the CCDMD is to ensure that students and teachers of the Quebec college network have access to quality educational materials in both English and French, and also to contribute to the development of these materials at the various stages of production. Most documents produced by the CCDMD are developed by teachers within the college network or by outside specialists supported by a member of the teaching faculty and academic dean of a college. A call for projects is held each year from November to March, providing the opportunity for any teaching or professional staff member among the 48 public or 22 private colleges in Quebec to submit a project for the development of educational materials, by completing a project presentation form.
Resources by Discipline.
The CCDMD produces materials for students in a wide range of courses and programs, as well as documents specifically aimed at improving English or French language skills. Its catalogue includes over 200 educational resources, a large collection of manuals and a rich educational heritage.
Improving French.
Further to the implementation of the plan of action to improve and promote French language skills in college educational institutions, in 1989, the then existing Service de développement de matériel didactique created the French language program. Today, a considerable portion of the documents produced by the CCDMD are aimed at improving the French language. The website provides hundreds of resources to French language help centres in the college network, teachers, tutors and students.
The site includes a wide variety of interactive materials: educational games, linguistic capsules, diagnostic tests, guided exercises, revision strategies as well as interactive exercises.
The site also includes a comprehensive collection of printed documents providing educational tools as well as grammar exercises and information on the French language test.
Since 1995, the CCDMD has also been publishing a newsletter called Correspondance three times a year. This publication is aimed at anyone concerned with improving the French language in the college network.
The Learning Centre.
The English-language division of the CCDMD was created in 2005, and in turn, in 2006, it developed a section dedicated specifically to improving the English language, the Learning Centre. This section includes a variety of resources in the form of exercises, readings, tutorials, interactive activities, audio and video clips:
• revision and correction strategies for English texts;
• exercises and tips to pass the English Exit Exam (or Ministerial Examination of College English), the equivalent of the Épreuve uniforme (standardized test) in French, that any student registered in an English college must pass to obtain a college diploma;
• an Internet directory of the best sites for English language improvement, including a search engine;
• a large number of useful resources for students, both in English and French colleges.
The mandate of the Learning Centre is to help students to develop their ability to express themselves in English, improve their English-language reading, writing and comprehension skills, and provide teachers with quality educational materials.
World of Images.
World of Images is a directory designed to meet the immense need to use copyright-free photographs, illustrations and videos for the production of quality educational materials. The site originated as Le Québec en images, but the project quickly expanded with the virtual proximity of users on the Web and the growing number of intercultural exchanges, and resulted in the World of Images, a collection constantly enriched by the many users and partners who agree to share their media. Its main objectives are to:
• provide free space for storing and managing photographs, illustrations and videos of all kinds (artistic, documentary, educational, scientific, etc.);
• gather a significant part of the media produced as part of all the college activities: demonstrations, lectures, research, assignments, artistic productions, foreign internships, exemplary practices, etc.;
• create theme-based albums to organize images according to their representative subject;
• promote exchanges between users by allowing them to vote for their favourite media, share it through social networking sites and post comments.
Netquiz Pro.
Netquiz Pro is a software application for creating Web-based exercises or tests, without any programming or knowledge of HTML language. It is in fact an Internet/Intranet software development tool that generates all the components of the quiz in a folder, which can then be installed on a server.
SurveyAuthor.
SurveyAuthor is an editing application for Web-based surveys. It allows you to create nine types of survey questions (matching, multiple choice, Likert-type scale, etc.). These questions can include text, images, sound, video, and web hyperlinks, and can be configured in various ways. The questionnaires produced by SurveyAuthor can also be customized to meet specific user requirements.
The CCDMD on iTunes U.
The CCDMD joined iTunes University (iTunes U) in December 2010. It is the first college organization to make educational content available on this distribution platform, and the third educational institution in Quebec to join, after University of Montreal and McGill University. The CCDMD has been distributing videos for six of its products on iTtunes U, thereby providing teachers and students with ready and free access to audio and video educational content. The files can be viewed or downloaded wherever you are on a Mac OS or Windows workstation, or on a digital player, and an interface is available for both the iPad and iPhone.

At the time Gordon took office, the County was facing a $100 million projected cumulative shortfall within four years. Gordon launched the first comprehensive County Reinvention Initiative in 1997. In 2000, Gordon had eliminated the projected shortfall and had created a $100 million surplus. After being reelected for a second term (8 total years), County Executive Gordon achieved unprecedented financial success for New Castle Countians leaving office with $185 million in Reserves and was awarded the highest Bond Rating (AAA) by all three Wall Street Bond Rating agencies. Gordon is also credited as being the only two-term County Executive who did not raise property taxes and sewer user rates for eight years while producing the largest Financial Reserves in the history of New Castle County government.

John MacKay Shaw

John MacKay Shaw (1897–1984) was a business executive, bibliophile, philanthropist, and writer. He was keenly interested in the tradition of poetry in the English language from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries. He was especially attentive to its treatment of the theme of childhood.
Biography.
Shaw was born 15 May 1897 at 60 Lumsden Street, dirk Overnewton, in Glasgow’s west end. He was the son of Neil and Catherine Ann (Mackenzie) Shaw. His father’s family was from the Island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides; his mother's family was from the Isle of Lewis, one of the Outer Hebrides. Shaw was educated at the Willow Bank School in Glasgow.
Neil Shaw emigrated to America in 1910, and in April 1911 John Shaw, his mother, and sisters Margaret and Anna followed. The Shaw family settled in Philadelphia. Feeling that he was too advanced for the grade level in which he was placed in the public schools, John Shaw departed from formal schooling and took the initiative in educating himself in various libraries, taking his cue from the institutions established by Scotsman Andrew Carnegie. 
Shaw’s involvement in business began at age sixteen when he enrolled in a program of business training organized by John Wanamaker. This involved a summer camp and also experience working in Wanamaker’s Philadelphia store, where, among other responsibilities, he sorted and delivered mail. His activities with Wanamaker extended from 1911 to 1913. During this period Shaw taught himself stenography, in part by transcribing Sunday sermons into shorthand. He was soon working in the steno pool at Union Casualty Company and afterwards at Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. 
With the coming of World War I, John Shaw enlisted in the Army. He served in Europe from 1917 to 1919. As an ambulance driver in France, he took part in the Second Battle of the Marne and the Meusse-Argon Offensive. He was in Paris on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918. 
On his return from Europe, he worked with Mitten Management, serving first as private secretary to Thomas Mitten (1865–1929) and afterwards as vice-president of the company. Mitten Management operated the Philadelphia street railway through Philadelphia Rapid Transit. Shaw was associated with the firm from 1925 until Mitten’s death in 1929. Shaw’s specialty was in the field of public relations and advertising. 
Although remaining on the board of Mitten Management, Shaw next accepted an appointment with American Telephone & Telegraph in 1930 and remained with the Bell Telephone system until his retirement in 1959. He served as assistant vice-president for public relations and marketing from 1944 to 1959. He played a key role in the introduction of the dial telephone, testifying before Congress in its behalf. As head of public relations at AT&T’s headquarters at 195 Broadway in New York, he was in charge of the Bell Telephone Hour broadcasts and the preparation of the Bell system’s telephone directories. In the latter endeavor, he worked with Chauncey Hawley Griffith in the development of the Bell Gothic typeface.
John Shaw founded the Public Relations Society of New York in 1945. He was active in various charities including Community Chest (1940–1950), National Council, Boy Scouts of America (1947–1966), and the Joint Council of Economic Education (1948–1955). He was active in the St. Andrews Society of New York and in 1976 served as first president of the St. Andrew’s Society of Tallahassee, Florida. 
On 19 June 1926 John M. Shaw married Lillian Reamer. Shaw soon began writing witty poems to amuse their son and daughter, and this interest led to his broad search for the treatment of childhood in the works of the British and American poets.
The Childhood in Poetry Collection.
In 1929 John MacKay Shaw began in earnest in collecting British and American poetry. Although his interest was in identifying passages relating to the theme of childhood, his collection extended far beyond the confines of children’s literature. In 1959, at the time of his retirement from Bell, he had assembled over 5,000 first and rare editions as well as manuscripts which he related to the subject of childhood in poetry. Included were virtually all of the major poets in English as well as a great number of minor authors, represented in their own books, in anthologies, Victorian gift books, children’s periodicals, biographies, and criticism. Many of the books were first editions, many were association copies, or otherwise distinguished for their, illustrations, bindings, or other features. 
Upon his retirement, Shaw placed his library at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. Here he continued to build on his holdings, and to speak and write about the collection and its research potential. He received the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1972. He served as voluntary curator of his collection until 1980.

Talia (given name)

Talia is a feminine given name of Hebrew origin meaning "dew from God". Talia is a combination of two separate words which, when combined, translate to "dew of God". The word "talia" can be found in the Mishnah ("Keilim" 24:17), although its use as a name is modern. 
It is also attributed to the word meaning female "lamb" in Hebrew, as define by the "Even-Shoshan" dictionary. The Hebrew word for male lamb – "taLEH" (טלה) with the addition of the female suffix describing female animals "ya" (יה), as mentioned in the Mishnah (Minchot, 23;7).
The Hebrew name Talia bears phonological similarities to names found in other languages. The Assyrian community heavily used the name "T(h)alia, which, in Neo-Aramaic, means "boy." The Greek name Thalia (or Thalía or Thaleia (; Greek: "Θάλεια" from "θάλλειν" "to bloom") dates back to antiquity and is relatively popular in a number of countries. However, pronunciation varies and in some cases the θ/t distinction of the original Greek is lost (e.g. ). A similar-sounding name is also in use in Polynesian cultures.

Harpejji

The harpejji is an electric stringed musical instrument developed in 2007 by Tim Meeks, founder of Marcodi Musical Products, and is a descendant of the StarrBoard. The instrument aims to bridge the gap in sound and technique between the guitar and the piano. The playing surface has an isomorphic keyboard layout arranged in ascending whole tones across strings, and ascending semi-tones as the strings travel away from the player with a five octave range from A0 to A5. The first harpejji model, the 24 string d1, was produced from January 2008 through May 2010. It was subsequently replaced by the k24 which also has 24 strings. The latter model includes updates to the internal electronics, a simplification of the fretboard marker system, and a change from maple to bamboo as the primary wood for the instrument. In January 2011, the g16, a smaller 16 string model with a four octave range (from C2 to C6) and mono output, was introduced. All harpejjis use an electronic muting system to dampen unfretted strings and minimize the impact of sympathetic vibrations.
Technique.
It is primarily played with a two handed tapping technique. It differs from other tapping instruments, such as the Chapman Stick, by way of the orientation of the instrument to the player. The instrument rests on a stand like a keyboard and the strings perpendicular to the player. The instrument allows for the musician to use all 10 fingers to fret the strings, and a single hand can cover a two octave range. New techniques for playing the instrument are beginning to surface, such as strumming with a pick. Unlike the piano, no formal pedagogy has been established for the harpejji.
Players and recordings.
Jim Daneker was an early adopter of the harpejji and was among the first to appear with the instrument in public. The first commercial harpejji recording was made by Jordan Rudess for the soundtrack to the "God of War III" video game. Rudess also has included the harpejji as another instrument on Dream Theater, who already has 2 keyboards, a lap steel guitar and a continuum. Stevie Wonder played his hit song "Superstition" on a 16 string harpejji on the 2012 Billboard Music Awards. 
Two time Grammy and Oscar awards winner A.R Rahman has been using Continuum in several of his recordings and live shows. His Oscar nominated song "If I rise" from 127 Hours featured Harpejji. In the opening episode of Season 3 of Coke Studio India, he played Harpejji in two songs - "Ennile Maha Oliyo" and "Jagao Mere Des"

Nallan Chakravartula Krishnamacharyulu

Sri Nallan Chakravartula Krishnamacharyulu (1924–2006) was a great scholar, musician, teacher and an exponent of the art of hari katha of modern times. He belongs the lineage of Saint Tyagaraja and is the 5th generation student descendant of the great saint.
Tyagaraja --> Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar --> Susarla Dakshina Murthy Sastry --> Parupalli Rama Krishnayya Pantulu --> Nallan Chakravartula Krishnamacharyulu
Life & Career.
He was born in 1924 in Jaggayya peta, Andhra Pradesh to parents Jagannaadha Tiru Venkataacharyulu and Venkata Ramanamma. At a very early age, he started learning vyaakaraNa and meemaamsa sastras from his father and later from sri chilakamarri kesavaacharyulu. He had a long gurukulam-style training in carnatic music from the legendary Parupalli Rama Krishnayya Pantulu who is credited with producing such stalwarts as Dr.M. Balamuralikrishna and Annavarapu Rama Swamy.
Sri Krishnmacharyulu served as staff violinist in All India Radio Vijayawada from 1948 to 1983. He was conferred with the title of Gaana kalA prapuurna by the Anadhra Pradesh Sangeetha Academy. Various other institutions recognized his mastery of the art by conferring titles Sangeetha Saahitya Kalaa Nidhi, Hari Kadhaa Chuudamani and Sangeetha Kalaa Saagara.
In November 1998, he received special recognition from All India Radio (AIR) during Golden Jubilee celebrations; Later he also received a similar award from Telugu University, Hyderabad.
Sri Krishnamacharylu created several scholarly works in Sanskrit and Telugu. He was of firm belief that there was no need for anyone to compose new keerthanas in Carnatic tradition as the Trinity's compositions were matchless and would take a life time to learn even a few. But due to compulsion and requests from some musicians composed over 20 krithis, varnams and Tillanas in popular as well as rare ragas. Just like earlier vaggeyakaras (spontaneous saintly composers), he never needed to think of the verses due to his extraordinary scholarship in Sanskrit and Telugu.
Sri Krishnamacharyulu is inspirational musician for some upcoming musicians in the family, for instance, Nallan Chakravartula Partha Sarathy. His devotion and dedication to music is incomparable.

Baggins End

The Baggins End Domes, also known as The Domes or the Davis Domes, are a student housing cooperative at the University of California, Davis built by students in 1972. They are part of the Sustainable Research Area which includes the Student Farm and the Experimental College Gardens. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller, there are 14 domes, featuring painted fiberglass-shell exteriors, the insides of which were coated with sprayed polyurethane foam, and "core-walls" with a kitchen on one side and a bathroom on the other. On January 25, 2011, an announcement was made by Student Housing that no new leases will be granted for the following academic year. The Sustainable Living/ Learning Task Force with faculty and students was initiated to investigate options.
Domes residents, also known as Domies, ended up collaborating with the Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA) cooperative in Davis, California. SCHA and Domies raised money to repair the domes and lobbied the university to transfer management of the Domes to SCHA. A community build event was held on November 3-6, where hundreds of volunteers performed the majority of the work, which included creating wheelchair accessible pathways and gardens, building new railings, and patching foam. 
SCHA signed a ground lease with UC Davis at the end of December 2011, 14 new Domies moved into 7 of the domes at the start of January. Work will continue on the remainder through July 2012.

<doc id="30989548" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30989548" title="Sexual orientation hypothesis">
Sexual orientation hypothesis

The sexual orientation hypothesis is an hypothesis proposed by Donald McCreary in 1994 that describes male and female sexual orientation and their societal acceptance. The hypothesis says that feminine men are more likely to be assumed gay than masculine women are to be assumed lesbians (Whitley & Kite, 2010). According to studies done on this hypothesis, having feminine characteristics is a sign of homosexuality in men, but masculine characteristics are less likely to be seen as a sign of homosexuality in women. Although gay men are considered more like hetero women than hetero men, and lesbians are rated more like hetero men than hetero women, the difference is not as great for lesbians as it is for gay men.
Research.
McCreary states that these negative feelings can be attributed to the male gender role rigidity principle. This principle presents the idea that males are more severely punished by parents and excluded from peer groups when behaving in atypical gender roles (McCreary, 1994).
In his research, McCreary tried to explain the reduced tolerance of cross-gender behavior in males rather than females through the sexual orientation hypothesis as well as the social status model. Uniting the two concepts has been said to produce the best way of understanding this concept. However, McCreary found that the sexual orientation hypothesis has a higher validity rate (1994). The social status model suggests that stereotypical male characteristics are more socially desirable than stereotypical female characteristics. Therefore, men who display female characteristics would create a more negative response in society than their female counterparts who present more masculine characteristics.
Another of his studies presented stimulus personalities to a group of college age students. These personalities were of both males and females either eight or thirty years of age and present either typical or atypical gender behaviors. Subjects were more likely to view the male atypical gender behavior personality as a homosexual. This finding suggests that gender roles and behaviors play a larger role in identifying the perception of male sexual orientation more than females (McCreary, 1994).
Hypothetical examples.
The sexual orientation hypothesis is evident in many ways. For instance, in the United States a man who carries a shoulder bag is mocked and considered feminine for carrying a “purse,” while most people hardly think twice about a woman who carries a wallet. The woman may even be applauded for breaking the stereotype of a woman with a large purse on her shoulder.
Another, more common, example can be found in sports. Female athletes aren't seen as homosexual but as active women who happen to share a common interest with men in sports. However, a male cheerleader or synchronized swimmer is often ridiculed as being homosexual, and looked down upon by others of both sexes.

David A. Booth

David Booth works full-time in research and research teaching as an honorary professor at the School of Psychology in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences of the University of Birmingham (UK). According to his Web page he investigates the ways in which an individual's life works. His research and teaching centre on the processes in the mind that fit acts and reactions of human beings and animals to the passing situation.
Educational roots.
Booth studied chemistry, physics and mathematics in school, then chemistry—in particular chemical physics—at university. Another student on a philosophy and psychology degree introduced him to the 1930s Cambridge work in analysis of the functioning of language
Academic career.
Booth has been Professor of Psychology, earlier Reader in Physiological Psychology, Senior Lecturer and initially Lecturer in the Birmingham School of Psychology since 1972, with research staff funded by MRC, HEC, SERC, MAFF, AFRC and BBSRC. In 1966-72, he was Research Fellow in the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, on his own funds from SERC, MRC and MHRF. He was elected to the Experimental Psychology Society in 1967. On joining the British Psychological Society in 1983, he was made a Fellow and later become Chartered Psychologist, a founding member of the Division of Health Psychology and professionally practising member of the Division for Teachers and Researchers in Psychology, ending as chair. His first employment within Psychology was as a postdoc at the Yale University Graduate School in 1964-6, initiating work on metabolic biochemistry and neuropharmacology in the laboratories of Neal E. Miller on his funds from NIH. From 1959 to 1964 he was employed as a graduate research worker in Henry McIlwain's Department of Neurochemistry at the Institute of Psychiatry (and briefly the Institute of Neurology) in the University of London. After 3 years of registered study for a PhD in Biochemistry, he graduated by thesis in 1964. He registered for two years for a BA in Philosophy and Psychology (with Sociology option) at Birkbeck College, University of London, graduating with First Class Honours in 1962. He went up to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1955 to read Chemistry with Biochemistry, following secondary education at Dulwich College.
Work.
David Booth carried out work that contradicted the theory that dual centres of the hypothalamus control eating, the lateral hypothalamus for hunger and the ventromedial hypothalamus for satiety and began to replace it with a theory of the control of food choice and intake through learnt connections distributed around the brain. With colleagues he built a simulation of the physiological and learning mechanisms influencing eating patterns in people and laboratory animals, and extended it to include cultural and interpersonal influences.

First Encounter is an album by American jazz pianist Mal Waldron and bassist Gary Peacock recorded in 1971 and released on the Japanese RCA Victor label.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating "The long improvisations on the four originals (three by Waldron and one from Peacock) are melancholy, usually introverted and subtle. The interplay between Waldron and Peacock on the inside/outside music is the main asset to this obscure but generally rewarding session".

Euphronia

Euphronia is a genus of three species of shrubs native to northern South America and is the only genus in the family Euphroniaceae. It was previously classified in the Vochysiaceae family and elsewhere, but the APG III system of 2009 recognizes Euphroniaceae and places "Euphronia" in it. The genus was originally described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini in 1824 when they described "Euphronia hirtelloides" as a new species. In 1918, the German botanist Johannes Gottfried Hallier reclassified what was then known as "Lightia guianensis" as a species in this genus: "Euphronia guianensis". And in 1987, the American botanist Julian Alfred Steyermark described the third species, "Euphronia acuminatissima". It was proposed in 1989 that the family Euphroniaceae be erected to contain the genus because it was sufficiently different from other related genera. An analysis of the molecular phylogenetics of these related genera and families in 1998 supported the decision to retain the genus within a monotypic family.

Huntington Wagon Road

The Huntington Wagon Road is a historic road in Deschutes County, Oregon, United States.
About halfway between Bend and Redmond, Oregon, is a roughly one-square-mile parcel of public land where a section of the historic Huntington Road wagon trail has been preserved. The parcel is managed by the Prineville district of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). At the beginning of the trail, which is closed to all motor vehicles, is a sign posted by the Deschutes County Historical Society that provides the following information:
"Before you lies a one mile segment of historic wagon road known as the "Huntington Road". In 1864, J. W. Perit Huntington, Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, guided a party to Fort Klamath to make peace with the Klamath, Modoc and some of the Paiute tribes. A peace treaty was signed, and the Klamath Reservation was established in 1866 with headquarters at Klamath Agency. By the terms of the "Indian Treaty of 1864", the U.S. government was required to provide the Indians with certain supplies. In the fall of 1867, Huntington guided a wagon train loaded with supplies from The Dalles to Fort Klamath, creating the Huntington Road. The party consisted of 70 men including teamsters, soldiers and Indian scouts. It is probable that members of the Lost Meek Wagon Train passed over this portion of the Huntington Road in 1845 as they crossed the juniper desert on their way to the Willamette Valley."

From 2001 to 2005, she was a member of the professional staff of the United States House Committee on Armed Services. In 2005, she became the Armed Service Committee's Minority Staff Director, holding that position until 2007, when she became the full committee's staff director. In this position, Conaton served as primary adviser on defense matters to the Chairman and 61 other Members; directed overall operations, and strategic planning; and led the substantive agenda of the committee, to include drafting and overseeing the National Defense Authorization Act.
On November 10, 2009, President of the United States Barack Obama nominated Conaton to be United States Under Secretary of the Air Force, an office that had been vacant since the resignation of Ronald M.

<doc id="30989859" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30989859" title="Conditioned satiety">
Conditioned satiety

"Conditioned satiety" is one of the three known food-specific forms of suppression of appetite for food by effects of eating, along with alimentary alliesthesia and sensory-specific satiety. "Conditioned satiety" was first evidenced in 1955 in rats by the late French physiologist professor Jacques Le Magnen. The term was coined in 1972 by professor David Allenby Booth. Unlike the other two sorts of stimulus-specific satiety, this phenomenon is based on classical conditioning but is distinct from conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in its dependence on internal state towards the end of a meal.
Description of the phenomenon.
"Conditioned satiety" is thought to be acquired when a food with a given flavour is eaten on a partly full stomach and followed promptly by a mildly aversive digestive event ("bloat"). However, it is uncertain if and how this phenomenon may occur under real-life conditions as normally more than food of one given flavor is ingested during a meal. It has been widely misunderstood as an association of the sensory properties of a food with its energy content (calories) or carbohydrate content. However that is a confusion with the conditioning of simple aversion or a contrast with simple conditioned preference. "Conditioned satiety" has only been evidenced in experiments with rats, monkeys or humans when a flavour and fullness together have been paired with concentrated maltodextrin. When a whole meal of concentrated maltodextrin is eaten without changing its flavour, only the conditioning of preference for the flavour early in the meal is seen. Rats, monkeys and people can learn "conditioned satiety" within one or two pairings although in the first experiments the rats needed several days to adapt their intakes because the test food was aversively flavoured or textured. The particularity of "conditioned satiety" is that the time lapse between intake (and thus sensory stimulation) and the aversively conditioning after-effect is much shorter (less than 15 minutes) than that feasible for the conditioning of simple aversion to taste, odour or texture by poisoning, which can occur with a delay in postabsorptive effects of 12 or more hours.

STANAG 4355 - The Modified Point Mass and Five Degrees of Freedom Trajectory Model is a NATO Standardization Agreement for surface to surface exterior ballistic modelling in support of Artillery, mortar and rocket systems.
The principal aim of this agreement is to standardize the exterior ballistic trajectory simulation methodology for NATO Naval and Army Forces. The Modified Point Mass model wil be used for spin-stabilized projectiles and the Five Degrees of Freedom model will be used for fin-stabilized rockets. This facilitates the exchange of exterior ballistic data and fire control information. The custodian of this STANAG is Land Capability Group 3 - Sub Group 2 within the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG). The most recent promulgated copy is Edition 3, dated 17 April 2009. Implementation of the STANAG is often accomplished by adoption of components of the SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4).

Henryk Gold

Henryk Gold (19029 January 1977, New York, USA) was a Polish Jewish composer, arranger, and orchestra director.
He was born in Warsaw to a musical family: his mother Helena was of the famous Warsaw klezmer Melodysta family, and his father Michael was a flautist in the Warsaw Opera Orchestra. He was the brother of Artur Gold. He studied in Warsaw, his teachers including Stanisław Barcewicz (violin).
When silent movies in Poland lost popularity following the arrival of Al Jolson's "The Jazz Singer", (known in Yiddish as "The Singing Buffoon"), thousands of Polish musicians who'd played in the movie theaters lost their livelihood; they began to create large and small orchestras playing dance music and jazz. Artur and Henryk Gold, the brothers Jerzy and Stanislaw Petersburski, Zygmunt Karasinski and Szymon Kataszek, Kazimierz Englard, Julian Halicki were the pioneers; Henryk Gold was chief among them, giving concerts at the famous Ziemiańska Cafe on Kredytowa Street and the revue theater “Morskie-Oko” on Sienkiewicz Street. He ran the nightclub “Adria” with his brother on Moniuszki Street.
Gold wrote hundreds of tangos, polkas, foxtrots, and waltzes, interpolating Jewish motifs. His hits included "Tęsknota" ("Nostalgia", in Yiddish "Benkshaft"); "Jaśminy" (Jasmine); "Jak ja się dziś upiję" ("When I Get Drunk Today", in Yiddish "Az 'Khvel Mikh Haynt Onshikirn"); "Moja pierswsza i ostatnia" ("My First and Last", Yiddish "Mayn Ershte Un Letste"); "Szkoda twoich łez" ("Too bad about your tears", Yiddish "A Shod Dayne Trern"), and others.
During the Second World War, he and fellow composer Jerzy Petersburski toured the Soviet Union with a large jazz orchestra. In 1942 he left the Soviet Union with the Polish Anders Army, went to Israel, where he wrote songs "Arcenu ha-ktantonet", "Ruakh", "Shalom" and lastly emigrated to New York, USA.

Safdar Ali

Safdar Ali, (, )
(1830-1899) a convert from Islam to Christianity, was born in the native state of Dholpur, and was the son of an orthodox Syud gentleman. Ali's father personally saw to his education which was deeply rooted in the religion of Islam but he also received instruction from other Islamic and philosophical scholars from around their city of residence. While Ali was still young, his father, who held the position of Qazi in Dholpur, was dismissed from this role and he chose to move their family to Agra. From here Ali continued his studies which led to his philosophical and theological questioning of his childhood religion of Islam. Ali's questioning led to what he called a three-year struggle through the Christian and Mohammedan scriptures as well as other works of controversy pertaining to either faith. At the end of his three-year journey, Ali finally attained what he called his full assurance of salvation. He was finally baptized on Christmas Day in 1864.
Early Life and Education.
Since an early age, Ali showed great interest in topics of metaphysical sciences, philosophy, polemical debates, and various topics in Muslim theology. When he was young, Ali's father began to teach and guide him in his study of the religion of Islam. Ali recounted in one of his letters to the Church Missionary Society, the extent to which his father went to ensure that his son received the best education possible. Giving up much of his free time away from work, his father was the largest influence in his training to become a Muslim scholar. Ali states again in the same letter that even after his father had been removed from his position in Dholpur and they had settled in Agra, despite the luxuries that they could no longer afford, his father remained steadfast and encouraged Ali daily which as he states, “produced the deepest longings in my mind”. In addition to his father's teaching, he also received instruction from other Islamic scholars in Agra. Ali dedicated much of his time into studying other religions and philosophies as well. Religious Hindu books, ancient Greek philosophical texts (in their Arab translations), as well as works by atheists, sophists and deists, were all in addition to his regular study of orthodox Islam. However, despite his studying of other religious texts, the Christian Scriptures did not come across his study until later in his life when he was appointed Deputy Inspector of Schools in Rawul Pindee. After his homeschooling, Safdar Ali then went on to receive an education from the British Governmental College in Agra which focused on physical sciences, mathematics, and introductions to English literature.
Career.
After graduating from the college in Agra, Ali was granted the distinction of being a maulvi. He was in attendance during the great debate in 1854 where public controversy broke out between Pfander and the leading maulvis of that time in reaction against his writings, particularly that of Mizan-Ul-Haqq. In his evidence given before the 1882 Education Commission presided over by W. W. Hunter, Safdar Ali gave an overview of his career in the Educational Department of the British Raj from 1854 to 1872. From 1854 to 1856 he was Persian teacher and Assistant Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Agra Government College. For the next four years he was Deputy Inspector of Schools in the Punjab including Rawalpindi. From 1860 to 1872, he held a similar position in Jubbulpore. During this time he also officiated as Inspector of Schools and was on tour in the Districts of Narsinghpur and Hoshangabad. After he left the Education Department in 1872, he conitinued his service as Extra Assistant Commissioner in Jabalpur in the Central Provinces, where he was serving at the time of the Education Commission and at Union Eternal.
Journey to Conversion.
In his years of scholarship, both in the governmental school and his religious studies, Ali came to find that Islam's sources of theology (the Koran and the Hadith) appeared to be in contradiction to what his studies in physical science had proven to be true. Yet in spite of this, he fortified himself in his faith by making the assertion (similar to that of Tertullian centuries prior), “What has reason to do with revelation?” However as he continued his scholarly pursuits, his findings remained true. 
While being Deputy Inspector of Schools, Ali came across a group of Sufi philosophers and fakirs whose practices of austerity and self-mortification enticed him greatly, and, in an attempt to fill his feelings of spiritual emptiness, he took up their disciplinary practices. These practices had the intended purpose of creating inner life, purity, and holiness of heart. However, as time went on they had the reverse effect on Ali than what he had hoped. His spiritual longings became greater, and the outward disciplines of which the Sufi's had taught him became the means through which his spiritual pangs grew. In his relationship with this group of mystics he became aware of what they described as a 'spiritual guide' which was necessary in order to pursue this inward purity. With this knowledge Ali went about searching in an attempt to find a guide that would give him direction toward spiritual fulfillment but none were found. With regard to his search for a spiritual guide, Ali later wrote a letter to the Church Missionary Society in which he stated:
“In my search after a guide, I waited upon a great number of Sheikhs and Fakeers, but many of them turned out to be nothing better than worldlings and hypocrites. Some, indeed, had the true Sufi temper, and were devout persons, loving God, and worshipping Him according to the instructions and directions of their spiritual guides, and employing themselves day and night in religious exercises and prayers. However, I was seeking for an infallible guide and unfailing director--for one who could discern and particularize my spiritual disease, and indicate its cause, and work a complete cure, and bring me full assurance--one who was not a quack-one who was not himself diseased.”
In the midst of his endless search Ali was transferred to a new region called Jabalpur. It was here that his spiritual mourning deepened, and with advice from friends, and perhaps a last attempt to find spiritual fulfillment, he planned a pilgrimage to Arabia. However, financial obligations connected to his property forced him to postpone his pilgrimage to Arabia to a later date. It was at this time while going through his books that he stumbled upon "Mizan-ul-Haqq" by Rev. C. G. Pfander (with whom he had prioer contact), as well as some Christian scriptures, both of which enticed him to study the controversy between Islam and Christianity thoroughly. It was then between the years of November 1861 and December 1864 that Ali suffered through his inquiries, spending as much time that he could afford, both day and night, in pursuit of the truth about the two religions.
In the first year of his intense struggle, Ali had discerned what he believed to be the truth: that Mohammed was not the prophet of God, and that the Koran, and the Hadith were not divinely inspired pieces of literature. He still held his previous disciplinary practices in high regard however, but only in so far as how he perceived that they revealed to a person their spiritual state of depravity. Additionally, he found that the Christian scriptures held a diagnosis and cure for what he felt was his 'spiritual disease' and that the scriptures themselves gave such purposeful care in their presentation of this process, that he believed that he had found within them divine and infallible character.
In the second year of Ali's struggle he became convinced of not only what he called the 'triumph of Christianity' but also of what he found to be the falsehood of all other religions and religious philosophies. Even the disciplinary practices of other religions that he had once held in such high esteem became pointless as far as he was concerned as, comparably, he thought that these practices only produced a false sense of piety to those that participated in them. Ali also found it important to note, that during this second year he was filled with great anguish over his predicament as to being "without creed or faith, and still unpossessed of eternal salvation," and in addition to this he was also afflicted with a strong bodily illness which left him in desolate condition.
By the time the third year of his struggle came around Ali was so deeply entrenched in his study and his ailment had gotten so severe that many of his close friends came to him and pleaded with him to reconsider his study. They pleaded that no religion was without small discrepancies and that his study was not worth the effect it was having on his health. Despite the constant warnings, rebukes, and pleas, Ali's resolve remained the same as he was convinced that God's revelation had indeed been made clear and he was determined to discover the full extent of what that was. Finally, at the end of his spiritual struggle, Ali found what he called his 'full assurance of salvation' and he was baptized Christmas Day of 1864. In addition, Ali's two close companions, who had also endured similar hardships and struggles, were baptized. Kasim Khan was baptized on the same day as Ali, and, Karim Bakhsh who was baptized shortly thereafter.
After his baptism and conversion, Ali received persecution from some of his friends and family, to the point of which his wife, child, and father-in-law all left him and returned to Agra. Other people ceased communication with Ali entirely, and others still, intrigued by his findings were spurred to begin some questioning of their own.
Influence and Writings.
Being a public figure in his occupation, as well as a learned and reputable man within the Muslim religious community, Safdar Ali had a substantial amount of influence, and after his conversion he was active in Christian missionary efforts to the Muslim communities around him. He also wrote a few works about the conclusions of his study between Islam and Christianity. Much of his works have not been translated into English.
Some of his more influential and popular works are: "Ghizai Ruh", which consists of hymns and sacred songs; "Khallat Nama", which was a treatise regarding the issues of religious toleration; and "Niaz Namah" (currently only available in Urdu, the language in which it was originally written), which is a volume consisting of his letters that he wrote to his family shortly after his conversion explaining the reasons why he decided to abandon Islam as well as some refutations of popular arguments held against Christianity by Islamic theologians.
Ali also worked much with the Church Missionary Society after his conversion and he submitted several letters, papers, and treaties to help the missionary efforts in the regions that he was involved in. Some of these correspondences can be found in a journal entitled "Church Missionary Inteligencer".

Romanians in Hungary

At present, Romanians in Hungary constitute a small minority. According to the most recent 2011 Hungarian Census (based on self-determination), the population of Romanians was 35,641 or 0.3%, a significant increase from 8,482 or 0.1% of 2001. The community is concentrated in towns and villages close to the Romanian border, such as Battonya, Elek, Kétegyháza and Méhkerék and in the city of Gyula, and is also present in the capital, Budapest.
History.
Historically, a significant part of the modern Romanian lands belonged to Hungarian states.
Regardless of the subject of Romanian presence/non-presence in Transylvania prior to the Hungarian conquest (See Origin of the Romanians), the first written sources about Romanian settlements derive from the 13th century, record was written about Olahteluk village in Bihar county from 1283. The 'land of Romanians', Terram Blacorum (1222,1280) showed up in Fogaras and this area was mentioned under different name (Olachi) in 1285. The first appearance of a supposed Romanian name 'Ola' in Hungary derives from a charter (1258). They were significant population in Transylvania, Banat, Maramaros and Partium.
After the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary has become close to homogeneous ethnically, with only 10.4% minorities, of which 6.9% were Germans, and Romanians constituted about 0.3%. 
The numbers of Romanians in Hungary increased briefly with the onset of World War II when Hungary annexed parts of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. These annexations were affirmed under the Munich Agreement (1938), two Vienna Awards (1938 and 1940). In particular, the population of Northern Transylvania, according to the Hungarian census from 1941 counted 53.5% Hungarians and 39.1% Romanians.
After World War II the ethnic homogeneity of Hungary became even higher than during the interbellum, reaching over 99% by 1980 (see Demographics of Hungary for ethnic composition tables over time).

Sri Lankan diaspora

The Sri Lankan diaspora are Sri Lankan emigrants from Sri Lanka, and their descendants, that reside in a foreign country. They number a total estimated population of around 3 Million. The vast majority of the Sri Lankans abroad are Sri Lankan Tamils, followed by the Sinhalese.
Expatriate workers.
Expatriate workers to Sri Lankan have been a valuable export for the country. The number of expatriate workers have been ever growing as well as the remittances they send back. In 2009 Sri Lankans sent home US$3.3 billion a US$400 million increase from the year before. It is expected that 2010 would exceed US$4 billion. In mid-2010 there were more than 1.8 million Sri Lankan expatriate workers.
Diaspora experience.
Discrimination.
In Australia, under the White Australia policy, immigration was negligible. It resumed after the Second World War primarily involving migration of Burghers, who fulfilled the then criteria that they should be of predominantly European ancestry and that their appearance should be European. Sinhalese migration began in the 1960s but it was after the mid-1970s that large groups arrived, which also included Christians and Buddhists. Sri Lankan students undertook courses in Australia as part of the Colombo Plan prior to the formal dismantling of the White Australia policy, and after 1973, Sinhalese, Tamil and Moor migration resumed.
Assimilation.
The rate of assimilation among Sri Lankan Australians is fairly high: among second-generation immigrants, the 'in-marriage' rate was extremely low - 5.6% for women and 3.0% for men.
Distribution by continent.
Africa.
There is a considerable Sinhalese population is now living in Africa.
Americas.
Bermuda.
In 1979 there were only 6 Sri Lankans living in Bermuda. As of 2005 there are an estimated 400 living and working there.
Canada.
Sri Lankan Canadians include members from all ethnicities of Sri Lanka, they are mainly concentrated in the cities of Toronto and Montreal, in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. As of 2006 there are 103,625 Sri Lankans in Canada.
United States.
There are tens of thousands of Sri Lankans in the United States from all different backgrounds. In the 1990s the number was about 14,448, however this has grown significantly. Sri Lankan American communities are mainly situated in large metropolitan areas. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The Little Sri Lanka in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of the borough of Staten Island in New York City is one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.
Asia.
India.
There are an estimated 200,000 Sri Lankans in India, most of them being refugees. Nearly all of them are Sri Lankan Tamils but there are also a small amount of Sinhalese as well. Most Sri Lankans in India reside in and around the southern state of Tamil Nadu with some small populations in the big cites like Delhi and Chennai. The vast majority of the population however, mostly Sri Lankan Tamils, live in refugee camps due to the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Japan.
As of December 2001 there were 6,467 Sri Lankan nationals residing in Japan.
Malaysia and Singapore.
Ceylonese Tamils made up an overwhelming majority in the civil service of British Malaya and Singapore prior to independence. It was in Malaysia and Singapore, that the term Ceylonese and Jaffnese were popularly used by the Sri Lankan Tamils to differentiate themselves from the larger Malaysian Indian population who were predominantly of Tamil origin.
After the Pangkor Treaty of 1874, the British embarked upon the construction of roads, railways, schools, hospitals, and government offices in the Malay Peninsula, to develop the country and to increase its revenue. 
"It was to meet those early problems that Malaya looked to its older sister Ceylon for help and probably, the then Governor of the Straits Settlements secured the despatch to Perak of the 2nd division of the Ceylon Pioneer Corp. "So it fell to the Ceylonese to survey the railways and to build and man them, to be apothecaries in the hospitals, to be technical assistants to qualified engineers and to staff the clerical services on which an expanding government was bound increasingly to depend.
In Kuala Lumpur, the Ceylon Tamil population was mainly concentrated in Brickfields and Sentul because of the proximity of the Administrative Centre of the Malayan Railway (opposite the railway station) and the Sentul Workshop. The Government provided accommodation for the white and the blue collar workers in these areas. The Ceylon Tamils living in both these areas were devout Saivites and as they fervently believed that "no one should live in a place that has no Temple ", they soon began to organize themselve into Associations. This gave birth to the Sri Kandaswamy Kovil, Brickfields, which has become a landmark and tourist attraction in the city, showcasing Sri Lankan Tamil and Hindu architecture at its finest.
Many of the first Asian and non-white doctors and engineers in Malaya and Singapore were of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. The world's first Asian surgeon was Dr S.S. Thiruchelvam, a Malayan of Ceylonese Tamil origin.
Former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once said:
The Ceylonese community established many schools, banks, cultural societies, cooperatives and temples in Malaysia and Singapore. Some good examples would be the Jaffnese Cooperative Society, Vivekananda Ashrama and the Vivekananda Tamil School in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur.In 1958 The Malaysian Ceylonese Congress was established as a political party with the aim of giving support to the then Alliance party. MCC has continuously supported the Barisan Nasional and the Government. It was formed to promote and preserve the Political, Educational, Social and Cultural aspects of the Malaysian Ceylonese Community. To date MCC has seen six President's:
Today MCC makes its way in this ever changing globe under the dynamic leadership of Dato Dr NKS Tharmaseelan. After 50years of hibernation MCC has now become visible.It must also be noted that it was only on 27 February 2009 was MCC formally registered with the Malasian Election's Commission (SPR)[http://mcc.org.my]
Many Ceylonese were also involved in the independence movements in Malaya and Singapore. In Singapore, there are many current and past ministers who are of Ceylonese Tamil in origin and Tamil is a national language. Sinnathamby Rajaratnam was the former foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Singapore and regarded as one of the founding fathers of Singapore. His death in 2006 was marked with a state funeral by the government of Singapore. The Singapore flag was flown at half mast at all public buildings and former Prime Minister and friend Lee Kuan Yew cried when giving his eulogy.
Even today, the Sri Lankan community in Malaysia and Singapore is an upwardly mobile community taking up many professional and government posts. One of Malaysia's and South East Asia's richest men is billionaire Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan, who regularly makes it to "Forbes" magazine's billionaire list.
Middle East.
Sri Lankans generally go to the Middle East to find work. For Sri Lankans Saudi Arabia is the largest "unskilled and semi-skilled labour" importing country, ahead of Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
Israel.
There are approximately 7,500 Sri Lankans in Israel, as of 2011.
Lebanon.
There are approximately 80,000 to 90,000 Sri Lankans in Lebanon. There is a large domestic labour population in Lebanon.
Qatar.
In 2011 there are almost a 100,000 Sri Lankans living and working in Qatar.
Saudi Arabia.
As of 2007 there were approximately 400,000 Sri Lankans in Saudi Arabia. During January 2010 up till October 56,000 workers have left for Saudi Arabia, however thousands have runaway or escaped from their employers due to ill-treatment or when found that they had been duped by unscrupulous job agents.
United Arab Emirates.
There are an estimated population of over 300,000 they mostly form the country's large foreign labour force. Most expatriates from Sri Lanka, along with other immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, tend to be found in Dubai, although sizeable communities are existent in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Al-Ain and Ras al-Khaimah.
Europe.
Denmark.
Denmark has 13,396 Sri Lankans residing in its borders as of 2010. 10,803 are immigrants while 2,593 are Sri Lankan nationals.
France.
There are over 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils living in France.
In only 10 years, "Little Jaffna", located at the last stretch of the winding street of Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis in the 10th arrondissement, between metros Gare de Nord and La Chapelle, has sprung to life and begun to truly flourish. It is commonly mistakenly called by the average Parisian as Little Bombay. [http://www.parisfranceguide.com:81/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=41]
The vast majority of Parisian Tamils fled Sri Lanka as refugees in the 1980s, escaping the violent civil conflict. The French Prefecture was initially quite reluctant about granting asylum to Tamils. In 1987, the Office for the Protection of Refugees (OFPRA) gained in power and opened up a period of nearly systematic asylum. This liberal period eventually tapered off in the 90s as a result of new European measures designed against an influx in immigration. Today, there are about 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils living in France, of which the greatest number live in Paris. Little Jaffna is also famous for the annual chariot procession held during Ganesha Chathurthi. Both the area and event have become popular tourist attractions.
Germany.
There are about 60,000 Sri Lankans living in Germany. 
Religious fervor among Tamil Germans intensified as their numbers swelled. Due to the inspirational encouragement of Hawaii Subramaniaswami – the disciple of Yoga Swamigal – two well organized Hindu temples – Sidhivinayagar Kovil and the kamadchi Amman Kovil –have in place in the city of Hamm since 1984. According to the journal Hinduism Today, the youth are being well trained in their religion and culture at home and in weekend schools in rented halls using texts from Sri Lanka. They even wear Hindu symbols of Vibuthi and Tilakam. [http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=585]
The second, third Generations of Tamils have integrated very well into the German society contributing in all skilled professions. Tamils are known as Hard workers .The identity of Hindus can be seen in city Hamm where the Temple was built with 17 meter high Gopuram and the layout rebuild in Germany after Kamadchi-Ampal Temple in South India.
Italy.
It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Most Italian Sinhalese work as domestic workers. But they have also opened businesses such as restaurants, cleaning enterprises (e.g. Cooperativa Multietnica di Pulizie

Many Sinhalese have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. 
In the late 70's, Sinhalese Catholic women migrated to Italy to work in elderley homes. This was followed by a wave of Sinhalese migrants who worked for Italian entrepreneurs in the early 80s. Italy was often seen as a temporary destination, but many Sinhalese decided to settle there. Many Sinhalese have also illegally migrated to Italy, mainly through the Balkans and Austria.
Admission acts also encouraged more Sinhalese to migrate to Italy. For example, the Dini Decree in 1996 made it more easier for Sinhalese workers to bring their family to Italy. In Rome, Naples and Milan, the Sinhalese have built up "enlarged families", where jobs are exchanged among relatives and compatriots.
The Sinhalese prefer to send their children to English speaking countries for their education and consider Italian education mediocre.
The major organisation representing the Sinhalese in Italy is the Sri Lanka Association Italy.
The Sri Lanka - Italy Business Council - Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is an organisation is an organization in Italy for promoting investment, trade and joint venture between the two countries.
Netherlands.
In 2010 there were 10,346 Sri Lankans in the Netherlands, with just over 3,500 of them second generation Sri Lankans in the Netherlands. There are 5,500 men and a thousand less women.
Norway.
As of 1 January 2010 Statistics Norway recorded 13,772 Sri Lankans living in Norway, an increase of 339 from the year before. The capital city Oslo is home to about 7,000 Sri Lankans while Norways second largest city Bergen has about a thousand Sri Lankan residents.
Sweden.
Sweden has a Sri Lankan population of about 6,733 as of 2010. There were 2,948 men and 3,774 women.
Switzerland.
There are about 46,000 to 55,000 Swiss of Sri Lankan origin and Sri Lankan expatriates are living in Switzerland, with around 32,000 to 42,000 home to Sri Lanka Tamils.
United Kingdom.
Sri Lankans have been migrating to Britain for several generations, up from the time of British ruled Ceylon. They include Sri Lankans of all ethnicities and backgrounds and boasts a large population in the country. In 2001 the United Kingdom Census recorded 67,938 Sri Lankan-born UK residents, however the total population is estimated to be in the hundred thousands. Some government estimates go up to 500,000 residents. Most Sri Lankans live in London.
Oceania.
Australia.
The 2006 Census in Australia found that there were approximately 29,055 Sinhalese Australians (0.1 percent of the population). That was an addition of 8,395 Sinhalese Australians (a 40.6 percent increase) from the 2001 Census. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. This was 26 percent more in 2001, in which 58,602 Australia reported having Sinhalese ancestry. The census is counted by Sri Lankans who speak the Sinhalese language at home.
Because the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) uses Sinhalese as opposed to Sri Lankan as the category to define ancestry, it is hard to estimate the number of Tamil Sri Lankans currently living in Australia
New Zealand.
The early arrivals to came to New Zealand from what was then British Ceylon were a few prospectors attracted to the gold rushes. By 1874 there were a mere 33 New Zealand residents born in Ceylon.
The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand.
Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. Out of the Asians, the Sri Lankans were the most likely to hold a formal qualification and to work in white-collar occupations. Sri Lankans mainly worked in health professions, business and property services, and the retail and manufacturing sectors, in large numbers. Most lived in Auckland and Wellington, with smaller populations in Waikato, Manawatu, Canterbury and others.
Returning.
Sri Lankan expatriates have a low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka, even though many conitnue mainatin close ties with the home country.

W. S. Senior

Reverend Walter Stanley Senior (10 May 1876 – 23 February 1938) was an English scholar, poet and member of the Church Missionary Society. Popularly known as the "Bard of Lanka", his works are still widely read in the island nation. He was also Vice Principal of Trinity College, Kandy, Sri Lanka.
Early life.
Walter Stanley Senior was the son of Walter Senior, a clergyman. His uncle was Edward Senior, headmaster of Sheffield Royal Grammar School which he attended from 1888 to 1891. He continued his early education at Marlborough, a school to which he was deeply attached and about which he wrote both in prose and verse. From Marlborough he won a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. He took a First Class in Classical Honour Moderations (Intermediate examination) and a Second Class in Greats (classics or philosophy). He was the author of a work titled "Pisgah or The Choice", which won the triennial prize poem on a sacred subject in the University of Oxford, 1914.
Trinity College – The early years.
Reverend Senior came out to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1906, and served as Vice Principal of Trinity for a decade. When the then Principal of Trinity, Rev. A. G. Fraser, was looking for talent in the English Universities which he could enlist into service at Trinity College, Kandy, he came across Senior who formed one of a brilliant set of men, including the late Dr. Kenneth Saunders from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, N. P. Campbell, also a Balliol man, who was recognized as a great scientist, and J. P. R. Gibson, later Principal of Ridley Hall, Cambridge. In the absence of Rev Fraser, Senior also deputized as Acting Principal for a short period.
Trinity emerged as a public school with a scholastic reputation with the appointment of Mr. Senior. His earliest students included two University Scholars, Mr. L. M. D. de Silva, K.C., and Mr. J. L. C. Rodrigo, who succeeded him as Classical Lecturer at the University College. Many of his pupils adorned various walks of life but several times that number cherishes the memory of a beautiful character.
A little known fact during his stay is Kandy was his role in the marriage of Mr. George E De Silva, which was solemnized in 1909 at St. Paul's Church, Kandy. The marriage, to Miss. Agnes Nell from a very conservative Dutch family was opposed by many to the point that The Vicar refused to marry them, and it was left to Rev. W.S. Senior to solemnize the marriage.
A portrait of Rev Senior by David Paynter RA, OBE, also a Trinitian, hangs in the Trinity College Library.
Other work in Sri Lanka.
Rev Senior assumed duties as Vicar of Christ Church, Galle Face, in 1916 and continued in this post until 1919. Not only was he a great scholar and moulder of youth, but he was also an arresting preacher. The spirituality of his countenance and the beauty of his voice with its cultured tones enhanced the appeal of able thoughts and striking utterance. He was one of the pioneer slum-workers and carried on a mission in Slave Island for many years.
Mr. Senior’s interest in educational work prompted him to accept the post of first Registrar of the University College and lecturer in Classics, but the material aspects of office and security had no appeal whatever to a man of his fine sensibilities. He was also the personal tutor of James P Obeysekere, and lived with the family in Reid Avenue while teaching at University College.
Later Years and Death.
Having spent the greater part of his life in the service of Sri Lanka, his comparatively early death was due to rigorous tropical conditions undermining a not very robust frame. He retired to England, and one of his greatest desires, namely, to see Ceylon and some of his numerous friends before his death, was gratified when he was able to spend a short holiday in the Island two years before his death, (in 1936) already a very sick man who knew that the end was not far off.
Some of his decisions at the important cross-roads of his life could only have been taken by one who never lacked the courage of his convictions. A career in government service with the prospect of a pension before him were no deterrents to the simple notion that he would like to live with his wife and children. But always there was at his heart-strings a tug towards the land of his adoption.
In a letter to a friend, written a few months before his death, he said: “The idea has come to me that I should like my ashes, for I contemplate cremation rather than burial, to be interred in St. Andrew’s Churchyard, Haputale.” His gravestone at St Andrew’s is a testament to his life, bearing the plain legend "He Loved Ceylon" preceded by the opening lines from his poem, "Lanka from Pidurutalagala": "Here I stand in spirit, as in body once I stood Long years ago, in love with all the land, This peerless land of beauty’s plenitude". The pulpit of the Trinity College Chapel is dedicated to his name.
Family.
Rev Senior Married Miss Ethel May Poole, daughter of Bishop Poole – the first Church of England Bishop in Japan – in 1907. He had two sons one of whom was a member of the African Civil Service, and two daughters.
Writing.
Senior was a fine classical scholar with a remarkable gift for conveying his own enthusiasm for the best in literature to those who were privileged to be his students. In the opinion of good judges he was the best English poet Sri Lanka has produced – for though he wrote when at Marlborough and Balliol, his best work was done in Sri Lanka and for Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). A book of his verse was published under the title "Vita Magistra" (1937). A common vein in many of his finest pieces is an appreciation of the diversity and beauty that is Sri Lanka.
Rev Senior also has the distinction of being the author of the famous "Hymn for Ceylon" as well as the Hymn of Trinity College, Kandy and that of St. John’s College, Jaffna. His best known work however is the soul-stirring epic titled "The Call of Lanka", which many consider to be arguably the finest poem dealing with Sri Lanka ever written.
Selected Works.
The Call of Lanka
I climbed o’er the crags of Lanka
And gazed on the golden sea
When out from her ancient places,
Her soul came forth to me;
"Give me a bard,” said Lanka,
“A bard of the things to be.”
“My cities are laid in ruins,
Their courts through the jungle spread,
My scepter is long departed
And the stranger lord instead.
Yet, give me a bard,” said Lanka.
“I am living, I am not dead.”
“For high in my highland valleys,
And low in my lowland plains,
The pride of the past is pulsing
Hot in a people’s veins.
Give me a bard,” said Lanka,
“A bard for my joys and pains.”
I offer a voice O Lanka,
I, child of an alien Isle;
For my heart has heard thee and kindled,
Mine eyes have seen thee and smiled;
Take, foster mother, and use it,
‘Tis but for a little while.
For, surely of thine own children,
Born of thy womb, shall rise
The bard of the moonlit jungle,
The bard of the tropic skies,
Warm from his mother’s bosom,
Bright from his mother’s eyes.
He shall hymn thee of hoar Sri Pada,
The peak that is lone and tall.
He shall sing with her crags, Dunhinda,
The smoking waterfall.
Whatsoever is fair in Lanka,
He shall know it and love it all.
He shall sing thee of sheer Sigiriya,
Of Minneria’s wandering kine;
He shall sing of the lake and the lotus,
He shall sing of the rock-hewn shrine,
Whatsoever is old in Lanka,
Shall live in his Lordly line.
But most shall he sing of Lanka
In the bright new days that come.
When the races all have blended
And the voice of strife is dumb
When we leap to a single bugle,
March to a single drum.
March to a mighty purpose,
One man from shore to shore;
The stranger, becomes a brother,
The task of the tutor o’er,
When the ruined city rises
And the palace gleams once more.
Hark! Bard of the fateful future,
Hark! Bard of the bright to be;
A voice on the verdant mountains,
A voice by the golden sea.
Rise, child of Lanka, and answer
Thy mother hath called to thee.
A Hymn for Ceylon
Jehovah, Thou hast promised 
The isles shall wait for Thee; 
The joyous isles of Ocean, 
The jewels of the sea ;
Lo ! we, this island's watchmen, 
Would give and take no rest, 
(For thus hast Thou commanded,) 
Till our dear land be blessed.
Then bless her, mighty Father, 
With blessings needed most, 
In every verdant village, 
By every palmy coast ;
On every soaring mountain 
O er every spreading plain. 
May all her sons and daughters 
Thy righteousness attain.
Give peace within her borders, 
Twixt man and man goodwill, 
The love all unsuspicious, 
The love that works no ill;
In loyal, lowly service 
Let each from other learn, 
The guardian and the guarded, 
Till Christ Himself return.
To Him our land shall listen, 
To Him our land shall kneel, 
All rule be on His shoulder. 
All wrong beneath His heel;
Oh consummation glorious, 
Which now by faith we sing; 
Come, cast we up the highway 
That brings us back the King.
Farewell to Lanka "(an excerpt from Rev Senior's last poem)"
I pass, but Thou, forever Thou remainest, 
Lord yet to-be of all the lure of Lanka, 
Blood from her heart, high Blossom of the ages. 
O Star; O Sun of all the magic distance, 
All the green palm-lands setting into Ocean. 
All the far dream-blue diadem of mountains. 
All the lone mares of pelican and egret; 
Kingly unrippled Nuwara Wewa watching. 
Silver itself, Mahinda’s ridge of silver. 
All the high rocks, the forest-ruin rising, 
Storied and still, throughout a marvel-isle 
From Trincomalee to Tissamaharama: 
Kindling all these, by these to passion kindled, 
Deep to their deep, a death-less Music calling, 
Mould thou the songs that mould a noble people. 
Peace shall be Thine; but mine is holy torment. 
Knowing I know not half the lore of Lanka 
Land of heart’s longing
Goodbye
So you’ve had enough of the tropics, and the back is growing bent 
And the heart is not so buoyant, and it’s time you packed and went 
You’re tired of wayside squatters, you’re tired of the spitting host 
Of the fatal red on the pavement, of the chunam white on the post 
Of the food that does not feed you, of the breeze that does not brace 
Of the lawless platform lawyer all out to scratch your face 
And the friends you had are all scattered, the friends who cared and knew 
And a newer race is rising with never a use for you 
And — yes you’re tired of the Tropics and you’d better pack and go 
To the haunts and the hearths of the homeland, to the fields and folk you know 
Yet, o my soul remember, when you’ve sailed the seas away 
And the English climate’s chilly and the English clouds are gray 
When the birds are sad and silent, and the sun is seldom seen 
And life is miles of houses with miles of mud between 
You will see in a sudden vision, you will see with a sudden sigh 
The scarlet splashed flamboyant awash in the azure sky 
You will see Anuradhapura and the old kings’ bathing pool 
And the shadowy blue king-fisher, the carven granite cool 
And the pass of Haputale and the lowland flat and far 
And through Gravillea feathers, the rosy evening star 
And the moon-besilvered jungle, the dipping magic cross 
Mid steady balm in-blowing from the silver foam and floss 
And better than places — faces, the Aryan face (your own) 
With its brown and olive beauty, the youths and maids you’ve known 
And the tender pearl of India in the black and brilliant eye 
My soul, you will break with longing — it can never be Goodbye.

Silent stroke

A silent stroke is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms associated with stroke, and the patient is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms a silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent strokes typically cause lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. The risk of silent stroke increases with age but may also affect younger adults. Women appear to be at increased risk for silent stroke, with hypertension and current cigarette smoking being amongst the predisposing factors.
These types of strokes include lacunar and other ischemic strokes and minor hemorrhages. They may also include leukoaraiosis (changes in the white matter of the brain): the white matter is more susceptible to vascular blockage due to reduced amount of blood vessels as compared to the cerebral cortex. These strokes are termed "silent" because they typically affect "silent" regions of the brain that do not cause a noticeable change in an afflicted person’s motor functions such as contralateral paralysis, slurred speech, pain, or an alteration in the sense of touch. A silent stroke typically affects regions of the brain associated with various thought processes, mood regulation and cognitive functions and is a leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment and may also lead to a loss of urinary bladder control.
In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population study conducted among 3,660 adults over the age of 65, 31% showed evidence of silent stroke in neuroimaging studies utilizing MRI. These individuals were unaware they had suffered a stroke. It is estimated that silent strokes are five times more common than symptomatic stroke.
A silent stroke differs from a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In TIA symptoms of stroke are exhibited which may last from a few minutes to 24 hours before resolving. A TIA is a risk factor for having a major stroke and subsequent silent strokes in the future.
Risk factors.
There are various individual risk factors associated with having a silent stroke. Many of these risk factors are the same as those associated with having a major symptomatic stroke.
Neuropsychological deficits.
Individuals who have had silent strokes often have various neuropsychological deficits and have significant impairment in multiple areas of cognitive performance. One study has shown an association between silent stroke and a history of memory loss and lower scores on tests of cognitive function. In a second study, individuals who have a had a silent stroke scored lower on the mini–mental state examination (MMSE) and on Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices—a test designed for children aged 5 through 11 years, mentally and physically impaired individuals, and elderly people.
In children.
Children who have suffered silent strokes often have a variety of neuropsychological deficits. These deficits may include lowered I.Q., learning disabilities, and an inability to focus.
Silent strokes are the most common form of neurologic injury in children with sickle cell anemia, who may develop subtle neurocognitive deficits in the areas of attention and concentration, executive function, and visual-motor speed and coordination due to silent strokes which may not have been detected on physical examination.
Link to depression.
Major depression is a risk factor and also a consequence of silent brain infarction (SBI). Persons who present with symptoms of presenile and senile major depression showed a markedly higher incidence of SBI (65.9% and 93.7%). Individuals with major depression who have had an SBI present with more marked neurological deficits and more severe depressive symptoms than do those without SBI.
Diagnosis.
The diagnosis of a silent stroke is usually made as an incidental finding (by chance) of various neuroimaging techniques. Silent strokes may be detected by:
Prevention.
"See main article: Stroke prevention"
Preventive measures that can be taken to avoid sustaining a silent stroke are the same as for stroke. Smoking cessation is the most immediate step that can be taken, with the effective management of hypertension the major medically treatable factor.
In children with sickle cell anemia.
Transfusion therapy lowers the risk for a new silent stroke in children who have both abnormal cerebral artery blood flow velocity, as detected by transcranial Doppler, and previous silent infarct, even when the initial MRI showed no abnormality. A finding of elevated TCD ultrasonographic velocity warrants MRI of the brain, as those with both abnormalities who are not provided transfusion therapy are at higher risk for developing a new silent infarct or stroke than are those whose initial MRI showed no abnormality.

Botswana Ground Force

The Botswana Ground Force is the army of the country of Botswana, and the land component of the Botswana Defence Force.
History.
The Botswana Defence Force was raised in April 1977 by an Act of Parliament called the 'BDF Act NO 13 of 1977. At its formation, Lieutenant General Mompati Merafhe (now retired and Vice President of the Republic of Botswana) became its first Commander. The current President of the Republic of Botswana, Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, then Brigadier, was the Deputy Commander. 
Unusually for an African military force, and chiefly attributable to its being founded after Botswana's independence, the Botswana Ground Force was not formed from colonial units formed by a colonising power, but rather were formed from the remains of the Botswana Mounted Police Unit, previously known as the Bechuanaland Mounted Police, a unit of the British South Africa Police.
The contemporary roles of the Defence Force are broad for a conventional military, suggesting that the government of Botswana and the BDF subscribe to a wide view of ‘security’ and consider the Defence Force an appropriate agency for attaining much of it, an issue that has been discussed even in the BDF’s own internal media. It is expected that the BDF in general is meant to be an apolitical instrument of the state.
The current stated mission of the Botswana Ground Force is:
To defend the country and provide for the security of Botswana, participate in external security cooperation activities, and contribute in domestic support operations, with the aim of:
Structure and organisation.
The commander-in-chief of the BGF is Ian Khama, the current President of Botswana. Answering to him are the Minister of Defence, Justice, and Security, Dikgakgamatso Seretse, and the Defence Council, and the Commander of the Botswana Defence Force, Lieutenant General Tebogo Masire.
The various units of the Botswana Ground Force are as follows:
Ranks and insignia.
The BGF and the Botswana Air Force maintain the same rank system, which is loosely based on British or Commonwealth rank systems. The ranks are as follows:
Enlisted:
Officers:
Equipment and vehicles.
The BDF uses a wide array of modern weapons and vehicles. Its suppliers are Russia and Western nations, including Israel, Switzerland, the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
Armoured vehicles.
Note: 54 Leopard 1A3 tanks were apparently under negotiation for purchase from the Netherlands in 1996, but the deal never went through and no tanks were delivered.

Background.
Marth was born January 28, 1880 in Wausau, the son of Louis and Ottilia (Ramthun) Marth, and attended the local public schools until dropping out at age 15 to go to work (although he continued studies at a business college at night). He worked his way up to become a chef and restaurateur in Wisconsin and neighboring states. He became also active in the labor movement and acted as a labor organizer for various unions.
Politics.
After long activity in Marathon County politics, and election to the Wisconsin Socialist Party executive committee, Marth was first elected to the State Assembly's second Marathon County district by a three-to-one margin in a special election in January 1918 to succeed Republican D. S. Burnett (who had resigned to enter military service). At the November general election he was re-elected, with 1883 votes to 1313 for Republican Fred Paulus, 1203 for Democrat George Merisette, and 40 for independent F. A. Wilcox. He served on the Committee on Taxation.
In 1920, after narrowly losing a hard-fought race for mayor of Wausau by 246 votes in September, Marth was defeated for re-election to the Assembly by Republican Lewis H. Cook, who received 5084 votes, to 3204 for Marth and 1100 for Democrat Kurt Beyreis. He continued to serve on the executive committee of the Wisconsin Socialist Party until 1935, and remained an outspoken Socialist his whole life.
Personal life.
On April 7, 1915, Marth was married in Wausau to Laura Tank. Together they had three sons. Marth died at the age of 90 at his home on March 11, 1970. He is buried in Pine Grove Cemetery in Wausau.

Kim Schneider

Kim Schneider (born August 21, 1984 in Regina, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian curler from Kronau, Saskatchewan. She currently skips her own team.
Career.
Juniors.
Schneider grew up in the small village of Kronau, Saskatchewan outside of Regina. She and her sister and teammate Tammy were the daughters of 1990 provincial champion lead Larry Schneider.
In 2003 and 2004, Schneider played in the Saskatchewan junior championships, but never won.
2005-2012.
After juniors, Schneider teamed up with Amber Holland, along with her sister Tammy Schneider and Heather Kalenchuk.
In 2008, the team won their only Grand Slam event, the 2008 Players' Championships.
In 2009 the team would earn a spot in the Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, after defeating Marie-France Larouche in the C Qualifier. The team would finish round robin with a 4-3 record, tied for third place. They would lose the second tiebreaker to Krista McCarville in an extra end.
Together the team played in their first Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts in 2008 and again in 2009. They would not find success until the 2010 Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts, when they would finally break through and represent Saskatchewan at the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. They would miss the playoffs, finishing with a 6-5 record. The team would repeat as Saskatchewan champions in 2011. At the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the team would finish round robin first with a 9-2 and advance to the playoffs. They would lose the 1-2 game to team Canada, before winning the semi-final, over team Ontario. In the final, they would again face team Canada (Jennifer Jones), and this time would come out victorious, stealing the win in the 10th end, winning the Canadian Championship. This was the first time since 1997, that a team from Saskatchewan would win the National Championship. Together the team would win a silver medal at the 2011 Capital One World Women's Curling Championship.
Returning to the Scotties in 2012, the team was looking to repeat and win their second Canadian Championship, however they would finish the tournament with a disappointing 6-5 round robin record, failing to reach the playoffs. This was the first time since 2008, Team Canada did not reach the playoffs.
After seven years of playing with her Canadian Championship winning team, Holland announced that she would leave her squad. Holland told her team she wants to go in another direction. Heather Kalenchuk has since decided to step away from the game for a few years, leaving Kim and her sister Tammy Schneider pondering their curling future. This departure by Holland left the four players ineligible for $72,000 worth of federal funding earned from winning the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, and they will forfeit their spot earned in the Olympic Curling Pre-Trials.
2012-current.
Following the break up of the Holland team, Schneider would team up with Deanna Doig, playing third for a new squad consisting of Colleen Ackerman and Michelle McIvor.
Personal life.
Schneider is a recreation therapist.

<doc id="30990371" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30990371" title="Hotel amenity">
Hotel amenity

A hotel amenity is something of a premium nature provided in addition to the room and its basics when renting a room at a hotel, motel, or other place of lodging. The amenities provided in each hotel vary. In some places of lodging, certain amenities may be standard with all rooms. In others, they may be optional for an additional cost.
In the room.
Kitchen facilities.
Some places of lodging offer kitchen facilities to enable guests to cook and/or store food. In some hotels, this may be in the form of a kitchenette. It may include a full-size or half-size refrigerator, an oven, a stove, and possibly some cabinets. This is common in extended stay hotels.
Other places may include just a refrigerator (often half-sized) and/or a microwave oven. When both are included, it is often marketed as a "microfridge."
Coffeemakers are also often found in rooms.
Hotels that offer no kitchen facilities in guest rooms sometimes provide them in the lobby for all guests to use.
Television.
A television set is a standard item in most hotel rooms. In the past, coin-operated pay TVs existed. Currently, standard TV channels are free to watch, but some lodging facilities charge extra for cable or satellite TV services that are offered.
With the advent of portable video through mobile and tablet devices, hotels have had a harder time generating revenue with their in room televisions.
Internet access.
Most places of lodging currently offer internet access in some form. Most common is wi-fi, which can be used by guests who bring their own computers in their rooms. In most hotels, this is free, though some charge a fee.
Some hotels offer hard-wired internet service requiring the use of a cable for the hook-up. 
Some hotels also provide computers in the lobby for all guests to use, or more rarely, in each guest room. Recently, more hotels are offering in room tablet computers for guests to use.
Personal items.
Many personal items are provided complimentary for use by guests. These may include irons and ironing boards, hair dryers, soap, shampoo, mouthwash, or shower caps. A current trend in personal items in the United States is to focus on American-made toiletries, such as those made by William Roam, given a perception by guests that foreign-made amenities are not as desirable. For example, in 2007 hotel amenity provider Gilchrist & Soames, which sources products in China and other foreign countries, was forced to recall Chinese-manufactured toothpaste sold under the Gilchrist & Soames brand, because the toothpaste was contaminated with poisonous diethylene glycol. Not all items are provided by all hotels; for example, some hotels do not provide toothpaste.
Hair dryer.
In some hotels, a hair dryer is offered for guests use.
Towels.
Hotels generally provide towels to guests for their use. 
One concern with the provision of towels is theft. Towel theft has proven costly to hotels, though hotels have been reported to do little to combat the problem. In 2003, Holiday Inn offered amnesty to those who returned stolen towels.
Hotels have begun to outfit their towels with RFID technology to reduce the frequency of theft.
Outside the room.
Dining.
Various forms of dining are offered in various places of lodging. Some hotels offer a continental breakfast that is often complimentary to guests. Items often served include cereal, pastries, waffles, sausage, fruits, and beverages.
Some hotels have on-site restaurants. In most cases, the meals must be paid for. In some hotels, room service is available to guests.
Some resorts are all inclusive, allowing guests access to food at little or no charge at all times of day throughout their visits.
Vending.
Vending machines are provided at many hotels and motels. These machines usually sell soft drinks, snacks, and other items commonly sold in vending machines.
Ice dispensers are also standard. While in some hotels, the ice may be complimentary, there may be a fee to obtain ice in others.
Exercise.
Some hotels have fitness centers allowing guests to work out during their visits here. A recent trend at some upscale properties, has seen some of the exercise and fitness programs held outdoors.
Recreation.
Many resorts offer various recreational activities, such as golf, tennis, and other popular sports.
Swimming pools.
Some hotels offer swimming pools to their guests. Outdoor pools may be open seasonally in temperate climates. Indoor pools can be open year round in any climate.

Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup

The Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup was a professional wrestling memorial event produced by the Pro Wrestling Unplugged (PWU) promotion, which took place on October 20, 2006, at Viking Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The show was held in honor of the deceased members of The Pitbulls (Anthony Durante) and The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge), both popular tag teams during the early years of Extreme Championship Wrestling, and featured some of the top tag teams on the independent circuit in an 8-team tournament. In keeping with ECW tradition, all matches were no-countout/no-disqualification. Twelve professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card, with three including championships.
All Money Is Legal (K-Murda and K-Pusha) won the tournament by winning three matches at the event. Over the course of the evening, they defeated The S.A.T. (Joel and Jose Maximo) in the quarter-finals, The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid) in the semi-finals and The Rottweilers (Homicide and Ricky Reyes) in the final match. Tod Gordon and Gary Wolfe, the sole surviving member of The Pitbulls, presented the 7-foot trophy to All Money Is Legal following their victory. K-Murda and K-Pusha were joined in the ring by The Backseat Boyz and The S.A.T. who congratulated the winners by lifting them on to their shoulders while The Public Enemy's theme music played in the background.
Several other matches were held at the event in addition to the tournament. The main event was a standard wrestling match for the PWU Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Devon Moore, and the challenger, Azrieal, in which Azrieal won by countout. The undercard also featured Corporal Robinson successfully defending the PWU Hardcore Championship in three consecutive matches with victories over Aramis, KC Blade and Pete Hunter. The other match was for the PWU Unified Women's Intergender Championship, in which Mercedes Martinez successfully defended the belt in an intergender match against Detox and was awarded the match via disqualification.
A number of websites have given the show positive reviews; 411mania.com rated the event a 6.0 and OnlineWorldofWrestling.com a 7.5 out of 10. Brett Schwan of WrestlingClothesline.com called the event "a very enjoyable DVD".
Results.
October 20, 2006 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Viking Hall)
Tournament brackets.
The tournament took place between April 13 and June 19, 1994. The tournament brackets were:
1. Mark Briscoe was injured during the quarter-final match when his brother Jay accidentally hit him in the face with a steel chair. It was later announced that several of Mark's teeth had been knocked out and had to be taken to the hospital. Jay chose to continue the tournament with Joker, however, his new tag team partner turned on him allowing The Rotweillers to advance to the final.

Kuwaiti protests (2011–2012)

The Kuwaiti protests refers to the series of 2011-2012 demonstrations for government reforms in the state of Kuwait. In November 2011, the government of Kuwait resigned in response to the protests, making Kuwait one of several countries affected by the Arab Spring to experience major governmental changes due to unrest. The protests began with stateless people (Bedoon).
Timeline.
Stateless protests (Early 2011).
Sabah Al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, gave every Kuwaiti citizen 1,000 dinars (3580 $) and a free food grant for one year on 18 January 2011, officially to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Kuwait's liberation from occupying Iraqi forces during the First Gulf War, as well as the 50th anniversary of the state's independence. But the grant was not extended to the stateless Bedoun living in Kuwait. Dozens demonstrated in Kuwait City on 19 February against their supposed second-class status. Opposition leaders called for further protests in March to pressure Prime Minister Nasser Al-Sabah to resign.
Stateless people continued to protest into January 2012 despite a protest ban, turning out on 13 and 14 January in slums near Kuwait City to call for the right to citizenship. On both days, violence broke out, with riot police clashing with stateless demonstrators and arresting several dozen on 13 January and firing tear gas to disperse rally-goers on 14 January.
Riot police on 2 October used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse hundreds of stateless demonstrators who were demanding citizenship. Witnesses and activists said at least three people, including a policeman, were slightly wounded and 10 stateless were arrested as security forces laid a siege on Taima suburb in Al Jahra which houses tens of thousands of stateless. The new protest comes a week after three international human rights groups sent an unprecedented letter to Emir Al-Sabah urging him to end alleged abuse against stateless people.
Political protests (Mid 2011-2012).
On the night of 16 November, demonstrators and several opposition MPs stormed the National Assembly, briefly occupying it while singing and shouting slogans calling for Prime Minister Nasser Al-Sabah to step down. They left after several minutes to rally in the adjacent Al-Erada Square, although riot police attacked several protesters with nightsticks when a smaller group split off and tried to charge the prime minister's residence.
Shortly after the Constitutional Court declared on June 2012 that the February 2012 National Assembly election were "illegal" and reinstated the previous pro-government parliament, thousands of Kuwaitis rally in Al-Erada Square on 26 June to protests against a court ruling that dissolved the opposition-dominated parliament. Demonstrators chanted "we will not surrender", while a prominent opposition MP called for a constitutional monarchy. On 27 August, around 3,000 people, mainly men in traditional Kuwaiti dress, gathered opposite parliament at Al-Erada Square to protest changes to the electoral law which they said could harm the prospects of opposition lawmakers in upcoming elections.
Around 1,500 Kuwaitis took part in a rally late on 10 September to protest against possible changes in the electoral law and call for more democracy. The crowd, which included opposition lawmakers and political activists, gathered outside parliament in a square which has hosted several anti-government demonstrations since late last year. However, the turnout was smaller than previous rallies in the major oil producer and there was only a light police presence.
Thousands of Kuwait opposition supporters rallied on 24 September, a day ahead where the Constitutional Court is scheduled to rule on next day if the electoral constituency law is in line with the constitution based on a request submitted by the government last month. Around 10,000 people, who filled the seaside square opposite the parliament building, cheered loudly as opposition figures called for an elected government and warned against what they called a politicised ruling. The next day, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Gulf emirate's electoral constituency law was in line with the constitution, rejecting a government appeal. Dozens of opposition activists who were in the court room hailed the verdict and exchanged congratulations.
On 15 October, Kuwaiti security forces detained at least five people, including the son of a prominent opposition figure, at an anti-government protest against possible changes to an election law. Several people were hurt in skirmishes at the rally, attended by at least 3,000 people who defied a request by authorities to cancel the Monday night demonstration. In some of the strongest remarks by an opposition figure, former lawmaker Musallam Al-Barrak appealed directly to Kuwaiti Emir to avoid "autocratic rule". His speech to the crowd contained extremely rare criticism of the ruler, "In the name of the nation, in the name of the people, we will not let you, your Highness, practice autocratic rule," Barrak told the rally in a speech addressed to the emir, drew repeated chants of "we will not let you, we will not let you" from the crowd. Analysts said his remarks, including the criticism of the emir could spark a strong reaction from the authorities. The son of Ahmed Al-Sadoun, another prominent opposition leader and former parliament speaker, was among those detained during the protest near parliament where several anti-government demonstrations have taken place in the past year.
After the 1 December elections which were won by pro-government candidates due to boycotts by the opposition, hundreds of opposition supporters demonstrated in various areas of Kuwait late on 6 December to demand scrapping the newly elected national assembly. Night demonstrations were staged in at least four areas of the state and that riot police used teargas and stun grenades to disperse the protesters. Activists clashed with police on the next day as they took to the streets in at least eight areas of the Gulf state. Thousands then demonstrated on 8 December to demand dissolving the new elected parliament.
Response.
Domestic.
On 18 October 2012, former MP Bader al-Dahum was taken into police custody. Khaled al-Tahus, also a former MP, was summoned for questioning by the prosecution service. Later, a group of around 500 people gathered outside the Justice Palace late Thursday night to protest against the detention of the former lawmakers. On the same day, Kuwait's Al-Sabah royal family issued a rare statement calling for "obedience" to the government. The three former lawmakers were all later released on bail on 23 October. Local media reported on 24 October that authorities have banned gatherings of more than 20 people.
Opposition lawmaker Musallam Al-Barrak was arrested by Kuwaiti authorities on the night of 29 October following a news conference at his house where he called on the government to abide by the constitution. Activists says that his arrest could impact for the further protests, which demonstrators has vowed to stage another protest on 4 November. He was freed after an appeal although he remains under investigation. Another opposition figure, former Islamist MP Faisal Al-Muslim, has been summoned for questioning on 31 October. On 3 November, the Kuwaiti newspaper "Al-Anbaa" quoted a security source saying that authorities may call in the army to help security forces stop a march called by the opposition for the next day, shortly after the government vowed to use force if necessary.
There were allegations that Jordanian forces had been deployed to assist in quelling protests in Kuwait. However, the Jordanian government denies this, saying the reports were "fabricated" and "not worthy of comment."

St. Nicholas of Myra Church (Manhattan)

The St. Nicholas of Myra Church is an American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese (ACROD) church dedicated to Saint Nicholas, located at 288 East 10th Street, on the corner of Avenue A in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, across from Tompkins Square Park.
The church was built in 1883 as the Memorial Chapel of St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, designed in Gothic Revival style by James Renwick, Jr. – who also designed Grace Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral – and W. H. Russell. The chapel was a gift of Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, a descendant of the Dutch governor Peter Stuyvesant, in memory of his wife.
The church later became the Holy Trinity Slovak Lutheran Church, and then, in 1925, the ACROD rented it for use as the Church of St. Nicholas of Myra, and bought it outright in 1937. The church draws its parishioners from the tri-state area: New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
