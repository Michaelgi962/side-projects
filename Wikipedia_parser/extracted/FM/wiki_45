Samuel Taylor Suit

Samuel Taylor Suit (1830–1888) was a Maryland politician and landowner. Suit was born in Bladensburg, Maryland, the son of innkeeper Fielder Suit. At age 14 he left home and traveled first to Keokuk, Iowa, and then to Louisville, Kentucky. In Kentucky Suit became involved in distilling whiskey, eventually owning a distillery and making his fortune. During this time he became a Kentucky colonel and was known as Colonel Suit from that time onward. While in Kentucky he married his first wife, Sarah Ebenezer Williams, who bore one child, then died at the age of 20.
In August 1862 Suit donated a set of regimental flags to the Chicago Board of Trade, which were presented to what became the First Board of Trade Regiment, or 72nd Illinois Infantry. The flags were labeled "Presented by S T Suit, of Louisville KY, to the First Board of Trade Regiment", and were carried by the regiment through the war, it is believed they were burned in the Chicago Fire. 
Suit left Louisville and moved to New York City, where he obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. In New York he met Aurelia Wilmarth, daughter of Home Life Insurance Company of New York president Arthur Wilmarth, and they were married in 1859. A son was born in 1861, but the marriage proved contentious. Suit apparently joined the Union army during the American Civil War, but the honorific "Colonel" derived from his tenure in Kentucky.
In 1867, Suit moved back to Maryland with his family, and purchased a more than estate near Washington, D.C.. The property, which became known as Suitland, is now the town of Suitland, Maryland. Suit set up a new distillery nearby under the name "S.T. Suit" and invested in railroads. The estate was visited by U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, and was the scene of negotiations to settle the Alabama Claims. 
From 1873 to 1877 Suit was a Maryland state senator. In 1876 the Suitland mansion was destroyed by fire, causing Suit to declare bankruptcy. While Suit recovered his properties and finances, the Suitland house was never rebuilt. In 1878 Aurelia left, and they were divorced by 1879.
At about this time, Suit met Rosa Pelham at the spa in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia. She was the daughter of U.S. Representative Charles Pelham of Alabama. They were married in 1883, when Samuel was 51 and Rosa was 22. They soon had three children.
The Suits were regular visitors to Berkeley Springs. In 1885, they started construction of their own private residence there: the Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage or "Berkeley Castle".
Suit died in 1888, at his residence on New Jersey Avenue in Washington. He is buried in St. Barnabas Cemetery, Oxon Hill, Maryland
"Berkeley Castle" was not complete at the time of Samuel's death, but Rosa completed the house in the 1890s. She sold the Suitland estate in 1902 to pay debts. The castle was sold in 1913.

Jury strut

__NOTOC__
The jury struts on a monoplane are small subsidiary struts that join the main wing struts to the wing.
Jury struts are installed to eliminate unwanted resonance and vibration from the main wing struts and also to prevent main strut compression buckling under negative-g loads in the case of high-wing aircraft. They are commonly installed on braced high-wing monoplanes, but are also used on braced low-wing aircraft, where they provide extra positive g-capabilities.
Jury struts come in many configurations. On monoplanes with one main strut, they may be just a single tube that connects that strut to the wing surface. On braced monoplanes with 'V' struts, they may brace both struts to the wing surface and also provide an interconnecting tube between the two jury struts to form a jury strut assembly.

Kalishankar (2007 Bengali film)

Kalishankar ()is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Prashanta Nanda. The film is starring Prasenjit Chatterjee, Anu Chowdhury, Anuvab Mohanty, Jishu Sengupta, Ashish Vidyarthi, Swastika Mukherjee and Victor Banerjee. This Bengali-Oriya film is a remake of Rakesh Roshan's blockbuster "Karan Arjun" on the theme of reincarnation. Director Prashant Nanda has turned the story around. Instead of being the story of the offsprings (played by Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan in the original) this is the story a pair of grandchildren and their grandfather's revenge on their wrongdoers. He play the grandfather, naturally. The film has a lot of stick-wielding action. Shoma A. Chatterji of www.screenindia.com commented that this movie is Manmohan Desai wine in Bengali bottle.Kali-Shankar is the similarity with old Manmohan Desai films wherein brothers separated in childhood grow up to find themselves on two sides of the fence. Then, when they recognise their blood link through a birthmark or a talisman, they join forces to fight the enemy together.
Plot.
Kali, Shankar and Tithi are the three motherless children of the acting priest of a local Krishna temple in an anonymous small town/village in West Bengal. The local MLA Debu Soren’s henchmen kill their father because he insists on standing witness in court against a murder committed at Soren’s behest. Kali, the elder brother, kills the corrupt lawyer as he walks out of the courtroom after the judge has delivered his judgement. Kali goes to jail for ten years. Shankar meets with a freak accident and is brought up by a local Muslim fakir. But the accident has left him with a memory loss and a penchant for violence. He grows up to be one of Debu Soren’s favourite henchmen. The little girl Tithi, who is picked off the streets by the maid of Debu’s mistress, grows up to become a wayward girl on the verge of turning alcoholic.
After ten long years, Kali is released. He returns to the temple to meet his grandfather who was away when Kali’s father was killed. The grandfather, a temple priest, encourages the grandson to avenge his father’s death. Kali, Shankar and Tithi are united and from then on, it is one long chain networking of maramari, dishoom-dishoom, blood and gore and the killing of the criminals one after the other in the same way their father was killed - by electric shock. The two young men come home to roost and it is one big happy family in the temple with their two girlfriends pitching in and Tithi hoping to tie the knot with the handsome young police officer.

GNoSR Classes X and Y

The GNoSR Classes X and Y were two similar classes of 0-4-2T steam locomotives built by Manning Wardle for the Great North of Scotland Railway. The two classes were similar, and were used throughout their lives to shunt on the docks at Aberdeen. They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 grouping, and received the LNER classification Z5. The class X were later reclassified Z4.
History.
When the Aberdeen Harbour Commissioners finally agreed to allow steam locomotives to replace horses on the Aberdeen docks, the GNoSR purchased two 0-4-2T locomotives from Manning Wardle for the purpose. These were designated Class Y and numbered 114 and 115. On delivery these were found to be 2 tons over the maximum weight for operating on the docks, and a further two locomotives of similar design were acquired. These Class X locomotives, numbered 116 and 117, had smaller driving wheels and a shorter wheelbase. In order to reduce the weight of the Class Y locos, they initially operated with their tanks only partially filled.
Both classes remained almost unchanged throughout their working lives which involved working the long branch from Kittybrewster to Waterloo Docks in Aberdeen, local trips, and hire to nearby industry. They remained in the GNoSR livery of black with red and yellow lining until painted unlined black during World War 2, although they gained the letters LNER and subsequently acquired BR emblems. The locos also retained their original boilers, there being no spares. Except when on hire to industrial concerns, the locomotives were shedded at Kittybrewster.
The first loco to be withdrawn was 68193 in 1956, followed by 68191 in 1959. The remaining two locos were withdrawn in 1960.
Classification and numbering.
After the grouping both the Class X and Class Y became LNER CLass Z5. This was changed in 1927 when the Class Y was redesignated LNER CLass Z4.

Ruzawi School was established in 1928 by joint founders, Canon Robert Grinham and Mr Maurice Carver, as a boarding primary school for boys. It became co-educational from January 2003. It is an Anglican Diocesan school (but does not apply a test of faith for admission) with a pupil population ranging from 205 to 220 depending on the balance of boys and girls and the number of pupils in each age group. In the Infants' Department there is one class each for Grade One and Grade Two. An additional entry point at Grade Three enables there to be two classes from that level up to Grade 7.
Within the school, students are divided up into two 'houses' that compete along academic and sporting lines. The houses are named Grenfell, represented by olive green and named after Julian Grenfell the first born of William Grenfell - Baron of Desborough; and Fairbridge, represented by light blue and named after Kingsley Fairbrige, a South African educator and statesman. The link between the houses, comes from the apt and fierce competition between Julian and Kingsley at Oxford University in the sport of Boxing. 
The School is situated some five kilometres south of Marondera in extensive grounds surrounded by many hectares of indigenous miombo woodland and exotic eucalyptus plantations .

Drug prohibition law

Drug prohibition law is prohibition-based law by which governments prohibit, except under licence, the production, supply, and possession of many, but not all, substances which are recognized as drugs, and which corresponds to international treaty commitments in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988.
When produced, supplied or possessed under licence, otherwise prohibited drugs are known as controlled drugs. The aforementioned legislation is the cultural institution and social fact that de facto divides world drug trade as illegal vs legal, according to geopolitical issues. The United Nations has its own drug control programme, as part of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which was formerly called the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP), and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs is the central drug policy-making body within the United Nations system.
The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is an independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug control conventions. It is important to note that there are several different sets of "schedules", or lists, of controlled drugs. One is the INCB schedules (four schedules numbered I-IV), while another is the United States' Controlled Substances Act schedules of controlled substances (five schedules, numbered I-V). Other countries also have different classifications and numbers of lists, such as those of the United Kingdom and Canada.
History and founding principles.
Drug prohibition law is based on the view that some drugs, notably opium poppy, coca, and substances derived from these plants, are so addictive or dependence inducing and so dangerous, in terms of potential effects on the health, morality and behaviour of users, that they should be rarely, if ever, used.
Psychotropic substances covered by drug control law include psilocybin mushrooms and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
The following treaties are no longer in force, being superseded in 1961 by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs:
Licensing.
Otherwise prohibited drugs may be licensed for medical, research and industrial purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies, also known as drug companies, work under drug control licenses.
Hemp production from the "Cannabis" plant is an example of an industrial purpose.
Recreational and self-medicational drug use.
Recreational use and self-medicational use are not licensed under drug prohibition laws, although other drugs, not covered by such laws, may be legally available for this purpose. Alcohol and tobacco are notable examples of legally available recreational drugs. Aspirin is an example of a drug legally available for self-medicational purposes.
Health, moral, and behavior issues, and legal issues, are associated with alcohol and tobacco use, but these are not addressed through drug prohibition laws.
Addiction to a prohibited drug may not be considered a legitimate reason for using it, even if the drug is obtained from a licensed source, or a substitute may be provided, for example, methadone instead of heroin. Generally, however, those addicted to prohibited drugs are expected to find other ways of coping with their addictions, or to risk suffering the law enforcement penalties associated with illegal possession.
Enforcement.
There is an extensive illegal trans-national industry supplying prohibited drugs for recreational use. Thus, while drug prohibition laws remain in force, there is perpetual law enforcement action directed against the illegal industry, which also impacts supply for self-medication.
Although it is directed against illegal recreational drugs, and not against drugs licensed under prohibition laws or against drugs beyond the scope of prohibition laws, the law enforcement is sometimes called the "war on drugs".
Criticism.
In the United Kingdom, where the principal piece of drug prohibition legislation is the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, criticism includes:

<doc id="21477359" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21477359" title="Falling cat problem">
Falling cat problem

The falling cat problem is a problem that consists of explaining the underlying physics behind the observation of the cat righting reflex: that is, how a free-falling body (cat) can acquire angular momentum such that it is able to right itself as it falls to land on its feet, irrespective of its initial orientation, and without violating the law of conservation of angular momentum.
Although amusing and trivial to pose, the solution of the problem is not as straightforward as its statement would suggest. The apparent contradiction with the law of conservation of angular momentum is resolved because the cat is not a rigid body, but instead is permitted to change its shape during the fall owing to the cat's flexible backbone and no functional collar-bone. The behavior of the cat is thus typical of the mechanics of deformable bodies.
History.
The falling cat problem has elicited interest from famous scientists including George Gabriel Stokes, James Clerk Maxwell, and Étienne-Jules Marey. In a letter to his wife, Katherine Mary Clerk Maxwell, Maxwell wrote, "There is a tradition in Trinity that when I was here I discovered a method of throwing a cat so as not to light on its feet, and that I used to throw cats out of windows. I had to explain that the proper object of research was to find how quick the cat would turn round, and that the proper method was to let the cat drop on a table or bed from about two inches, and that even then the cat lights on her feet." Maxwell's as well as other scientist's fetish with so-called "cat turning" was reputed to have caused the death of many cats after being dropped from windows of multi-storied buildings. Maxwell in particular, was interested in discovering the precise height that a cat needed to be dropped from so that the cat would be incapable of using its righting reflex to land on its feet, an endeavor in which he eventually succeeded.
Whereas the cat-falling problem was regarded as a mere curiosity by Maxwell, Stokes and others, a more rigorous study of the problem was conducted by Étienne-Jules Marey who applied chronophotography to capture the cat's decent on film using a chronophotagraphic gun. The gun, capable of capturing 12 frames per second, produced images from which Marey made some important deductions. Namely, that as the cat had no rotational motion at the start of its descent the cat was not "cheating" by using the cat handler's hand as a fulcrum. This in itself posed a problem as it implied that it was possible for a body in free fall to acquire angular momentum. Marey also showed that air resistance played no role in facilitating the righting of the cat's body.
His investigations were subsequently published in "Comptes Rendus", and a summary of his findings were published in the journal "Nature". The article's summary in "Nature" appeared thus,
Despite the publication of the images, many physicists at the time maintained that the cat was still "cheating" by using the handler's hand from its starting position to right itself as the cat's motion would otherwise seem to imply a rigid body acquiring angular momentum.
Solution.
The solution of the problem, originally due to , models the cat as a pair of cylinders (the front and back halves of the cat) capable of changing their relative orientations. later described the Kane–Scher model in terms of a connection in the configuration space that encapsulates the relative motions of the two parts of the cat permitted by the physics. Framed in this way, the dynamics of the falling cat problem is a prototypical example of a nonholonomic system , the study of which is among the central preoccupations of control theory. A solution of the falling cat problem is a curve in the configuration space that is "horizontal" with respect to the connection (that is, it is admissible by the physics) with prescribed initial and final configurations. Finding an optimal solution is an example of optimal motion planning (; ).
In the language of physics, Montgomery's connection is a certain Yang-Mills field on the configuration space, and is a special case of a more general approach to the dynamics of deformable bodies as represented by gauge fields (; ), following the work of Shapere and Wilczek ().

New Radnor was, from 1894 to 1974, a rural district in the administrative county of Radnorshire, Wales.
The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1894, when the existing Kington Rural Sanitary District was divided into two: the section in Herefordshire was reconstituted as Kington Rural District, while the section in Radnorshire became New Radnor Rural District. The new district took its name from the village of New Radnor, at one time a borough and county town of Radnorshire. The council continued to be based in Kington in Herefordshire.
The rural district comprised fifteen civil parishes: 
The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which completely reorganised local administration in England and Wales. Its area became part of the District of Radnor in the new county of Powys.

Peter Chan (businessman)

Peter Chan Chun-chuen (born 23 December 1959), earlier known as Tony Chan, is a Hong Kong businessman and the former Feng shui geomancer to the late Nina Wang, who at the time of her death was chair of Chinachem Group and Asia's richest woman. He laid claim to Wang's HK$83 billion estate after she died from ovarian cancer in 2007, claiming to have been her lover.
Personal life and business activities.
Chan was born in Hong Kong with family roots in Xinhui, Guangdong. He is a partial owner, along with Wang's estate, of RCG Holdings Limited (, ), a biometrics and RFID solution provider which was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in February 2009. He is married to Tam Miu-chung; their first child, Wealthee Chan, was born in 1993. In March 2013, Tony Chan was baptised as a Christian and took the name Peter Chan on the occasion of his conversion. He stated that he began considering conversion when his driver quit in 2012 and gave him a Bible as a parting gift. He also indicated that he would no longer practise feng shui after his conversion.
Estate battle.
After Nina Wang's death in 2007, Chan presented a 2006 document purporting to be her last will and testament, which left all of her assets to him. This would have been a complete reversal of Wang's earlier 2002 will, in which she stated that she wished to bequeath her fortune to Chinachem Charitable Foundation, a trust run by her family. On 2 February 2010, the Hong Kong High Court ruled that Wang's estate belonged to the Foundation and not to Chan. 
Justice Johnson Lam said Chan was "untruthful, unreliable and lacking in credibility". He further stated: "I do not find him to be a credible witness and I find in many respects his evidence was tailored to suit his convenience. I do not believe what he testified regarding the provenance of the 2006 will. Apart from my general assessment of his credibility, I also find his evidence incredible." 
The judge found Wang's signature on the 2006 will relied on by Tony Chan to be "a highly skilled simulation", on the basis of which the Hong Kong Police arrested Tony Chan the next day. 
He was released on HK$5 million (US$640,000) bail. Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department issued a demand for HK$300 million in back taxes on income he is alleged to have received from Wang for feng shui services, sums which Chan claims were gifts from his lover.
Criminal case.
On 4 July 2013, Chan was convicted of two criminal fraud charges in a jury trial. He was convicted of forging the will and of using a false document by majority verdicts. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. He filed for leave to appeal against his conviction the following week.

Morris Jones (footballer)

William Morris Jones (30 November 1919 – 1993) was an English footballer. A centre-forward, he scored 84 goals in 191 league games in a 13 year career in the Football League.
Jones moved from South Liverpool to Port Vale in June 1939, but had to wait seven years to make his debut because of World War II. He was sold on to Swindon Town for £2,500 in November 1947. He moved on to Crystal Palace after three years, before ending his career after spending the 1951–52 season with Watford. He was listed in the September 2002 book "Swindon Town Football Club 100 Greats".
Playing career.
Jones performed well for South Liverpool in the Lancashire Combination in 1938–39, ousting the more experienced Jack Roscoe from the starting line-up. However, Jones found himself on the sidelines as South Liverpool won four trophies, including the Welsh Cup, in the spring of 1939. He signed with Port Vale in June 1939. Due to the Second World War it took until 31 August 1946, in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion, before he made his debut; in the interim he had guested three times for Celtic in 1940. He scored his first Third Division South goal on 7 September, in a 2–1 defeat by Exeter City at The Old Recreation Ground. He scored a hat-trick past Watford in a 3–0 home win on 16 November, and also scored twice against Watford in the FA Cup. In total, he scored 26 goals in 44 appearances in 1946–47, becoming the club's top-scorer. He hit three goals in 14 games in 1947–48, all of the goals coming in a 6–4 win over Aldershot on 6 September.
Jones handed "Valiants" manager Gordon Hodgson a transfer request, and his wish was granted in November 1947, when he was sold to league rivals Swindon Town for £2,500. Louis Page's "Robins" finished 16th in 1947–48, with Jones scoring 14 goals in 31 games. He then hit 25 goals in 43 appearances to help the club to rise to fourth place in 1948–49. He then scored 13 goals in 27 games, as Swindon finished in 14th place in 1949–50. Jones scored 52 goals in 101 league and cup appearances during his time at the County Ground. Following a £3,500 transfer in May 1950, he scored three goals in 17 league appearances for Crystal Palace in 1950–51, as the "Eagles" finished bottom of the Third Division South. He left Selhurst Park for Watford in 1951–52. Haydn Green's "Hornets" finished three places above the bottom of the Third Division South. Despite scoring seven goals in 27 league games for a struggling team, Jones did not find another club after leaving Vicarage Road, though did have a trial with Leyton Orient.

Driving licence in Romania

In Romania the driving licence () is a governmental right given to those who request a licence for any of the categories they desire. It is required for every type of motorized vehicle. The minimum age to obtain a driving licence is 18 years. Regardless of age, in the first year after obtaining the licence the driver is called a beginner () and has to display on the windscreen and the back window of the car the distinctive sign (a black exclamation mark (!) on a yellow disk).
Beginning with 1999, the driving licence format was changed from that of a pink booklet to a credit-card sized card.
Obtaining a drivers licence.
The driving licence can be obtained after finishing a driving school and passing a two stage test, a theory test and a road test.
The theory test.
The theory test consists of 26 questions and it is computerized, with successful candidates needing to score a minimum of 22 correct answers. The candidate is automatically eliminated if 5 wrong answers are given. For authenticity, during the computerized examination, the candidate is photographed three times and these pictures are later used as evidence that the person present at the road test is the same person as the one who was present at the theory test.
The road test.
The road test is a practical hands on test that lasts 25 minutes, during which time the candidate must prove that he/she is able to handle the vehicle properly and safely, that he/she can do all kind of manoeuvres including turns, parking, while respecting the law.
The driving test ends when the test period finishes and the candidate is then informed of the result. If the candidate obtained no more than 20 penalty points, he is given the result "passed", if the candidate made mistakes that sum at least 21 points, he is given the result "failed" and can reschedule another examination after a 15 day period has lapsed.
Age requirement.
Every category has a minimum age required for obtaining it:

Following graduation, she attended the New York University School of Law, receiving her Juris Doctor in 1968. She worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an attorney before moving to Florida in 1980. Schwartz gained employment as an Assistant City Attorney in Hollywood, where she lives. Prior to her election to the legislature, she served on the Hollywood Housing Authority as the Vice-Chair and as a Commissioner.
Florida House of Representatives.
When incumbent State Representative Eleanor Sobel was unable to seek re-election in 2006, Schwartz ran to succeed her in the 99th District, which stretched from Pembroke Pines to Hollywood in southern Broward County. She ran in the Democratic primary to succeed Sobel, winning 50% of the vote against Arthur Palamara and Barry Sacharow. In the general election, Schwartz defeated Republican nominee Juan Selaya in a landslide, receiving 75% of the vote to Selaya's 25%. She was re-elected without opposition in 2008 and 2010.
In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House districts, Schwartz was kept in the 99th District, which maintained most of the territory that she previously represented. She won her party's nomination unopposed and faced Republican nominee Elizabeth Eddy in the general election. Schwartz was endorsed by the "Sun-Sentinel", which praised her for being "a voice for children, working families, and women's issues during her time in the Florida Legislature," and the "Miami Herald", which identified her support for expanding the Nursing Home Diversion Program, resulting in the opening of "thousands of new slots" for the disabled elderly to "stay in their homes or assisted living facilities." Ultimately, Schwartz was re-elected in a landslide to her final term in the legislature over Eddy, winning 66% of the vote.

Akita Relay

The was a limited express train service operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan between March 1996 and March 1997.
Engineering work to convert the Tazawako Line between Morioka and Ōmagari from narrow gauge to standard gauge for use by Akita Shinkansen services entailed the complete closure of the line between March 1996 and March 1997. The "Tazawa" limited express services that previously linked Morioka with Akita and Aomori were curtailed to run between Akita and Aomori only, and temporary "Akita Relay" limited express diesel services were operated instead between Kitakami on the Tōhoku Shinkansen and Akita via the Kitakami Line and Ōu Main Line.
Services commenced on 30 March 1996, with 10 "down" services and 11 "up" services operating daily using a specially built fleet of KiHa 110-300 series DMUs mostly in 4-car formations, but with some 3- or 7-car formations. These trains featured 2+2 abreast unidirectional limited express style seating identical to the seating used in E217 series EMU Green cars.
The "Akita Relay" services ended on 21 March 1997, the day before Akita Shinkansen "Komachi" services commenced between Morioka and Akita. The KiHa 110-300 series DMUs were subsequently refitted with standard seating, renumbered as KiHa 110-200 series, and reassigned for use on other lines such as the Iiyama Line.

Rhayader Rural District

Rhayader was, from 1894 to 1974, a rural district in the administrative county of Radnorshire, Wales.
The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1894, based on the existing Rhayader Rural Sanitary District. The rural sanitary district had included the Brecknockshire parish of Llanwrthwl, and this was administered by Rhayader Rural District Council until 1934, when it was transferred to Builth Rural District. 
The rural district comprised nine civil parishes: 
The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which completely reorganised local administration in England and Wales. Its area became part of the District of Radnor in the new county of Powys.

Inverted Dendermonde

The Inverted Dendermonde is a Belgian postage stamp, issued in 1920.
Its catalogue number is: 
Background.
The 65-cent stamp, depicting the townhall of Dendermonde was issued on 5 August 1920.
It was a completion of a definitive series of stamps printed between 1915 and 1919 which depicted on the lower nominations - 1 cent up to 25-cent - King Albert I and the higher nominations - 35-cent up to 10 Francs - various subjects.
Originally, the stamp was to have a denomination of 20 cents. By the time the commission was given, the postage rates had changed and there was a need for a stamp of 65 cents for express rate post.
A run of 10 million stamps was ordered. The stamp was designed, engraved and printed by the Dutch company Joh. Enschedé in Haarlem, the Netherlands and exists in two versions: a first run was printed in sheets of 25 (5 by 5), a second run was printed in sheets of 100 (10 by 10). This was because of a shortage of paper.
The two runs can be identified by the dimensions of the image. The first run has an image of 26,25 by 22,5 mm, whereas the second run's dimensions are 27 by 22 mm. Perforation measurement is 11½. End of use date was 1 May 1931.
Inversion.
Two sheet of the first run had its centre inverted, so that the depicted town hall is upside down.
Most likely the cause of this error was similar to the one of the Inverted Jenny, since the Belgian stamp has also two colours.
The first sheet was partially sold in the Post Office of Ghent. After this discovery was made, the management of the Belgian Post went to Enschedé to find out if there were more. A second sheet was discovered, transported to Brussels and destroyed.
One pane of the second run was also inverted. 50 copies of these were discovered in January 1921 in Leuven. They were confiscated by the Post Office before they could be sold to the general public. The remaining 50 were still in the Netherlands and were cut, this being witnessed by Dutch and Belgian officials. The 50 already in Belgium were destroyed by burning them on 21 January 1921.
Known stamps.
18 of the 25 stamps were sold at the Post Office of Gent (Fr. Gand) on 13 August 1920. When the discovery was made, only 7 copies remained.
At the moment there are 17 known copies: 15 unused and 2 used. The only known cancellation is "Gand 13 August 1920".
In 1942 a stampdealer from Brussels, who had two copies of the stamp, was murdered. The murderer and the two stamps were never found.
Value.
The cancelled stamp is valued at €75,000 and is one of the most expensive Belgian stamps.
Popular culture.
In 2003 the stamp was the subject of the comic book Het mysterie van de omgekeerde zegel (The mystery of the inverted stamp) in the serie Stam en Pilou.
In 2004, the stamp was the subject of a children's book De omgekeerde Dendermonde (The inverted Dendermonde) by author Henri Van Daele.

Christian Holtermann Knudsen

Christian Holtermann Knudsen (15 July 1845 – 21 April 1929) was a Norwegian typographer, newspaper editor, publisher, trade unionist and politician for the Norwegian Labour Party. He is known as chairman of his party in three non-consecutive periods, and also founded what would become the main party newspaper. He served three terms in the Norwegian Parliament.
Career.
Media and trade unions.
He was born in Bergen as the son of a cooper. He finished a typographer's education in 1865, and worked for several printing presses in Kristiania. Most notably he worked for the weekly newspaper "Almuevennen", as typographer for six years and manager for eight years. In 1872 he was among the co-founders of the trade union Oslo Typografiske Forening. He chaired this organization from 1876 to 1878, 1879 to 1882 and 1883 to 1885, and in 1883 he co-founded the first trade union center in Norway, "Fagforeningernes Centralkomité".
In 1884 Knudsen established the newspaper "Vort Arbeide" ('Our Work'), on behalf of the central committee. The first issue was released on 10 May 1884, and led to Knudsen being fired from "Almuevennen". He also had to establish his own printing press since none of the existing printing presses wanted to be affiliated with a labourer's newspaper. The fledgling project was marred by economic problems, and the burden of both writing, editing and printing lay chiefly on Knudsen. In 1885 he founded the association "Socialdemokratisk Forening", which formally took over the newspaper. The name was changed from "Vort Arbeide" to "Social-Demokraten" ('The Social Democrat') in 1886. At the same time, Carl Jeppesen took over as editor-in-chief, although Knudsen would return as editor from 1892 to 1893.
Knudsen expanded the printing press, and published several books, many of which were frowned upon by the establishment. Kristian Stenrud's books were controversial, and Hans Jæger's book "Fra Kristiania-Bohemen", published in 1885, was instantly banned upon publication. Jæger was sentenced to eighty days in jail, appealed to the Supreme Court and had it reduced to sixty days. Jæger's defender, Ludvig Meyer, later became both editor-in-chief of "Social-Demokraten" and leader of the Labour Party. Jæger and Knudsen later tried to circumvene the law and sell the banned book in Sweden, brandishing a fake name "Julefortællinger af H.J." ('Christmas Carols by H.J.') on the cover, but this was discovered and the book banned in Sweden as well. Knudsen also received a jail sentence, of eleven days, for publishing a piece about contraception in "Social-Demokraten" in 1887. Nonetheless, Knudsen became the official stamp printer in 1895.
Political party.
Knudsen, inspired by German theories, argued that "socialism the only means" to "help the working estate". He became a co-founder of the Norwegian Labour Party in August 1887 in Arendal. Like the trade unions, the early Labour Party contained both socialist and non-socialist elements. The most important political demand was universal suffrage. Knudsen was a member of the central committee from the beginning, and then became party leader from 1889 to 1890 and 1900 to 1903. From 1899 to 1926 he was a member of Kristiania city council. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1906, representing the constituency of Grünerløkken, and was re-elected in 1909 and 1912. For the first two terms he was the leader of the parliamentary party group.
Knudsen was a deputy member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1913, and served his third term as party leader from 1911 to 1918. His leadership came to an end when the radical wing, spearheaded by Kyrre Grepp and Martin Tranmæl, took over at the 1918 national party convention. He left the central committee, but returned in 1920. When the less radical wing broke out to form the Social Democratic Labour Party in 1921, Knudsen did not follow; he continued in the central committee until 1924. In 1923 the name of the newspaper "Social-Demokraten" had been changed again, to "Arbeiderbladet" ('The Labour Paper'). It became the main organ of the Labour Party, undergoing direct control; the editor-in-chief was also represented in the national party board. As the newspapers became independent in the latter quarter of the twentieth century, the newspaper changed its name again, to the current "Dagsavisen".
Knudsen died in 1929.

He was first elected to the Florida House in 2006, and was reelected in 2008 and in 2010. In 2012, Martin Kiar was elected to the Broward County Commission and now serves as the Broward County Commissioner for District 1. Martin Kiar was the first person in Broward County's history to win an open (no incumbent running) Broward County Commission seat unopposed. Martin Kiar is also one of the youngest Broward County Commissioners to ever serve in that capacity. This is a unique achievement because many South Florida elected officials aspire to serve on either the Broward County Commission or the Miami-Dade County Commission. Most of the state of Florida's revenue is generated out of Broward County and Miami-Dade County and both counties play a significant role in the revenue generated by the United States of America. Broward County is larger in population than many states and countries with 1.8 million people and the Broward County Commission is a nine member board that oversees an approximately 4 billion dollar budget. The Broward County Commission also oversees and makes decisions for Port Everglades and The Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport. The Broward County Commission is also the decision maker for Broward County's land use, building and construction and for Broward County's parks, libraries, mass transit, human services, traffic control, etc. The Broward County Commission is also responsible for funding the Broward Sheriff's Office, the Property Appraiser's Office and the Supervisor Of Elections. The Broward County Commission also makes policy decisions for the county. 
Martin Kiar was born in Pembroke Pines, Florida on June 19, 1977. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Palm Beach Atlantic University in 1999 and his Juris Doctorate at Nova Southeastern University in 2002. After graduation, he worked as an attorney for a law firm for a year and then for Monroe D. Kiar and Associates. He made an unsuccessful bid for the District 97 seat in 2004 and ran successfully in 2006.

Thomas Hall (minister)

Thomas Hall (1610–1665) was an English clergyman and ejected minister.
Life.
He was son of Richard Hall, clothier, by his wife Elizabeth (Bonner), and was born in St. Andrew's parish, Worcester, about 22 July 1610. He was educated at the King's School, Worcester, under Henry Bright (d. 1626), one of the most celebrated schoolmasters of the day. In 1624 he entered Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner. Finding himself under 'a careless tutor,' he moved to the newly founded Pembroke College as a pupil of Thomas Lushington. He graduated B.A. on 7 February 1629. Returning to Worcestershire, he became teacher of a private school, and preached in the chapels of several hamlets in the parish of Kings Norton, of which his brother, John Hall, vicar of Bromsgrove, was perpetual curate. At this period he conformed, but attendance at the puritan lecture, maintained at Birmingham, contributed to make him a presbyterian. He became curate at Kings Norton under his brother, who soon resigned the living in his favour. The living was of little value, but Hall obtained the mastership of the grammar school, founded by Edward VI.
During the civil war he was 'many times plundered, and five times imprison'd', according to Edmund Calamy. He refused preferment when his party was in power. In June 1652 he 'had liberty allow'd him by the delegates of the university' to take the degree of B.D. on the terms of preaching a Latin and an English sermon. His presbyterian principles prevented him from joining Richard Baxter's Worcestershire agreement in 1653; and he became a member of the presbytery of Kenilworth, Warwickshire (see Obadiah Grew). He, however, signed Baxter's Worcestershire petition for the retention of tithe and a settled ministry.
Hall was a 'plain but fervent' preacher, and 'a lover of books and learning'. When the first Birmingham library was established in connection with the Birmingham grammar school he contributed many books, and collected others from his friends. Subsequently he founded a similar library at Kings Norton; the parish at his instance erected a building, and Hall transferred to it all his books for public use. After his ejection by the Uniformity Act (1662) he was reduced to great poverty, but his friends did not allow him to want. He died on 13 April 1665, and was buried at Kings Norton.
Family.
John Hall (1633–1710), Bishop of Bristol, was his nephew.
Works.
Hall wrote: 
Views.
He was a "high" Presbyterian, concerned to put in place a national church.
"Histrio-mastix", or "A Whip for Webster", starts from a clear mistake of the identity of John Webster the physician, for the dead dramatist John Webster; Hall argues from an "unyielding Aristotelian" point of view, and for no change in the educational system. It was a companion to the "Vindiciae literarum" (1654), which Christopher Hill calls "hysterical".
He was an opponent of astrology, associating it in "Histrio-mastix" with the 'Familistical-Levelling-Magical temper'.

<doc id="21477678" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21477678" title="Magnetic survey (archaeology)">
Magnetic survey (archaeology)

Magnetic survey is one of a number of methods used in archaeological geophysics. Magnetic surveys record spatial variation in the Earth's magnetic field. In archaeology, magnetic surveys are used to detect and map archaeological artifacts and features. Magnetic surveys are used in both terrestrial and marine archaeology.
Overview.
Magnetometers used in geophysical survey may use a single sensor to measure the total magnetic field strength, or may use two (sometimes more) spatially separated sensors to measure the gradient of the magnetic field (the difference between the sensors). In most archaeological applications the latter (gradiometer) configuration is preferred because it provides better resolution of small, near-surface phenomena. Magnetometers may also use a variety of different sensor types. Proton precession magnetometers have largely been superseded by faster and more sensitive fluxgate and cesium instruments.
Every kind of material has unique magnetic properties, even those that we do not think of as being "magnetic". Different materials below the ground can cause local disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field that are detectable with sensitive magnetometers. The chief limitation of magnetometer survey is that subtle features of interest may be obscured by highly magnetic geologic or modern materials.
Terrestrial magnetic surveys.
In terrestrial archaeology, magnetic surveys are typically used for detailed mapping of archaeological features on known archaeological sites. More exceptionally, magnetometers are used for low-resolution exploratory surveys.
Several types of magnetometer are used in terrestrial archaeology. Early surveys, beginning in the 1950s, were conducted with proton precession magnetometers. Data collection with proton precession instruments was slow, making high sample density surveys impracticable. Data were manually recorded and plotted. The subsequent introduction of Fluxgate and cesium vapor magnetometers improved sensitivity, and greatly increased sampling speed, making high resolution surveys of large areas practical. Equally important was the development of computers to handle, process, and display large datasets.
Magnetometers react very strongly to iron and steel, brick, burned soil, and many types of rock, and archaeological features composed of these materials are very detectable. Where these highly magnetic materials do not occur, it is often possible to detect very subtle anomalies caused by disturbed soils or decayed organic materials. Many types of sites and features have been successfully mapped with magnetometers, ranging from very ephemeral prehistoric campsites to large urban centers.
Marine Magnetic Surveys.
Magnetic surveys are extremely useful in the excavation and exploration of underwater archaeological sites. The apparatus used on the water slightly differs from that on land. Marine magnetometers come in two types: Surface towed and near-bottom. Both are towed a sufficient distance (about two ship lengths) away from the ship to allow them to collect data without it being polluted by the ship's magnetic properties. Surface towed magnetometers allow for a wider range of detection at the price of precision accuracy that is afforded by the near-bottom magnetometers.
The most common type of magnetometer used for marine survey is the fluxgate magnetometer. Fluxgate magnetometers utilize two ferromagnetic cores each wound with a primary coil and an outer secondary coil attached to amp meter. When an alternating current (AC) is passed through the primary coils, it creates two opposing magnetic fields that vary in intensity based on the outside magnetic fields. By floating them parallel to the seafloor, they can measure the changes in magnetic fields over the seabed.
Another common type is the newer proton precession magnetometer. This utilizes a container full of hydrogen rich liquids (commonly kerosene or methanol) that, when agitated by a direct current (DC) or Radio Frequency (RF), cause the electrons to become energized and transfer that energy to the protons due to the Overhauser Effect basically turning them into dipole magnets. When the stimulus is removed, the protons precess at a rate that can be interpreted to determine the magnetic forces of the area.
In maritime archaeology, these are often used to map the geology of wreck sites and determine the composition of magnetic materials found on the seafloor. An Overhauser magnetometer (PPM) was used in 2001 to map Sebastos (the harbor of Caesarea Maritima) and helped to identify components of the Roman concrete.
Related methods.
The magnetic properties of archaeological materials form the basis for a number of other archaeological techniques, Including:

Perry E. Thurston, Jr.

Perry E. Thurston, Jr. (born January 30, 1961) is a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, currently serving as the Minority Leader and representing the 94th District, which includes most of Fort Lauderdale in central Broward County, since 2012, previously representing the 93rd District from 2006 to 2012.
History.
Thurston was born in Pompano Beach and attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he graduated with a degree in finance in 1982. After graduation, he retired to Florida, where he worked in banking until he quit to attend the University of Miami School of Law, where he graduated in 1987. Thurston then worked for the Broward County Public Defender's Office for four years, and then began working in private practice as a defense attorney.
Florida House of Representatives.
When State Representative M. Mandy Dawson did not seek re-election in 1998, instead choosing to successfully run for the Florida Senate, Thurston ran to succeed her in the 93rd District. In the Democratic primary, he faced Chris Smith, Hazel K. Armbrister, and Fred Segal. Smith placed first in the primary, but he did not win a majority, so he and Thurston, the second-place finisher, advanced to a runoff election, which Smith easily won.
In 2006, Smith could not seek re-election, and Thurston ran to succeed him in the 93rd District. Against Alain Valias-Jean, Randy Smith, Sallie Tillman-Watson, and McKinley Williams II, Thurston won the Democratic primary with 43% of the vote. In the general election, he crushed his opponent, independent candidate Nick Sakhnovsky, with 82% of the vote. Thurston was re-elected in 2008 and 2010 without opposition.
When Florida House of Representatives districts were redrawn in 2012, Thurston was redistricted into the 94th District, which included most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 93rd District. He won the Democratic nomination without an opponent, and was opposed by Republican nominee Scott Herman in the general election. The "South Florida Sun-Sentinel" endorsed Thurston for re-election, praising him as "an advocate for those issues important to his district and his party...education, economic development, and criminal justice issues." In the end, Thurston won in a landslide with 84% of the vote to secure his final term in the House.
During the 2012-2014 term, Thurston serves as Minority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives. In that capacity, he played a critical role in the controversy over the proposed Medicaid expansion as provided for by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, joining to support Governor Rick Scott's proposal to take "more than $50 billion from the federal government over the next decade," which would allow "an estimated 1.1 million low-income Floridians to purchase private insurance." Owing to the refusal by Republicans to consider the proposal, Thurston engaged in a series of legislative maneuvers to slow down the session, "relying on a parliamentary tactic that requires a full reading of all House bills ready for floor votes," which caused Will Weatherford, the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives to use an automated bill reader named "Mary" to speed-read through the bills. When the legislative session drew to a close without a decision on the Medicaid expansion, Democrats, including Thurston, joined forces to urge Governor Scott to call a special session to resolve the issue. However, despite the battle over health care, he did not engage in a protracted fight over the budget, declaring, "There will be some who will be voting for the budget, and they'll have legitimate reasons to vote for it, which I think are legitimate reasons."
Attorney General campaign.
In late 2012, Thurston confirmed that he was considering running against Republican Attorney General of Florida Pam Bondi in 2014, and at the annual convention of the Florida Democratic Party in October 2013, he announced that he was running, declaring, "I will be a candidate for Attorney General in November 2014. I look at the Attorney General's position as the people's attorney, and I think that we need, Florida can do better. I think we need an Attorney General who's going to focus on the health care needs of Florida citizens, not necessarily some national agenda." Thurston, however, is also a candidate for the Florida Senate in 2016, when State Senator Chris Smith is term-limited. When asked about how his Senate candidacy impacts his Attorney General campaign, he said, "I will not be running for the Senate once I win this election in 2014," but he whenn asked about whether he would run for the Senate if he loses, noted, "I have not made a decision about but I fully expect to win in 2014."

Sumner Carruth was an officer in the volunteer army of the United States during the American Civil War. He commanded the 35th Massachusetts Infantry and eventually rose to the command of two different brigades in the IX Corps.
Pre-War.
Carruth was born on December 22, 1834 in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. He worked as a machinist. At the outbreak of the Civil War he was a militia officer. His company, the Chelsea Light Infantry, was mustered into the federal service as Company H of the 1st Massachusetts Infantry in 1861. 1st Lt. Carruth was credited with the leading role in persuading the company to volunteer.
Civil War Service.
On May 22, 1861, Carruth, became captain of Company H by election. He first saw combat at First Bull Run in the brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson. Carruth next served in the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign. The regiment was in the III Corps in the division of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Carruth was present at the Battle of Yorktown (1862), where his company distinguished itself. The company also fought at the Battle of Williamsburg. Carruth was wounded in the arm at the Battle of Seven Pines, apparently missing the subsequent battles of the Peninsula Campaign.
Carruth returned to the field as a major in the newly organized 35th Massachusetts Infantry, commissioned at that rank on August 21, 1862. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on August 27 of that year. The regiment served in IX Corps in the division of Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis. Carruth was present at the Battle of South Mountain, where the commander, Col. Edward A. Wild was wounded. Carruth succeeded to command, but he was wounded at the Battle of Antietam near Burnside’s Bridge. Carruth was captured at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia on November 11, 1862, missing the Battle of Fredericksburg.
After being exchanged, Carruth next served in IX Corps in the Department of the Ohio. He became colonel of his regiment on May 1, 1863 and served with the corps in the Siege of Vicksburg, as well as in Eastern Tennessee. Carruth led the 2nd brigade, 2nd division, IX Corps from February 2 to March 3, 1864, before the Corps was transferred back to Virginia. In Virginia, he led the same brigade in April 1864. Then he led 1st brigade, 1st division, IX Corps from April 25 to May 6, 1864. On the second day of the Battle of the Wilderness, May 6, Carruth's brigade was involved in the fighting on the Orange Plank Road. Fighting in the Wilderness alongside the troops of Brig. Gen. Alexander Webb and Brig. Gen. James Wadsworth, Carruth was felled by sunstroke and carried from the field.
Col. Carruth returned to IX Corps in the Army of the Potomac late in 1864 during the Siege of Petersburg, command his regiment. He led a brigade in the second division from January 23 to February 11, 1865, in the absence of Brig. Gen. John I. Curtin. He did so again from May 4 to June 9 of that year, serving in the Department of Washington after the Confederate surrender. Carruth was mustered out of the volunteer service on June 9, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Carruth for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from April 9, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866. His brevet was awarded for gallant and meritorious services in the attack on Fort Mahone on April 2, 1865 during Battle of Petersburg III. Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, commander of IX Corps, recommended him; and two other officers commended his regiment for its role in that action.
Post-War.
Sumner Carruth married Clara Smith of Newark, New Jersey on August 18, 1862, just before leaving the 1st Massachusetts and joining the 35th regiment. The Sumner’s had two daughters, Minnie Hale, born in 1863, and Clara Louise, born in 1869. Carruth farmed and served as a customs official. Sumner died in 1892 in Andover, Massachusetts and was buried in the West Parish Cemetery.

Thomas Clowes

Thomas Clowes (August 5, 1791 Marblehead, Essex County, Massachusetts - April 9, 1866) was an American lawyer and politician from New York.
Life.
His father and uncles were seafaring men. While a boy he went to sea with his uncle, making two voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1808, he went to live with an uncle, who had settled in Brunswick, Rensselaer County, New York, with the promise of becoming heir to his property. After the death of his uncle, he went to the county seat Troy, New York, to settle the estate, but eventually remained there and studied law at the office of Ross & McConihe. On July 6, 1818, he married Nancy Cox, but of their children only one daughter reached maturity.
He was Surrogate of Rensselaer County from 1821 to 1827.
From 1840 to 1844, he was a Canal Appraiser.
In November 1846, he was elected on the Whig and Anti-Rent tickets a Canal Commissioner. Under the Act of May 6, 1844, there were two canal commissioners to be elected to a four-year term beginning on February 1, 1847, but at the same State election the voters ratified the New York State Constitution of 1846 which extended the terms of the incumbent commissioners until the end of 1847, calling for a new election in November 1847. Thus Clowes could not take office for his elected term. However, on November 1, 1847, Commissioner Nathaniel Jones resigned, and Clowes was elected by the New York State Legislature on November 15 to fill the vacancy, and remained in office for six weeks, until the end of the year.
In 1849, he was appointed by President Zachary Taylor Postmaster of Troy. In March 1851, he was removed by President Millard Fillmore. He was again appointed Postmaster of Troy by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and re-appointed by President Andrew Johnson, and died in office.

Hedge relationship (finance)

Hedge relationship describes the criteria for including the fair value of derivatives on balance sheet as part of an effort to regulate and normalize the use of hedging in corporate accounting. A hedge relationship can be conceptualized as a type of insurance contract for risk mitigation on an underlying asset and a set of tests and methods for valuation of this insurer/insuree contract in corporate accounting and reporting. In general, the use of hedges and financial derivatives to protect against risk should reflect a fair value assessment of the hedge and should not appear as items in corporate income. For companies operating outside of the financial services sector an effective hedge should protect against undue loss without being a major component of company income statements. These contracts are valuable to a company and standardized means of including their fair value on corporate balance sheets is of interest to lenders and investors.
To account for the value of these contracts all of the criteria noted in IAS section 39R.88 must be met for a hedge relationship to be deemed to exist and for hedge accounting to apply. Testing must be performed on both elements of the hedge relationship to ensure that the risk mitigation value of the hedge would be effectively reflected in the insurees profit and loss ledger. Effectiveness measures the strength of this relationship.
Measures of effectiveness.
For the hedge relationship to be allowable for inclusion in the accounts of a corporate entity testing must be applied. There are several generally accepted measures of effectiveness.

History.
Established in 2006, Optoacoustics' founders are the inventors of the original fiber optical microphone. The company pioneered the microphone's commercial manufacture, which is now in its third generation.
In 2008, Optoacoustics began installing the first fully optical fiber-based communication systems for interventional magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) at leading U.S. research and clinical hospitals. This system enables doctors, staff and patients to converse normally while performing complex MRI medical procedures, safely abating noise levels of more than 120 dB commonly found in these environments.
Optoacoustics' fiber optical microphones are also used in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) environments to enable brain researchers to better understand the underlying workings of human speech and communications.
Optoacoustics' products combine two physical disciplines, optics and acoustics, to meet requirements which cannot be addressed by conventional sensing solutions. In particular, Optoacoustics products do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields, offering complete EMI/RFI immunity. The company's technology is protected by over 20 international patents.

Nigel H. Jones

Nigel Jones (born 1961) is a British historian, journalist and biographer.
Early life.
Born in Woking, Surrey, he spent a peripatetic childhood in Surrey, Sussex, Kent and rural Yorkshire, and was educated at schools in the Isle of Wight and North Wales. His journalistic career began on local newspapers in Hertfordshire and the "Cambridge Evening News" where he was Crown Court correspondent. He then spent almost two years in Germany, learning the language, studying the history, and working in factories in Karlsruhe, Reutlingen and Berlin.
Professional life.
In the 1980s he worked for the Press Association news agency in London, and as an editor with BBC and Independent Radio News IRN. 
He has written a number of books with their references below. 
His first book "The War Walk: A Journey along the Western Front" (1983) was inspired by his elderly father, Frank Jones (1890-1970), a Great War veteran. For it, he walked along the trench lines of the Western front, interviewing more than 30 veterans of the conflict. Among these was the German author and war hero Ernst Jünger.
His stay with Jünger inspired his second book "Hitler's Heralds: the story of the Freikorps 1918-1923".(1987. Reissued in 2004 as "A Brief History of the birth of the Nazis").
His third book was inspired by the discovery in 1988 of an archive of letters, papers and manuscripts of the English novelist and playwright Patrick Hamilton (1904-1962) which were bequeathed to him by Hamilton's sister-in-law Aileen Hamilton and used in his biography of Hamilton "Through a Glass Darkly" (1990 : reissued 2008). 
In 1991 Jones moved to Vienna, Austria, where he joined the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) and broadcast worldwide on Radio Austria International. It was at this time that his only stage play, "End of the Night" based on the life of French novelist Louis-Ferdinand Celine, was produced at Brighton's Pavilion Theatre in November 1991.
Returning to England in 1995, he worked as a freelance journalist for The Guardian and Spectator while writing his biography of the poet Rupert Brooke, "Life, Death and Myth" (1999). 
He was deputy editor of History Today magazine (1999-2000) and Reviews editor of BBC History Magazine (2000-2003). 
His next book was a brief life of Britain's Fascist leader, Sir Oswald Mosley "Mosley" published by Haus in 2004.
His recent publications include a history of the plots to assassinate Hitler "Countdown to Valkyrie" published by Frontline Books in January 2009, and "Tower: An Epic History of the Tower of London" published by Hutchinson in 2011 and to be released in the U.S. in 2012 by St. Martin's Press.
He is currently working on his first novel, planned to be one of a series about an Irish spy who goes through the major wars and crises of the early 20th century.
Nigel Jones has written for most of Britain's national newspapers, including the Times and Sunday Times; the Daily and Sunday Telegraph; and the Daily Mail and Daily Express. He reviews books regularly for The Literary Review. 
He initiated and appeared in the BBC film "Journey to Hell" (2003) about the war poet Wilfred Owen; and a BBC film biography of Patrick Hamilton (2004). He has also presented a BBC Radio Four portrait of Hamilton Portrait in Black(2004); and a Radio Four documentary about the SS Lebensborn children's homes in Nazi Germany, "Fountain of Life" (2006).
Nigel Jones is a frequent contributor to the WAIS -- World Association of International Studies on-line discussion group, created by Professor Ronald Hilton of Stanford University.
Nigel Jones also conducts adult and schools tours of the Western Front, 'In the Footsteps of the war poets'.
In 1999 Jones settled in Lewes, East Sussex, where he currently lives with his partner Lally Freeborn, his daughter and two step-sons. Jones has been married twice. First (1982- to Christine Romeyer, by whom he has one daughter Rebecca (b. 1982); and secondly to Claudia Richardson ( 1988-[divorced 1991). He has a son, Tom, (b. 1992) by Nadja Trittner; and a daughter, Milena (b. 2000) by his present partner.

Italy–Spain relations

Italy–Spain relations refers to interstate relations between Italy and Spain. Both countries established diplomatic relations after the unification of Italy. Relations between Italy and Spain have remained strong and affable for centuries owing to various political, cultural, and historical connections between the two nations.
In 218 BC the Romans invaded the Iberian peninsula, which later became the Roman province of Hispania (which later evolved into "España", the Spanish word for Spain). The Romans introduced the Latin language, the ancestor of modern-day Spanish (and the Portuguese language). The Iberian peninsula remained under Roman rule for over 600 years, until the collapse of the Western-Roman Empire.
In the Early modern period, until the 18th century, southern and insular Italy came under Spanish control, having been previously a domain of the Crown of Aragon.
During the Spanish civil war, the Corps of Volunteer Troops, a fascist expeditionary force from Italy, supported the Nationalist forces led by Francisco Franco. It's estimated that around 75,000 Italians fought in the war.
Both countries are full members of NATO, the Union for the Mediterranean, European Union, and the Eurozone. Italy has an embassy in Madrid. Spain has an embassy in Rome.

<doc id="21478095" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21478095" title="Progressive download">
Progressive download

A progressive download is the transfer of digital media files from a server to a client, typically using the HTTP protocol when initiated from a computer. The consumer may begin playback of the media before the download is complete. The key difference between streaming media and progressive download is in how the digital media data is received and stored by the end user device that is accessing the digital media.
A media player that is capable of progressive download playback relies on meta data located in the header of the file to be intact and a local buffer of the digital media file as it is downloaded from a web server. At the point in which a specified amount of data becomes available to the local playback device, the media will begin to play. This specified amount of buffer is embedded into the file by the producer of the content in the encoder settings and is reinforced by additional buffer settings imposed by the media player.
History.
Initially the digital media file type known as JPEG was the first visual media to render a progressive visual display as the digital media was downloaded and actually referred to as a progressive download. The distinction between the technical behavior of progressive download as opposed to the common or commercial use of the term progressive download to describe that behavior was not documented and there is a good deal of question regarding the origin of the term versus the origin of the technical implementation. Apple in reference to their QuickTime media player employed the term "Fast Start" in 1997, to describe what was commercially referred to as progressive download playback of encoded digital media content.
This fast start playback is the result of moving the meta data from the end of the digital media file to the front, this move of the meta data gave the media player all the information it required to begin playback as the file was still being downloaded. Prior to that change, the meta data summary was located at the end of a digital media file and the entire file would need to be downloaded in order for the meta data to be read and the player begin play back.
HTTP progressive download versus streaming media.
The end user experience is similar to streaming media, however the digital file is downloaded to a physical drive on the end user's device, the digital file is typically stored in the temp folder of the associated web browser if the digital media was embedded into a web page or is diverted to a storage directory that is set in the preferences of the media player used for playback. The digital media file will stutter or stop play back if the rate of play back exceeds the rate at which the file is downloaded. The file will begin to play again after further download.
Seeking.
Initially, the file is played from the beginning as soon as possible. A user may wish to point to a part of the file which haven't been downloaded yet. This capability is called seeking and it makes possible to download and start playing any part of the media file. That is often referred to as pseudo-streaming.
For Flash video seeking requires a list of seek points in the media file metadata. These points are offsets in the video (both in seconds and bytes) at which a new key frame starts. A web server or a media server which handles the download, must support seek points in query string of requests for downloading data.
For other types of media files such as MP4 or MKV, web servers must be capable of handling a special offset parameter. The offset parameter name differs for various servers so it must be specified in player settings.
Some servers support seeking via additional modules only, they are specified below. Seeking parameter names are written in "italic".

Goče

Goče () is a village in the hills southwest of Vipava in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Bešenca, Na Grofovem, Na Jagni, Pod Strmcem, and V Gasah.
Name.
The name "Goče" is derived from the personal name *"Gotъ". Other Slovenian toponyms presumably based on this name are "Gotenica", "Gotna vas" (a suburb of Novo Mesto), "Gotovlje", and "Gotenc". Locally, the name is pronounced "Γûəče" , with the adjective form "γûški" and demonym "Γučân" .
History.
Goče was very wealthy in the past; this is indicated in part by houses with dates from the 17th and 18th centuries carved into their door casings. Near Saint Andrew's Church some of the old buildings are built so close together that the streets are barely 1 m wide. Oral tradition states that the houses were built so compactly because the land belonged to the church, exempting the residents from military service.
Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Andrew and dates from 1630. It belongs to the Koper Diocese. A small church built on a hill above the village also belongs to this parish and is dedicated to Our Lady of the Snow. The bell tower contains a bell cast in Goče in 1706.
The village cemetery is south of the settlement. It has chapel dating from 1687 that is a prime example of the Karst Renaissance style. Between the church and the cemetery there is an altar-like wayside shrine from the end of the 17th century. Its relief carvings are heavily damaged.

Los Angeles County Lifeguards

Los Angeles County Lifeguards is a division of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The lifeguard operations safeguard of beach and of coastline, from San Pedro in the south, to Malibu in the north. The Los Angeles County Lifeguard Service served as the model for the hit television series "Baywatch" which was created by part-time lifeguard Gregory Bonan.
Lifeguards also provide paramedic and rescue boat services to Catalina Island, with operations out of Avalon and the Isthmus. Other daily rescue boat services operate out of Los Angeles Harbor(Baywatch Cabrillo), King Harbor(Baywatch Redondo), Marina Del Rey(Baywatch Del Rey and Baywatch Santa Monica), and Malibu Pier(Baywatch Malibu).
The Los Angeles County Lifeguard service is the largest professional lifeguard service in the world. Entering the year 2005, the Los Angeles County Lifeguard Service employs 132 year-round lifeguards (chiefs, captains and ocean lifeguard specialists) and over 650 seasonal lifeguards (recurrents). Operating out of four Sectional Headquarters, located in Hermosa, Santa Monica, Marina Del Rey and Zuma beach. Each of these headquarters staffs a 24-hour EMT-D response unit, and are part of the 911 system.
In addition to providing for beach safety and emergency medical services, LA County Lifeguards have specialized training for Baywatch rescue boat operations, underwater rescue and recovery, swift water rescue, cliff rescue, marine mammal rescue and marine firefighting.
Lifeguard uniforms.
The following categories of lifeguard clothing in sufficient quantities to fully annually outfit 760 male lifeguards and 136 female lifeguards, which numbers can change each agreement year based upon the workforce composition then in employment, as order by county:
Badges and patches.
Most lifeguards are wearing a departmental badge shall consist of a shield, surmonted a bear, and shall be of silver-colored metal unless otherwise specified. The words "County of Los Angeles" shall appear on a ribbon at the atop of the badge just under the bear, followed by ribbons with the words "Fire Department" will appear just above the seal of the county. Then the title of the position of the person authorized to wear such official badge shall be inscribe on a ribbon placed just below the county's seal and the serial number of the badge shall appeared at the bottom of the badge below the title of the position. The words "Ocean Lifeguard Specialist", "Ocean Lifeguard", "Captain" and "Chief" may also appear on the face of badges issued to employees or retired employees authorized by the Fire Department and board of supervisors to carry such badges.
Shoulder patches.
Los Angeles County lifeguards wear a patch on their left sleeve that reads "County of Los Angeles Fire Dept. Lifeguard". Lifeguards that are licensed as paramedics wear a smiliar patch that identifies them as such.
Rescue equipment.
Every lifeguard must possess certain physical skills in order to perform the duties of the job. In addition to these physical skills, lifeguards are provided with specialized equipment designed to assist the lifeguard in protecting lives.
'"EMILY (Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard)
With a history of striving for excellence with innovative and new safer cost effective ways to perform their mission, the Los Angeles County Fire Department Lifeguard Division was the first entity in the country to experiment with a remotely operated motorized rescue buoy system now known as EMILY the Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard which was funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The first experimental trials began in April 2010. The cutting edge effort performed with Los Angeles County Fire Department personnel formed the foundation for the EMILY system which has since been deployed in various locations around the country. This progressive work has drawn great attention and interest of news media and the respect of the public all around the country and internationally around the world.
Rescue cans.
Rescue cans are floats made out of hard plastic, with handles molded into the sides and rear, and are named Burnside Cans after their creator. The rescue can is attached to a line and harness which is worn by the lifeguard. The rescue can is the basic tool of the ocean lifeguard. While it is always optimal to have one flotation device for each victim, if necessary, a rescue can is able to support up to three victims, depending on the condition of the victims and ocean conditions at the time of the rescue.
Rescue cans are used by lifeguards to rescue people in the water and also as a signaling device. During a rescue, you might see a lifeguard raising a can in the water. Raising it vertically means the lifeguard is signaling lifeguards onshore that he or she needs more manpower to assist with the rescue. Raising it to a horizontal position means that a rescue boat is required to assist with the rescue. You will also see lifeguards in Los Angeles County waving their rescue cans as they patrol up and down the beach. This is so that the lifeguards working on both sides of them can easily spot them in case backup is needed.
While working in a tower, a lifeguard will place the rescue can in the designated location, usually on a "can hook" located on the roof of the lifeguard tower. The absence of the rescue can from its rack or hook may be the only way a lifeguard in an adjacent tower will know the lifeguard assigned to a tower is not there.
Rescue tubes.
Foam rubber rescue tubes, located in main stations and rescue units, are ideal for rescuing single or double victims. The tube can be placed under a victim or victims, and is particularly effective in large surf, for rescues near piers or jetties, or for unconscious victims. The tube, because of its soft exterior, is also ideal for use on the rescue boats, also known as Baywatch, or when using a rescue board.
The rescue tube is placed under the victim. When used with an unconscious person, the lifeguard will secure the tube under the victim and use the cross chest method of swimming the person to shore.
Boat tows.
A boat tow is a twelve-foot length of polypropylene line with a snap hook attached to each end. Boat tow lines are used by lifeguards when assisting any water vessel that has approached the beach and is having difficulty staying offshore. One end of the boat tow is usually clipped onto the bow of the vessel while the other end is secured to a rescue can. Lifeguards can then start to tow the vessel by swimming it out and away from the beach and away from beach patrons.
Swim fins.
Swim fins, worn either singularly or in pairs, are especially useful to the lifeguard in several situations, such as large surf or strong rip currents. Fins are also useful in long-distance or multiple victim situations.
Rescue boards.
Rescue boards are kept at main stations and on each emergency vehicle, and can be used in conjunction with a rescue tube or can. Rescue boards are mainly used for long distance rescues and to assist with crowd control. Rescue boards are generally 12 feet in length with anywhere from 2 to 6 handles placed along the rails of the board.
Lifeguard vehicles.
All Ford Escape Hybrid SUV's are currently assigned a sectional beach in Los Angeles County since deploying its new vehicle since 2008.
Lifeguard Centennial.
In 2014, the Los Angeles County Lifeguards will celebrate its centennial anniversary of establishing the lifeguard service for the beaches of L.A. County.

Lomond (horse)

Lomond (foaled February 3, 1980 in Kentucky) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1983 Classic 2,000 Guineas Stakes.
Background.
Bred in Kentucky by the partnership of Warner L. Jones, William S. Farish III and William S. Kilroy, Lomond was sold as a foal in a private transaction for US$1.5 million to British racing's leading owner, Robert Sangster, who had built his highly successful stable from Northern Dancer offspring.
He was sired by Northern Dancer, the most successful sire of the 20th Century, whom the National Thoroughbred Racing Association calls "one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history."
Lomond's dam was My Charmer, a granddaughter of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Round Table. My Charmer was an outstanding broodmare who produced 1977 U.S. Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew. As well, she produced Seattle Dancer, who sold at the July 1985 Keeneland Sales for US$13.1 million, the highest amount ever paid for a yearling at public auction.
Racing career.
Lomond made only seven lifetime starts, winning the 1983 Gladness Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse in Ireland and the Classic 2,000 Guineas Stakes at England's Newmarket Racecourse.

Matsuura Akira

Count was the 12th and final "daimyō" of Hirado Domain in Hizen Province, Kyūshū, Japan. He was also the 37th hereditary head of the Matsuura clan, and a noted tea master. His honorary title was. "Hizen-no-Kami".
Biography.
Akira was born as the 3rd son of Matsuura Hiromu, the 10th "daimyō" of Hirado. His elder brother, Matsuura Terasu became 11th "daimyō" of Hirado in 1841; however by 1849, despite having a wife and three official concubines, was still childless. Therefore in November 1849, Akira was officially adopted as his son and heir. Terasu died unexpectedly on August 5, 1858, and Akira became the 12th "daimyō" of Hirado.
Akira was an active ruler, and attempted to continue the efforts started by his brother to strengthen the domain in face of the unsettled Bakumatsu period by continuing land reforms, sponsoring improved agricultural methods and military training. In 1859, he was visited by Katsu Kaishū and by the Dutch doctor J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort. In 1860, he built coastal defenses as increasing numbers of foreign ships were seen near Hirado’s shores.
Politically, he supported the moderate "Kōbu Gattai" policy of attempting to reconcile the Tokugawa Bakufu with the Imperial Court. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, he commanded his forces as part of the Satchō Alliance in support of Emperor Meiji, and fought at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and against the Tokugawa remnants of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei in northern Japan, at Morioka and Akita.
In June 1868, the revenues of Hirado domain were raised to 61,700 "koku" as a reward for his loyalty to the new government. However, with the abolition of the han system later that year, he surrendered the title of "daimyō" to the central government and was appointed governor until Hirado domain was absorbed into Nagasaki prefecture in July 1871. Awarded 4th Court rank, he moved to Tokyo and entered into service of the Imperial Household Ministry. In April 1884, he was made a count in the new "kazoku" peerage system. From 1890, he served in the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan. He was later awarded 2nd Court rank. 
In addition to his political work, Matsuura Akira was also heir to the school of the Japanese tea ceremony begun by the 4th "daimyō" of Hirado, Matsuura Shigenobu. His former house in Hirado still exists, and is preserved as the “Matsuura Historical Museum”. The building is listed as a National Important Cultural Property. The collection holds household objects, paintings, calligraphy, and documents relating to the early foreign trade in the area. All items in the collection had once been the property of the Matsuura clan of Hirado.

John Angus Erskine

John Angus Erskine (28 January 1873, Invercargill – 27 April 1960, Melbourne) was a New Zealand educated physicist, electrical engineer, benefactor and chess master.
Born in Invercargill, he was a son of Robert Erskine, who migrated from Scotland to Southland, New Zealand, at the age of 16. Jack was educated at South School, and became the first Southland youth to win a Junior Scholarship to the University of New Zealand in 1890. The next year, he chose to enrol at Canterbury College. He passed his final B.A. exams in 1893. With the start of the new term in April 1894, Ernest Rutherford and J.A. Erskine applied to use a basement room in which to carry out electrical experiments. It was here that Erskine investigated the magnetic screening of high-frequency oscillations by various metals, an offshoot of Rutherford's pioneering work. Results of his research appeared in the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute in 1895. 
In 1896 Erskine won an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship and opted to study in Berlin at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat. In 1897, he and Rutherford holidayed together in Germany and year 1897 and part of 1898 Erskine was at the University of Leipzig. He then moved to London and spent 1899 and 1900 there, attending classes at University College and translating German works into English.
He took 11th place in the London 1899 chess tournament (second section won by Frank James Marshall). 
Erskine returned to New Zealand, to shortly work as a boiler stoker, and then began working in industry, in the United States (1903–1904), and Australia (1905–1920). After 1920 he worked as a private consultant in Melbourne. He twice won New Zealand Chess Championship at Wellington 1928/29 (with a 100% score: 8/8) and Christchurch 1934/35.
Erskine Fellowship.
Erskine bequeathed his estate to the University of Canterbury to be held in trust to fund international exchanges of academic staff. Each year, approximately 70 Erskine fellows travel to Christchurch for periods of up to three months (with travel and per diem allowance funded) and between 18 and 25 Canterbury academics are funded to travel to overseas institutions.

Marco Blaauw

Marco Blaauw (born 23 September 1965 in Lichtenvoorde, Gelderland) is a Dutch trumpeter.
Biography.
Marco Blaauw studied trumpet at the Sweelinck Conservatorium in Amsterdam. He continued studying with Pierre Thibaud and with Markus Stockhausen. He has an international career as a trumpet soloist and is a permanent member of the ensemble musikFabrik in Cologne. Some of the orchestras and new music ensembles with which he has performed as soloist are: the Dutch Radio Symphony Orchestra, the National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra, WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Klangforum Wien, London Sinfonietta and Asko|Schönberg Ensemble.
Marco Blaauw's goal is the further development of the trumpet, its technique and its repertoire. He works in close collaboration both with the established and younger composers of our time. Many works have been written especially for Blaauw or have been inspired by his playing, including compositions by Peter Eötvös, Rebecca Saunders, Richard Ayres, Isabel Mundry and Hanna Kulenty. 
Since 1998, Marco Blaauw has worked intensely with Karlheinz Stockhausen, and has premiered solo roles in scenes of the opera cycle "LICHT". In August 2008 he presented the premiere of "HARMONIES for trumpet" from Stockhausen’s unfinished cycle "KLANG" for BBC Radio 3 in the Royal Albert Hall.
Marco Blaauw's performances are widely documented in radio and CD recordings. The first solo CD "Blaauw" was released in September 2005, his second solo CD, "HOT", came out in October 2006. In 2007 he presented "Improvisation", a duo album with Gijsbrecht Roye.
In 2003 Marco Blaauw was awarded the Orpheus Prize for his performance of Hanna Kulenty's "Trumpet Concerto" during the Warsaw Autumn Festival. In 2008 he received the Karel de Grote-award from the city of Nijmegen.
He is also active as a teacher with notable residencies since 2003 at the Stockhausen Courses in Kürten and in 2004 and 2006 at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. From August 2008 Marco Blaauw is guest teacher at the School of Music of Lucerne, Switzerland.
List of trumpets.
Marco Blaauw plays different sorts of trumpets and related instruments: C trumpet, Es flat/ D trumpet, Bflat trumpet, Piccolo trumpet, C-Cornet, Flugelhorn, Natural trumpet, Tibetian trumpet, Indian temple trumpet, Didgeridoo in D, Shofar (a horn of a ram), Conch (a shell) and the Double bell trumpet. He plays instruments manufactured by fellow Dutchman Hub van Laar.
Double Bell Trumpet.
One trumpet Marco Blaauw plays needs special attention: the double bell trumpet is a specially designed trumpet with two bells.
"The self designed trumpet is build by Dieter Gärtner, from the company Gärtner und Thul in Düren, Germany. The trumpet uses the standard three valves, plus a fourth and fifth valve. The fourth valve enables me to play quarter-tones, fast and over the whole range of the trumpet. An extra, surprisingly good and controllable effect is playing half-valve; in combination with the three “normal” valves, it sounds relatively well in tune over the whole range. It is like using a strange kind of mute. The fifth valve is for changing between the two bells: having two bells on a trumpet was an old dream of mine, it gives many extra possibilities:
Before starting experimenting, I considered it almost impossible to extend the trumpet and improve it in the same time. The cheerful experiment worked out very well though! It seems that the evolution of the trumpet is far from reaching an end-point."

Economic history of China before 1912

The economic history of China stretches over thousands of years and has undergone alternating cycles of prosperity and decline. China had, for most of the last two millennia, the world's largest and most advanced economy China's history is usually divided into three periods: The pre-imperial era, consisting of the era of before the unification of Qin, the early imperial era from Qin to Song, and the late imperial era, marked by the economic revolution that occurred during the Song Dynasty.
By roughly 10,000 BCE, in the Neolithic Era, agriculture was practiced in China. Stratified bronze-age cultures, such as Erlitou, emerged by the third millennium BCE. Under the Shang (c. 1600–1045 BCE) and Zhou (1045–771 BCE), a dependent labor force worked in large-scale foundries and workshops to produce bronzes and silk for the elite. The agricultural surpluses produced by the manorial economy supported these early handicraft industries as well as urban centers and considerable armies. This system began to disintegrate after the collapse of the Western Zhou Dynasty in 771 BCE, preceding the Spring and Autumn and Warring states eras.
As the feudal system collapsed, much legislative power was transferred from the nobility to local kings. A merchant class emerged during the Warring States period, resulting in increased trade. The new kings established an elaborate bureaucracy, using it to wage wars, build large temples, and perform public works projects. This new system rewarded talent over birthright; important positions were no longer occupied solely by nobility. The adoption of new iron tools revolutionized agriculture and led to a large population increase during this period. By 221 BCE, the state of Qin, which embraced reform more than other states, unified China, built the Great Wall, and set consistent standards of government. Although its draconian laws led to its overthrow in 206 BCE, the Qin institutions survived. During the Han Dynasty, China became a strong, unified, and centralized empire of self-sufficient farmers and artisans, though limited local autonomy remained.
The Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE) brought additional economic reforms. Paper money, the compass, and other technological advances facilitated communication on a large scale and the widespread circulation of books. The state's control of the economy diminished, allowing private merchants to prosper and a large increase in investment and profit. Despite disruptions during the Mongol conquest of 1279, the population much increased under the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty, but its GDP per capita remained static since then. In the later Qing period, China's economic development began to slow and Europe's rapid development since the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance enabled it to surpass China—an event known as the Great Divergence.
Pre-Imperial Era (ca. 10,000 – 221 BCE).
By Neolithic times, the tribes living in what is now the Yellow River valley were practicing agriculture. By the third millennium BCE, stratified bronze-age societies had emerged, most notably the Erlitou culture. The Erlitou dominated northern China and is identified with the Xia Dynasty, the first dynasty in traditional Chinese histiography. Erlitou was followed by the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties, which developed a manorial economy similar to that of medieval Western Europe. By the end of the Spring and Autumn period, this system began to collapse and was replaced by a prosperous economy of self-sufficient farmers and artisans by the Warring States Era. This transformation was completed when the State of Qin unified China in 221 BCE, initiating the imperial era of Chinese history.
The Neolithic and the early Bronze Age.
Agriculture began almost 10,000 years ago in several regions of modern-day China. The earliest domesticated crops were millet in the north and rice in the south. Some Neolithic cultures produced textiles with hand-operated spindle-whorls as early as 5000 BCE. The earliest silk remains date to the early third millennium BCE.
By the Longshan period (north China, c. 3000-2000 BCE), a large number of communities with stratified social structures had emerged.
The Erlitou culture (c. 1900-1350 BCE, named after a representative site in modern Henan) dominated northern China in the early second millennium BCE, when urban societies and bronze casting first appeared in the area. The cowries, tin, jade, and turquoise that were buried in Erlitou suggest that the Erlitou polity traded with many neighbors. A considerable labor force would be required to build the rammed-earth foundations of Erlitou buildings. Although the "highly stratified" Erlitou society has left no writing, some historians have identified Erlitou as a site from the possibly mythical Xia dynasty mentioned in traditional Chinese sources as preceding the Shang.
Only a strong centralized state led by rich elites could have produced the bronzes of the Erligang culture (c. 1600–1400 BCE or 1500–1300 BCE). The Erligang state, which archaeologist Robert Bagley has called "... the first great civilization of East Asia," interacted with neighboring states, which imported bronzes or the artisans who could cast them. These exchanges allowed the technique of bronze metallurgy to spread to surrounding polities. Some historians have identified Erligang as a Shang site because it corresponds with the area where traditional sources say the Shang were active, but no written source from the time exists to confirm this identification.
The Shang dynasty (ca. 1600 – ca. 1045 BCE).
The first site unequivocally identified with the Shang dynasty by contemporaneous inscriptions is Anyang, a Shang capital that became a major settlement around 1200 BCE. The staple crop of the Shang, a predominantly agricultural society, was millet, but rice and wheat were also cultivated in fields owned by the royal aristocracy. Agricultural surpluses produced by royal fields supported the Shang royal family and ruling elite, advanced handicraft industries (bronze, silk, etc.) and large armies. Large royal pastures provided animals for sacrifices and meat consumption. Other agricultural produce supported the population of Shang, estimated to be about 5.5 to 8 million people.
Since land was only cultivated for a few years before being left fallow, new lands constantly needed to be opened by drainage of low-lying fields or by clearing scrubland or forests. These tasks were performed by corvée labor under state supervision, often in the context of hunting expeditions.
Like their Neolithic predecessors, the Shang used spindle-wheels to make textiles, but the Shang labor force was more formally organized. By Shang times, controlled workers produced silk in workshops for the aristocracy. Fields and workshops were manned by labor of varying degrees of servitude. Some historians have called these dependent workers "slaves" and labelled the Shang a "slave society," but others reject such labels as too vague because we know too little about the nature of this labor force.
The Western Zhou (ca. 1045 – 771 BCE).
By traditional dating, the Zhou Dynasty defeated the Shang around 1045 BCE and took control of the Wei and Yellow River valleys that the Shang had dominated. Land continued to belong to the royal family, which re-distributed it among its dependents in a system that many historians have likened to the feudal organization of medieval Europe. Epigraphic evidence shows that, as early as the late 10th century BCE, land was being traded, though it was not yet considered private property. Edward Shaughnessy hypothesizes that this increase in the land exchanges resulted from the division of elite lineages into branches, increasing demand for land while its supply was diminishing.
The 4th-century book "Mencius" claims that the early Zhou developed the well-field system, a pattern of land occupation in which eight peasant families cultivated fields around a central plot that they farmed for the landlord. The system was named after the Chinese character for "well" ("jing" 井), which resembles the grid-like pattern in which these nine fields were supposedly arranged. Historians have generally doubted the existence of this idealized system, but some maintain that it may have existed informally in the early Zhou, when dependent tenants working on manorial estates paid corvée to their landlords instead of rent, as they would later.
Handicraft industries developed during the Shang, such as textiles, bronze and the production of weapons, were continued during the Zhou, but they were completely state-controlled. The Zhou government also controlled most commerce and exchange through appointing officials whose titles were "Jia", which later came to mean "merchant".
Spring and Autumn period (771–475 BCE).
The collapse of the Zhou initiated the Spring and Autumn Period, named after Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals. It was a time of war between states, when the Chinese feudal system fell into decline and trade began to flourish. Competition between states led to rapid technological advancement. Iron tools became available, producing agricultural surpluses that led to the collapse of the well-field system. Towards the end of this era, the introduction of iron technology caused the complete collapse of the feudal system and ushered in a new era of development. In this era the Chinese produced a number of notable accomplishments such as the first isolation of the element sulfur in the sixth century BC.
During the Spring and Autumn Period, many cities grew in size and population. The prosperous capital of Qi, Linzi had a population estimated at over 200,000 in 650 BCE, becoming one of the largest cities in the world. Alongside other large cities, Qi served as a center of administration, trade, and economic activity. Most of the cities' populations engaged in husbandry and were thus self-sufficient. The growth of these cities was an important development for the ancient Chinese economy.
Large-scale trade began in the Spring and Autumn Period as merchants transported goods between states. Currency was issued en masse to accommodate the new trade. Although some states restricted trade, others encouraged it. Zheng in Central China, promised not to regulate merchants. Zheng merchants became powerful throughout China as they carried goods from Yan in the north to Chu in the south.
As lords expanded their quantity of plots, the well-field system began to collapse, and this was hastened when the State of Lu changed its taxation system in 594 BCE. Under the new laws, grain producers were taxed upon each "mu" (A Chinese unit of land measurement equal to about 666 square meters) cultivated, rather than an equal amount being collected from each noble. As other states followed this example, large estates began to disintegrate, ending the well-field system. Free peasants became the majority of the population and provided a tax base for the emerging centralized state.
Warring States (475–221 BCE).
The Warring States Period saw rapid technological and philosophical advances. As rulers competed with each other to take control of China's states, they implemented various reforms, greatly changing China's economic system. Iron tools were produced on a massive scale, leading to the disintegration of the feudal system. Common-born landowners and merchants prospered and the aristocracy lost influence. Some merchants, such as Lü Buwei, may have become as wealthy as some states.
Cast iron was invented in China during the 4th century BCE. Although iron tools were manufactured during the Spring and Autumn Period, they became ubiquitous during the Warring States Era after large states began producing iron under government control. Governments, which controlled the large iron smelting works, had a monopoly on military equipment, which strengthened the state at the expense of the feudal lords. Iron agricultural tools allowed a massive increase in surplus farm goods, making the well-field system redundant.
After Shang Yang's reforms in the 3rd century BCE, land could be bought and sold, stimulating economic progress in agriculture and an increase in productivity. The newly powerful states undertook large-scale irrigation projects, such as the Zhengguo Canal and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. Thousands of "mu" of previously desolate land were cultivated and integrated into the Qin economy. The agricultural boom allowed larger armies. New agricultural techniques were introduced that formed the basis of Chinese agriculture for centuries to come. In the 6th century BCE, among other innovations, the iron plow, row cultivation, and intensive hoeing were introduced. The introduction of oxen in cultivation also began during this period.
In this era, the growing power of the state strengthened the monarchy, allowing it to undertake reforms to strengthen the monarch's authority. The most extensive of these reforms was carried out in Qin by Shang Yang, including the abolition of the feudal nobility, redistribution of nobles' land based on military merit, and allowing private ownership of land by discontinuing the Jintian system. Shang Yang encouraged the cultivation of unsettled lands, gave noble ranks to soldiers who performed well in battle, and established an efficient and strict legal code. Absolute monarchy persisted in China until its gradual weakening under the Song and Ming dynasties.
Early Imperial Era (221 BCE – 960 CE).
The Early imperial era was marked by a strong, unified and centralized monarchy, though local officials still maintained limited autonomy. During the early imperial era, self-sufficient peasant farmers and artisans dominated the economy and largely operated independently of the overall market. Commerce was relatively frequent, increasing after the Han Dynasty with the development of the silk road. Sinologist Joseph Needham has claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe from the 5th century BCE onwards by a substantial margin, while economic historian Angus Maddison estimates that China's GDP per capita remained below that of Western Europe until the fall of the Roman Empire. The Wu Hu uprising crippled the economy, which did not recover until the Tang, under which it transformed into the mercantile economy of the Song and Ming Dynasties.
Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE).
In 221 BCE, the State of Qin conquered the remaining states in China, becoming what scholars consider the first unified Chinese state. It quickly expanded, extending the Southern frontier from the Yangtze to modern Vietnam, and the northern frontier to modern Mongolia. While the early Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasties had nominal authority over all of China, the feudal system gave most regions a large degree of autonomy. Under the Qin, however, a centralized state was established, and the entire empire had uniform standards and currency to facilitate trade. In addition, the Qin government undertook many public works projects, like the Great Wall of China. The Qin initiated what is considered the "first Chinese empire", which lasted until the Wu Hu uprising.
The Qin emperor unified standards of writing, weight measurement, and wheel length, while abolishing the old currencies, which varied between states. He also issued a uniform code of laws throughout the empire, which made trade easier. Defensive walls between states were demolished because of their disruptive influence upon trade. The Qin Empire did not return to the old feudal system, but set up a system of 36 commandries, each governing a number of counties. Other Qin policies including heavy taxation of salt and iron manufactures, and forced migration of many Chinese towards new territories in the south and west.
The Qin government undertook many public works projects, the workers often being conscripted by the state in order to repay a tax debt. The most famous of these projects is the Great Wall of China, built to defend the state against Xiongnu incursions. Other Qin projects include the Lingqu Canal, which linked subsidiaries of the Yangtze and Pearl rivers and made possible the Qin's southern conquests, as well as an extensive road system estimated at .
However, Qin's legalist laws and the heavy burden of its taxes and corvee were not easily accepted by the rest of the empire. Unlike the other states, Qin specifically enacted laws to exile merchants and expropriate their wealth, as well as imposing monopolies on salt, iron, forests and other natural resources. Scholars note that the list of prominent merchants during the Warring States compiled in Sima Qian's Shiji (Grand History) during the Han dynasty does not include a single merchant from Qin. Rebellions occurred soon after the death of the first Qin emperor, and by 206 BCE, the Qin had collapsed.
Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).
The Han Dynasty is remembered as the first of China's Golden Ages. Emerging from the devastation of the Chu-Han contention, the Han Dynasty rapidly recovered to become one of the most powerful and populous nations on Earth. The Han reached its peak size under Emperor Wu, who subdued the Xiongnu and took control of the Hexi Corridor, opening up the Silk Road. The economy boomed during the Han, who had a registered population of 58 million. Large-scale enterprises emerged, some which were later temporarily nationalized during the Western Han. Technological innovations, such as the wheelbarrow, paper and a seismograph, were invented during this period.
Government policy under Western Han.
The reigns of the Emperors Wen and Jing were a period of peace and prosperity. During their reigns, state control of the economy was minimal, following the Taoist principle of Wu wei (無為), literally meaning "do nothing". As part of their laissez-faire policy, agricultural taxes were reduced from 1/15 of agricultural output to 1/30 and for a brief period, abolished entirely. In addition, the labor corvée required of peasants was reduced from 1 month every year to one month every three years. The minting of coins was privatized.
Both the private and public sectors flourished during this period. Under Emperor Jing, ... the ropes used to hang the bags of coins were breaking apart due to the weight, and bags of grain which had been stored for several years were rotting because they had been neglected and not eaten. Severe criminal punishments, such as cutting off the nose of an offender, were abolished.
The Han taxation system was based on two taxes; a land property tax and a poll tax. The average individual's tax burden consisted of one-thirtieth of the output on land, and a poll tax of 20 coins paid for every person between 7 and 14, with another poll tax for those above 14. Late in the Han Dynasty, the taxation rate for agriculture was reduced to one-hundredth, the lost revenue being made up with increased poll taxes. Merchants were charged at double the individual's rate. Another important component of the taxation system was Corvee labor. Every able-bodied man, defined as a man in good health above 20, was eligible for two years of military service or one month of military service and one year of corvee labor (later those above 56 were exempt from any military or corvee labor service).
Emperor Wu, on the other hand, sparked debate when he intervened into the economy to pay for his wars. His interventions were hotly debated between the Reformists, who were composed mainly of Confucian scholars favoring laissez-faire policies, and the Modernists, a group of government officials who supported the state monopolies on salt and iron and high taxation policies that Emperor Wu had pioneered. These debates were recorded in the book "Discourses on Salt and Iron", an important document showing ancient Chinese economic thought. Although the Modernist policies were followed through most of the Western Han after Emperor Wu, the Reformists repealed these policies in Eastern Han, save for the government monopoly on minting coins.
Developments in industry.
In the early Western Han, the wealthiest men in the empire were merchants who produced and distributed salt and iron and gained wealth that rivalled the annual tax revenues collected by the imperial court. These merchants invested in land, becoming great landowners and employing large numbers of peasants. A salt or iron industrialist could employ over one thousand peasants to extract either liquid brine, sea salt, rock salt, or iron ore. Advanced drilling techniques that allowed drilling up to 4800 feet were developed, allowing Chinese to extract salt and even natural gas for use in fuel and lighting.
Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) viewed such large-scale private industries as a threat to the state, as they drew the peasants' loyalties away from farming and towards the industrialists. Nationalizing the salt and iron trades eliminated this threat and produced large profits for the state. This policy was in line with Emperor Wu's expansionary goals of challenging the nomadic Xiongnu Confederation while colonizing the Hexi Corridor and what is now Xinjiang of Central Asia, Northern Vietnam, Yunnan, and North Korea. Historian Donald Wagner estimates that the production of the Han iron monopoly was roughly around 5,000 tons (assuming 100 tons per iron office), though the true figure was much higher due to illegal private production and growth after the privatization under Later Han.
Although many industrialists were bankrupted by this action, the government drafted former merchants like Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) to administer the national monopolies. Although a political faction in the court succeeded in having the central government monopolies abolished from 44 to 41 BCE, the monopolies resumed until the end of Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 CE) regime. After his overthrow, the central government relinquished control of these industries to private businessmen.
Liquor, another profitable commodity, was also nationalized by the government for a brief period between 98 and 81 BCE. After its return to private ownership, the government imposed heavy taxes on alcohol merchants.
In addition to the state's short-lived monopolies, the government operated a separate sector of handicraft industries intended to supply the needs of the court and army, a practice that was continued throughout Chinese history, though the importance of this sector decreased after the Tang Dynasty.
Light industries such as textiles and pottery also developed substantially during this period. In particular, hand-made pottery was made in large quantities; its price dropped substantially, allowing it to replace the bronze vessels that had been used during the Zhou. Porcelain also emerged during this period.
Developments in Agriculture.
Widespread use of iron tools that had begun under the Warring States period allowed Chinese agriculture to increase its efficiency. These include the "two-teeth" plow and an early sickle. The use of cattle-pulled plows improved with the introduction of three-cattle plow which required two operators and the two-cattle plow requiring one. Another important invention was the invention of the horse collar harness, in contrast with the earlier throat harness. This innovation, along with the wheelbarrow, integrated the Chinese economy by drastically decreasing transportation costs and allowing long-distance trade.
The seed drill was also developed during this period, allowing farmers to drill seeds in precise rows, instead of casting them out randomly. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, The 'Dai Tian Fa', an early form of crop rotation was introduced. Farmers divided their land into two portions, one of which would be planted, the other being left fallow.
Trade and currency.
Sources of revenue used to fund Emperor Wu's military campaigns and colonization efforts included seizures of lands from nobles, the sale of offices and titles, increased commercial taxes, and the issuing of government minting of coins. The central government had previously attempted—and failed—to monopolize coin minting, taking power from the private commandery-level and kingdom-level mints. In 119 BCE the central government introduced the "wushu" (五銖) coin weighing 3.2 g (0.11 oz), and by 113 BCE this became the only legally accepted coin in the empire, the government having outlawed private mints. Wang Mang's regime introduced a variety of new, lightweight currencies, including archaic knife money, which devalued coinage. The "wushu" coin was reinstated in 40 CE by the founder of Eastern Han, Emperor Guangwu, and remained the standard coin of China until the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE).
Trade with foreign nations on a large scale began during the reign of Emperor Wu, when he sent the explorer Zhang Yi to contact nations west of China in search of allies to fight the Xiongnu. After the defeat of the Xiongnu, however, Chinese armies established themselves in Central Asia, starting the famed Silk Road, which became a major avenue of international trade.
Wang Mang and the Later Han.
In 8 CE, the Han chancellor Wang Mang usurped the throne of the Han emperors and established his own dynasty, the Xin. Wang Mang wanted to restore the Han to what he believed to be the "idyllic" condition of the early Zhou. He outlawed the trading of land and slaves, and instituted numerous state monopolies. These ultra-modernist policies proved highly unpopular with the population, who overthrew and executed him in 25 CE and restored the Han dynasty.
Under the Later-or Eastern-Han Dynasty, which followed Wang Mang's overthrow, earlier laissez-faire policies were reinstated, and the government abolished conscription and withdrew from managing the economy. A new period of prosperity and intellectual thought, called the Rule of Ming and Zhang, began. This period saw the birth of the great scientist, Zhang Heng, and the invention of paper. However, by the end of the 2nd century CE, Han society began to disintegrate. In 184 CE, a peasant preacher started a rebellion called the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which ended the Han Dynasty in all but name.
Wei & Jin (220–304 CE).
Also known as the Three kingdoms period, the Wei and Jin eras, which followed the collapse of the Han Dynasty, saw large-scale warfare envelop China for the first time in more than 150 years. The death toll and subsequent economic damage were significant. Powerful aristocratic landowners offered shelter to displaced peasants, using their increased authority to reclaim privileges abolished during the Qin and Han. These refugees were no longer taxable by the state. During the Jin, the taxable population was 20 million; during the Han it had been 57 million. Most of North China was unified by Cao Cao, who founded the Wei Dynasty (220–265 CE), and the Jin reunified the remainder of China in 280 CE. The centralized state weakened after losing the tax revenue of those under the protection of large landowners. Nevertheless, the economy recovered slightly under the policies of Cao Cao, who nationalized abandoned land and ordered peasants to encourage peasants to work on them, as well as re-instituting the hated iron monopoly, which would continue under Jin and the Southern Dynasties. Later, the War of the Eight Princes, which, coupled with the a Jin policy of moving the barbarian Wu Hu into China to alleviate labor shortages caused the eventual fall of China.
Wu Hu (304–420 CE).
In 304 CE, there was a massive uprising of barbarian clans that were under Chinese control. Following several years of civil war between the various princes of the Jin dynasty, the Xiongnu, led by Liu Yuan, revolted and declared their independence from China. Several other groups under Chinese control subsequently revolted, including the Jie, Qiang, Di, and Xianbei. These groups became collectively known as the Wu Hu, committing genocide against Han Chinese in the Yellow River valley. The collapse of the Jin Empire quickly followed these revolts. The Wu Hu invasion caused large-scale depopulation and the market economy that developed during the Qin, Han, Wei and Jin to declined rapidly, allowing the feudal manorial economy returned to prominence. Large manorial estates were self-sufficient and isolated from the wider market. These estates were self-contained economies that practiced agriculture, herding, forestry, fishing, and the production of handicraft goods. Exchange was no longer carried out through money, but barter. Following the economic revival after the unification of the Sui, the manorial economy again declined.
A brief economic recovery occurred in the North under Fú Jiān, the Di ruler of Former Qin, who reunified North China. Fu Jian repaired irrigation projects constructed under Han and Jin, and set up hotels and stations for traders every 20 kilometers. Under Fu Jian's rule, trade and agriculture were significantly revived, and many nations again sent tribute to Fu Jian's court. This recovery ended when Fu Jian was defeated at the battle of Fei by Jin forces, causing his empire to collapse into a series of small states. This battle is considered one of the most important in Chinese history because it preserved Chinese civilization from the danger of destruction.
Meanwhile, the legitimate Jin dynasty had fled to the south, then an undeveloped periphery of the Chinese Empire. Jin rulers attempted to develop this region as a center of rule and as a base for the reconquest of their homeland. Jin rulers granted large tracts of land in the south to Chinese immigrants and landowners fleeing barbarian rule, who preserved the system of government that was in place before the uprising. The migration of northern people stimulated the southern economy, allowing it to rival the northern economy. Improved agricultural techniques introduced to the south increased production and a market economy survived as Jin rulers enforced laws. The improvement of the southern economy can be seen later when it financed Liu Yu's expeditions to recover Sichuan and most of the Chinese heartland from the barbarian states of the north.
Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–581 CE).
The Southern and Northern Dynasties, despite constant war, largely recovered from the Wu Hu uprising. The early part of the era saw the greater part of China reunified by the native Liu Song Dynasty, whose northern border extended to the Yellow River. The Liu Song founder and general, Liu Yu, reclaimed much of China's heartland, conquering most of the states that the Wu Hu had established in the 4th century CE, excluding the Xianbei state of Northern Wei. Under his son, China witnessed a brief period of prosperity during the Yuanjia era. However, a later Xianbei invasion once more confined the Chinese dynasties to the territories south of the Huai River. Henceforth, China was divided into the Northern and Southern dynasties, which developed separately; the north prospering under a new equal-field system, while the southern economy continued to develop in the fashion of Wei and Jin. In 589 CE, the Sui Dynasty restored native rule to northern China and reunified the country.
The Yuanjia era and development in the South.
The Yuanjia era, inaugurated by Liu Yu and his son, Wen Ti, was a period of prosperous rule and economic growth, despite ongoing war. Emperor Wen Ti was known for his frugal administration and his concern with the welfare of the people. Although he lacked the martial power of his father, he was an excellent economic manager. He reduced taxes and levies on peasants and encouraged them to settle in areas that had been reconquered by his father. He reduced the power of wealthy landowners and increased the taxable population. He also enacted a system of reviewing the performance of civil servants. As a result of his policies, China experienced an era of prosperity and economic recovery.
During the Yuanjia era, the Chinese developed the co-fusion process of steel manufacturing, which involved melting cast iron and wrought iron together to create steel, increasing the quality and production volume of Chinese iron.
Towards the end of Wen Ti's reign, the Xianbei state of Northern Wei began to strengthen, and decisively defeated an attempt by Wen Ti to destroy it. Following this victory, Wei launched repeated incursions into the northern provinces, finally capturing them in 468 CE.
The economic prosperity of southern China continued after Liu Song's fall and was greatest during the succeeding Liang Dynasty, which briefly reconquered the North with 7,000 troops under the command of general Chen Qingzhi. The Liang emperor, Wu Ti, gave a grant of 400 million coins to Buddhist monasteries, indicating the amount of wealth present in the south. It was recorded that during his reign, the city of Nanjing had a population of up to 1.4 million, exceeding that of Han-era Luoyang. The Southern Dynasties' economy eventually declined after the disastrous sacking of Nanjing by the barbarian general Hou Jin.
Sinification and division in the North.
After the Xianbei conquest of Northern China, it experienced an economic recovery under the Northern Wei that was even greater than the prosperous era of Yuanjia. This came mostly under the rule of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei, who introduced several reforms designed to further sinify Northern Wei, which included banning the Xianbei language and customs and promoting Chinese law, language and surnames. A new agricultural system was introduced; in the equal-field system, the state rented land to the peasant laborers for life, reclaiming it after the tenant's death. Peasants also received smaller, private plots that could be inherited. Cattle and farm tools were also rented or sold to peasants.
The state also introduced the Fubing system, where soldiers would farm as well as undergoing military training. This military system was used until the Tang Dynasty, and empowered Han Chinese, who comprised the majority of the army. In addition, Xiaowen strengthened the state's control over the provinces by appointing local officials rather than relying on local landowners, and paying officials with regular salaries. The capital was moved to Luoyang, in the center of the North China Plain, which revitalized the city and the surrounding provinces. Xiaowen's reforms were very successful and lead to prosperity for north China. Under Emperor Xiaowen, the taxable population was an estimated 30 million, which surpassed that under the Jin.
After Xiaowen's rule, Northern Wei's economy began to deteriorate, and famines and droughts undermined Wei rule. From 523 CE onwards, conservative Xianbei noblemen dominated the north and reversed much of Xiaowen's reforms, setting up their own regimes and warring against each other. It was not until 577 that North China was again reunited by Northern Zhou, which was soon usurped by Han Chinese Yang Jian, who restored native rule over North China.
Sui Dynasty (581–618 CE).
The Sui Dynasty was established over the Northern Zhou, whose throne was usurped by Yang Jian in 581 CE. Yang Jian quickly enacted a series of policies to restore China's economy. His reunification of China marked the creation of what some historians call the 'Second Chinese Empire', spanning the Sui, T'ang and Northern Song dynasties. Despite its brevity, the Sui reunified China, and its laws and administration formed the basis of the later Tang, Song and Ming dynasties. The Sui Dynasty had a population of about 45 million at its peak.
One of Yang Jian (or Sui Wen Ti)'s first priorities was the reunification of China. Chen, which ruled the south, was weak compared to Sui and its ruler was incompetent and pleasure-loving. South China also had a smaller population than the north. After eight years of preparation, Sui armies marched on and defeated Chen in 589 CE, reunifying China and prompting a recovery in the Chinese economy. The registered population increased by fifty percent from 30 to 46 million in twenty years.
To encourage economic growth, the Sui government issued a new currency to replace those issued by its predecessors, Northern Zhou and Chen. They also encouraged foreign merchants to travel to China and import goods, and built numerous hotels to house them.
The Sui continued to use the equal-field system introduced by Northern Wei. Every able-bodied male received 40 mou of freehold land and a lifetime lease of 80 mou of land, which was returned to the state when the recipient died. Even women could received a lifetime lease of 40 mou of land which was returned to the state upon her death. The Sui government charged three "Shi" of grain each year. Peasants were required to perform 20 days of labor for the state per year, but those over 50 could instead pay a small fee.
In 604 CE, Wen Ti was assassinated by his son Yang Guang, who became Yang Ti of Sui. Yang Ti was an ambitious ruler who immediately undertook many projects, including the building of the Grand Canal and the reconstruction of the Great Wall. Thousands of forced laborers died while building the projects, and eventually women were required to labor in the absence of men. Sui Yang Ti also launched a series of unsuccessful campaigns against Goguryeo. These campaigns negatively impacted the image of the dynasty, while his policies drove the people to revolt. Agrarian uprisings and raids by the Gokturks became common. In 618 CE, Yang Ti was assassinated and the Sui Dynasty ended.
Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).
The Tang Dynasty was another golden age, beginning in the ruins of the Sui. By 630, the Tang had conquered the powerful Gokturk Khagnate, preventing threats to China's borders for more than a century. A series of strong and efficient rulers, beginning with the founder and including a woman, expanded the Tang Empire to the point that it rivaled the later Yuan, Ming and Qing. The Tang was a period of rapid economic growth and prosperity, seeing the beginnings of woodblock printing. Tang rulers issued large amounts of currency to facilitate trade and distributed land under the equal-field system. The population recovered to and then surpassed Han levels, reaching an estimated 80 million. Although the state weakened after the disastrous An Shi Rebellion, and withdrew from managing the economy in the 9th century, this withdrawal encouraged economic growth and helped China's economy to develop into the mercantile economy of the Song and Ming Dynasties.
Economic development before the An Shi Rebellion.
Emperor Taizong of Tang, the second ruler of the Tang Dynasty, is regarded as one of the greatest rulers in Chinese history. Under his rule, China progressed rapidly from the ruins of a civil war to a prosperous and powerful nation. His reign is called the Zhenkuan era. Taizong reduced conscript labor requirements and lowered taxes; in addition, he was careful to avoid undertaking projects that might deplete the treasury and exhaust the strength of the population. Under his reign, a legal code called the Code of Tang was introduced, moderating the laws of the Sui.
During Taizong's reign and until the An Shi Rebellion, the Chinese Empire went through a relatively peaceful period of economic development. Taizong and his son's conquest of the Gokturk, Xueyantue, Gorguryeo and other enemy empires ensured relative peace for China. Control over the western provinces of China reopened the Silk Road, allowing trade between China and the regions to its west to flourish. Tang armies repeatedly intervened in the western regions to preserve this state of peace and prosperity.
The equal-field system did not allow large land transactions and thus during the early Tang estates remained small. The Tang government managed the economy through the bureaucratic regulation of markets, limiting the times where they could exchange goods, setting standards for product quality, and regulating prices of produce.
During the Tang, the taxation system was based on the equal-field system, which equalized wealth among the farmers. The tax burden of peasants was based on population per household, rather than the value of property. The standard tax amounted to 2 tan (about 100 litres) of grain, as well as 2 Zhang (around 3 1/3 meters) and 5 Chi (about 1/3 of a meter) of cloth. The peasant was eligible for 20 days' conscripted labor; if he defaulted he was obliged to pay 3 Chi of cloth per day missed. Assuming each farmer had 30 mou of land which produced 1 tan of grain a year, the tax rate amounted to 25% of the farmer's income. Commercial taxes were lighter, at 3.3% of income.
The Tang government operated a huge handicraft industry, separate from the private handicraft industry that served the majority of the population. The public handicraft industry provided the Tang government, army and nobility with various products. The government's handicraft industries retarded the growth of the private sector which did not develop rapidly until after the Anshi Rebellion, when the Tang government's interference in the economy (and the size of its government handicraft industries) drastically decreased. Despite this, a large number of households worked in private industry; scholars have estimated that 10% of Tang China's population lived in cities.
The height of Tang prosperity came during the Kaiyuan Era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, who expanded Tang influence westward to the Aral Sea. Emperor Xuan was a capable administrator, and his Kaiyuan Era is often compared with the earlier Zhenkuan era in efficiency of administration. After this era, the Tang Dynasty started to decline.
Economic development after the An Shi Rebellion.
Emperor Xuanzong's reign ended with the Arab victory at Talas and the An Shi Rebellion, the first war inside China in over 120 years, led by a Sogdian general named An Lushan who used a large number of foreign troops. The Tang economy was devastated as the northern regions, the mainstay of economic activity, were destroyed. The cities of Luoyang and Chang'an were reduced to ruins. After the war, the Tang central government never recovered its former power, and local generals became independent of Tang rule. These generals wielded enormous power, passed on their titles by heredity, collected taxes, and raised their own armies. Although most of these jiedushi were quelled by the early 9th century, the jiedushi of Hebei, many of them former officers of An Lushan, retained their independence.
The weakened Tang government was forced to abolish many of its regulations and interventions after the rebellion; this unintentionally stimulated trade and commerce in Tang China, which reached an apogee in the early 9th century. The economic center of China shifted southwards because the north had been devastated.
The equal-field system, which had formed the basis of agriculture for the past two and a half centuries, began to collapse after the An Shi Rebellion. The equal-field system had relied on the state having large amounts of land, but state landholdings had decreased as they were privatized or granted to peasants. Landowners perpetually enlarging their estates exacerbated the collapse. The Fubing system, in which soldiers served the army and farmed on equal-field land was abolished and replaced with the Mubing system, which relied on a volunteer and standing army. In 780 CE, the Tang government discontinued the equal field system and reorganized the tax system, collecting taxes based on property value twice a year, in spring and autumn.
Woodblock printing began to develop during the 8th and 9th centuries. This grew out of the huge paper industry that had emerged since the Han. Woodblock printing allowed the rapid production of many books, and increased the speed at which knowledge spread. The first book to be printed in this manner, with a production date, was the "Jin Gang Jin", a Buddhist text printed in 868 CE, but the hand-copying of manuscripts still remained much more important for centuries to come. Until During the latter era of the Tang Dynasty, overseas trade also began with East Africa, India, and the Middle East.
Although the economy recovered during the 9th century, the central government was weakened. The most pressing issue was the government's salt monopoly, which raised revenue after the equal-field system collapsed and the government could no longer collect land tax effectively. After the An Shi Rebellion, the Tang government monopolized salt to raise revenue; it soon accounted for over half the central government's revenues. During the reign of emperors Shi and Yi, private salt traders were executed, and the price of salt was so high that many people could not afford it. Eventually, private salt traders allied and rebelled against the Tang army. This rebellion, known as the Huang Chao Rebellion, lasted ten years and destroyed the countryside from Guangzhou to Chang'an. Following the rebellion, two generals, the Shatuo Li Keqiang and the former rebel Zhu Wen, dominated the Tang court. Civil war broke out again in the early 10th century, ending with Zhu Wen's victory. Following his victory, Zhu Wen forced the Tang emperor to abdicate, and the Tang empire disintegrated into a group of states known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms.
Five Dynasties & Ten kingdoms (907–960 CE).
The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms was a period of warfare and disruption. After 907 CE, the Tang government effectively disintegrated into several small states in the south, while the north saw a series of short-lived dynasties and barbarian invasions. A key event of the era was the conquest of North China by the Shatuo Turks. During their rule, the Shatuo gave the vital Sixteen Prefectures area, containing the natural geographical defenses of North China and the eastern section of the Great Wall, to the Khitan, another barbarian people. This effectively left Northern China defenseless against incursions from the north, a major factor in the later fall of the Song Dynasty. The Shatuo and Khitan invasions severely disrupted economic activity in the north and displaced economic activity southwards, and native Chinese rule was not restored until the Later Zhou dynasty, the Song's precursor.
The southern provinces remained relatively unaffected by the collapse. The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period was largely one of continued prosperity in these regions.
Late Imperial Era (960–1911 CE).
In 960 CE, Zhao Kuangyi led a coup which established the sixth dynasty in fifty years. The Song Dynasty saw a steep economic rise of China. The Late Imperial Era, encouraged by technological advancement, saw the beginnings of large-scale enterprise, waged labor and the issuing of paper money. The economy underwent large increases in manufacturing output. Overseas trade flourished under the Ming Dynasty. Investment, capital, and commerce were liberalized as technology advanced and the central state weakened. Government manufacturing industries were privatized. The emergence of rural and urban markets, where production was geared towards consumption, was a key development in this era. China's growing wealth in this era lead to the loss of martial vigor; the era involved two periods of native rule, each followed by periods of alien rule. By the end of the isolationist Manchu Qing Dynasty (1662–1911 CE), China's development slowed, falling behind that of the west.
Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE).
In 960 CE, the Later Zhou general Zhao Kuanyi overthrew his imperial master and established the Song Dynasty, the sixth in fifty-three years. Nineteen years later, he had reunified most of China. This was one of the most prosperous periods in Chinese history. Unlike its predecessors, the monarchy and aristocracy weakened under the Song, allowing a class of non-aristocratic gentry to gain power. The central government withdrew from managing the economy (except during Wang Anshi's chancellorship and the Southern Song), provoking drastic economic changes. Technological advances encouraged growth; the so-called Four Great Inventions: gunpowder, woodblock printing, and the compass, were invented or perfected during this era. The population rose to more than 100 million during the Song period. However, the Song eventually became the first unified Chinese dynasty to be completely conquered by invaders.
Developments in industry.
During the 11th century, China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production. Iron production rose fivefold from 800 to 1078, to about 125,000 English tons (114,000 metric tons), not counting unregistered iron production. Initially, the government restricted the iron industry, but the restrictions on private smelting was lifted after the prominent official Bao Qingtian's petition to the government Production of other metals also soared; officially registered Song production of silver, bronze, tin, and lead increased to 3, 23, 54, and 49 times that of Tang levels. Officially registered Salt production also rose at least 57%.
The government regulated several other industries. Sulfur, an ingredient in gunpowder – a crucial new weapon introduced during the Tang – became a growth industry, and in 1076 was placed under government control. In Sichuan province, revenue from the Song government's monopoly on tea was used to purchase horses for the Song's cavalry forces. Chancellor Wang Anshi instated monopolies in several industries, sparking controversy.
In order to supply the boom in the iron and other industries, the output of mines increased massively. Near Bianjing, the Song capital, according to one estimate over one million households were using coal for heating, an indication of the magnitude of coal use. Light industries also began to prosper during the Song, including porcelainwhich replaced potteryshipbuilding and textiles. Compared with the Tang, textile production increased 55%. The historian Xie Qia estimates that over 100,000 households were working in textile production by Song times, an indicator of the magnitude of the Song textile industry. The urbanization rate of the Song increased to 12%, compared with 10% during the Tang.
Developments in agriculture.
Agriculture advanced greatly under the Song. The Song government started a series of irrigation projects that increased cultivatable land, and encouraged peasants to cultivate more land. The total area of cultivated land was greatly increased to 720 million mou, a figure unsurpassed by later dynasties. A variety of crops were cultivated, unlike the monocultures of previous dynasties. Specialized crops like oranges and sugar cane were regularly planted alongside rice. Unlike the earlier self-sufficient peasantry of the Han and Tang eras, rural families produced a surplus which could be sold. The income allowed families to afford not only food, but charcoal, tea, oil, and wine. Many Song peasants supplemented their incomes with handicraft work.
New tools, like the Water Wheel, greatly enhanced productivity. Although most peasants in China were still primarily rice farmers, some farmers specialized in certain crops. For example, Luoyang was known for its flower cultivation; flower prices reached such exorbitant prices that one bulb reached the price of 10,000 coins. An important new crop introduced during the Song was Champa rice, a new breed which had superior yields to earlier forms of rice and greatly increased rice production. The practice of multiple cropping, which increased yields by allowed farmers to harvest rice twice a year, was a key innovation of the Song era. Per-mou agricultural output doubled for South China, while increasing only slightly in the north. Scholars offer "conservative estimates" which suggest that agricultural yields rose at least 20% during the Song. Other scholars note that although taxable land rose only 5% during the Song, the actual amount of grain revenues taken in increased by 46%.
Agricultural organization also changed. Unlike the Han and Tang, in which agriculture was dominated by self-sufficient farmers, or the pre-Warring states era and era of division (period between Han and Tang), which was dominated by aristocratic landowners, during the Song agriculture was dominated by non-aristocratic landowners. The majority of farmers no longer owned their land; they became tenants of these landowners, who developed the rural economy through investment. This system of agriculture was to continue until the establishment of the People's Republic of China under Mao.
Developments in Commerce.
During the Song Dynasty, the merchant class became more sophisticated, well-respected, and organized. The accumulated wealth of the merchant class often rivaled that of the scholar-officials who administered the affairs of government. For their organizational skills, Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais state that Song Dynasty merchants:
... set up partnerships and joint stock companies, with a separation of owners (shareholders) and managers. In large cities, merchants were organized into guilds according to the type of product sold; they periodically set prices and arranged sales from wholesalers to shop owners. When the government requisitioned goods or assessed taxes, it dealt with the guild heads. Unfortunately, like their counterparts in Europe, these guilds restricted economic growth through collaboration with government to restrict competition.
Large privately owned enterprises dominated the market system of urban Song China. There was a large black market, which grew after the Jur'chen conquest of North China in 1127 CE. Around 1160 CE, black marketeers smuggled some 70 to 80 thousand cattle.
There were many successful small kilns and pottery shops owned by local families, along with oil presses, wine-making shops, and paper-making businesses. The "... inn keeper, the petty diviner, the drug seller, the cloth trader," also experienced increased economic success.
Song abolition of trade restrictions greatly aided the economy. Commerce increased in frequency and could be conducted anywhere, in contrast to earlier periods where trade was restricted to the 'Fang' and 'Shi' areas. In all the major cities of the Song Dynasty, many shops opened. Often, shops selling the same product were concentrated into one urban area. For example, all the rice shops would occupy one street, and all the fish shops another. Unlike the later Ming Dynasty, most businesses during the Song Dynasty were producers and retailers, selling the products they produced, thus creating a mixture of handicraft and commerce. Although the Song Dynasty saw some large enterprises, the majority of enterprises were small.
Overseas commerce also prospered with the invention of the compass and the encouragement of Song rulers. Developments in shipping and navigation technologies allowed trade and investment on a large scale. The Song-era Chinese could conduct large amounts of overseas trade, bringing some merchants great fortune. Song-era commercial enterprises became very complex. The accumulated wealth of merchants often rivalled that of the scholar-officials who administered the affairs of government.
Developments in currency.
The prosperous Song economy resulted in an increase in the minting of currency. By 1085 CE, the output of copper currency reached 6 billion coins a year, compared to 5.86 billion in 1080 CE. 327 million coins were minted annually in the Tang Dynasty's prosperous Tianbao period of 742–755 CE, and only 220 million coins minted annually from 118 BCE to 5 CE during the Han Dynasty.
Paper receipts of deposit first appeared in the 10th century, but the first officially sponsored bills were introduced in Sichuan Province, where the currency was metallic and extremely heavy. Although businesses began to issue private bills of exchange, by the mid-11th century the central government introduced its paper money, produced using woodblock printing and backed by bronze coins. The Song government had also been amassing large amounts of paper tribute. Each year before 1101 CE, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone sent 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In the Southern Song, standard currency bearing a marked face value, was used. However, a lack of standards caused face values to wildly fluctuate. A nationwide standard paper currency was not produced until 1274 CE, two years before the Southern Song's fall.
Song fiscal administration.
The Song government instituted a taxation system on agriculture in which a property value tax was collected twice every year, amounting to roughly 10% of income. However, the actual level was higher due to numerous surcharges. Commercial taxes were around 2%. In an important change from Tang practices, however, the Song did not attempt to regulate prices and markets, with the exception of the time of Wang Anshi, though it also instituted an indirect monopoly in salt, in which merchants had to deliver grain to the state before being allowed to sell salt.
In 1069 CE, Wang Anshi, whose ideas were similar to the modern welfare state, became chancellor. Believing that the state must provide for the people, and pressed by the need for revenues to wage an irrentist war against the Xi Xia and Liao, he initiated a series of reforms. These reforms included nationalizing industries such as tea, salt and liquor, and adopting a policy of directly transporting goods in abundance in one region to another, which Wang believed would eliminate the need for merchants. Other policies included a rural credit program for peasants, the replacement of corvee labor with a tax, lending peasants military horses for use in peacetime, compulsory military training for civilians, and a "market exchange bureau" to set prices. These policies were extremely controversial, especially to Orthodox Confucians who favored laissez faire, and were largely repealed after Wang Anshi's death, except during the reign of Emperor Huizong.
A second, more serious attempt to intervene in the economy occurred in the late 13th century CE, when the Song Dynasty suffered from fiscal problems while trying to defend themselves against Mongol invasions. The Song chancellnor Jia Sidao attempted to solve the problem through land nationalization, a policy that was heavily opposed and later withdrawn.
Fall of the Song.
The prosperity of the Song was interrupted by the invasion of Jur'chen Jin in 1127 CE. After a successful alliance with the Jin in which the Song destroyed its old enemy the Khitan, the Jin attacked the Song and sacked its capital in Kaifeng. The invasion preceded 15 years of constant warfare which ended when the Song court surrendered territory north of the Huai River in exchange for peace, despite victories by the Song general Yue Fei, who had almost defeated the Jur'chens. The southern Chinese provinces became the center of commerce. Millions of Chinese fled Jur'chen rule to the South, which the Song Dynasty still held.
Due to the new military pressure of the Jur'chens, the Southern Song massively increased the tax burden to several times of that of the Northern Song. The Southern Song maintained an uneasy truce with the Jin until the rise of the Mongols, with whom Song allied to destroy the Jin in 1234 CE. Taking advantage of this, the Song army briefly recaptured their lost territory south of the Yellow River as the Mongols withdrew. However, a flood of the Yellow River, coupled with Mongol attacks, eventually forced the Song to withdraw.
Seeking to conquer China, the Mongol Empire launched a series of attacks on the Song. By the 1270s, the Song economy had collapsed from the burden of taxes and inflation which the Song government used to finance its war against the Mongols. In 1275 CE, helped by Frankish counterweight trebuchets designed by Muslim engineers, the Mongols defeated the Song army near Xiangyang and captured Hangzhou, the Song capital, the following year. Song resistance ended at the Battle of Yamen, in which the last Song emperor drowned with the remnants of his navy.
The destruction caused by the barbarian invasions in the later half of the Song represented a major setback in China's development.
Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty (1271–1368 CE).
The Mongol Yuan Dynasty was the first foreign dynasty to rule the whole of China. As the largest khanate in the Mongol Empire, the emperors of Yuan had nominal authority over the other three Mongol Empires. This period of Pax Mongolica stimulated trade. However, millions of Chinese died because of the Mongol conquest. Under Mongol rule, approximately 65 million people were registered in 1290 CE; in 1215 CE, the dynasties of Jur'chen Jin and Song had registered populations of between 110 and 120 million. In addition, the Mongol government later imposed high taxes and extensively nationalized major sectors of the economy, greatly damaging what was left of China's economic development.
In their conquest of China, particularly the north under Jur'chen Jin, the Mongols resorted to scorched earth policies, destroying entire provinces. Mongol forces carried out massacres in cities they captured, and one Khan proposed that all Chinese under Mongol rule be killed and their lands turned to pasture, but was persuaded against this by his minister Yelu Chucai, who proposed that taxing the region's inhabitants was more advantageous than killing them.
Kublai Khan, after becoming ruler of China, extended the Grand Canal, connecting the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, to the capital, Beijing. This eased transportation between the south, now the hub of economic activity, and Beijing. This enhanced Beijing's status, it having formerly been a peripheral city, and was important to later regimes' decisions to have it remain the capital.
The Yuan Government revolutionized the economy by introducing paper currency as the predominant circulating medium. The founder of the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan, issued paper money known as Chao in his reign. Chinese paper money was guaranteed by the State and not by the private merchant or private banker. The concept of banknotes was not brought up in the world ever since until during the 13th century in Europe, with proper banknotes appearing in the 17th century. The original notes during the Yuan Dynasty were restricted in area and duration as in the Song Dynasty, but in the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund their ruling in China, began printing paper money without restrictions on duration. Chinese paper money was therefore guaranteed by the State and not by the private merchant or private banker.
Kublai and his fellow rulers encouraged trade between China and other Khanates of the Mongol Empire. During this era, trade between China and the Middle East increased, and many Arabs, Persians, and other foreigners entered China, some permanently immigrating. It was during this period that Marco Polo visited China. Although Kublai Khan wished to identify with his Chinese subjects, Mongol rule was strict and foreign to the Chinese. Civil service examinations, the traditional way that Chinese elites entered the government, was ended, and most government positions were held by non-Chinese, especially the financial administration of the state.
Over-spending by Kublai and his successor caused them to resort to high taxes and extensive state monopolization of major sectors of the economy to fund their extravagant spending and military campaigns, which became a major burden on the Chinese economy. State monopolies were instituted in salt, iron, sugar, porcelain, tea, vinegar, alcohol and other industries. The most controversial of Kublai's policies, however, was opening the tombs of the Song emperors to gain treasure for the treasury, and issuing large amounts of notes which caused hyperinflation. These policies greatly conflicted with Confucian ideals of frugal government and light taxation. As a result of Kublai's policies, and the discrimination of the Mongols towards the Chinese, South China was beset by violent insurrections against Mongol rule. Many Chinese refused to serve or associate themselves with the Yuan administration, who they viewed as barbarian despots.
During the 1340s CE, frequent famines, droughts, and plagues encouraged unrest among the Chinese. In 1351 CE, a peasant rebel leader, who claimed he was the descendant of the Song Emperor Huizong, sought to restore the Song by driving out the Mongols. By 1360 CE, much of South China was free of Mongol rule and had been divided into regional states, such as Zhu Yuanzhang's Ming, Zhang Shichen's Wu and Chen Yolian's Han. On the other hand, North China became divided between regional warlords who were only nominally loyal to the Yuan. In 1368 CE, after reunifying South China, the Ming Dynasty advanced northward and captured Beijing, ending the Yuan.
Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 CE).
Following the unrest in the late Yuan Dynasty, the peasant Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion against Mongol rule. He founded the Ming Dynasty, whose reign is considered one of China's Golden Ages. Private industries replaced those managed by the state. Vibrant foreign trade allowed contact to become established between East and West. Cash crops were more frequently grown, specialized industries were founded, and the economic growth caused by privatization of state industries resulted in one of the most prosperous periods in Chinese history, exceeding that of the earlier Song Dynasty.
The Ming was also a period of technological progress, though less so than the earlier Song. It is estimated that Ming China had a population of approximately 150 million in 1600.
Recovery under Hongwu and Yongle.
Zhu Yuanzhang, also called the Hongwu Emperor, was born of a peasant family and was sympathetic towards peasants. Zhu enacted a series of policies designed to favor agriculture at the expense of other industries. The state gave aid to farmers, providing land and agricultural equipment and revising the taxation system. The state also repaired many long-neglected canals and dikes that had aided agriculture. In addition, the Ming Dynasty reinstated the examination system.
Hongwu's successor and grandson, the Jianwen Emperor, was overthrown by his uncle, Zhu Di, called the Yongle Emperor, in a bloody civil war that lasted three years. Zhu Di was more liberally-minded than his father and he repealed many of the controls on gentry and merchants. Thus, his reign is sometimes regarded as a 'second founding' of the Ming Dynasty. The expeditions of his eunuch Zheng He created new trade routes. Under Yongle's rule, Ming armies enjoyed continued victories against the Mongols, who were forced to acknowledge him as their ruler. He also moved the capital to Beijing. By Yongle's reign, China had recovered the territories of Eastern Xinjiang, Manchuria, Tibet, and those lost during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Era.
The Ming fiscal administration.
The Ming government has been described as "... one of the greatest achievements of Chinese civilization". Although it began as a despotic regime, the Ming government evolved into a system of power-sharing between the emperor and the civil service.
The Ming government collected far fewer revenues than the Song Dynasty. Regional tax quotas set up by the Ming emperor Tai-Tzu would be collected, though in practice Ming revenues were markedly lower than the quotas declared. The gentry class won concessions from the government and resisted tax increases. Throughout the Ming Dynasty, the state was constantly underfunded. Unlike earlier dynasties such as the Tang and Song, and later dynasties such as the Qing, the Ming did not regulate the economy, but had a laissez-faire policy similar to that of the Han Dynasty. The Cambridge history of China volume on the Ming Dynasty stated that:
Ming government allowed those Chinese people who could attain more than mere subsistence to employ their resources mostly for the uses freely chosen by them, for it was a government that, by comparison with others throughout the world then and later, taxed the people at very low levels and left most of the wealth generated by its productive people in the
regions where that wealth was produced.
Key Ming taxes included the land tax (21 million taels), the service levy (direct requisitioning of labor services and goods from civilians, valued at about 10 million taels), and the revenue from the Ming salt monopoly (2 million taels). Other miscellaneous sources of revenue included the inland customs duty (343,729 taels), sale of rank (500,000 taels), licensing fees for monks (200,000  taels), and fines (300,000 taels) and others, which all added up to about 4 million taels. The overall Ming tax rate was very low, at around 3 to 4%. However, by the end of the dynasty, this situation had changed dramatically. Zhang Juzheng instituted the one whip reform, in which the arbitrary service levy was merged into the land tax. The Ming government's salt monopoly was undermined by private sellers, and had collapsed completely by the 15th century; government officials estimated that three-quarters of salt produced was being sold privately.
Developments in Commerce and currency.
The Ming's overseas trade began when Zhu Di launched extensive expeditions to southern India and Africa, increasing China's contacts in those areas and establishing state-regulated trade there.
The Ming government often intervened in foreign trade. Under the reigns of Emperors Hongwu, Yongle and Jiajing, foreign trade by private merchants was prohibited completely. Merchants became discontent and engaged in an illegal trade network, which the Ming state could not curtail. Merchants pressured the government repeatedly to lift the prohibition, or to at least ignore it. In 1567 CE, the Hai Jin, or prohibition on overseas trade, was lifted completely, and an extensive expansion of trade followed, with only trade to nations at war with China prohibited. This trade was estimated by Joseph Needham at about 300 million taels from 1567 CE to 1644 CE. At that time, Twitchett claims that China, apart from being a lucrative market for Europeans, was the largest and wealthiest nation on Earth, although the economic historian Angus Maddison estimates its GDP per capita to correspond to the Asian average and lower than Europe's. One of the most important parts of this trade was the importation of silver.
Initially, Hongwu issued paper fiat currency as the standard currency, while private providers issued currency based on metals. Eventually, the state stopped issuing currency because the population lost faith in the fiat paper, which was frequently inflated by Hongwu. By 1425 CE, paper currency was worth approximately 0.014% of its original value. Although the Ming government attempted to stop the inflow of silver, it proved too profitable to halt. Overseas trade brought great prosperity to China, as Japanese and European importers paid for Chinese products with silver, thus monetizing China's economy. The demand for silver was so great that it overwhelmed the earlier paper currency used by the Ming, and silver soon became the common medium of exchange.
In the mid-15th century, a severe decline in the production of silver caused a severe monetary contraction and forced the Ming economy to operate under a monetary constraint, where even counterfeiters' supply of metal decreased.
Developments in industry.
After 1400, Ming China's economic recovery led to high economic growth and the revival of heavy industries such as coal and iron. Industrial output reached new heights surpassing that of the Song. Unlike the Song, however, the new industrial centres were located in the south, rather than in North China, and did not have ready access to coal, a factor that may have contributed to the Great Divergence. Iron output increased to triple Song levels, at well over 300,000 tons. Further innovations helped improve industrial capability to above Song levels. Many Ming-era innovations were recorded in the Tiangong Kaiwu, an encyclopedia compiled in 1637.
Developments in agriculture.
Under the Ming, some rural areas were reserved exclusively for the production of cash crops. Agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, allowed the production of a sizable agricultural surplus, which formed the basis of the rural economy. Alongside other crops, rice was grown on a large scale. The population growth and the decrease in fertile land made it necessary that farmers produce cash crops to earn a living. Landed, managed estates grew substantially; while in 1379 only 14,241 households had over 700 mou, by the end of the Ming some large landowners had over 70,000 mou. Increasing commercialization caused huge advances in productivity during the Ming Dynasty, allowing a greater population.
Many markets, with three main types, were established in the countryside. In the simplest markets, goods were exchanged or bartered. In 'urban-rural' markets, rural goods were sold to urban dwellers; landlords residing in cities used income from rural landholdings to facilitate exchange in the cities. Merchants bought rural goods in large quantities and sold them in these markets. The 'national market' developed during the Song Dynasty became more important during the Ming. In addition to the merchants and barter, this type of market involved products produced directly for the market. Many Ming peasants no longer relied upon subsistence farming; they produced products for the market, which they sold for a profit. The Cambridge history states about the Ming that:
"The commercialization of Ming society within the context of expanding communications may be regarded as a distinguishing aspect of the history of this dynasty. In the matter of commodity production and circulation, the Ming marked a turning point in Chinese history, both in the scale at which goods were being produced for the market, and in the nature of the economic
relations that governed commercial exchange."
Collapse of the Ming economy.
At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Little Ice Age severely curtailed Chinese agriculture in the northern provinces. From 1626 CE, famine, drought, and other disasters befell northern China, bringing peasant revolts. The Ming government's inability to collect taxes resulted in troops frequently not being paid. Many troops joined the rebels, worsening the situation. In 1644 CE, the rebels under Li Zicheng took Beijing, ending Ming rule in the north. Regimes loyal to the Ming throne (collectively called the Southern Ming) continued to reign in southern China until 1662 CE.
Qing (Manchu) Dynasty (1644–1912 CE).
China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, was not founded by Han Chinese but the Jur'chens, later called the Manchus, which had been subjects of the Ming and had earlier founded the Jurchen Jin Dynasty. In 1616 CE, under Nurhaci, the Manchus rebelled against the Ming. In 1644 Beijing was sacked by Li Zicheng's rebel forces and the last Ming Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty then allied with Ming Dynasty general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing and quickly overthrew Li's short-lived Shun Dynasty. It was only after a few decades until 1683 CE that the Qing took control of the whole of China. By the end of the century the Chinese economy had recovered from the devastation caused by the previous wars, and the resulting breakdown of order. Although the Qing economy significantly developed and markets continued to expand during the 18th century, it failed to keep pace with the economies of European countries in the Industrial Revolution.
Economy during the early Qing.
From the 1640s, China saw a period of political upheaval caused by the wars in which the Ming Dynasty were overthrown. The Qing Dynasty established by the Manchus, quickly seized Beijing in 1644, but hostile regimes still existed in other parts of China, and it would take the Qing a few decades to take control of all of China. During this period, especially in the 1640s and 1650s, people died of starvation and disease, which resulted in a decline in population. In 1661, facing attacks by overseas Ming loyalist forces, the Qing government adopted a policy of clearing the shore line, which ordered all people residing along the coast of Zhejiang to the border with Vietnam to move 25 kilometers inland and guards were positioned on the coast to prevent anyone from living there. Thus, until 1685 few people engaged in coastal and foreign trade. During these decades, although grain harvests improved, few participated in the market because the economy had contracted and local prices hit bottom. Tang Chen, a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant described a dismal picture of the market economy of the preceding decades in his writing in the early 1690s.
The situation only significantly improved after the peace was gradually recovered. By the 1680s the Qing had consolidated its control over the empire, and favorable economic developments resumed. Those developments resemble the late Ming expansion, but the early Qing market had more interregional trade, depended more on overseas markets, and had a larger population. Meanwhile, the relationship between the market and customary and command economies changed.
Developments during the "Kang–Qian Age".
After crushing all Ming royalists in the south by 1683 CE, the Kangxi Emperor revoked destructive measures, such as princely estates and the clearing of the shoreline. He quickly recovered the war-destructed economy and initiated a period of great prosperity in history. Under his successors' reigns, the Qing Dynasty reached its peak in the Kang–Qian Age between the reigns of the Kangxi Emperor and the Qianlong Emperor. This period is also known as "High Qing", during which Kangxi and his successors controlled the areas of Xinjiang and Tibet, conquered the Dzungar Khanate and exercised tighter control over these regions than the Ming Dynasty had. This removed a major threat to China and incorporated the regions of Xinjiang and Mongolia into the Chinese economy.
During the Qing Dynasty, foreign food crops, like the potato, were introduced during the 18th century on a large scale. These crops, along with the general peace in the 18th century, encouraged a dramatic increase in population, from approximately 150–200 million during the Ming to over 400 million during the Qing. During the 18th century, markets continued to expand as in the late Ming period. To give people more incentives to participate in the market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the Corvée system with a head tax used to hire labourers. China continued to export tea, silk and manufactures, creating a large, favorable trade balance with the West. full citation should be added in 'Sources'.
Reversing one of the Ming's trends, the Qing government interfered greatly in the economy. The monopoly on salt was restored and became one of the greatest sources of revenue for the state. Qing officials tried to discourage cultivation of cash crops in favor of grain. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licences and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronized literature, theater and the arts. Cloth and handicraft production boomed.
Isolationist trade policy.
The Qing Dynasty viewed foreign trade with suspicion. Emperor Qianlong proclaimed that:
During the 18th and 19th centuries, however, foreign trade increased massively after the economy recovered from the warfare in the mid-17th century, and after the prohibition on foreign trade was lifted in 1684. Despite the Qing government's regulations discouraging trade (during emperor Qianlong's reign, the number of ports allowed to trade was reduced from 4 to 1), trade between China and Europe grew at the rate of 4 percent a year between 1719 CE and 1806 CE, doubling the volume of trade every 18 years. This helped China’s interior markets and its coastal city ports, providing additional demand for domestic products.
The Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion.
Considering China to be a large, untapped market, the British tried several times to persuade the Chinese to expand trade with them, sending an ambassador to the court of the Qianlong Emperor in 1793. Their overtures met with no success while smuggled imports of opium by British and other foreign traders began to rise sharply. The result was disastrous for the Chinese. It is estimated that between 1821 and 1840, as much as one-fifth of the silver circulating in China was used to purchase opium, the abuse of which incapacitated able men throughout the country.
When the Qing government tried to stop the opium trade, the result was the First Opium War (18391842), in which Qing forces were defeated by western superior firearms. The resulting Treaty of Nanking and its successors saw concessions given to European nations in China, undermining Chinese authority. The war began a pattern of war, defeat, concessions, and silver payments to foreign powers, which further weakened the Chinese government and economy through outflow of silver. Nevertheless, the Qing government was eager to appease the foreigners.
Anger at the Qing rulers grew after the First Opium War. In 1851, Hong Xiuquan revolted against the Qing dynasty, proclaiming its rulers to be "filthy barbarians and beasts" who had "led China into despair". His rebels, called the Taipings, quickly took control of much of southern China. With aid from the British and French, the Qing defeated the rebels, but not before the rebellion claimed over 20 million lives. Lasting until 1871 CE, the Taiping Rebellion was one of the bloodiest wars in history, and it devastated the Qing economy, which had not been helped by the outbreak of a Second Opium War in 1856.
Self-Strengthening Movement and Qing's collapse.
Following the Taiping Rebellion, some Manchu nobles acknowledged that reforms were necessary. They instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement, in which limited modernization occurred, such as re-equipping the army, creating a standing navy, and industrialization. Although some of these reforms were successful, most of the Manchu nobility opposed them. The Chinese economy underwent a somewhat limited industrialization during this period. After defeat by the Japanese in 1894 CE, the movement became discredited. In 1911 CE, the Xinhai Revolution overthrew Manchu rule and established the Republic of China. The collapse of the Qing accelerated the decline of the Chinese economy, which was rapidly declining in comparison to the world gross domestic product.

Meridian High School (Macon, Illinois)

Meridian High School is a public four year high school located in Macon, Illinois. It is located about 9 miles south of Decatur, Illinois. Its first year of existence was fall of 1994 when it was formed by the merger of the Macon School District (1927–1994) and the Blue Mound School District (1917–1994). It is part of Meridian Community School District #15, which also includes Meridian Middle School in Blue Mound, Illinois; Meridian Intermediate School, also in Blue Mound, housing grades 3-5; and the primary school in Macon, housing grades K-2.
The Meridian district consists of the towns of Macon, Blue Mound, Boody and Elwin and some areas in the southern tip of Decatur.
In 2011, with the help of a 1% sales tax increase for Macon County and a grant from the state of Illinois, Meridian residents decided to change the Macon and Blue Mound campuses. Meridian High School will become the new Meridian Jr./Sr. High school housing grades 6-12. A new wing and gym will be added, and a new football and baseball field will be constructed. Meridian Middle School will be torn down (except for the gymnasium,) and a new school constructed, and this will be the new Pre-k thru 5 building.
Sports.
On June 4, 1971 the Macon Ironmen baseball team finished in second place at the Illinois High School Association state boys’ baseball championship tournament. The story of this feat has been retold in a 2012 book titled “One Shot at Forever: A Small Town, an Unlikely Coach, and a Magical Baseball Season” by Sports Illustrated writer Chris Ballard. Brian Snitker, a member of that team, currently serves as manager of the Atlanta Braves' Triple-A team the Gwinnett Braves.
In November 1986, the Macon Ironmen football team took 2nd place in the IHSA Class 1A State Playoffs.
In November 1999, the Meridian Hawks placed second in the IHSA 2A Football Championship.
On March 14, 2009, Meridian Hawks won the boys IHSA Class 1A state basketball championship.

Dan Olofsson

Dan Olof Olofsson, born 24 September 1950, is a Swedish entrepreneur, business leader and philanthropist.
Olofsson is married to Christin since 1973. Together, they have three children: Johan (born 1974), Andreas (born 1977) and Hanna (born 1980)
Biography.
Early life and education.
Dan Olofsson was born in Ekenäs in Finland. His father was employed as pastor of Karis in 1948 to 1951. Parents and family is rooted in Jämtland in northern Sweden. When Olofsson was one year old his family moved to Malmö in southern Sweden, where he was brought up and still is living.
Dan Olofsson completed upper secondary technical school at Pauliskolan in Malmö and graduated as Master of Science in Engineering at Lunds Tekniska Högskola in 1974.
Career.
After his education Olofsson began a carrier in the technology consulting industry. He started at VBB (what is now Sweco) and then proceeded to Skandiaconsult.
In 1986 Sapia was established, and Dan Olofssons was assigned the task of building its technical consultancy part, which he then acquired in 1993. The company was renamed Sigma. Dan Olofsson was CEO and the IPO took place in 1997. In 2001, each of Sigma's three business areas became separate companies and went public as Sigma, Epsilon and Teleca. Olofsson became Chairman and principal owner of all.
Since the start in 1986, Sigma, Epsilon and Teleca has grown from zero to approximately 6,000 employees in an entrepreneurial development with subsidiaries in over ten countries. The companies has grown in three different ways: through organic growth, ”entrepreneur packages”, and acquisitions. Entrepreneur packages enables new companies to be started around a driven entrepreneur, who also becomes a co-owner. Some 20 companies, with currently more than 1,500 employees, have been established in this way. The group has also acquired both private and public companies.
Dan Olofsson has been involved in numerous acquisitions and sales, and in seven public buy-outs. The largest transaction was the sale of Epsilon to ÅF in 2012.
In the autumn of 2012, Dan Olofsson’s autobiography ”Mina tre liv” ("My three lives") was published by the publishing house Ekerlids förlag. The book has received particular attention for its claim that the Swedish government should have committed a financial miscarriage of justice at financier Maths O Sundqvist.
Commitment in South Africa and in Malmö.
In recent years, Dan Olofsson has developed a strong commitment in South Africa. One example of this is Thanda Private Game Reserve, which in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 was awarded the World Travel Award as ”The world’s leading luxury lodge”.
His philanthropic commitment is best seen through the organization Star for Life, which he and his wife Christin launched in 2005. Today, Star for Life includes 100,000 young people in a preventive program against hiv/aids in South Africa, Namibia, and Sri Lanka.

Cardinal and Theological Virtues (Raphael)

The Cardinal and Theological Virtues is a fresco by Raphael as part of his Stanza della Segnatura in the Palazzi Vaticani in Vatican City. It is 6.6m wide at the base. The cardinal virtues are personified as three women in a bucolic landscape, and the theological virtues by cupids:
Description.
It was painted in 1511 as the fourth part, after the "Disputation of the Holy Sacrament", "The School of Athens" and "The Parnassus", of Raphael's commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. It is located in the "Stanza della segnatura" and allegorically presents fortitude, prudence and temperance.
Prudence holds up a mirror because she sees the truth clearly. Fortitude's attribute is the lion which she has in her lap and Temperance has a putto in reins, she is tempering him. The fourth virtue, Justice, is depicted in the tondo on the ceiling. Fortitude holds a Della Rovere oak tree and her legs and drapery are derived almost directly from those of Michelangelo’s “Moses”. Prudence has two faces one young looking into a mirror and the other old and bearded looking back. The long loops of Temperance’s bridle continue the curves of the composition. These large reclining figures in bulky fabric aren’t much unlike the great sibyls of the Sistine chapel ceiling.

The Madonna of the Rose ("Madonna della rosa") is a 1518-1520 painting, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Ironically, the rose in this painting and the entire lower portion, was added at a later date by an unknown artist. Its attribution as by Raphael is uncertain, and the involvement of Giulio Romano cannot be excluded.

Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society is a Canadian registered charity located in Vancouver, BC. Their mission is to provide food and related assistance to those in need.
History.
The Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society (GVFBS) was established in 1982 when organizations, church groups and concerned citizens joined together in response to the hunger crisis during the economic recession in 1981. The original purpose of the GVFBS was to be a temporary social service provider. However, because the number of those at risk of hunger has continued to increase, the GVFBS has become one of the most important non- government funded food assistance providers in Canada.
In 1982, the GVFBS assisted 200 people. Today, the GVFBS assists up to 9,000 people per week through 15 food depots located in Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, and the North Shore. In addition, through their support of more than 100 meal- providing agencies in these communities, up to 16,000 more people benefit each week from the GVFBS' food assistance.
Internal Programs.
Food Depots.
Food depots distribute a weekly supplement of non-perishable food and fresh produce. More than 300 dedicated volunteers provide four to five hours every week handing out food to those in need.
Kids Picks.
The Kids Picks program provides preschoolers aged 18 months to 6 years with a monthly supplemental bag of healthy, ready-to-eat snacks that will ensure they receive all the essential vitamins and minerals needed for proper growth and development.
Community Angel Food Runners.
The Community Angel Food Runners program is the prepared and perishable food recovery program of the GVFBS. Through the Community Angel Food Runners, quality food donated from restaurants, hotels, cafeterias and schools is delivered to meal-providing agencies. The Food Runners program saves 725,000 lbs of food yearly, creating 1.25 million meals for people in need.
Fresh Choice Kitchens.
Fresh Choice Kitchens was formerly known as the Vancouver Community Kitchen Project and has been promoting and supporting community kitchens for over ten years. A community kitchen is a group of individuals who meet regularly to cook healthy, nutritious meals.
Downtown Eastside Community Kitchen Project (DECK).
The Downtown Eastside Community Kitchen Project (DECK) was established in 2000 and is a program that focuses on providing residents of single room occupancy (SRO) hotels an alternate method of obtaining food in a self-directed and dignified manner.

Tian Huaijian

Tian Huaijian (田懷諫) (b. 802) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who, in his childhood, briefly served as the ruler of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), which had been held by his family for generations. The soldiers soon overthrew him and replaced him with his distant relative Tian Xing, and he was delivered to the Tang capital Chang'an.
Background.
Tian Huaijian was born in 802, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. Prior to his birth, his family had held Weibo Circuit for generations, ruling it in a "de facto" independent manner from the imperial regime, with his great-grandfather Tian Chengsi, Tian Chengsi's nephew Tian Yue, Tian Huaijian's grandfather Tian Xu, and father Tian Ji'an successively serving as the military governors ("Jiedushi") of Weibo. His mother was Tian Ji'an's wife Lady Yuan, a daughter of the general Yuan Yi (元誼). He had least three brothers – Tian Huaili (田懷理), Tian Huaixun (田懷詢), and Tian Huairang (田懷讓), with the "Book of Tang" implying that he was older than his brothers and the "New Book of Tang" implying that he was younger than his brothers.
In 812, Tian Ji'an fell ill, and it was said that in his illness, he killed his subordinates at will, and the headquarters fell into chaos. Lady Yuan summoned the officers and had them support Tian Huaijian as deputy military governor, acting as military governor. Tian Ji'an was moved out of the headquarters into a separate residence, and he died a month later, on September 21, 812.
Brief reign of Weibo.
After Tian Ji'an's death, one of the officers who had been supported by the soldiers, Tian Xing – a son of Tian Chengsi's cousin Tian Tingjie (田庭玠) – was recalled from his post to serve as the commander of the army. Meanwhile, because of Tian Huaijian's youth, the servant Jiang Shize (蔣士則) came to be making the key decisions, and Jiang made movements that were based on his own likes and dislikes, causing the soldiers to be disgruntled. Further, the reigning Emperor Xianzong (Emperor Dezong's grandson) was withholding the official commission for Tian Huaijian, hoping to cause a mutiny at Weibo. One morning, when Tian Xing was set to enter the headquarters to meet Tian Huaijian, the soldiers surrounding him bowed to him, asking him to be active military governor. Tian Xing agreed on condition that the soldiers would not harm Tian Huaijian and would be willing to submit to imperial orders, and the soldiers agreed. Tian Xing then executed Jiang and his associates and moved Tian Huaijian out of the headquarters. (While the date of this mutiny was not recorded in historical sources, the mutiny was reported to Emperor Xianzong by the imperial eunuch stationed at Weibo on November 17, 812.)
Aftermath.
Tian Xing buried Tian Ji'an, and then delivered Tian Huaijian to the Tang capital Chang'an. Emperor Xianzong gave Tian Huaijian a general title, gave him a mansion at Chang'an, and granted a generous stipend of grain. No further historical references were made to Tian Huaijian, and it is not known when he died.

Frank Martin is a Democratic Alliance councillor for the 19th Ward in Cape Town which includes Blue Downs, Kuilsriver, Wesbank and a small eastern section of Delft.
N2 Gateway occupations.
Martin rose to prominence during the December 2007 N2 Gateway occupations of BNG houses in the new Symphony area of Delft. The N2 Gateway Occupations saw large numbers of government-built houses occupied illegally by local residents of Delft in the Western Cape on 19 December 2007. 
After the occupation, it emerged that Martin had encouraged local families to occupy the houses. He was arrested on 20 December on charges of issuing letters to an estimated 300 families in Delft which allegedly granted them permission to move into the houses and stated that he would accept full responsibility for the consequences.
Charges against Martin were later dropped. 
In February 2008, Judge Van Zyl of the Cape Town High Court ruled to evict residents. In his comments, he faulted Martin for instigating the occupation. On 18 February 2009, a City of Cape Town disciplinary committee found Martin guilty of encouraging people to invade homes at Delft. As punishment, Martin was suspended for only one month while former supporters of the councillor expressed outrage and called for him to be fired.

In the 19th century the beaches of Wheelers Bay and Horseshoe Bay were used for the unloading of provisions, particularly coal. Boats would beach at high tide and the cargo off-loaded onto horsedrawn carts. The boats would then be floated off again at the next high tide.
Today's shoreline is a concrete seawall, constructed in the early 1990s at a cost of £1.6 million, to protect the cliff from erosion.
The bay is accessed by a concrete slope from the road above the bay or by walking along the seawall either from Ventnor or Horseshoe Bay. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs the length of the bay along this seawall.

H&amp;E naturist

H&E naturist (originally Health and Efficiency) is an 92-page monthly commercial magazine focusing on the naturist and nudist lifestyle, through articles on travel, health and culture, as well as various features on arts and books with a naked theme. This content and focus has sometimes caused it to be accused of appealing to consumers of pornography, although sexual nudity is absent from its pages.
History.
"Health & Efficiency" was first published in 1900. Back then the magazine covered health topics such as diet, exercise, herbalism and general advice on living a healthy and efficient life.
In the 1920s when nudists began publicising their activities and sun clubs began to form, "Health & Efficiency" became an early champion of their cause through publishing their letters, articles and photos. Later, this material occupied a greater proportion of the magazine, particularly as it absorbed other naturist and health periodicals, including "Health and Vim" and "Sunbathing and Health Magazine".
After the Second World War, nudism experienced a massive expansion and the monthly "H&E" - as it became known - was in pole position in promoting the nudist lifestyle. Throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s H&E's reputation as the "nudist bible" grew. H&E's audience was made up of nudists who were members of British clubs and those who used British beaches. A small minority who were lucky enough to be able to afford holidays abroad, and sampled the delights of French and Yugoslavian nudist facilities, provided H&E with the first "naturists abroad" travel reports.
This was a hint of things to come, for, by the 1970s, cheaper foreign travel allowed many more British naturists to visit the south of France, Spain, Greece and Yugoslavia. H&E reflected this change and soon became an international naturist magazine providing news, travel reports, features and photography from around the naturist world.
The magazine has had a number of publishers and editors, and has been based in London, Epsom, Goole and Hull.
Editors.
The editor was anonymous before George Greenwood

In return for his generosity, the University has named a building in his name: J.R. Coutts Engineering Lecture Hall (commonly referred to as Rod Coutts Hall, or RCH). Since then, Rod has been actively supporting the university, through more funding, bursaries and scholarships. 
In 2007, Rod Coutts received his Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.'07).
Teklogix.
Rod Coutts was the founder of Teklogix International with 4 other young entrepreneurs: Lawrie Cragg, Al Vanderburgh, Cliff Bernard and Pete Halsall. The company focused on providing mobile workers with wireless data transmission and real-time data management within the logistics industry. Teklogix became Psion Teklogix in the year 2000, after it was purchased for $544 million (Cdn.) by U.K.-based Psion, started by David Potter.
Rod Coutts met the other Teklogix founders while working at Ferranti International's Canadian division, Ferranti-Packard Electronics. Ferranti-Packard was known for projects related to FP6000 (Ferranti-Packard 6000, which became the ICL 1900), ReserVec, Back Up Interceptor Control (BUIC) for the United States Military, as well as Ferranti-Packard's drum memory systems. Coutts worked closely on drum memory associated with the early warning radar system for North America. Coutts and the rest of the founding group left Ferranti-Packard and formed Teklogix in 1967.

Holger Danske (opera)

Holger Danske (Ogier the Dane) is the title of a 1789 Syngespil opera based on the Oberon myth, with music by F.L.Æ. Kunzen and a Danish libretto by Jens Baggesen.
Synopsis.
The opera is set in the time of Charlemagne, and the action revolves around the quarrel of Oberon, King of the Fairies, and Titania, Queen of the Sylphs. They have sworn an oath that they will reconcile only if they can find a human couple who will remain true to each other despite all perils and temptations; after centuries of painful separation, they find this couple in young prince Holger, one of Charlemagne's knights, and Rezia, the daughter of Sultan Buurman in Baghdad. Holger has killed one of Charlemagne's sons in self-defense, and his punishment is to cut off a lock of the sultan's beard and kiss his daughter in public.
Act One opens with Oberon singing of his longing for Titania. Then Holger and his squire Kerasmin, in a forest in Lebanon, meet Oberon, who promises Holger his help and gives him a magic horn that can force others to dance; Holger tries it on Kerasmin to punish him for his hard words about Oberon. Then the two travel on to Babylon. The act ends with Rezia awakening from a dream in which Holger appears to her as her true bridegroom; she is in despair, because that day she is to marry Langulaffer, Prince of the Lebanon.
Act Two begins in Buurman's palace, where the marriage of his daughter is about to be celebrated; Holger and Kerasmin interrupt the ceremony, Holger and Rezia recognize each other from their dreams and embrace joyfully; a fight breaks out, and Kerasmin blows the horn and forces everyone to dance ecstatically until they drop from exhaustion, at which point Holger snips a lock from Buurman's beard, and Oberon appears and drives the Turks away.
Act Three opens with Titania lamenting her separation from Oberon; she has a vision of Holger and Rezia being menaced by death. Three fairies enter and report that the ship that was to take the young couple to Europe had been wrecked on the coast of Tunis, where they were sold as slaves to the court of the Sultan Bobul. Holger is working as a gardener for the Sultana Almansaris, who tries unsuccessfully to seduce him and angrily tells her guard to take him to be burned at the stake. Meanwhile Rezia, now called Palmine and part of the sultan's harem, fights off his advances and says she would rather die in flames than submit. The two are chained together and about to be burned in the public square, but Oberon and Titania appear and free the pair, and Holger once more uses the horn to make his enemies dance until they are helpless. Both fairy and human couples are united at last, and the opera ends with a chorus of joy.
Holger Feud and the opera's later history.
"Holger Danske" is now considered one of the masterpieces of Danish opera, but when it opened on 31 March 1789 it sparked off a heated controversy, the "Holger Feud," having nothing to do with the merits of the opera itself. There had been considerable tension over the influence and attitudes of Germans in Denmark since the rise and fall of Johann Friedrich Struensee almost two decades earlier; nationalists like the leading reviewer Knud Lyhne Rahbek attacked Baggesen and his German collaborator, and opponents of opera in general like the witty satirist Peter Andreas Heiberg joined in. 
Baggesen was so unnerved by the attacks that he requested the opera be withdrawn after only six performances, and he and Kunzen left the country; though both returned and had success in Denmark later, the opera was never again performed in their lifetimes, to the distress of critics like Peter Grönland, who in 1792 praised the opera highly and said he could not understand why it was "no longer performed." Ole Kongsted writes of the later fate of the opera: 
"One performance of the first act at a Royal Orchestra Widows' Pension Fund concert in 1804. made no impact, and the opera was never again part of the repertoire of the Royal Theatre. The work lay hidden away until Kunzen's biographer Martienssen had it performed in 1912 at the Cecilia Society. 
Then it was forgotten again until it was performed a few times at the Royal Theatre in 1941, Poul Kanneworff directed, Harald Lander did the choreography, and Johan Hye-Knudsen conducted. In the same version, the opera was then repeated in 1944, and — oddly enough — it was now considered, 150 years later, to be a national Danish manifestation against the German occupation. 
Nils Schiørring — the greatest expert on Danish musical history — thought that "Holger Danske" must be considered "the most significant musicodramatic work that saw the light of day in the country in the 1700s."

<doc id="21478754" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21478754" title="Common sense">
Common sense

Common sense is a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge things, which is shared by ("common to") nearly all people, and can be reasonably expected of nearly all people without any need for debate. The everyday understanding of what common sense is derives from philosophical discussion, involving several European languages. Related words in other languages include Latin , Greek (koinē aísthēsis), and French , but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.
"Common sense" has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul (Greek "psukhē") proposed by Aristotle, which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive characteristics such as movement and size, which are common to all things, and which help people and other animals to distinguish and identify things. It is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but works with both. The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community. Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge which most people are expected to share naturally, even if they can not explain why.
All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday one, are inter-connected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern western civilisation, notably concerning science, politics and economics. The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.
In modern times the term "common sense" has frequently been used for rhetorical effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, as an authority. It can be negatively equated to vulgar prejudice and superstition, or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for good taste and as the source of the most basic axioms needed for science and logic. This began with Descartes' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "rationalism" and "empiricism". In the opening line of one his most famous books, "Discourse on Method", he established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ("bon sens"), but it is rarely used well. Therefore a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon. In the ensuing 18th century Enlightenment, common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to metaphysics, which was associated with the "ancien régime". Thomas Paine's pamphlet named ""Common Sense"" has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century affecting both the American and French revolutions. Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in epistemology and ethics, with special focus often being upon the philosophy of the modern social sciences.
Aristotelian common sense.
The origin of the term is in the works of Aristotle. The most well-known such case is "De Anima" Book III, chapter 2, especially at line 425a27. The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the five specialized sense perceptions, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. Each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific (Greek: "idia") to it. For example sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion "common" ("koinos") is a term opposed to specific or particular ("idia"). The Greek for these common sensibles is "ta koina", which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing. Distinct combinations of these properties are "common" to all perceived things.
In this passage, Aristotle says that concerning these "koina" (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things (Greek: "koinē aisthēsis"), which does not work by accident (Greek: "kata sumbebēkos"). And there is no specific ("idia") sense perception for movement and other "koina", because then we would not perceive the "koina" at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive colour. explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident. Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" which can distinguish black from sweet. The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; Greek: "sēmeion") of what the specialist senses have perceived. This is therefore also where a type of consciousness originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.
The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the "Theaetetus". But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing "koina" is an active thinking process which happens in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moves the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this "sensus communis", which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational. 
The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details. has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the imaginative faculty (""phantasia""), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same. Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Al-Farabi felt they were distinct, but later, Avicenna emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers. argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" which represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term "koinē aisthēsis" as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity) which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.
Aristotle's understanding of the soul has an extra level of complexity in the form of the "nous" or "intellect" which is something only humans have, and which enables humans to perceive things in a different way to other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using reasoning (Greek "logos") as well as the "active intellect". It is the "nous" which identifies the true forms of things, while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Although scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. Reason or rationality ("logos") exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and "nous". Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions. Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs, "phronein" and "noein", to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, one being found in animals, and the other unique to humans and involving reason. Therefore in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals which are used in identifying and categorising things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the "species sensibilis" which are used for perception and imagination in animals, and the "species intelligibilis" or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or "nous".
Aristotle also occasionally called the "koinē aisthēsis" (or one version of it), the "prōton aisthētikon", the first of the senses. (According to Gregorić this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense which includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as Themistius, Galen, and Al-Farabi, called it the "ruler" of the senses or ruling sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's "Timaeus" (70b). Augustine and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense". The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the Middle Ages. Under the influence of the great Arab philosophers Al-Farabi and Avicenna several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and John of Jandun recognized four internal senses: the common sense, imagination, "vis cogitativa", and memory. Avicenna, followed by Robert Grosseteste, Albert the Great, and Roger Bacon, argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, "vis aestimativa", and memory." By the time of Descartes and Hobbes, in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to "five wits", which complimented the more well-known five "external" senses. Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior Galenic ventricle of the brain. The great anatomist Andreas Vesalius however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.
Roman common sense.
""Sensus communis"" is the Latin translation of "koinē aesthēsis" which came to be recovered by Medieval scholastics when discussing perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct human detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word "koinē" (meaning shared or common); not only "koinē aisthēsis", but also such terms as "koinē nous", "koinē ennoia", and "koinonoēmosunē", all of which involve "nous", something which at least in Aristotle would not be present in "lower" animals. 
Another link between Latin "communis sensus" and Aristotle's Greek was in rhetoric, a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric a prudent speaker must take account of the opinions (Greek "doxai") which are widely held. Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as "koinai doxai", which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as "endoxa".
In his "Rhetoric" for example Aristotle mentions ""koinōn ... tàs písteis"" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude". In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, "De Oratore", Cicero wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of ""communis sensus"" in the Latin of Cicero.
Whether the Latin writers such as Cicero deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. has proposed for example that the Roman republic maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. argues, in agreement with Shaftesbury in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.
As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection". But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's "Timaeus" (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in "De Anima", and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages. Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational human beliefs which are widely shared, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of "humanitas". This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only human nature, but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on. Apart from Cicero, Quintilian, Lucretius, Seneca, Horace and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term ""sensus communis"" in a range of such ways. As C. S. Lewis wrote: Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ("congressus") how will he ever learn that "sensus" which we call "communis"? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks "communis sensus".
Compared to Aristotle and his medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible "koina", and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, "nous" (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of "koina", the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.
Cartesian common sense.
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was Descartes in the 16th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his "Meditations on first philosophy". The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the pineal gland. Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical. This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a "sensus communis". The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the Scholastics. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his "Passions of the Soul" (1649).
Contemporaries such as Gassendi and Hobbes went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or "nous", which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism. In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"... According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with Peripatetic thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term ""sensus communis"", but also the French term ""bon sens"", with which he opens his "Discourse on Method". And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. "Bon sens" is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of "bon sens" gave a new way of defining "sensus communis" in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate "bon sens" as "sensus communis", but treated them as two separate things).
The idea which now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of skeptical reasoning. The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, Spinoza, and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing Bourbon, and Habsburg dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to Machiavellianism and Protestantism as part of the so-called counter reformation.Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional". So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.
The Enlightenment after Descartes.
Epistemology: common sense versus claims of certainty.
During the Enlightenment, Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking which treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the "sensus communis" linking them). Cartesians such as Henricus Regius, Geraud de Cordemoy, and Nicolas Malebranche realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith. Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense". Descartes and the Cartesian "rationalists", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and inductive reasoning, and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or ""a priori"" knowledge in the human mind - a controversial proposal.
In contrast to the rationalists, the "empiricists", took their orientation from Francis Bacon, whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "idols of the mind", presented in his "Novum Organum", and in his "Essays" described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies. But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience, experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced Locke and Pierre Bayle, in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 Voltaire "introduced him as the "father" of the scientific method" to a French audience, an understanding which had become widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to "metaphysics" and associated with the "ancien regime".
As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, John Locke abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" which are perceived. But then George Berkeley abandoned both. David Hume agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of extreme skepticism. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?
Ethics: "humanist" common sense.
Once Thomas Hobbes and Spinoza had applied Cartesian approaches to political philosophy, concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, Shaftesbury and, much less known at the time, Giambattista Vico, both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after Hans-Georg Gadamer, as a humanist interpretation of the term. Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method which treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals (methodological individualism), ignoring the "sense of community" which the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering "common good sense" as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.
Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay "Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour" was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as Seneca, Juvenal, Horace and Marcus Aurelius, for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense which was particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as Francis Hutcheson was what came to be called "moral sentiment", which is quite different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling which is very important for larger communities:A publick Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or "Sense of Partnership" with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being "Partners" in this "Sense", or sharers in this "common Affection", as they who scarcely know "an Equall", nor consider themselves as subject to any law of "Fellowship" or "Community". And thus Morality and good Government go together.
Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. “our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery.”" which, he explains, "was sometimes called κοινονοημοσύνη or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".
A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in Bernard Mandeville's controversial works. Indeed this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.
By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "moral sentiment" referred to by Hume and Adam Smith, the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being "sympathy", which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. Jeremy Bentham gives a summary of the plethora of terms which had come to be used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century in order to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in "common", in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other’s moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author’s, being struck out of the account as not worth taking. This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself. In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example French "sens commun" and German "Gemeinsinn" are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while "bon sens" (good sense) and "gesunder Verstand" (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".
According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or "bon sens"), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day. But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of "sensus communis" in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "Sensus communis was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness (conscience) and taste." The concept of "sensus communis" "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment". But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.
Gadamer notes one less-known exception which is the Württemberg pietism inspired by the 18th century Swabian churchman, M. Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff, who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.
Giambattista Vico.
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in Naples (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon Hans-Georg Gadamer, Benedetto Croce and Antonio Gramsci. Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term "communis sensus". Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his "On the Study Methods of our Time", which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make enthymemes. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities, as opposed to the Cartesian method which was skeptical of all which could not be dealt with as syllogisms, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of eloquence" but also "the standard of practical judgment". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the "koinē aisthēsis", is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.
In its mature version, Vico's conception of "sensus communis" is defined by him as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race”. Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties which are available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths which were formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's "Spirit of the Laws", as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.
Thomas Reid and the Scottish school.
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.
Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.
Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and J. S. Mill, who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceive the problem with any claim that common sense could be ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of "a priori" knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.
Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American pragmatism, and modern Thomism. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a "sensus communis" for any possibility of rational discussion between people.
Kant: "common sense" in aesthetic taste.
Immanuel Kant developed a new variant of the idea of "sensus communis", noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of aesthetics and taste:"The common Understanding of men" ["gemeine Menschenverstand"], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense ["Namen des Gemeinsinnes"] ("sensus communis"); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.<br><br>
But under the "sensus communis" we must include the Idea of a "communal" sense ["eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes"], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (a priori) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement. Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".
But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's ""Weltanschauung"", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of "a priori" knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his "Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics" as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically - the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.
Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic "sensus communis", for which he used Latin or else German "Gemeinsinn", and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as "gemeinen Menscheverstand", "gesunden Verstand", or "gemeinen Verstand".
According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The moral imperative "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility". For Kant, the "sensus communis" only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge. Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".
Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a "sensus communis"), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.
Contemporary philosophy.
Epistemology.
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced C. S. Peirce, the founder of the philosophical movement now known as Pragmatism, which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after Charles Darwin, suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.
Another example which is still influential today is G. E. Moore, several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "A Defence of Common Sense", argued that there are many types of statements which individuals can make about what they judge to be true, and which the individual and everyone else knows to be true.
Ethics: what the community would think.
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the "sensus communis" as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The basic theme of this discussion is the question of how far that an understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard of model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of relativism are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations has become essential. Some philosophers such as Jacques Rancière indeed take the lead from Jean-François Lyotard and refer to the "postmodern" condition as one where there is ""dissensus communis"".
Hannah Arendt adapted Kant's concept of "sensus communis" as a faculty of aesthetic judgement which imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like Adolf Eichmann, which consisted in a lack of "sensus communis" and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also Jürgen Habermas, who took a similar position concerning Kant's "sensus communis", were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's "sensus communis" as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's "sensus communis" as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "euphony" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any "sensus communis" in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.
In a parallel development, Antonio Gramsci, Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work "Truth and Method", can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry". In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the "sensus communis" concept in Kant which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.
Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called "Hermeneutikstreit". Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of "sensus communis" effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of "Truth and Method", "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".
Paul Ricoeur argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest". But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic which was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.
A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to "sensus communis" exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a Socratic dialectic aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers Richard J. Bernstein, Bernard Williams, Richard Rorty, and Alasdair MacIntyre, and the recent theorist of rhetoric, Richard Lanham.
"Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality".
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive which is not selfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially economics. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of self-interested individuals is a central assumption in much of modern mathematical economics, and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.
While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about methodological individualism as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by Milton Friedman and more recently by Gary S. Becker, both members of the so-called Chicago school of economics). As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as Deirdre McCloskey, who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian Richard Rorty and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.
Catholic theology.
Among catholic theologians, an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge was given by writers such as theologian François Fénelon and philosopher Claude Buffier. This was taken up by other catholic theologians, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example Jean-Marie de Lamennais. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on Theodore Jouffroy. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. Matteo Liberatore, seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the "koinai doxai" of Aristotle, that correspond to the "communes conceptiones" of Aquinas. In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with Étienne Gilson and Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist intellect and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas. Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".

MW-1

The MW-1" (Mehrzweckwaffe 1", multipurpose weapon) is a German munitions dispenser similar to the British JP233. It is designed to be carried on the Tornado IDS, although it can be carried on the F-104 Starfighter and the F-4 Phantom. Since the German Government decision to support the ban on cluster ammunition, the MW-1 is currently being phased out.
Submunitions.
The MW-1 was designed so that different types of submunitions may be loaded into its 112 tubes. The MIFF, MUSA and MUSPA mines are parachute dropped, and upon reaching the ground self-right and arm. The mines are blast-resistant and are reported to have self-destruct devices giving them a lifespan of less than forty days.
KB 44.
"(Kleinbombe 44)": Bomblets for use against unarmored and light armored targets such as vehicles and airplanes, etc.
STABO.
"(Startbahnbombe)": Bomb to destroy runway. The first shaped charge explodes on impact creating a channel under the surface. An additional charge creates an explosion under the concrete runway to make a crater with heaved sides (large jagged, uprooted edges), making it much more difficult to repair the runway because the large jagged pieces have to be broken off, removed and edges smoothed before it can be patched or permanentely repaired.
MIFF.
"(Mine-Flach-Flach)": Anti-tank mine with a magnetic field sensor.
The MIFF mine is an anti-tank mine. The mine has a seismic sensor, as well as a magnetic influence sensor that it uses to determine the optimum detonation point. It uses two back-to-back Misznay-Schardin effect shaped charges to penetrate the hulls of armoured vehicles, as well as a 38 secondary bowl shapes that produce secondary fragments. 
MUSA and MUSPA.
The MUSA and MUSPA mines are identical in external appearance but have different fuses that allow them to perform different functions. When triggered, the mine scatters 2,100 steel pellets to an effective radius of 100 meters.
The MUSA mine has a simple delay fuse which triggers the mine after a pre-set interval to prevent clearance operations.
The MUSPA mine, officially classified as an anti-aircraft mine, has an acoustic sensor which triggers the mine when the right acoustic signature is detected.

Pillow Fight League

The Pillow Fight League (PFL) is a Toronto-based semi-professional sports league centered around public pillow fights. The tongue in cheek women's sport is hosted in a fighting arena, much like a boxing or wrestling match. The League was founded by PFL Commissioner Stacey P. Case, and Honorary PFL Commissioner Craig Daniels in February 2004. The formal league launched at a Canadian goth bar called The Vatikan in downtown Toronto. Events since then have been hosted in both Montreal, Quebec and New York City, but the primary seat of the League remains in Toronto, Ontario. Fighter Abbie Roadkill, originally of British descent, recently speculated about a similar event in the United Kingdom.
Fights within the League now feature either two or three girls, the latter referred to as a damage à trois, and a codified set of rules. Fighters frequently incur cuts, scrapes and bruises. There have also been more serious injuries, including concussions, black eyes, lost teeth, split lips, torn muscles, and bruised kidneys.
The League grew out of a pair of live events held by performers from Canadian burlesque troupe “Skin Tight Outta Sight” at a performance of Mr. Case's band (named for tijuana bibles) at New Year's Eve 2004 and 2005. The latter featured the first instance of live tryouts for members of the audience. The events that followed in 2006 at the Vatikan launched the new League-sponsored series of events primarily focused around the pillow fighting bouts. A potential moneymaker for its founders, the League saw television rights snapped up in 2007 by reality television and sitcom producers Eddie October (executive producer of Tommy Lee Goes to College and The Roseanne Show) and Al Berman (executive producer of The Biggest Loser and Survivor).

NMC Recordings

NMC Recordings is a British recording label which specialises in recording works by living composers from the British Isles.
History.
The composer Colin Matthews founded NMC in 1989, with financial assistance from the Holst Foundation. NMC is an abbreviation for "New Music Cassettes", which refers to the intended main means of packaging its recordings at the time. Matthews continues as a producer of NMC's recordings. NMC was originally administered through the Society for the Promotion of New Music. In 1992, NMC became independent, and Matthews invited Bill Colleran to become NMC's first board chairman. Colleran served in this capacity from 1993 to 2004.
Additional financial support for NMC resulted after the 1993 Copyright Duration Directive (93/98/EEC), which extended the copyright term from 50 to 70 years. As a result, the music of Gustav Holst came back into copyright, and NMC obtained increased funding as a result.
Recordings.
NMC's first recordings, from 1989, were of Jonathan Harvey's "Bhakti" (NMC D001) [http://www.nmcrec.co.uk/?page=catalogue/item.html&id=1] and a recital of contemporary solo piano music by Michael Finnissy (NMC D002). NMC's first opera recording was of Harrison Birtwistle's The Mask of Orpheus (NMC D050). Its single best-selling issue is of Anthony Payne's realisation of the sketches for Edward Elgar's Symphony No. 3 (NMC D053). NMC's catalogue has now over 200 recordings. NMC releases 10 to 12 discs per year. NMC has several sub-categories within its releases:
NMC has an overriding principle of maintaining all its titles in its catalogue and not deleting any issues.
The NMC Songbook.
To mark its 20th anniversary in 2009, NMC Recordings commissioned "The NMC Songbook", a collection of art-songs from 96 composers, each on the general theme of "Britain", scored for one or two voices, and various instrumental accompaniments. NMC recorded the collection of songs (NMC D150) for commercial release in April 2009. This recording received the Gramophone Contemporary Award in 2009.
In parallel, the label curated a series of 4 concerts, the first public performances of the songs, at Kings Place, London from 1–4 April 2009.
Awards.
Several NMC releases have won critical awards:

Portrait of Perugino (Raphael)

The Portrait of Perugino is a portrait of the Italian Renaissance artist Perugino attributed to his pupil Raphael or to Lorenzo di Credi. It was produced around 1504 and is now in the Uffizi gallery, Florence.
History.
The painting is known to have been in the Florentine Galleries since as early as 1704, when it was identified as a portrait of Martin Luther and was attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger. In an 1825 comment to Giorgio Vasari's "Vite", it was listed as a "Portrait of Verrocchio" by Lorenzo di Credi. Adolfo Venturi in 1922 attributed it to Perugino himself, while the attribution to Raphael appeared in the 1930s.
The identification with Perugino is today ascertained thanks to the evident similarities with the self-portrait in the Collegio del Cambio. Copies of the painting exist in Vienna, London, Bergamo, Rome and in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.

<doc id="21478904" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21478904" title="Border blaster">
Border blaster

A border blaster is a broadcast station that, though not licensed as an external service, is, in practice, used to target another country. The term "border blaster" is of North American origin, and usually associated with Mexican AM stations covering large parts of the United States and United States border AM stations covering large parts of Canada. Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre–World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom, "radio périphérique" around France and the US government funded propaganda station Radio Free Europe targeting eastern Europe.
With broadcasting signals far more powerful than U.S. stations, the Mexican border blasters could be heard over large areas of the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1970s, often to the great irritation of American radio stations, whose signals could be overpowered by their Mexican counterparts. These are also sometimes referred to as X stations for their call letters: Mexico assigns callsigns beginning with XE or XH to broadcast stations.
On November 9, 1972 in Washington, D.C., the United States and Mexico signed an "Agreement Concerning Frequency Modulation Broadcasting in the 87.5 to 108 MHz Band". Since then, in the FM band power levels and frequency assignments have been set by mutual agreement between the two countries. AM radio border blasters still exist, though they are largely ignored due to the decline of AM radio in the U.S. There are several such stations licensed by Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation using transmitters with an effective radiated power similar to those of major licensed commercial stations located within the USA.
In 1973 the border blaster became world famous when George Lucas featured the station as the source for the musical soundtrack of his motion picture "American Graffiti".
Background.
In contrast to pirate radio stations which broadcast illegally, border blasters are licensed by the government upon whose soil they are located. Pirate radio stations are freebooters from offshore, outside the territorial waters of the nation they serve, or ones that are illegally operating in defiance of national law within its sovereign territory.
A similar situation developed in Europe, beginning with Radio Luxembourg after World War II. The British government identified these stations as "pirates" because the Sunday broadcast was reserved for British listeners (deliberately coinciding with the BBC Sundays of religious programmes). The broadcasts were considered illegal on British soil as these stations were breaking the monopoly of the non-commercial BBC. Listening to the broadcasts was technically a violation of UK radio-license laws of the day. The same radio périphérique, or "peripheric radio", phenomenon existed in France from the 1930s until the legalization of private broadcasting in the early 1980s, which allowed Radio Luxembourg from Luxembourg, Radio Andorre and Sud Radio from Andorra, Radio Monte Carlo from Monaco, and Europe 1 from Saarland, Germany to begin legally broadcasting signals across international borders.
In Mexico and the US, while the federal government of the US did not particularly like them, the stations were allowed to flourish. W. Lee O'Daniel used a border blaster in his successful campaign for governor. The US, unlike the UK, has never required a license to listen to broadcast radio or television. The only restriction placed upon border-blasters was a law which prohibited studios in the US from linking by telephone to border-blaster transmitters in Mexico. This law, part of the Brinkley Act, was introduced in the wake of John R. Brinkley's fraudulent medical advice program on XERA. The Brinkley Act remains on the books in the US, but licenses under that act are now routinely granted as long as the station follows applicable US and Mexican regulations.
The British government created a similar measure after World War II: the state-owned telephone monopoly prevented studios in Britain from linking by telephone to the transmitters of Radio Luxembourg. These restrictions were mostly lifted following the privatisation and demonopolisation of the UK telephone system.
Signals of many US and Canadian radio stations (and to a lesser extent television outlets) encroach into neighboring territory. Such stations are usually not deemed "border blasters," as their programming is not primarily targeted at listeners and viewers across the border. US and Canadian stations adhere to comparable maximum power levels, and the encroachment is regarded as unintentional and largely unavoidable.
An exception to that general rule is KRPI located in Ferndale, Washington. It is owned by BBC Broadcasting Inc., a Washington state company with studios in Richmond, British Columbia. The station airs a mixture of music, news and talk focused on the South Asian communities in Metro Vancouver. To improve reception of the station within its target market, KRPI applied and received permission from the FCC to move its transmitter from Ferndale to Point Roberts, a community adjacent to the Canadian border. The move has attracted much criticism from the local citizens of Point Roberts and the adjacent community of Tsawwassen, British Columbia.
Another possible exception to that general rule on the Canadian side was CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit. Originally licensed as a Class II-B (now Class B) station and always operating in full compliance with the technical specifications and operating rules of its CRTC license (i.e., protection of the entire Mexican border nights and protection of co-channel Canadian stations days and nights), CKLW's 50,000-watt directional signal blanketed much of Michigan and northern Ohio east to Cleveland days and nights, and south to Toledo, Lima and Dayton in the daytime. American-owned until 1970 as part of the RKO General chain (along with such other top 40 powerhouses as KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco), it functioned essentially as a Detroit-market station during the 1960s and 1970s. Its Motown-flavored personality Top 40 format made it one of the most highly rated stations in the Midwestern US. The decline of AM radio as a music source in the 1970s, combined with new Canadian government rules imposing minimum domestic music content, made it difficult for CKLW to continue to compete for listeners with Detroit-based, US-licensed FM music stations, which offered clean stereo sound and faced no program content or music playlist restrictions. CKLW abandoned the Top 40 format and its efforts to compete in the Detroit market in the 1980s. Today it is a news/talk station aimed specifically at an Ontario audience, though still containing a significant amount of American syndicated talk.
According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the regulatory body for Canadian broadcasting, it is illegal to operate a station licensed in Canada from studios in the US; CKEY-FM in Fort Erie, Ontario learned this when it attempted to offshore its operations to American-based Citadel Broadcasting's studios across the Niagara River in Buffalo, New York, and almost had its license revoked because of it. CKEY remains on the air, targeting solely the Niagara Region and no longer targeting Western New York.
Attempts at border-blasting were somewhat more common on the other side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. WIVB-TV, prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller market than Southern Ontario, which boasts the major world city of Toronto); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF low band (channel 4), even after the Federal Communications Commission reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station WKBW-TV did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting Winnipeg, a much larger city sixty miles north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York found it could reach a larger audience in Montreal. Canadian regulators put in simultaneous substitution requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day CKND-TV; Burlington station WFFF-TV entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed).
The mythology surrounding the history of the border blaster stations in Mexico is extensive with examples being the 1971 Doors song, "The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)", 1975 ZZ Top song "Heard It on the X", 1983's "Mexican Radio" by Wall of Voodoo, and 1987's "Border Radio" movie theme by The Blasters.
Programming.
Most border blaster stations today program Spanish-language programming targeted at the Mexican side of the border. Some of the Spanish language border blasters target the growing Latino audience living in the southwestern US. Some target both.
As was the case between the 1930s and the 1970s, some border blaster stations in areas near larger American border cities such as San Diego are leased out by American broadcasting companies and air English-language programming targeting American audiences, although the AM stations have sometimes been supplanted by FM signals just over the border and able to reach major American cities like San Diego or El Paso with city-grade signals. During those decades border radio was used by preachers who solicited donations, and advertisers who sold products of dubious value. The American side leases the station from the Mexican station owners/license holders and feeds programming from their American studios to the Mexican transmitters via satellite.
Due to Mexican government regulations, these stations, like all radio stations in Mexico, must air "La Hora Nacional" ("The Mexican National Hour") on Sunday evenings (usually 8pm or 10pm, depending on where the station is located) and "Himno Nacional Mexicano" (the Mexican National Anthem) at midnight and 5 am. In addition, they must also give station identification in Spanish. This is usually done softly or during commercial breaks so the listeners on the American side won't usually notice it.

Subsidence (atmosphere)

Subsidence in the Earth's atmosphere is most commonly caused by low temperatures: as air cools, it becomes denser and moves towards the ground, just as warm air becomes less dense and moves upwards. Cool subsiding air is subject to adiabatic warming which tends to cause the evaporation of any clouds that might be present. Subsidence generally causes high barometric pressure as more air moves into the same space: the polar highs are areas of almost constant subsidence, as are the horse latitudes, and these areas of subsidence are the sources of much of the world's prevailing wind. Subsidence also causes many smaller-scale weather phenomena, such as morning fog. An extreme form of subsidence is a downburst, which can result in damage similar to that produced by a tornado. A milder form of subsidence is referred to as downdraft.

Chisholm Trail Technology Center

Chisholm Trail Technology Center (CTTC) is a public career and technology education center located in Omega, Oklahoma, and is part of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education system.
The center is located on Highway 33, 13 miles east of Watonga and 16 miles west of Kingfisher.
History.
In August 1987, voters in the Kingfisher, Watonga, Lomega and Hitchcock school districts elected five board members to the newly formed Area Vocational School District No. 26. Their first official act was to call for a 5-mill election on November 3, 1987, to provide for operating expenses for the district. The 5-mill operational levy was approved by solid margins.
Kenneth Glazier began duties as Superintendent of the district on March 1, 1988.
In April 1988, a contest was held to name the vo-tech district. The winning name, Chisholm Trail Area Vocational-Technical Center, was submitted by Roger McAdams of Kingfisher.
Fifty acres of land were purchased for the construction of the center. HT&B Architect firm of Oklahoma City was hired to design the facility. Short-term adult classes began in Kingfisher and Watonga in September 1988.
Voters in the Watonga, Hitchcock, Lomega, and Kingfisher school districts went to the polls on September 27, 1988, and passed a $2.6 million bond issue to build and equip the center. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on Friday, June 2, 1989. The building was completed and dedication ceremonies were held on Sunday, August 12, 1990. Classes in the new facility began that month for adult and high school students.
In 2001 the center changed its legal name to Chisholm Trail Technology Center.
Max Thomas was hired in July 2007 as the current Superintendent.
On April 1st, 2014 the Dover Public Schools voted to annex to Chisholm Trail Technology Center to become the forth school in the CTTC district.

Paul Berna

Jean-Marie-Edmond Sabran (21 February 1908, Hyères, Var – 19 January 1994, Paris), best known by his pseudonym Paul Berna, was a French writer whose children's books were also published in Britain and the United States. 
Before becoming a full-time writer, he worked on a suburban newspaper. After publishing several books under his own name, from 1952 he wrote children's books under the pseudonym Paul Berna. His books were published by Rouge et Or, the publishing house where his brother Guy Sabran worked as an illustrator. The brothers collaborated on "Zoupette en camping", "Les Contes des mille et une nuits" and "Nous irons à Lunaterra". 
His most famous book, "Le Cheval sans tête", usually known in English as "A Hundred Million Francs", was published in 1958. It concerns the adventures of a gang of street urchins from the slums of Paris whose plaything, a headless horse on wheels, is used as a hiding-place by train robbers. It has been translated into several languages, enjoying great success in Britain and the United States. In 1963, the Disney Studios in Britain filmed the book as "The Horse Without a Head: The 100,000,000 Franc Train Robbery", scripted by T. E. B. Clarke and starring Jean-Pierre Aumont and Herbert Lom.
"The Mystery of the Cross-eyed Man" was read on "Jackanory" in 1968 by Keith Barron. 
Paul Berna also wrote science fiction novels, the best known being "La Porte des étoiles" ("Threshold of the Stars") and its sequel "Le Continent du Ciel" ("Continent in the Sky"). 
For his adult novels he used the pseudonyms Bernard Deleuze and Paul Gerrard, and for detective fiction, Joel Audrenn. 
In 1958, Jean Sabran married Jany Saint-Marcoux, herself an author of Rouge et Or books for children. 
At the end of his life he suffered from blindness.

Winchester Psalter

The Winchester Psalter is an English 12th-century illuminated manuscript psalter (British Library, Cotton MS. Nero C.iv), also sometimes known as the "Psalter of Henry of Blois", and formerly known as the "St Swithun's Psalter". It was probably made for use in Winchester, most scholars agreeing that the most likely patron was the Henry of Blois, brother of Stephen, King of England, and Bishop of Winchester from 1129 until his death in 1171. Until recent decades it was "a little-studied masterpiece of English Romanesque painting", but it has been the subject of several recent studies.
The manuscript now has 142 vellum leaves of 32 x 22.25 cm, which after a fire in 1731 have been cut and mounted individually, and rebound.
Miniatures.
The thirty-eight full-page miniatures are all grouped at the beginning of the manuscript. They are nearly all divided horizontally into two or three compartments with different scenes, creating an unusually extended narrative cycle of more than eighty scenes covering the Old Testament (6 pages), the Life of the Virgin and Life of Christ (23 pages) and several scenes covering the Second Coming and Last Judgement (9 pages) - a number of non-narrative subjects such as the "Jesse Tree", "Christ in Majesty" and an enthroned Virgin being included in these figures. Together they form "one of the most unusual and innovative miniature cycles of the twelfth century"
Most of the miniatures are drawings tinted with coloured washes set against fully painted backgrounds. This is a common English technique from at least the 11th to the 13th century. Two miniatures, of the "Death of the Virgin" and the "Virgin Enthroned", are in a different fully painted technique and style, and follow Byzantine iconographic models, although the forms of the drapery are English in style. The other miniatures are all closely related to one another in style, though some are of markedly higher quality than others. According to Heslop, this is deliberately done to reflect the social status of the subjects depicted; Haney considers it may be the result of an artist working closely with a less skilled assistant. Apart from the two "Byzantine" miniatures, all the others have borders of geometric ornament, onto which the central image sometimes impinges. Many scenes or parts of scenes are just drawn in ink, presumably unfinished, especially towards the end of the cycle. Some paint has been added to areas by a less skilled artist, probably a few decades after the original work. Many miniatures have titles in Norman-French, in a different hand to the main text, probably added later in the 12th century. The original sequence of the miniatures is uncertain.
Haney's analysis of the iconography of the cycle suggests a variety of sources and influences were involved. Some details can be found in Early Christian works such as the Cotton Genesis but not in works from later periods. Other details show awareness of Carolingian and Ottonian traditions, while much else continues Anglo-Saxon and English Romanesque iconography.

The manuscript contains:
Patron.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that the patron was Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester from 1129 to 1171:
Some pieces of evidence suggest instead that the manuscript was not made for Henry of Blois, and may instead have been made for a woman, although the personal Latin prayers use masculine forms:
History.
It is not known where the manuscript was between the 13th century and 1638, when it appears in a catalogue of the collection formed by the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton between about 1588 and 1629, and added to by his son and grandson. The manuscript was damaged in the fire in 1731 at Ashburnham House in which many of the Cotton manuscripts were damaged. As a result, the bifolia were split into single leaves, and there is some uncertainty about their original sequence, which has been partly resolved by the recent discovery of verdigris offsets which confirm which miniatures originally faced each other. Cotton's library formed one of the foundation collections of the British Museum, from which the British Library was formed in 1973. The manuscript was on semi-permanent exhibition at the British Museum, but is now very rarely exhibited at the new St Pancras site of the British Library.

Tian Hongzheng

Tian Hongzheng (田弘正) (764 – August 29, 821), né Tian Xing (田興), courtesy name Andao (安道), formally Duke Zhongmin of Yi (沂忠愍公), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. Under his governance, Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), which had not been under actual imperial control for decades, submitted to imperial control, but he was killed by mutineers while later serving as military governor ("Jiedushi") of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei).
Background.
Tian Xing was born in 764, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. He was the second son of Tian Tingjie (田庭玠), a cousin of Tian Chengsi, who was then ruling Weibo Circuit as its military governor, in "de facto" independence from the imperial government. It was said that in Tian Xing's youth, he studied the Confucian classics but particularly military strategies. He was also said to be capable in horsemanship and archery, and was brave and polite. Tian Chengsi favored him and had him named Xing (meaning "prosperity"). After Tian Tingjie died in 782 in distress (after being unable to dissuade Tian Chengsi's nephew and successor Tian Yue from turning against the imperial government), Tian Xing's older brother Tian Rong (田融) became in charge of watching over his younger brothers. On one occasion, after Tian Xing won an archery contest among Weibo soldiers, Tian Rong battered him and told him, "If you do not keep your abilities hidden, disaster will come to you." Traditional historians credited Tian Rong's teaching for Tian Xing's ability to survive in the following years.
Service under Tian Ji'an and Tian Huaijian.
During the governance of Tian Chengsi's grandson Tian Ji'an (796-812), Tian Xing became the commander of the headquarters guards. It was said that Tian Ji'an was wasteful, uncaring of soldiers, and harsh in punishment, and Tian Xing often spoke to him, hoping to correct his behavior, and that the soldiers often looked up to Tian Xing for support. Tian Ji'an became suspicious of Tian Xing and demoted him out of the headquarters, to be the defender of Linqing (臨清, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), and considered executing Tian Xing. Tian Xing, in order to avoid disaster, pretended to suffer from paralysis. Meanwhile, by 812, Tian Ji'an himself fell ill and behaved erratically. Tian Ji'an's wife Lady Yuan had their 10-year-old son Tian Huaijian designated deputy military governor and acting military governor, and Tian Ji'an died shortly after. Tian Xing was recalled from Linqing to serve as the commander of the soldiers.
Meanwhile, because of Tian Huaijian's youth, the servant Jiang Shize (蔣士則) came to be making the key decisions, and Jiang made movements that were based on his own likes and dislikes, causing the soldiers to be disgruntled. Further, then-reigning Emperor Xianzong (Emperor Dezong's grandson) was withholding the official commissioning for Tian Huaijian, hoping to cause a mutiny at Weibo. One morning, when Tian Xing was set to enter headquarters to meet Tian Huaijian, the soldiers surrounding him and bowed to him, asking him to be active military governor. Tian Xing agreed under the conditions that the soldiers would not harm Tian Huaijian and would be willing to submit to imperial orders, and the soldiers agreed. Tian Xing then executed Jiang and his associates and moved Tian Huaijian out of the headquarters.
As military governor of Weibo Circuit.
Tian Xing presented maps and census rolls of the six prefectures of Weibo Circuit to Emperor Xianzong to show submission, and did not commission his own officials. After a debate between the chancellors Li Jifu (who advocated making Tian acting military governor) and Li Jiang (who advocated making Tian the official military governor immediately and further advocated a large money reward to the soldiers of Weibo for their submission), Emperor Xianzong agreed with Li Jiang. He sent the official Pei Du to Weibo to show approval and encouragement to Tian, and it was said that when Pei discussed with Tian the proper ways to be loyal, Tian was respectful and not bored in his hearing Pei's statements. He further accepted the imperial government's commissions of 90 officials below him — including the deputy military governor Hu Zheng (胡證) — without objection, submitted taxes that Tian Ji'an had withheld to the imperial treasury, and rebuffed attempts by Tian Ji'an's allied circuits — Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Chengde, and Zhangyi (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) — to bring him into the alliance. Emperor Xianzong also created him the Duke of Yi and gave him the honorary title of "Yinqing Guanglu Daifu" (銀青光祿大夫). Emperor Xianzong further gave him a new name — Hongzheng (meaning "magnification of righteousness").
As a result of Weibo's submission, the imperial forces stationed at Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan), which was stationed at Heyang, between Weibo and the eastern capital Luoyang to defend against Weibo, were moved to Ru Prefecture (汝州, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan) to instead defend against Zhangyi, whose military governor Wu Shaoyang had died earlier, and it was said that this movement pleased Tian Hongzheng greatly. When Emperor Xianzong did not allow Wu Shaoyang's son Wu Yuanji to succeed Wu Shaoyang, Wu Yuanji reacted by openly pillaging the surrounding circuits, and Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Wu Yuanji in spring 815. Tian Hongzheng sent his son Tian Bu, with a detachment of 3,000 soldiers, to serve in the campaign.
With Emperor Xianzong also having declared the military governor of Chengde Circuit, Wang Chengzong, a renegade — but not declared a campaign against Wang at that point — Tian Hongzheng led his troops to wait on the border with Chengde, and Wang repeatedly harassed his troops. Tian Hongzheng requested permission to enter Chengde territory, and Emperor Xianzong authorized him to advance to Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern Xingtai). It was also said that it was because of Tian's loyalty to the imperial government that the military governor of Pinglu, Li Shidao, did not dare to openly aid Zhangyi. After Wu was defeated and captured by the imperial general Li Su in 817, Wang became fearful, and he made offers through Tian to submit to the imperial government. Tian relayed Wang's offers to the imperial government, and in spring 818, Emperor Xianzong accepted Wang's offer to send his sons Wang Zhigan (王知感) and Wang Zhixin (王知信) to the capital Chang'an as hostages and to submit two of Chengde's six prefectures to imperial control.
Li Shidao initially also offered to do the same as Wang — sending his sons as hostages and submitting three of Pinglu's 12 prefectures — to show submission to the imperial government, but soon reneged on his offer. In anger, Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Pinglu. In the initial stages, Emperor Xianzong, at Pei's suggestion, had the Weibo forces remain at Weibo to rest themselves (and to prevent unnecessary expenditures, as once a circuit's troops left the circuit, the imperial treasury would be responsible for their expenditures) until winter 818, when under imperial orders Weibo forces under Tian Hongzheng crossed the Yellow River and approached Pinglu's capital prefecture Yun Prefecture, causing much alarm at Yun Prefecture. Tian scored several victories against Pinglu forces under the Pinglu officer Liu Wu, in spring 819. Li Shidao, suspecting that Liu was disloyal, sent messengers to Liu's deputy Zhang Xian (張暹) to order Zhang to kill Liu and take over the army. Zhang, instead, informed Liu. Liu responded by commanding his forces to turn back to Yun Prefecture. He captured and executed Li Shidao and his sons, sent their heads to Tian, and submitted to the imperial government. When Emperor Xianzong subsequently commissioned Liu to be the military governor of Yicheng Prefecture (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) but feared that Liu would resist the commission and want to hold onto control of Pinglu, he had Tian take precautions by commanding forces from Weibo and several other circuits to move into Yun Prefecture. Liu did not resist and accepted the post at Yicheng. In the aftermaths of the campaign, Tian was given the title of acting "Situ" (司徒, one of the Three Excellencies) and honorary chancellor with the title "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). Once Tian arrived at Yun Prefecture, he ended the harsh rule of Li Shidao and his predecessors. Pinglu was subsequently divided into three circuits and given to three different governors. It was at this point historians regarded the reestablishment of Tang's imperial power during Emperor Xianzong's reign reached its apex.
Later in 819, Tian went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong, and Emperor Xianzong treated him well; he was also given the greater honorary chancellor title of "Shizhong" (侍中). Tian offered to remain at Chang'an, but Emperor Xianzong declined and returned him to his post at Weibo. As Tian was loyal and was concerned that eventually, his soldiers would demand that his family inherit his position, he sent his brothers, sons, and nephews all to Chang'an, and Emperor Xianzong gave them prominent positions.
As military governor of Chengde Circuit.
In spring 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong. In winter 820, after Wang Chengzong died, the Chengde soldiers supported Wang Chengzong's brother Wang Chengyuan as successor, but Wang Chengyuan, while pretending to accept, sent secret submissions to Emperor Muzong declining the position. Emperor Muzong thus carried out a group of military governor movements for Weibo, Chengde, and three other nearby circuits — making Tian Hongzheng the military governor of Chengde, Wang Chengyuan the military governor of Yicheng, Liu Wu the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Li Su the military governor of Weibo, and Tian Bu the military governor of Heyang. (Emperor Muzong's making Tian Hongzheng military governor of Chengde was against the advice of the general Yang Yuanqing (楊元慶), who also tried to persuade the chancellors that it was not a good idea, but Yang's suggestions were also ignored by the chancellors.)
As Tian Hongzheng had battled Chengde forces for years, he believed that the Chengde soldiers would bear him great hatred. He thus took 2,000 Weibo soldiers with him to Chengde and kept them with him as his personal guards. He submitted requests to the directorate of finance for the soldiers to be paid out of the imperial treasury. However, the director of finances, Cui Ling (崔倰), a relative of the chancellor Cui Zhi, not understanding the scope of the situation, believed that Chengde soldiers had the responsibilities of protecting their governor and that Weibo soldiers should be returned to Weibo, and that approving Tian's request would create a bad precedent, and thus refused Tian's requests. After Tian made four requests and failed to receive approval, he had to order the Weibo soldiers to return to Weibo.
Meanwhile, Tian Hongzheng was also drawing resentment from the soldiers for another reason. He was known for treating his family well — so much so that his relatives at Chang'an and Luoyang were becoming extremely wasteful. As a result, while at Weibo and later at Chengde, he extracted much revenue from the people and sent them to Chang'an and Luoyang for his family to use. As a result, the soldiers of both circuits resented him for this. Further, at that time, Emperor Muzong had issued an edict that a large cash reward be given to the Chengde soldiers for their submission, but the directorate of finance did not deliver the reward quickly, and the Chengde soldiers became even more resentful. The officer Wang Tingcou, originally of Huigu extraction but whose great-grandfather had been adopted by Wang Chengzong's grandfather Wang Wujun, planned a mutiny, and often found ways to foster the soldiers' resentment toward Tian. He decided to act as soon as the Weibo soldiers left Chengde.
On the night of August 29, 821, Wang Tingcou gathered his soldiers outside headquarters and charged into the headquarters, slaughtering Tian, his staff, and their families — over 300 people. Subsequently, after an unsuccessful campaign against Wang, Emperor Muzong was forced to commission Wang as the new military governor. He gave Tian Hongzheng the posthumous name of "Zhongmin" (meaning, "faithful and suffering") and ordered Wang to return Tian's body. However, Wang claimed that Tian's body could not be located by that point.

Madonna with the Blue Diadem

The Madonna with the Blue Diadem is a painting by Raphael and his pupil Gianfrancesco Penni, and was most likely painted in Rome around 1512, now at the Louvre.
In the Louvre, the painting is named "Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John", also known as "Virgin with the Veil" or "Virgin with the Blue Diadem". Additional names include "Virgin with the Linen", "Slumbering Child" and "Silence of the Holy Virgin."
History.
Legend has it that at one time the panel, split in two, was used to cover casks in Pescia. Once found, they were said to be expertly joined. There is also a different version where the panel was split into three pieces to make a screen, which was made whole again.
By the later part of the 16th century, it had been in the Chateauneuf Collection, Paris and descended to his heir, Marquis de la Vallière.
In 1620 the painting was owned by Marquis de la Vallière, Secretary of State, as part of the La Valière Collection in Paris. In 1713, Prince Louis Alexander de Bourbon, Comte de Toulouse, owned the painting and from him passed in 1728 into the collection of Prince de Carignano.
From at least 1728 to 1743 is was in the possession of Victor Amadeus I, Prince of Carignan. After he died, the painting fell to his son Luigi di Carignano and painter Rigauld mediated the sale in 1742 dispersed to Louis XV in 1743.
The last Raphael painting to enter the French Royal Collection, it was acquired from the Prince of Carignano in 1742 dispersed to Louis XV in 1743.
Description.
Although there is question about the artist, the composition is almost certainly that of Raphael. Due to the use of bright, acid colors and the porcelain-like finish, it is thought that the painting of the composition may have been the work of one of his pupils, Giovanfrancesco Penni and to be dated around 1518.
The painting is similar to the "Madonna of Loreto" (Musée Condé, Chantilly), featuring the symbolic lifting of the veil. The use of veil in Renaissance paintings, from the "Meditations on the Life of Christ", symbolizes the manner in which the Madonna wrapped the Child in the veil from her head at the Nativity and, prophetically, again at the Crucifixion.
Here the Virgin lifts the veil over the sleeping Child, who is turned toward the audience, with her other arm around the young John the Baptist, who has a reed across his shoulder. Both the Virgin and John are in profile. Attached to a blue diadem, a veil that flows down her head, across her shoulders and clings to her arms. A draped tunic, belted at the waist, flowing overtop her red underdress.
While the paintings has some similarity to the "Madonna of Loreto", Raphael make a more dramatic statement, such as through the use of ruins of the Sacchetti Villa and vineyard, near the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
There is also refinement in the features and limbs of the Christ child. The child is very calm, contrasted to the expression of awe and adoration by the young John.

Aslan

Aslan ( or ) is the main character of C. S. Lewis's "The Chronicles of Narnia" series. He is "the great Lion" of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books of the series. "Aslan" is Turkish for "lion". Lewis often capitalises the word "lion" in reference to Aslan, since, at least partially, he represents Jesus.
Aslan is depicted as a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea, lord of Narnia; a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual); mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit; guardian and saviour of Narnia. The author, C. S. Lewis, described Aslan as an alternative version of Christ; that is, as the form in which Christ might have appeared in a fantasy world.
Throughout the series, it is stated that Aslan is "not a tame lion," since, despite his gentle and loving nature, he is powerful and can be dangerous. He has many followers, including humans, talking beasts, and mythological creatures such as Centaurs, Fauns, Dryads, Dwarfs, Satyrs, Naiads, Hamadryads, Mermaids, Sylvans, Unicorns, and Winged Horses.
Role in "The Chronicles of Narnia".
In "The Magician's Nephew".
When Digory, Polly, Jadis, Uncle Andrew, the Cabby and Strawberry inadvertently enter a new world using magic rings, they find it an empty void. Aslan appears, and through the power of his singing, calls the world of Narnia into existence.
All the characters immediately feel awe for Aslan. Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan with an iron bar that she tore from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song is so great that even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning lamp post, and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims the power of his song will last for a few days.
Aslan then selects two of most animals that his song has called into existence and gives them the power of speech and reason. He instructs them to look after all the animals. He appoints the cabby to be King Frank of Narnia and brings his wife Nellie from Earth to be Queen Helen.
Aslan explains that Jadis will pose a great threat to the Narnians, and charges Digory and Polly with a quest to acquire a magic apple so they may plant it to protect the land. To aid them, he turns Strawberry into a winged horse named Fledge. When the quest is complete, he crowns Frank and Helen, and advises Digory to take an apple from the tree to revive his sick mother.
At the end of the novel, he takes Digory, Polly and Uncle Andrew back to the Wood between the Worlds, without the use of magic rings, and warns them that their Earth is in danger of a similar fate to the dead world Charn, which is the world that Jadis (the White Witch) is from.
In "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe".
Aslan is first introduced in the book "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe". Narnia is now in the hundredth year of the tyrannical rule of Jadis, who has returned as a powerful sorceress called the White Witch, Jadis has condemned the land to endless winter – but never Christmas – and has turned hundreds of Aslan's followers to stone. 
He is first mentioned by Mr. Beaver, who tells the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) that "Aslan is on the move". He explains that Aslan is the true king of Narnia and that the children (as Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) are the chosen ones to help end the tyrannical rule of the White Witch. Even as the children explore Narnia, Aslan's presence begins to weaken Jadis' grip on the land; the ice begins to melt and Father Christmas appears at last and gives the children gifts. 
Edmund, who was enchanted by the White Witch on his first visit to Narnia by eating enchanted Turkish Delight, attempts to betray his siblings and is not present to receive a gift. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver lead the others to Aslan at the Stone Table at a large gathering of Loyal Narnians preparing for war. Aslan sends his creatures to rescue Edmund. Peter slays Maugrim the Wolf, chief of the Witch's secret police, and Aslan makes Peter a knight.
The White Witch comes in parley and demands her right to execute Edmund for his betrayal, citing Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time that gives her power over all traitors. In private conversation with her, Aslan offers himself in Edmund's place, and she accepts his offer, though none of Aslan's followers know this. Susan and Lucy, unable to sleep, follow Aslan to the Stone Table that night. They watch from afar as the White Witch asks her evil people to tie him up, shave him, and the Witch kills Aslan with her knife.
With her greatest adversary dead, the Witch leaves with her army to prepare for war against the Narnians, convinced that she will win. Lucy, Susan, and a number of mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body; but as the Stone Table breaks they find that his body is gone. To their shock, Aslan reappears alive and well, thanks to a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time. The Witch, having entered Narnia only at the Dawn of Time, had not known of this. Aslan explains that the Deeper Magic is invoked when an innocent willingly offers his life in place of a traitor's, causing death itself to be reversed until the victim is reborn.
Aslan goes to the Witch's palace and, with his breath, brings the statues of her petrified enemies back to life. He leads them all to aid Peter, Edmund, and the Narnian army, who are fighting the Witch's army. At the conclusion of the battle, Aslan leaps upon the Witch and kills her.
After the defeat of the evil forces, Aslan crowns the four children as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and during the celebration he quietly slips away. The children say nothing about it, for Mr. Beaver had warned them, "...one day you'll see him and another you won't" (a line assigned to Tumnus in the 2005 film), foreshadowing Aslan's role in the books to follow.
In "The Horse and his Boy".
"The Horse and His Boy" is set during the reign of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in Narnia, the only extended story told of that period.
This book is about finding one's home. The talking horses Bree and Hwin seek their home in the land of Narnia where they were born. For Shasta and Aravis, the two humans who journey with them, finding home is more a matter of the heart (For Aravis had run away from home and Shasta ran away to evade slavery).
Aslan's influence throughout "The Horse and his Boy" is at first hidden from the characters. Secretly, he delivered the infant Prince Cor of Archenland from his enemies, placing him in the hands of a Calormene fisherman (who made a slave of him and called him Shasta). When Shasta meets Bree, it is Aslan, disguised as a "witless" lion, who drives them to join Aravis and Hwin. In the form of a cat, Aslan comforts Shasta when he feels abandoned at the Tombs of the Ancient Kings (although as a lion, Aslan defends him from predatory jackals). It is Aslan who chases Bree and Hwin so that they will reach Archenland in time to warn the king of the impending attack by the Calormene army, led by Rabadash. Aslan gives Shasta the resolve to help save Archenland and Narnia from the invaders. He slashes Aravis across the back with his claws as punishment for disregarding her servant's safety when she ran away from home: the cuts on her back equal the severity of her servant's whipping.
Eventually Aslan shows himself directly to the travelers, addressing their fears or their self-pity, or their condescension towards others, or their pomposity (after Shasta and Aravis ask why some of the events happened, he said "I tell no one's story but their own"). After the victory over the Calormenes, Aslan reveals himself to Rabadash in an effort to free him of his arrogant and violent ways. When kind words and forgiveness fail to soften Rabadash, who calls Aslan the "demon of Narnia", Aslan resorts to an act of severe kindness: he turns Rabadash into a donkey. To cure himself of this "condition", Rabadash must present himself at the temple of the Calormene god Tash in Tashban, where in the sight of his people he would be restored to human form. But if he thereafter goes without ten miles of the temple, he would be turned back into a donkey permanently. Since then, Rabadash remained in Tashban where he ruled until his death.
In "Prince Caspian".
The novel "Prince Caspian" takes place 1,300 Narnian years after the events in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe". Aslan and the Pevensie children have become near-forgotten "myths", and Narnia is now ruled by Telmarines, humans who have since conquered and settled in Narnia. 
Aslan serves to guide the Pevensie children to Prince Caspian, but he appears unambiguously to them only when they put their faith in his will and really try to see him.
The loyal Narnians gather at Aslan's How, a mound over the site of the Stone Table. Here Prince Caspian forms his army to fight for Narnia against his uncle. Meanwhile, Aslan re-awakens the spirits of the forest and the river, leading a Bacchanalian revel through the oppressed towns and fomenting a popular revolution.
When the Telmarines are defeated and the Old Order is restored, Aslan creates a door in the air allowing the children to return to Earth – along with any Telmarines who do not wish to remain in the renewed Narnia, where humans and animals are equal. He tells Peter and Susan that they are now too old to return to Narnia, having learned all they can from their experiences there. However, he tells Edmund and Lucy that they may return to Narnia.
In "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader".
Edmund, Lucy and their cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb (who "almost deserved it") arrive into Narnia through a painting of a ship which turns into Caspian's ship, "Dawn Treader". Caspian, having established peace in Narnia as the new King, has set out on a voyage in search of the Seven Lost Lords who had been loyal to his late father and were subsequently banished by the usurper Miraz. The talking mouse Reepicheep accompanies Caspian in hopes that their voyage will lead to Aslan's Country in the uttermost East, for he was told by a dryad that his fate lies in Aslan's country. Lucy and Caspian come to the conclusion that it was Aslan who summoned the three children into Narnia to help Caspian on his quest.
On many of the islands where they stop, a brief glimpse of Aslan or his image is enough to guide Caspian and his crew away from danger and folly. When the recalcitrant Eustace becomes a dragon, Aslan meets him and pulls the dragon-skin away, leaving Eustace a chastened and more pleasant boy.
In a magician's house on another island, Lucy attempts to perform a spell that would make her tragically beautiful, despite being warned of negative consequences. Just as she is about to say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.
Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep the mouse reach the world's end, where Aslan appears as a lamb before transforming into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a breakfast of fish for the disciples). He shows Reepicheep the way to his country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead come to know him in their world — a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does not say whether Eustace will return to Narnia.
In "The Silver Chair".
The story begins with Eustace Scrubb, who was introduced in "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", and his classmate Jill. They are unhappy at their school, where bullying is left uncorrected. One day they are beset by bullies, and Eustace suggests that they ask for Aslan's help. They blunder through a temporary gate and find themselves in Aslan's Country, atop an immense cliff. Jill, showing off, moves too close to the edge, and Eustace falls off trying to pull her back.
Aslan appears and saves Eustace by blowing him into Narnia. Then he explains to Jill that she and Eustace are charged with the quest of finding Caspian's son Prince Rilian who disappeared years before. He tells her that their task has become more difficult because of what she did, but gives her four Signs to guide them on their quest. The fourth and final Sign is that at a key moment they will be asked to do something "in Aslan's name."
According to the Narnian timeline, fifty years have elapsed since "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader".
Aslan then blows Jill into Narnia, where she arrives a few moments after Eustace. They see a very old King Caspian setting sail to search for Aslan one last time, but fail to realise who he is until it is too late, and are unable to speak to him. However, the elderly Lord Regent, Trumpkin the Dwarf, takes them to Cair Paravel. There they are aided by Master Glimfeather the Owl and a Parliament of his fellow talking owls (a pun on Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, and a nod toward "parliament" as a collective noun for owls, as "exaltation" is for larks). The owls explain that Rilian disappeared while searching for the green serpent that killed his mother; they believe that he is now under the spell of an enchantress he had seen in the forest while searching for the serpent. As Jill and Eustace journey toward the far north of Narnia, they acquire a companion and guide, a gloomy but stalwart Marsh-wiggle, fittingly named Puddleglum (or "the wet blanket").
Aslan makes no further appearance until the end of the story, but his Signs prove central to the quest, and belief in Aslan plays a crucial part in defeating the Lady of the Green Kirtle, who tries to destroy the children's belief in the reality of Narnia. The children manage to rescue Rilian, and they return him to Narnia just in time to meet his father who dies shortly afterwards.
In the end, Aslan sends Jill and Eustace back to our world. Aided by a rejuvenated Caspian, Aslan helps them repay the school bullies — and make the school better in the process. Aslan shows himself to the bullies who seeing only what they take to be a wild lion are severely shaken. But no one believes their story, as the only other witnesses are Jill, Eustace and Caspian.
In "The Last Battle".
The ape Shift disguises the reluctant donkey Puzzle as Aslan and fools the Narnians into thinking that Aslan has returned. Shift issues commands in "Aslan's" name and takes advantage of the credulous Narnians.
Shift and the unbelieving Calormene leader Rishda Tarkaan encourage the invading Calormenes and the dispirited Narnians to treat Aslan and the Calormene god Tash as a single, combined being — "Tashlan." Dissenters are thrown into Puzzle's stable supposedly to meet "Tashlan" where they are murdered by Calormene soldiers.
King Tirian of Narnia calls on Aslan for help, and Jill and Eustace arrive in Narnia. They help Tirian and the remaining loyal Narnians battle the Calormenes and their allies, but are all forced through the stable door along with several Black Dwarfs. They find themselves not within the confines of a stable, but in a paradise: Aslan's Country. Aslan is there, with King Peter and the other Pevensies (except for Susan who no-longer believes in Narnia) with other characters from previous books, and they watch through the stable door as the world of Narnia is destroyed with the dragons and the salamanders ripping up the trees and Father Time crushing the sun. All of the people and animals (including those who had previously died) gather outside the barn and are judged by Aslan. The animals who have been loyal to Aslan or the morality upheld by Narnians join Aslan in Aslan's Country. The animals who have opposed or deserted him become ordinary animals and vanish to an unknown place that not even C.S. Lewis knows where they went. The Black Dwarfs (who, unlike the Red Dwarfs, have lost faith in Aslan) are unable to see Aslan's Country, certain that they are still inside an ordinary stable. When Lucy asks Aslan to help them, he tells her that he will show her what he can and what he cannot do. He then growls at the Black Dwarfs, and makes food magically appear in their hands. This fails to convince them: they think that the growling is a machine and that the food is only what would normally be found in a stable. Aslan tells the children that the Black Dwarfs shut themselves out from him, and therefore cannot be reached much like Uncle Andrew in "The Magician's Nephew".
Aslan then commands Peter to shut the door on Narnia, and he leads them into his country, a platonic ideal of Narnia. He greets Emeth, a devout yet kind Tash-worshipping Calormene, telling him that "I and Tash are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him." As they get "further up and further in," the Narnians find Aslan's country getting bigger and better, eventually encompassing Earth as well. Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Jill learn that they have died, or rather, passed into Aslan's country, which is more real than the "Shadowlands" (to use Lewis's own word) from which they have come.
Influences.
The theory that the figure of Aslan may have been inspired by a mysterious lion which appears and disappears suddenly at key moments in the novel "The Place of the Lion", written by Lewis' close friend Charles Williams, was specifically denied by Lewis in a paper published later in his life.
Christian interpretation.
Although Aslan can be read as an original character, parallels exist with Christ. In particular, Aslan's sacrifice and subsequent resurrection parallel Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. Aslan also has God-like powers; he created Narnia with a song ("The Magician’s Nephew"). The Emperor-Over-the-Sea then refers to God the Father, and Aslan’s country ("The Voyage of the Dawn Treader") to heaven. In "The Last Battle" a new Narnia is made and also a new Earth, as in the Book of Revelation. Furthermore, there are biblical references of Christ being called a lion, as in Revelation 5:5 "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof" (KJV). When he first appeared at the end of "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", he looked like a lamb, which is also a symbol of Christ, who is frequently described throughout the New Testament as being "The Lamb of God".
According to the author, Aslan is not an allegorical portrayal of Christ, but rather a suppositional incarnation of Christ Himself:
This interpretation is related to J. R. R. Tolkien's concept of "secondary creation" expounded in his 1947 essay "On Fairy-Stories," reflecting discussions Lewis and Tolkien had in the Inklings group.
Aslan's words to the Calormene in "The Last Battle" ("I take to me the services which thou hast done to false god... if any man swear by and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by [Christ that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him"), ratifying the good deeds the latter did even under the name of Tash, have been the subject of controversy in some Christian circles. See Emeth for details.
Portrayals.
The first visual dramatization of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", broadcast on British television in 1967, presented a bipedal Aslan played by Bernard Kay. In the animated adaptation of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" distributed by the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), Aslan is voiced by Stephen Thorne. Thorne also makes appearances as the Great Lion in the adaptations made in the mid-1990s by BBC Radio.
In all four of the BBC television serial adaptations of the late 1980s and early 1990s ("The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" tales told in one package, "The Silver Chair"), Aslan is voiced by Ronald Pickup and the elaborate costume/puppet is operated by Alisa Berk, Tim Rose, and William Todd-Jones. In the Focus on the Family radio adaptations, he is portrayed by David Suchet.
In the 2005 film, ', the CGI Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson. Neeson returned to voice the character in the sequel, ' in 2008, and the third film in the series, "".

Allen McKnight

Allen Darrell McKnight (born 27 January 1964) is a Northern Irish former international footballer who played professionally in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, and Hong Kong as a goalkeeper.
Club career.
Born in Antrim, McKnight played youth football for a number of local clubs including Crumlin Boys, Crumlin Rec., and Chimney Corner.
He began his senior career in 1984 with Distillery, and he also played for Celtic, Albion Rovers, West Ham United, Airdrieonians, Stockport County, Rotherham United, Walsall, South China and Exeter City.
Celtic.
McKnight signed for Celtic in August 1986, joining up again with his former Distillery team-mate Anton Rogan who had arrived at Parkhead a few months earlier. He did not feature in any first-team games in his first year, and was loaned out to Albion Rovers to gain experience of the Scottish game. With the departure of Peter Latchford in the summer of 1987, McKnight rose up in the pecking order at Celtic to second-choice keeper, behind first choice Pat Bonner. McKnight played several games for Celtic at the start of season 1987–88 in place of Bonner who had contracted a virus. He made his debut in a 5–1 win away to Dumbarton in a league cup tie on 26 August 1987 and went on to play in three Old firm league games, a 1–0 win at Parkhead, a 2–2 draw at Ibrox and a 2–0 win in the New Year game at Parkhead. Bonner regained his place in the team upon his recovery from illness, but McKnight's 12 league appearances and 5 clean sheets helped the club to win the League Championship. An injury to Bonner in May 1988 saw McKnight play in the 1988 Scottish Cup Final against Dundee Utd, and he won another winner's medal as Celtic triumphed 2–1 at Hampden. McKnight left Parkhead for West Ham a couple of months later.
West Ham United.
During his West Ham United career he was known by the fans as "McKnightmare" because of his frequent goalkeeping errors. Signed from Celtic in the summer of 1988 McKnight made his West Ham debut on 10 September 1988 in a 1–0 away win against Wimbledon. Competing for the goalkeeper's place with an ageing Phil Parkes, McKnight played all his 23 league games for West Ham in his first season. His last league game coming on 23 May 1989, a 5–1 away defeat to Liverpool which saw West Ham relegated to the Second Division. He had to wait eighteen months for his next game, also a 5–1 defeat, away to Luton Town in the Full Members Cup.
He later played non-league football with teams including Collier Row, Romford and Collier Row & Romford (a merger of his two previous teams).
International career.
McKnight earned 10 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team between 1987 and 1989.

Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act

The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act is a bill that was introduced into the U.S. Congress in February 2009. The proposed legislation would allow U.S. citizens to engage in unrestricted travel to Cuba for the first time since 1963. The bill was introduced by Rep. William Delahunt (D-Mass) with eight co-sponsors, including Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn), Sam Farr (D-Calif), and Ron Paul (R- Texas).
Bob Whitley, president of the United States Tour Operators Association, has supported the measure, remarking "if Americans don't like the policies of the government of a country, they can choose not to go. But a lot of people want to see Cuba because they've been denied the right."
The bill is currently sidelined in a committee.
Support.
As of July 2009, the bill had more than 150 Congressional signatories. Florida attorney Tony Martinez has voiced support of the bill noting that "U.S. foreign policy shouldn't be manipulated to serve a political agenda", while noting that "the majority of all Americans want the ending of the embargo and the lifting of travel restrictions."
In July 2010, "Newsweek magazine" reported that a poll conducted by Andy Gomez, associate provost at the University of Miami, found that 64 percent of Cuban-Americans in Miami now support a unilateral lifting of the travel ban. In lieu of changing perceptions, former Democratic Senator Gary Hart criticized the continuing embargo, remarking "second generation Cuban-Americans are finally beginning to change their community's attitudes and make it clear they no longer are interested in holding the mighty U.S.'s foreign policy toward a tiny nearby country hostage to their parents' anger."
In June 2011, former Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern spoke out against the travel ban before visiting Cuba, remarking:
McGovern blamed "embittered Cuban exiles in Miami" for keeping the embargo alive all these years, because of their dislike for Fidel Castro.

German submarine U-377

German submarine "U-377" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 8 April 1940 at the Howaldtswerke yard in Kiel, launched on 15 August 1941, and commissioned on 2 October 1941 under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Otto Köhler.
"U-377" was attached to the 6th U-boat Flotilla, and was ready for front-line service from 1 February 1942. She served with the 11th U-boat Flotilla based in Norway from July 1942, and was transferred to the 9th U-boat Flotilla based in France on 1 March 1943. She sailed on 11 war patrols between February 1942 and January 1944, but sank no ships, before she was sunk with the loss of all hands on 17 January 1944 south-west of Ireland, in position , by one of her own homing torpedos or (more probably) by depth charges from the British destroyer and the frigate .
Service history.
Norway.
"U-377" sailed from Kiel on 14 February 1942 and patrolled along the coast of Norway before arriving at Narvik on 28 February. This was her home port for the rest of the year, she sailed on a series of six patrols in the Barents Sea, without success.
On 30 January 1943 "U-377" left Bergen and sailed out into the Atlantic, patrolling south of Greenland, before arriving at Brest in France on 18 March, having been transferred to the 9th U-boat Flotilla.
France.
"U-377" sailed from Brest on 15 April, out into the mid-Atlantic, and patrolled for 54 days, before returning to base on 7 June.
On 2 August 1943 her commander, Otto Köhler, left the boat and was replaced by "Oberleutnant zur See" Gerhard Kluth. Kluth's first patrol was quite eventful, as her first two attempts were cut short; "U-377" sailed from Brest on 26 August 1943, but returned on the 30th; she sailed again on 6 September 1943, returning the next day. Finally she set out again on 9 September, joining other U-boats in mid-Atlantic. On 22 September, the U-boat was attacked by a B-24 Liberator, wounding the commander. The U-boat returned to port under the command of the I WO. "Leutnant zur See" Ernst-August Gerke.
Loss.
"U-377" departed from Brest on 15 December 1943, with Kluth back in command, sailing out into mid-Atlantic. She made her last radio report on 15 January 1944, claiming to have attacked an unidentified search group with homing torpedoes. The BdU ("U-boat Command") expected the U-boat to head back to France on or about 29 January, so when she had failed to arrive by 10 February, she was listed as missing from 4 February 1944. After the war the Allied Assessment Committee were unable to attribute the loss of "U-377" to any known anti-submarine attack, and the U-boat was officially recorded as "lost to unknown cause". The "Kriegsmarine" had received at least two partially corrupted unsigned coded emergency messages around the time of the U-boat's disappearance, leading to a theory that "U-377" had been sunk by one of its own "Zaunkoenig" T-5 acoustic torpedoes. However, an attack by the British destroyer and frigate on 17 January took place two days and about from " U-377"s last known position, where she would have been, had she been on course and sailing at the most economical speed, as ordered, making it more probable that this was the U-boat's fate.

Ira Van Gieson

Ira Thompson Van Gieson (1866, Long Island – March 24, 1913, New York) was an American neurologist, psychiatrist, bacteriologist and neuropathologist.
He was born in Long Island in 1866, as the son of Dr Ransford Everett Van Gieson (1836–1921). He was of Dutch-Jewish heritage.
Ira Van Gieson graduated from the College of Physicians of Columbia University in 1885. In 1896, he was appointed as first director of the Pathological Institute of the New York State Hospitals for the Insane (renamed New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1929). He was dismissed after five years because of political controversy involving the newly appointed president of the NY State Commission on Lunacy, Peter Wise.
As a result, the whole Institute's faculty resigned
and in 1900 a formal "Protest of the Friends of the Present Management of the N.Y. Pathological Institute" was signed (S. Weir Mitchell, James J. Putnam, Percival Bailey,
Morton Prince, Frederick Peterson, and many others). After dismissal, he returned into the service of the New York State Health Department. He practised hypnosis and occasionally served as a forensic psychiatrist.
He died at the age of 47 at the Bellevue Hospital, NY, on March 24, 1913. He suffered from chronic nephritis. 
His obituarist, William Alanson White, wrote:
"Dr. Van Gieson can best be described in a few words as a genius. He knew none of the rules that applied to the average man. He had a keen and incisive mind, he was alert and full of interest in everything, but he possessed that sensitive organization which made anything approaching control from outside sources utterly unsupportable. He was a spasmodic and irregular worker, when he worked, working with a fervor and depth of distraction that made him utterly forget time, food and, sleep, working for days and days without rest, way into the small hours of the morning. These periods of tremendous activity were followed by days of inactivity, during which he did nothing, and sometimes was entirely inaccessible, not even attending his office. He was, however, tremendously productive."
Van Gieson introduced the picric acid stain (Van Gieson's stain) to neurohistology in 1889. He coined the term "psychomotor epilepsy". 
He collaborated with Boris Sidis, Bernard Sachs and others.

Veckatimest

Veckatimest is the third studio album by the American indie rock band Grizzly Bear, released on May 26, 2009, on Warp Records. The album is named after Veckatimest Island, a small island in Dukes County, Massachusetts. Produced by bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, the album entered the US Billboard 200 at #8, selling 33,000 copies in its first week of release. It has sold around 220,000 copies since September 2012. 
The album was also included in the 2011 edition of the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".
Background and recording.
The recording of "Veckatimest" began in summer 2008 at Allaire Studios in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. Regarding the writing process, Ed Droste states: 
Nico Muhly collaborated with Grizzly Bear on this album. In the interim, they debuted four new songs: "Two Weeks", "While You Wait for the Others", "Fine for Now" and "Cheerleader". They also performed "While You Wait for the Others" on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" on April 21, 2008, and performed "Two Weeks" on "Late Show with David Letterman" on July 23, 2008. The band performed the track "Two Weeks" Live in the UK on Later... with Jools Holland on 5 May 2009
The tracks "Cheerleader", "Ready, Able", "I Live with You" and "Foreground" feature the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.
A deluxe edition of the album was released on November 2, 2009, in Europe. Along with the twelve original tracks, it contained an exclusive 24 page booklet and a bonus disc of "Veckatimest" tracks recorded in various locations. Although the release was exclusive to Europe, the bonus tracks were released digitally to the US in the iTunes Store.
Album leak.
An unmastered version of the album was leaked before its release. Regarding this, Ed Droste states:
Artwork.
The abstract drawing was created by William O'Brien and chosen by Droste, whom he has known since high school. Although the piece was not originally intended to be used as "Veckatimest"'s artwork, O'Brien had been working on it at the same time as Grizzly Bear was working on the record. After contacting O'Brien requesting to use one of his pieces for the new album, Droste received a number of examples to choose from. Initially O'Brien was surprised Droste had chosen that specific piece for the artwork as he felt it had an "awkward placement" to it, but after hearing the album he reconsidered the piece, "it was like this amazing, beautiful thing that happened".
Along with "Veckatimest", O'Brien also created the artwork for the accompanying singles, and the European bonus disc. Although unclarified, it is most likely that the other artwork for the singles and bonus disc was taken from the same abstract series that spawned the "Veckatimest" piece as they all have a similar nature.
"Jack Goes Boating" and "Blue Valentine".
Many of the album's tracks appear in actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's directorial debut, "Jack Goes Boating" (2010), acting as the film's primary score. Hoffman noted, "Susan Jacobs the music supervisor threw Grizzly Bear my way. She was like, "You should really listen to them!" I heard their album and I was like, "Definitely!" There was a bunch of music from Grizzly Bear that I used, which fit so nicely."
Instrumental tracks from the album also appear on the film, "Blue Valentine" (2010), with Grizzly Bear subsequently releasing a soundtrack album to the film, in 2011.
Reception.
On release, "Veckatimest" was greeted with widespread critical acclaim, currently holding a score of 85 at the aggregate critic review site, Metacritic. The album is generally viewed by critics as a large step forward for Grizzly Bear in regards to partial genre-blending, musical complexity and experimentation.
Both "While You Wait for the Others" and "Two Weeks" appeared in Pitchfork Media's "Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s", ranking at #334 and #162 respectively. The album was ranked #42 on their list of the decade's top 200 albums. Rhapsody called it the 8th best album of 2009. Official music videos have been produced for "Two Weeks", "While You Wait for the Others" and "Ready, Able". Veckatimest was also voted Stereogum's second best album of 2009. 
"Veckatimest" was well-placed on many "End of the Year" lists, with "Rolling Stone" placing it at 21st, "Spin" magazine placing it at 4th and Pitchfork Media at 6th.

Tche music

Tchê music or chê music is a variation of the traditional music style from the most southern state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. It incorporates elements from Bahian music (north-east), of the Chorinho (ancient Brazilian style), the Pagode (a variation of Samba), the Samba itself is also used, folk and dance music, to the commonest musical rhythms of Rio Grande do Sul, like the Chamamé, Vaneira and Xote.
This musical style is considered modern for the Rio Grande do Sul's tradition cultivators because in the Tchê Music equipments were incorporated to modernize the rural music, like percussion, drums, electric guitar and DJs.
The Tchê Music is represented mainly by the musical groups Tchê Barbaridade, who began the "Tchê Era", Tchê Garotos and Tchê Guri. Tchê Barbaridade started in the end of the 80s, Tchê Guri in the beginning of the 90s and Tchê Garotos was launched in 1995.
In the middle of 2006, the people of the Traditionalist Movement from Rio Grande do Sul (MTG) prohibited the musicians of Tchê Music to use pilcha (traditional Guacho clothes, buts, bombacha, guaiaca), because they didn't find it a legitim cultural representation from Rio Grande do Sul. They consider that Tchê Music bands are altering the rhythm of the music from the state and its traditional garment. For the MTG, the principal preoccupation is the devaluation of the tradition, which should be above the financial values, or it would lose its finality.
With this kinds of prohibition, the components of the Tchê Music have got united and founded the Tchê Brasil Movement (MTB), in defense of Tchê Music, and created specific places for this style, as well as the CTGs are for the rural music from Rio Grande do Sul.

The Prophet Isaiah (Raphael)

The Prophet Isaiah is a fresco located in Basilica di Sant'Agostino, an early Renaissance church in Rome. It is an Italian Renaissance painting, influenced by Michaelangelo's work on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
Isaiah, a powerful figure, gives the illusion of a three-dimensional character, flanked by putti figures. He carries a Hebrew scroll with his prophecy foretelling the birth of Christ. There is also a message to Saint Anne. Due to wear, Raphael's work has been retouched by other painters over time. In 1960, the fresco was restored to Raphael's vision.
St. Anne Altar.
Johann of Goritz (also Gorizius), from Luxembourg, commissioned Raphael to paint the prophet Isaiah in fresco on a pillar in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino. Soon after his arrival in Rome, his name was Latinised to Janus Corycius. He held the office of receiver of requests. 
Janus was a patron of the arts. Wishing to leave a mark in Rome, he had a chapel built in the Sant'Agostino basilica, with an altar commissioned in 1512 honoring his patron saint Saint Anne. The altar included this fresco of Isaiah and a marble grouping of "Virgin with St. Anne" by Andrea Sansovino. The Saint Anne altar was intended as his tomb.
At the dedication of the church, a steady stream of literary friends honored Corycius with verses that were later was editor and publisher of the 1524 book "Coryciana" by Blosius Palladius, later Bishop of Foligno. The book named 120 poets who contributed verses that became the book.
Michaelangelo influence.
Much comparison is made of the Raphael fresco "Prophet Isaiah" to the work of Michaelangelo, Ernst Gombrich going as far to suggest that Michaelangelo may have hired Raphael to work on Ezekiel for the Sistine Chapel, which he believes is much more reflective of Raphael than of Michaelangelo. This would have allowed Raphael to both gain influence by Michaelangelo and also contribute to a piece of work on the Sistine Chapel.
Within the "Prophet of Isaiah", noted influences by Michaelangelo include:
Legend has it that Corycius complained to Michaelangelo that he had been overcharged for the fresco, to which Michaelangelo responded, "the knee alone is worth the price."

History of Poland during World War I

While Poland did not exist as an independent state during World War I, its geographical position between the fighting powers had meant that much fighting and terrific human and material losses occurred on the Polish lands between 1914 and 1918.
When World War I started, Polish territory, split during partitions between Austria-Hungary, German Empire and Russian Empire, became the scene of much of the operations of the Eastern Front of World War I.
After World War I and the collapse of the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian Empires, Poland became an independent republic.
Split of Three Empires.
The war split the ranks of the three partitioning empires, pitting Russia as defender of Serbia and ally of Britain and France against the leading members of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary.
Conflicting aims of empires.
This circumstance afforded the Poles political leverage as both sides offered pledges of concessions and future autonomy in exchange for Polish loyalty and army recruits.
The Austrians wanted to incorporate the Russian territory of Privislinsky Krai into their territory of Galicia, so even before the war they allowed nationalist organizations to form there (for example, Związek Strzelecki).
The Russians recognized the Polish right to autonomy and allowed formation of the Polish National Committee, which supported the Russian side. Russia's foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov proposed to create an autonomous Kingdom of Poland with its own internal administration, religious freedom and Polish language used in schools and administration Poland would receive eastern area of Poznan region, southern Silesia and Western Galicia
As the war settled into a long stalemate, the issue of Polish self-rule gained greater urgency. Roman Dmowski spent the war years in Western Europe, hoping to persuade the Allies to unify the Polish lands under Russian rule as an initial step toward liberation.
In the meantime, Piłsudski had correctly predicted that the war would ruin all three of the partitioners, a conclusion most people thought highly unlikely before 1918. Piłsudski therefore formed the Polish Legions to assist the Central Powers in defeating Russia as the first step toward full independence for Poland.
The encroaching German forces were met with hostility and distrust. Unlike the Napoleonic forces a century earlier, Poles didn't see them as liberators.
Russians were bid farewell, often with sadness, grief and uncertainty. There was no harassment of retreating Russian soldiers, nor attacks on wounded. For many Poles, Russians at that time were seen as "ours," due to the process of liberalization that occurred in the Russian Empire after the 1905 Revolution. This was in contrast to Germany which, through its actions of relentless Germanization of Poles within its borders, the Września school strike, persecution of Polish education in Pomerania na Poznań, and in 1914 the Destruction of Kalisz increased pro-Russian and anti-German feelings. This attitude distressed Austrian-orientated Piłsudski. Only in late summer of 1915 after harsh policy of Russian plunder of Polish lands did the sympathy of Poles for Russia waned.
Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918).
In 1916, attempting to increase Polish support for the Central Powers and to raise a Polish army the German and Austrian emperors declared that a new state called Kingdom of Poland would be created. The new Kingdom in reality was to be a client state under military, economical and political control by the German Reich and its territory was to be created after the war of only of a small part of the old Commonwealth, i.e. the territory of Kingdom of Poland (Privislinsky Krai), with around 30,000 square kilometers of its western areas to be annexed by Germany. Polish and Jewish population in those areas was to be expelled and replaced by German colonists. A Regency Council was established in preparations of this, forming a proto-Government, and issuing currency, called the Polish mark. German efforts to create an army serving Central Powers however met with failure, as it lacked expected volunteers for German cause.
After peace in the East was assured by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Germany and Austria-Hungary started a policy of creating a "Mitteleuropa" ("Central Europe") and on November 5, 1917, declared that a puppet state Kingdom of Poland might be created.
Battlefields.
Much of the heavy fighting on the war's Eastern Front took place on the territory of the former Polish state. In 1914 Russian forces advanced very close to Kraków before being beaten back. The next spring, heavy fighting occurred around Gorlice and Przemyśl, to the east of Kraków in Galicia. In 1915 Polish territories were looted and abandoned by the retreating Imperial Russian army, trying to emulate the scorched earth policy of 1812; the Russians also evicted and deported hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants suspected of collaborating with the enemy. By the end of 1915, the Germans had occupied the entire Russian sector, including Warsaw. In 1916 another Russian offensive in Galicia exacerbated the already desperate situation of civilians in the war zone; about 1 million Polish refugees fled eastward behind Russian lines during the war. Although the Russian offensive of 1916 caught the Germans and Austrians by surprise, poor communications and logistics prevented the Russians from taking full advantage of their situation.
A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, 450,000 died and close to one million were wounded. Several hundred thousand Polish civilians were moved to labor camps in Germany, and 800,000 were deported by the Tsarist forces to the East. The scorched-earth retreat strategies of both sides left much of the war zone uninhabitable. Total deaths from 1914–18, military and civilian, within the 1919–1939 borders, were estimated at 1,128,000.
Recovery of statehood.
In 1917 two separate events decisively changed the character of the war and set it on a course toward the rebirth of Poland. The United States entered the conflict on the Allied side, while a process of revolutionary upheaval in Russia weakened her and then removed the Russians from the Eastern Front, finally bringing the Bolsheviks to power in that country. After the last Russian advance into Galicia failed in mid-1917, the Germans went on the offensive again; the army of revolutionary Russia ceased to be a factor, and Russia was forced to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in which she ceded all formerly Polish lands to the Central Powers.
The defection of Russia from the Allied coalition gave free rein to the calls of Woodrow Wilson, the American president, to transform the war into a crusade to spread democracy and liberate the Poles and other peoples from the suzerainty of the Central Powers. The thirteenth of his Fourteen Points adopted the resurrection of Poland as one of the main aims of World War I. Polish opinion crystallized in support of the Allied cause.
Józef Piłsudski became a popular hero when Berlin jailed him for insubordination. The Allies broke the resistance of the Central Powers by autumn 1918, as the Habsburg monarchy disintegrated and the German imperial government collapsed. In October 1918, Polish authorities took over Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia. In November 1918, Piłsudski was released from internment in Germany by the revolutionaries and returned to Warsaw. Upon his arrival, on November 11, 1918 the "Regency Council" of the Kingdom of Poland ceded all responsibilities to him and Piłsudski took control over the newly created state as its provisional Chief of State. Soon all the local governments that had been created in the last months of the war pledged allegiance to the central government in Warsaw. Independent Poland, which had been absent from the map of Europe for 123 years, was reborn.
The newly created state initially consisted of former Privislinsky Krai, western Galicia (with Lwów besieged by the Ukrainians) and part of Cieszyn Silesia.

Urine test strip

A urine test strip or dipstick is a basic diagnostic tool used to determine pathological changes in a patient’s urine in standard urinalysis.
A standard urine test strip may comprise up to 10 different chemical pads or reagents which react (change color) when immersed in, and then removed from, a urine sample. The test can often be read in as little as 60 to 120 seconds after dipping, although certain tests require longer. Routine testing of the urine with multiparameter strips is the first step in the diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. The analysis includes testing for the presence of proteins, glucose, ketones, haemoglobin, bilirubin, urobilinogen, acetone, nitrite and leucocytes as well as testing of pH and specific gravity or to test for infection by different pathogens.
Characteristics.
The test strips consist of a ribbon made of plastic or paper of about 5 millimetre wide, plastic strips have pads impregnated with chemicals that react with the compounds present in urine producing a characteristic colour. For the paper strips the reactants are absorbed directly onto the paper. Paper strips are often specific to a single reaction (e.g. pH measurement), while the strips with pads allow several determinations simultaneously.
There are strips which serve different purposes, such as qualitative strips that only determine if the sample is positive or negative, or there are semi-quantitative ones that in addition to providing a positive or negative reaction also provide an estimation of a quantitative result, in the latter the colour reactions are approximately proportional to the concentration of the substance being tested for in the sample. The reading of the results is carried out by comparing the pad colours with a colour scale provided by the manufacturer, no additional equipment is needed.
This type of analysis is very common in the control and monitoring of diabetic patients. The time taken for the appearance of the test results on the strip can vary from a few minutes after the test to 30 minutes after immersion of the strip in the urine (depending on the brand of product being used).
Semi-quantitative values are usually reported as: trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+; although tests can also be estimated as milligrams per decilitre. Automated readers of test strips also provide results using units from the International System of Units.
Test method.
The test method consists of immersing the test strip completely in a well mixed sample of urine for a short period of time, then extracting it from the container and supporting the edge of the strip over the mouth of the container to remove excess urine. The strip is then left to stand for the time necessary for the reactions to occur (usually 1 to 2 minutes), and finally the colours that appear are compared against the chromatic scale provided by the manufacturer. 
An improper technique can produce false results, for example, leukocytes and erythrocytes precipitate at the bottom of the container and may not be detected if the sample is not properly mixed, and in the same way, if an excess of urine remains on the strip after it has been removed from the test sample, may cause the reagents to leak from the pads onto adjacent pads resulting in mixing and distortion of the colours. To ensure that this does not occur it is recommended the edges of the strip are dried on absorbent paper.
Reactions for generalised tests using a urine test strip.
pH.
The lungs and kidneys are the main regulators of an organism’s acid / alkali balance. The balance is maintained through the controlled excretion of acidic hydrogens in the form of ammonia ions, monohydrogenated phosphate, weak organic acids and through the reabsorption of bicarbonate through glomerular filtration in the convoluted tubules of the nephron. The pH of urine can vary between 4.5 and 8 with the first urine produced in the morning generally being more acidic and the urine produced after meals generally more alkaline. Normal reference values are not provided for urine pH as the variation is too wide and results have to be considered in the context of the other quantifiable parameters. 
The determination of urinary pH has two main objectives, one is diagnostic and the other is therapeutic. On the one hand it provides information regarding the balance between acid and alkali in a patient and allows identification of the substances that are present in the urine in crystalline form. On the other hand, certain illnesses require a patient to keep the pH of their urine within given narrow margins, whether to promote the elimination of chemotherapeutic agents, avoid the precipitation of salts that promote the formation of gallstones, or in order to facilitate the control of a urinary infection. 
Regulating diet mainly controls urinary pH, although using medication can also control it. Diets rich in animal proteins tend to produce acidic urine, while diets mainly composed of vegetables tend to produce alkali urine.
Commercial brands measure pH in increments of 0.5 or 1 pH units between pH 5 and 9. In order to differentiate pH in this wide range it is common to use a double indicator system comprising methyl red and bromothymol blue. Methyl red produces a colour change from red to yellow in the range of pH 4 to 6 and the bromothymol blue changes from yellow to blue between pH 6 and 9. In the range 5 to 9 the strips show colours that change from orange at pH 5, passing through yellow and green to dark blue at pH 9.
Specific gravity.
The kidney’s most important function is to reabsorb water after glomerular filtration. This complex process of reabsorption is usually one of the first renal functions to be affected by disease. The specific gravity of urine is a measure of the density of the substances dissolved in it and it depends on the number of dissolved particles and their mass. The molecules with the greatest mass contribute more to the measure of specific gravity than smaller molecules. The measurement of specific gravity should not be confused with the measurement of osmotic concentration, which is more related to the number of particles than with their mass.
The urine test strip test for specific gravity is based on the change in dissociation constant (pKa) of an anionic polyelectrolyte (poly-(methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride)) in an alkali medium that is ionised and releases hydrogen ions in proportion to the number of cations present in the solution. The greater the cation concentration of the urine the more hydrogen ions are released, thereby reducing the pH. The pad also includes bromothymol blue which measures this change in pH. It should be remembered that the test strip only measures cation concentration, it is therefore possible that urine with a high concentration of non-ionic solutes (such as glucose or urea) or with high molecular weight compounds (such as the media used to provide radiographic contrast) will yield a result that will be erroneously lower that that measured by densitometry. The colours vary from dark blue with a reading of 1.000 to yellow for a reading of 1.030.
Elevated protein concentrations produce slightly elevated specific density results as a consequence of the indicator’s protein error, in addition, samples with a pH above 6.5 give lower readings as a result of the indicator’s bias. For this reason the manufacturers recommend that 5 units are added to the specific gravity reading when the pH is greater than 6.5.
Diseases Identified with a Urine Test Strip.
With the aid of routine examinations early symptoms of the following four groups can be identified:
Diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract.
Screening parameters:
Many renal and urinary tract diseases may be asymptomatic for a long period of time. Routine urinalysis is recommended as a basic yet fundamental step in identifying renal damage and / or urinary tract disease at an early stage, especially in high risk populations such as diabetics, the hypertensive, African Americans, Polynesians, and those with a family history.
Specific kidney and urinary tract diseases that can be identified include: chronic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, proteinuria and haematuria.
Protein testing.
Urine usually contains only low concentrations of proteins, less than 10 mg/dL or 100 mg in 24 hours is excreted, these are mostly low molecular weight proteins, filtered through the kidney’s glomerulus, and proteins produced in the genitourinary tract. The main serum protein found in urine is albumin as it has a low molecular weight. However, only low concentrations are normally found in urine because it is generally not filtered out in the glomerulus and in addition those molecules that do pass through the glomerulus are reabsorbed in the tubules. Other proteins found in urine are small concentrations of serum and tubular microglobulins, the Tamm-Horsfall protein produced by the tubules and proteins in prostate, seminal and vaginal secretions. Further testing is required if proteins are found in urine in order to establish if their presence is due to illness. 
Proteinuria can be the first symptom of renovascular, glomerular or tubulointerstitial nephropathy or it can be caused by the accumulation of abnormal proteins due to diseases such as multiple myeloma.
The test for proteins on a urine test strip is based on the principle of the protein error of indicators in order to produce a visible colorimetric reaction. This principle is based on the fact that proteins alter the colour of some pH indicators even though the pH of the media remains constant. This occurs because proteins (and particularly albumin) acquire hydrogen ions at the expense of the indicator as the protein’s amino groups are highly efficient acceptors of H+ ions. According to the manufacturer, the strip’s protein pad contains tetrabromophenol blue or 3',3",5',5"-tetrachlorophenol-3,4,5,5-tetrabromosulphonphthalein, as well as an acid buffer substance to maintain pH at a constant level. At pH 3 and in the absence of proteins both indicators are yellow, as protein concentration increases the colour changes through various shades of green until it becomes a dark blue.
Indicator-H+(Yellow) + Protein → Indicator(Blue-green) + Protein-H+
The main problem with the protein tests found on urine test strips is that very alkali urine can neutralise the acid buffer and produce a false positive reading that is unrelated to the presence of proteins. Another similar error occurs if the strip is left submerged in the urine sample for too long. It should also be remembered that the test strips mainly detect albumin, so it is possible for a certain degree of proteinuria to be present (for example Bence Jones proteinuria) without the strips indicating a significant increase in urinary protein concentrations.
Hemoglobin and myoglobin testing.
The presence of blood in the urine is, of all the parameters normally tested, the one that is most closely related with traumatic damage to the kidneys or the genitourinary tract. The most common causes of hematuria are: nephrolithiasis, glomerular disease, tumours, pyelonephritis, exposure to nephrotoxins, and treatment with anticoagulants. Non-pathological hematuria can be observed after strenuous exercise and during menstruation. The normal number of red blood cells in urine should not usually exceed 3 per high power field.
A urine test strip showing positive for blood can also indicate hemoglobinuria, which is not detectable using a microscope due to the lysis of red blood cells in the urinary tract (particularly in alkaline or dilute urine), or intravascular hemolysis. Under normal conditions the formation of haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes prevents glomerular filtration, but if the hemolysis is extensive haptoglobin’s uptake capacity is exceeded and hemoglobin can appear in urine. Hemoglobinuria can be caused by hemolytic anaemia, blood transfusions, extensive burns, the bite of the recluse spider (Loxosceles), infections and strenuous exercise. 
The urine test strip test for blood is based on hemoglobin’s pseudo peroxidase activity in catalysing a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine in order to produce a dark blue oxidation product. the resultant colour can vary between green and dark blue depending on the amount of hemoglobin.
The presence of myoglobin in urine gives a positive reaction in the test strip’s blood test but the urine appears clear with a red to brown colouration. The presence of myoglobin in place of hemoglobin can be caused by pathologies associated with muscular damage (rhabdomyolysis), such as trauma, crush syndrome, prolonged coma, convulsions, progressive muscular atrophy, alcoholism, heroin abuse and strenuous physical activity.
The haem fraction of these proteins is toxic for the renal tubules and elevated concentrations can cause acute renal insufficiency.
It is possible to use an ammonia sulphate precipitation test in order to distinguish between hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria. This consists of adding 2.8gr of ammonia sulphate to 5 ml of centrifuged urine, mixing well and after 5 minutes filtering the sample and centrifuging again. The hemoglobin precipitates out with the ammonia sulphate but not the myoglobin. Analysis of the supernatant for blood with a test strip will give a positive if myoglobin is present and a negative if hemoglobin is present.
The test can give false positives if strong oxidant or peroxide residues are present on the laboratory material used for the analysis.
Carbohydrate metabolism disorders.
Around 30–40% of type I diabetics and around 20% of type II diabetics suffer in time from a nephropathy, and early recognition of diabetes is therefore of major significance for the further state of health of these patients.
Specific carbohydrate metabolism disorders able to be identified include Diabetes Mellitus, Glucosuria and Ketonuria.
Glucose test.
Under normal conditions nearly all the glucose removed in the glomerulus is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule. If the blood glucose level increases, as happens in diabetes mellitus, the capacity of the convoluted tubule to reabsorb glucose is exceeded (an effect know as "renal reabsorption threshold") For glucose this threshold is between 160–180 mg/dl. Glucose concentrations vary in an individual, and a healthy person can present with transitory glucosuria after a meal high in sugars, therefore the most representative results come from samples obtained at least two hours after food is eaten.
The detection of glucose by test strips is based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase. This enzyme catalyses the oxidation of glucose by atmospheric oxygen to form D-glucono-δ-lactone and hydrogen peroxide. A second linked reaction, mediated by a peroxidase, catalyses the reaction between the peroxide and a chromogen (a substance that acquires colour after a chemical reaction) to form a coloured compound that indicates the glucose concentration. 
The reaction is specific for glucose, as occurs in all enzymatic reactions, but it can provide some false positive results due to the presence of traces of strong oxidising agents or peroxide from disinfectants used on laboratory instruments.
Ketone test.
The term "ketones" or "ketone bodies" in reality refers to three intermediate products in the metabolism of fatty acids; acetone, acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Elevated concentrations of ketones are not generally found in urine, as all these substances are completely metabolized, producing energy, carbon dioxide and water. However, the disruption of carbohydrate metabolism can lead to metabolic imbalances and the appearance of ketones as a by-product of the metabolism of an organism’s fat reserves.
An increase in fat metabolism can be the result of starvation or malabsorption, the inability to metabolize carbohydrates (as occurs, for example, in diabetes) or due to losses from frequent vomiting. 
The control of urinary ketone is particularly useful in managing and monitoring diabetes mellitus type 1. Ketonuria indicates an insulin deficiency that indicates the need to regulate its dosage. An increase in the blood concentration of ketone produces a water-electrolyte imbalance, dehydration and if not corrected, acidosis and in the end diabetic coma.
The three ketone compounds appear in different proportions in the urine, although these proportions are relatively constant in different samples as both the acetone and the beta-hydroxybutyric acid are produced from the acetoacetic acid. The proportions are 78% beta-hydroxybutyric acid, 20% acetoacetic acid and 2% acetone.
The test used in the urine test strips is based on the reaction of sodium nitroprusside (nitroferricyanide). In this reaction the acetoacetic acid in an alkali medium reacts with the sodium nitroprusside producing a magenta coloured complex:
The test does not measure beta-hydroxybutyric acid and it is only weakly sensitive to acetone when glycine is added to the reaction. However, as these compounds are derived from the acetoacetic acid their existence can be assumed and a separate test is not therefore necessary. Those medicines that contain sulfhydryl groups, such as mercaptoethane sulphonate Na (Mesna) and captopril and L-DOPA can give atypical colouring. A false negative can occur in samples that have not been adequately stored due to volatilization and bacterial degradation.
Liver diseases and haemolytic disorders.
In many liver diseases the patients often show signs of pathology only at a late stage. Early diagnosis allows appropriate therapeutic measures to be instituted in good time, avoiding consequential damage and further infections.
Specific liver diseases and haemolytic disorders able to be identified include liver disease, (accompanied by jaundice), cirrhosis, urobilinogenuria and bilirubinuria.
Bilirubin test.
Bilirubin is a highly pigmented compound that is a by-product of haemoglobin degradation. The haemoglobin that is released after the mononuclear phagocyte system (located in the liver and spleen) withdraws old red blood cells from circulation is degraded into its components; iron, protoporphyrin and protein. The system’s cells convert the protoporphyrin into unconjugated bilirubin that passes through the circulatory system bound to protein, particularly albumin. The kidney is unable to filter out this bilirubin as it is bound to protein, however, it is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to form water-soluble conjugated bilirubin. This conjugated bilirubin does not normally appear in the urine as it is excreted directly from the intestine in bile. Intestinal bacteria reduce the bilirubin to urobilinogen, which is later oxidised and either excreted with the faeces as sturcobilin or in the urine as urobilin.
Conjugated bilirubin appears in urine when the normal degradation cycle is altered due to the obstruction of the biliary ducts or when the kidney’s functional integrity is damaged. This allows the escape of conjugated bilirubin into the circulation as occurs in hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis). 
The detection of urinary bilirubin is an early indication of liver disease and its presence or absence can be used to determine the causes of clinical jaundice. 
The jaundice produced by the accelerated destruction of red blood cells does not produce bilirubinuria, as the high serum bilirubin is found in the unconjugated form and the kidneys are unable to excrete it.
The test strips use a diazotization reaction in order to detect bilirubin. The bilirubin combines with a diazonium salt (2,4-dichloroaniline or 2,6-dichlorobenzene-diazonium-tetrafluoroborate) in an acid medium to produce an azo dye with colouration that varies from pink to violet:
False positive reactions can be due to unusual pigments in the urine (for example, yellowy orange phenazopyridine metabolites, indican and the metabolites of the medicine Lodine (Etodolac)). False negatives can also be given by poorly stored samples as the bilirubin is photosensitive and undergoes photo oxidation to biliverdin when it is exposed to light, or hydrolysis of the glucuronide can occur producing free bilirubin which is less reactive.
Urobilinogen test.
Intestinal bacteria convert the conjugated bilirubin that is excreted by the bile duct into the intestine into urobilinogen and stercobilinogen. Part of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed in the intestine then circulated in the blood to the liver where it is excreted. A small part of this recirculated urobilinogen is filtered out by the kidneys and appears in urine (less than 1 mg/dl urine). The stercobilinogen can not be reabsorbed and remains in the intestine.
Any deterioration in liver function reduces its ability to process the recirculated urobilinogen. The excess that remains in the blood is filtered out by the kidneys and appears in urine. When hemolytic disorders occur the amount of unconjugated bilirubin that is present in the blood increases causing an increase in hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin, resulting in increased amounts of urobilinogen that in turn causes an increase in reabsorption, recirculation and renal excretion.
The reactions that take place in the test strip vary according to the manufacturer, but in reality there are two reactions that are most frequently used. Some manufacturers use Ehrlich’s reaction (1), in which urobilinogen reacts with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (Ehrlich's reagent) in order to produce colours that vary from light to dark pink. Other manufacturers use a diazo coupling reaction (2) that uses 4-methoxybenzene-diazonium-tetrafluoroborate to produce colours that vary from white to pink. The latter reaction is more specific.
A number of substances interfere with the Ehrlich reaction on the Multistix strip: porfobilinogen, indican, p-amino salicylic acid, sulphonamide, methyldopa, procaine and chlorpromazine. The test should be carried out at room temperature as the reaction’s sensitivity increases with temperature. Poorly stored samples can yield false negative results as the urobilinogen suffers photo oxidation to urobilin that does not react. The formaldehyde used as a preservative produces false negatives in both reactions.
Urinary infections.
Urinary infections can be identified including bacteriuria and pyuria.
Nitrites test.
The test for nitrites is a rapid screening method for possible asymptomatic infections caused by nitrate-reducing bacteria. Some of the gram negative bacteria species that most commonly cause urinary tract infections (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Proteus) have enzymes that reduce the nitrate present in urine to nitrite. The test is a rapid screen for possible infections by enteric bacteria, but it does not replace the urinalysis tests nor microscopic examination as diagnostic tools, nor subsequent monitoring as many other microorganisms that do not reduce nitrate (gram positive bacteria and yeasts) can also cause urinary infections.
The reactive strips detect nitrite by using the Greiss reaction in which the nitrite reacts in an acid medium with an aromatic amine (para-arsanilic acid or sulphanilamide) in order to form a diazonium salt that in turn reacts with tetrahydrobenzoquinoline to produce a pink azo dye.
The nitrite test is not particularly reliable and negative results in the presence of clinical symptoms are not uncommon, meaning that the test should not be taken as conclusive. Negative results can be obtained in the presence of non nitrate-reducing microorganisms. Nitrite-reducing bacteria need to remain in contact with nitrate for long enough to produce detectable amounts (first urine produced In the morning or at least with a urine retention of 4 hours). Large numbers of bacteria can react to reduce nitrite to nitrogen, which will give a false negative result. The use of antibiotics will inhibit bacterial metabolism causing negative results even though bacteria are present. In addition some substances such as ascorbic acid will compete with the Greiss reaction giving unrepresentatively low readings.
Leukocytes test.
It is normal to find up to 3 (occasionally 5) leukocytes per high power field (40X) in a urine sample, with women having slightly higher results owing to vaginal contamination. Higher numbers indicate urinary infection. The urine test strip test for white blood cells detects leukocyte esterase, which is present in azurophilic granules of monocytes and granulocytes (neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic). Bacteria, lymphocytes and epithelial cells from the genitourinary tract do not contain esterases. Neutrophil granulocytes are the leukocytes most commonly associated with urinary infections. A positive test for leukocyte esterase normally indicates the presence of bacteria and a positive nitrite test (although it is not always the case). Infections caused by Trichomonas, Chlamydia and yeasts produce leukocyturia without bacteriuria. The inflammation of the renal tissues (interstitial nephritis) can produce leukocyturia, in particular toxic interstitial nephritis with predominant eosinophils.
The test for leukocyte esterase is purely indicative and should not be solely relied on for diagnosis, as it does not replace microscopic or urine culture examinations.
The urine test strip reaction is based on the action of leukocyte esterase in catalysing the hydrolysis of an ester of indolecarboxylic acid. The indoxyl that is liberated combines with a diazonium salt in order to produce a violet coloured azole dye.
The esterase reaction needs about 5 minutes to take place. The presence of strong oxidising agents or formaldehyde can cause false positives. False negative results are associated with elevated concentrations of protein (greater than 500 mg/dL), glucose (greater than 3 g/dL), oxalic acid and ascorbic acid. Urine with a high specific gravity can also cause leukocyte crenation, which can impede the liberation of the esterases.
Detection limit.
The detection limit of a test is that concentration, at which the test starts to turn from negative to positive. Although the detection limit may vary between urine samples, the detection limit is defined as that concentration of the analyte that results in a positive reaction in 90% of the examined urines.
Uses for Urine Test Strips.
Urine test strips can be used in many areas of the healthcare chain including screening for routine examinations, treatment monitoring, self-monitoring by patients and/or general preventive medicine.
Screening.
Urine test strips are used for screening both in hospitals and in general practice. The aim of screening is early identification of likely patients by examination of large groups of the population. The importance of screening for diabetes and kidney disease amongst high-risk populations is becoming very high.
Treatment Monitoring.
Treatment monitoring with the aid of urine test strips allows a health professional to check on the results of the prescribed therapy, and if necessary to introduce any changes into the course of therapy..
Self-monitoring by Patients.
Self-monitoring with urine test strips under the guidance of a health professional is an effective method for monitoring the disease state. This applies particularly to diabetics, where the idea of self-monitoring of the metabolic status (determinations of glucose and ketones) is self-evident.
General Preventive Medicine.
Unsolicited self-testing has become a popular measure in recent years as various urine test strips become available via pharmacy and online stores. Self-monitoring for frequent urinary tract infections is a popular example as sufferers monitor their own urine on a daily basis and discuss the results with their health professional.
Veterinary.
In veterinary medicine, especially in cats and dogs, the test strip can be used for urinalysis.
History of the modern day test strip.
In many cultures urine was once regarded as a mystical fluid, and in some cultures it is still regarded as such to this day. Its uses have included wound healing, stimulation of the body’s defences, and examinations for diagnosing the presence of diseases.
It was only towards the end of the 18th century that doctors interested in chemistry turned their attention to the scientific basis of urinalysis and to its use in practical medicine.
Ascorbic Acid Interference.
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is known to interfere with the oxidation reaction of the blood and glucose pad on common urine test strips. Some urine test strips are protected against the interference with iodate, which eliminates ascorbic acid by oxidation.
Urinary Sediment.
During routine screening, if a positive test for leukocytes, blood, protein, nitrite, and a pH greater than 7 is identified, the urine sediment be microscopically analysed to further pinpoint a diagnosis.
Automated Urine Test Strip Analysers.
Automatic analysis of urine test strips using automated urine test strip analysers is a well-established practice in modern day urinalysis. They can measure calcium, blood, glucose, bilirubin, urobilinogen, ketones, leukocytes, creatinine, microalbumin, pH, ascorbic acid and protein.

HSH Nordbank

HSH Nordbank is a commercial bank in northern Europe with headquarters in Hamburg as well as Kiel, Germany. It is active in corporate and private banking. HSHs main focus is on shipping, transportation, real estate and renewable energy.
The bank was created as a result of a merger between Hamburgische Landesbank and Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein on June 2, 2003. HSH has significant operations in Luxembourg, New York, London (the Bank no longer has an office in London) and Singapore. As of 12/2009 it employed 4,188 people worldwide.
As of 12/2009 HSH had a balance sheet of EUR 174.5 bn and reported a loss of EUR 678 mn.
The shareholders are:
In the merger the City of Hamburg and the State of Schleswig-Holstein agreed to hold the majority of shares at least until End of 2013.
Financial crisis of 2007-2010.
With the beginning of the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 HSH had to report losses on their credit investment portfolio. 
In September 2008 HSH announced further writedowns. As a direct consequence the CEO Hans Berger stepped down and in the following weeks HSH announced extensive restructuring. Branches in Copenhagen and Hong-Kong were reduced to representations and new business will be focussed on the core region in northern Germany.
In December 2008 HSH was granted to issue up to EUR 30bn guaranteed notes under the German SoFFin program. One requirement that was imposed on HSH was to raise the capital ratio to at least 8%. On January 20, 2009 EUR 3bn 3 year guaranteed notes were issued. On February 24, 2009 HSH received new capital of EUR 3bn and credit guarantees of EUR 10bn by the two main shareholders, the states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. The other shareholders, JC Flowers and the savings bank association, did not participate in the capital infusion. Together with this increase of its core-capital, HSH announced further restructuring. It plans to spin off non-strategic activities and the Toxic asset portfolio into a—yet to be created—Bad Bank.
On April 9, 2009, president of supervisory board Wolfgang Peiner appointed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to investigate recent management decisions of the Vorstand.
On April 17, 2009 the supervisory board of HSH Nordbank relieved Frank Roth, member of the management board of his duties and started pressing criminal charges against him. The bank claims that Frank Roth leaked strictly confidential information to outside parties.
On October 13, 2009, the "Norddeutscher Rundfunk" reported on a questionable CDO deal codenamed "Omega 55" between HSH Nordbank and BNP Paribas in late 2007, that eventually cost HSH Nordbank 500 million Euro. Parts of that deal were not disclosed to BaFIN, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.

Ezekiel's Vision (Raphael)

"Ezekiel's Vision" is a c. 1518 painting by Raphael showing the prophet Ezekiel's vision of God in majesty. It is housed in the Palatine Gallery of Palazzo Pitti, Florence, central Italy.
History.
The work is remembered by Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari as property of a Bolognese nobleman, Vincenzo Ercolani. There is trace of payment by him to Raphael for 8 ducats in 1510, but this is generally considered just a down payment, since stylistically the work (inspired for example by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling) cannot be dated before 1518. 
In Florence since as early as 1589, it was ceded to Francesco I de' Medici and was placed at the Uffizi. The painting is known to be at Palazzo Pitti in 1697. In 1799 it was robbed by the French, who kept it in Paris until returning it back in 1816.
The work was once considered to be by the hand of Giulio Romano, with Raphael providing only the drawing. However, it has been subsequently assigned to Raphael.

La Brière

La Brière (translated as "Passion and Peat") is a 1923 novel by Alphonse de Chateaubriant that won the Grand prix du roman de l'Académie française for that year. 
The novel is set in the rustic fenland landscape west of Nantes, known as Brière, in which the traditional occupation of peat-cutting is becoming increasingly unsustainable as the peat runs out. The independence of the local population is threatened by outsiders, who have plans for modernisation.
Synopsis.
Aoustin, a rough peat-cutter and "ranger" employed to protect the traditional rights of the people of Brière, comes into conflict with his wife and daughter. Having returned home to the ile de Fédrun after a long trip, he discovers that his wife, Nathalie, has sold the family linen to fund their estranged son who lives in Nantes. The domineering Aoustin had cursed his son for marrying a Nantes girl, rather than a local Brièronne. His daughter Théotiste now also wants to marry a lad from outside the region, from a despised village of basket weavers, who are traditionally looked down upon by the independent-minded fenlanders. Aoustin utterly refuses to give her hand in marriage to the youth, Jeanin. He leaves his wife and daughter, moving into his childhood cottage, rejoicing in his independence and the traditional ways of fenland life. 
Meanwhile, the local mayors are attempting to resist a drainage and modernisation project that threatens the independence of the Brièrons. Aoustin is given the task of finding a lost historical document signed by Louis XVI confirming the rights of the local people. He travels throughout the fens to find whether any of the locals possess it, eventually locating it in the home of Florence, a madwoman who lives inside an ancient dolmen. 
Théotiste seeks Aoustin out, telling him that she is pregnant by Jeanin, but he still refuses to assent to the marriage, insisting that he will curse the couple. The superstitious Théotiste takes this threat seriously since her brother's wife died after her father's curse. Aoustin also contrives to have Jeanin arrested for poaching ducks. Jeanin seeks revenge, and when Aoustin is sent to Nantes to deposit the document Jeanin shoots him during his return journey. Théotiste, anxiously seeking Jeanin, gets lost in the marshes, suffers a miscarriage, and spends the night sheltering in Florence's dolmen. Aoustin survives the shooting, but loses his hand. He refuses to give Jeanin up to the police, but seeks revenge himself. 
Théotiste is accused by a spiteful neighbour of having given birth and drowned her child in the marsh. She is arrested, but released through lack of evidence. Jeanin now refuses to marry her because of her "shame", and Théotiste is shunned by most of the community. Aoustin has a false wooden hand made to replace his loss. He kidnaps Jeanin, intending to kill him and bury him under his cottage, but news arrives that Théotiste has had a mental breakdown. He locks Jeanin up, and attempts to take the deranged Théotiste through the marshes to a hospital. He cannot control his boat adequately with his wooden hand, and gets lost in the freezing cold marsh. During the night Théotiste dies. In despair, Aoustin returns to his cottage but cannot bring himself to kill Jeanin. He lets him go.
Other versions.
The novel was filmed in the year after its publication by Léon Poirier in a style of pictorialist naturalism. The music from the film by Paul Ladmirault was published as the Symphonic poem, "La Brière". 
In 1926 an edition illustrated by René-Yves Creston was published.

Beckhill

Beckhill (or Beck Hill) is a small council estate in the Meanwood area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, UK, which has received negative local publicity in the past, but is now the subject of urban regeneration. The area is situated south of Stainbeck Road and north of Potternewton Lane. To the East is the Miles Hill Estate.
Location.
The area was built in the 1970s and consists mainly of brick built terrace houses. The estate has a small newsagents on Beckhill Approach. There is only one entrance to the estate via car, from Stainbeck Road, however there are ginnels linking it with Potternewton Lane from Beckhill Gate.
Schools.
Miles Hill primary school was on Beckhill Approach, and had 170 pupils. The 2004 and 2007 league tables showed a challenging situation. The school was closed in 2007, and demolished in 2008. At the same time the estate children's play area in the former school grounds was closed due to maintenance costs. Beckhill is part of the intake area for St Urban's Catholic primary school. Miles Hill primary was recently replaced by the new Mill Field primary school on Potternewton Mount, which led to concerns over the road crossing in Potternewton Lane, as pupils now had to walk from their estates to the new school. However, this appears to be resolved by the addition of new zebra crossings.
Then and now.
Past.
In 2004 there was a problem with gang behaviour in this and other estates, and in 2006 it was reported that children were committing burglaries. There used to be a public house called the Hilltop in Beckhill Grove but it was demolished in 2007, making space for a planned local regeneration development by East North East Homes Leeds. In July 2007 authorisation was given to demolish a large number of properties on Beckhill Approach and Beckhill Garth, to make way for new family housing. Beckhill became the focus of negative press attention in December 2008, following the 'Beckhill Stabbing'. As of 2014, knife crime continued to be a problem on the estate.
Present and future.
Since 2007, the Beckhill Implementation Group (BIG) received funding from the NHS for activities to promote health and wellbeing on the estate. BIG won an Effective Partnership Working Award on 18 March 2009. Groundwork Leeds is still involved in improvement of this environment. In 2007 the average value of a house on Beckhill Chase was approximately half that of the average house in Leeds, and at least one of those houses was built in 1968.Image In Beckhill Grove there are 39 homes, built about the same time.Image
There is an active Beckhill Tenants and Residents' Association. £10,000 funding was agreed by Leeds City Council (North East Inner Area Committee) in 2008 for a study into the feasibility of providing a new community centre for Beckhill. The Three Churches Project focuses on this and other nearby estates. In 2008 the group completed a four-month project with people from estates including Beckhill, and performed a play based on Shakespeare's "The Two Gentlemen of Verona". New council housing is planned for the estate, as a second phase of Leeds City Council's intention to build 80 properties across three sites in Leeds.
