Tom Clarke (musician)

Tom Clarke (born 11 March 1986) is an English multi-instrumentalist known as the lead vocalist of the British indie rock band The Enemy.
Clarke has performed on both albums, playing guitar, piano and strings on "We'll Live and Die in These Towns".
He appeared as guest on Noel Fielding's team on the first episode of series 23 of Never Mind the Buzzcocks.
Personal life.
On 14 April 2009 The Sun newspaper reported that Tom Clarke had purchased a 1972 Jaguar E Type because it reminded him of his grandfather. The singer said "in 1972 my granddad used to work in Jaguar's Brown's Lane plant in Coventry and I wanted a car he'd worked on – whenever I look at the car I think of him".
In January 2010 Gigwise reported that Clarke had acquired a "ridiculous farm" and was taking a short break from music to decorate. Clarke stated that the band was rehearsing and was writing new Enemy material prolifically.
Gumball Rally.
In 2009 Tom Clarke drove a Jaguar XKR in the famous "Gumball 3000 Rally" an annual 3,000-mile international road rally which takes place on public roads featuring mostly exotic and powerful sports cars. Clarke is alleged to have been landed with a $5,000 bill during the course of the rally for wrecking a hotel suite with friends from Dirty Sanchez, whilst celebrating the band's second album reaching number two in the UK albums chart. Monster Energy, one of the rally sponsors, awarded Clarke and his co driver and fellow band member Tom Boddy, The 2009 Monster Energy Award for Bad Behaviour.
Car accident.
On 29 August 2010 "The Sun" Newspaper reported that Clarke had "totalled his new sports car just days after getting it." Clarke said he "lost it in the outside lane of the A90 near Aberdeen, The car, a TVR 350c, spun four times before hitting a barrier, then it left the road and went over a bollard before wrapping around a parking sign." The newspaper report said that the singer was not injured, and Clarke compared the crash to the feeling of falling over when trying to put your boxers on. He also urged festival goers to drive safely.
Motorcycle injury.
In March 2009 The Enemy were forced to cancel a performance in Tunbridge Wells when singer Tom Clarke sustained a hand injury whilst riding his motorcycle.
Art gallery bid.
In June 2010 Tom Clarke backed an art gallery's bid to win the UK's largest single arts prize. The Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry was shortlisted for the £100,000 prize. The singer said winning the award would make The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum a "jewel in the crown of Coventry". Clarke said, "The Herbert means a lot to me personally, as we did one of our first ever gigs downstairs. No band had played here before us, and not many people knew the gallery was here".
Race For Heroes.
On 27 February Tom Clarke participated in the "Race For Heroes" alongside stars of British motor-sport and British soldiers for the Help For Heroes organisation. The six-hour endurance race aimed to raise money and awareness for the charity, which is a charity formed to help those who have been wounded in Britain's current conflicts.
XFM controversy.
In September 2007, Alex Zane, presenter of the XFM Breakfast show broadcast a statement declaring that the band would not be played on his show again. After playing their single "You're Not Alone" for seven seconds, he reasoned that altercations between himself and the band (notably Tom) over a television interview meant that they would no longer be played by him. He stated that Clarke said "disgusting, offensive, hateful things". However, during the Xfm Review of 2008, the presenters Sunta Templeton and Matt Dyson commented on the band and Zane making up just after playing their record "Away from here".

Holy See–Mexico relations

Holy See – Mexico relations are foreign relations between the Holy See and Mexico. The Vatican assigned an Apostolic Delegate as resident representative in Mexico in 1904, after diplomatic relations had earlier been broken off. But, since 1992, the Holy See has a nunciature in Mexico City and Mexico has an embassy in Rome. As of 1990 about 90 percent of Mexico's 86 million people declared themselves Roman Catholics.
History.
Mexico and the Vatican broke diplomatic relations after President Benito Juárez confiscated church property between 1856 and 1861. He disbanded religious orders and ordered the separation of church and state. Some of the powers of the Catholic Church were reinstated by the dictator Porfirio Diaz.
In 1992 after more than 130 years the Mexican Government reestablished formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See and restored civil rights to the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico.
State visits.
Pope John Paul II traveled to Mexico in 1979 as his first overseas trip as Pope, and visited Mexico City in 1999.

Rick Santelli

Rick Santelli is an editor for the CNBC Business News network. He joined CNBC as an on-air editor on June 14, 1999, reporting primarily from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. He was formerly the vice president for an institutional trading and hedge fund account for futures-related products. He is also credited with being a catalyst in the early formation of the Tea Party movement via a statement he made on February 19, 2009.
Early life.
The grandson of four Italian immigrants, Santelli was born near Taylor Street in Chicago's old Italian neighborhood and at age 6 moved with his family to Lombard, Illinois. After graduating from Willowbrook High School in Villa Park, Illinois, Santelli graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and was a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.
Career.
In the early 1980s Santelli got an up-close-and-personal education in futures trading, foreign exchange and customer relations from his then mentor and employer, RJ Abrams. Abrams filled customer orders in the Japanese Yen pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for all the major brokerage houses, most of which no longer exist. Santelli's job was to keep customer orders, mostly entered on paper via Telex machines arranged according to price and to interface with customers.
Financial.
After graduation in 1979, he joined the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade as a commodity trader and order filler for Drexel Burnham Lambert; he eventually became the Vice President of Interest Rate Futures and Options.
Media.
In the 1990s, Santelli felt that the financial industry was changing in a way "not beneficial to me and my family", and accepted a full-time job with CNBC in 1999.
Political and economic views.
"Chicago Tea Party" remarks.
Santelli drew attention for his remarks made on February 19, 2009, about the Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan, which was announced on February 18. While broadcasting from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Santelli accused the government of "promoting bad behavior", and raised the possibility of a "Chicago Tea Party". He suggested that individuals who knowingly obtained high-risk mortgages (and faced impending foreclosure as a consequence) were "losers". The Tea Party remark was credited by some as launching the Tea Party movement.
Responses.
Santelli later clarified his comments and addressed concerns that the event was staged.
On April 20, 2009, Santelli participated as a panel member in an Economic Leadership Forum hosted by the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation at Texas A&M University.
CNN.com reported that some compared Santelli to fictional reporter Howard Beale, the protagonist of the 1976 satirical film "Network". Santelli said:
Santelli's comments also garnered praise from libertarians. Mark R. Crovelli wrote:
Santelli has also been criticized by the left; for example, George Monbiot said "it is the most alarming example of cheap demagoguery you are likely to have seen." Paul Krugman said:
Personal life.
Santelli lives with his wife and three daughters in Chicago's western suburbs near Wheaton, Illinois.

Chicago Assyrian Dictionary

The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) or The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago is a nine-decade project at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute to compile a dictionary of the Akkadian language and its dialects, focusing on the New-Assyrian forms. Modeled on the "Oxford English Dictionary", work on the project was initiated in 1921 by James Henry Breasted, the founder of the Oriental Institute, who had previously worked on the Berlin dictionary of Ancient Egyptian. 
From 1973 to 1996, Erica Reiner was editor in charge, followed by Martha T. Roth, dean of humanities. Expected to take 10 years to complete, the first volume was not published until 1956, and the 26th and final volume was not published until 2011. 
At a conference at the Oriental Institute on June 6, 2011, scholars assessed the significance of the dictionary. Gil Stein, director of the Oriental Institute, said it "is an indispensable research tool for any scholar anywhere who seeks to explore the written record of the Mesopotamian civilization." It is one of several large-scale United States dictionary projects for ancient Middle Eastern languages, including the "Chicago Hittite Dictionary", the "Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary", and the "Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon".

Justino 'Tining' R. Romea was a Filipino composer, writer, director, musical arranger, poet and journalist. He composed the Awit sa Bohol or Bohol hymn and many school anthems.
Biography.
Born in Napo, Loon, Bohol who later settled in Maribojoc with his wife Jesusa Dalugdug (also from Napo) and family because they were able to acquire a property there. 
Romea taught at the Bohol School of Arts and Trades (BSAT) now CVSCAFT. 
Romea was commissioned to pen the Bohol Provincial Hymn. It was first sung publicly by a female choir of the College of Holy Spirit of Tagbilaran City on March 1, 1970 in time for the unfurling of the Bohol Flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1970 East Visayan Athletic Association held in Tagbilaran City.
On September 24, 1970, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 215 adopting it as the official song of the province of Bohol.
As the hymn's original version was in English, the Provincial Board, a few years after, endeavored to have it translated into the vernacular. A competition was launched and the entry of Maxelende Ganade emerged as the best and was adjudged the winner. The Boholano version was adopted by the Provincial Board in Resolution No. 151 dated September 13, 1974.
Romea also composed many school anthems like University of Bohol or UB Hymn, BSAT Hymn, Saint Joseph Institute of Technology in Butuan City, and he is best remembered for the love song "Ako Kang Paabuton," the folk song "Sa Daplin sa Baybayon" as well as most of the songs featured in the annual 'drama' presentations in his native Napo for which he served as writer, director and musical arranger. 
Nong Tining was also a revered columnist of Bohol Chronicle. In fact, his column was in the frontpage of the Bohol Chronicle defying editing rules.
Father's side.
Romea's father Bernardo "Leon" Vidal Romea was a rondalla trainer, scriptwriter, director and musical Arranger for the "Drama" in Napo, Loon, Bohol. 
Bernardo or "Pantaleon" or "Leon", as he was more popularly known, was born on March 12, 1895 in Barangay Napo to spouses Marcelo (Oyong Eloy) and Maria (Oyang Iyay) Vidal, a second wife. His grandparents were Domingo Romea and Cecilia Ordubanes of Barangay Taytay. 
After completing his elementary education and first year of high school, the latter at Bohol High School, he qualified for a teaching post, a feat in those days. On June 16, 1910, at age 15, he was appointed temporary teacher in Loon. A few years later, he passed the teachers' examinations and went on to become principal for 19 years. 
Romea's command of the English language was grammatically flawless. He bought American books and subscribed to local English magazines (e.g. Free Press, Graphics, etc.) hoping that his children would love or develop the habit of reading. They indeed became bookworms and their communication skills improved. His passion for music was such that he composed songs, organized rondallas wherever he was assigned in his teaching career, and promoted and participated in competitions. This went on even through his retirement years. He could skillfully play any of the string instruments in the rondalla but was at his best with the banduria. 
Romea was keen in distinguishing the slightest discord that at times during rondalla rehearsals, he would suddenly wave a hand for a pause just to tune up a dissonant instrument. Romea was also called a "dramaturgo" for he wrote and directed stage plays or "drama" which always served as the culminating feature of the barrio fiesta celebration in Napo. In fact, he is acknowledged as the original playwright, director and composer–musical arranger of Napo's stage plays that are now mounted on May 25 of each year without fail. It is believed that Napo holds the record of staging the longest running series of annual plays in Bohol, if not the whole country.

Secret Tournament

"The Secret Tournament" (also known as "Scorpion KO") was a Nike advertising campaign coinciding with the 2002 FIFA World Cup. With a marketing budget estimated at US$100 million, the advert featured 24 top contemporary football players and Eric Cantona as the tournament "referee". It was directed by film director and former Monty Python actor and animator Terry Gilliam.
Campaign instalments.
The campaign started in March 2002 with the "tease" phase of the campaign, featuring only a shot of soccer shoes and a scorpion. The early ads led viewers to a website where they could learn more about the Secret Tournament and play interactive games.
April saw the start of the "Excite" phase, with the teams facing off against each other, then moved into the "Involve" phase (see Impact).
Synopsis.
The concept of the advertising campaign was a fictional tournament involving eight teams of three of football's top players in a first-goal-wins elimination. The matches were staged in an enclosed pitch located on a ship with former footballer Eric Cantona acting in the role of referee.
Edits.
There are several different edits of the "Scorpion KO" commercials. There are four separate commercials for each match as well as an overall compilation of the matches and a condensed version of the compilation.
Rematch.
Following the run of the original advert, it was quickly followed up by a "Rematch" advert, featuring the two teams from the original final. In this script, the two teams played on a set representing the interior hull of the ship, no longer within a cage, and scored goals by hitting the bulkheads within a painted-on rectangle. Furthermore, as there were now only two teams remaining, the target was now to reach 100 goals. The two teams were said to have reached 99–99, meaning that the next goal would win; however, the previous 198 goals and other errant shots meant that the rivets holding the ship together had weakened, so when Luís Figo scored the winning goal for "Os Tornados", there was a hull breach, water rushed in and the two teams had to swim for shore.
Impact.
Following the airing of the commercials, in June 2002 an estimated 1 to 2 million children competed in matches following the Scorpion KO rules in about a dozen cities worldwide, including London (in the Millennium Dome), Beijing, and Buenos Aires.
Nike considered the campaign a success, with Nike president Mark Parker commenting, "This spring's integrated football marketing initiative was the most comprehensive and successful global campaign ever executed by Nike."

Bergmann-Bayard pistol

The Bergmann-Bayard was a German designed semi-automatic pistol produced under license in Belgium.
Bergmann Mars.
The Bergmann Mars was produced in 1901, and was the first Bergmann design aimed squarely at the military market, with a comparatively powerful 9x23mm Bergmann round. It aroused the interest of a number of armies and was the subject of several trials in competition with the Mauser C96, Mannlicher, Browning and Luger pistols.
Model 1903.
The Bergmann-Bayard Model 1903 was adopted by the Spanish army in 1905 as the "Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1903". Unable to find a German manufacturer to complete the Spanish order for 3000 pistols, Theodor Bergmann turned to a Belgian manufacturer, Anciens Etablissements Pieper (who used the trademark "Bayard") and who completed the order. The modified pistol was known as the Bergmann Bayard 1908 (not to be confused with Pieper-Bayard 1908), or in Spain as the "Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1908". Although adopted in 1908 delivery of the approximately 3,000 weapons was not completed until two years later. Meanwhile other manufacturers such as Campo-Giro had adopted the 9mm Bergmann-Bayard round and, due to its long history of use in Spanish submachine guns, carbines and pistols, today it is most commonly known as the 9mm Largo.
Model 1910 and Model 1910/21.
At the same time the Bergmann-Bayard model 1910 was adopted by the Danish military. A total of 4,840 M1910 Bergmann Bayards was initially delivered to the Danish Army. The pistol was produced in Belgium until 1914, when production ceased during World War I and never resumed. The Bergmann-Bayard was later produced in Denmark from 1922-1935.
Several modifications to the original design, such as an improved extractor and bolt; a screw to retain the sideplate instead of a spring-loaded catch; and a new grip design extending the full length of the backstrap to the frame were made. The original grips were made of Trolit, a checkered plastic material similar to Bakelite. It was, however, prone to chipping and warping, and the majority of new 1910/21 models was fitted with checkered wooden grips.
More than 2,200 Danish Bergmann-Bayard pistols were produced in Copenhagen. In addition, most of the prewar M1910s delivered to the Danish army by AEP were converted to meet the new specifications. These were restamped "M1910/21" beneath the "Societe Anonyme Anciens Establissments Pieper" on the left side of the barrel extension. The last Danish 1910/21 models were built in 1935, but they remained standard issue for the Danish military until 1946 when they were replaced by the Browning Hi-Power.
Other variants.
German forces received between 1,000-2,000 modified Model 1910 pistols from the occupied AEP factory. Comparatively speaking these are very rare, and had a distinctive wooden grip fitted and changed markings, but seem to have been mechanically identical.
Greece also adopted the pistol in 1913 (presumably the Model 1910) but no deliveries are believed to have taken place due to the outbreak of war.
Bergmann-Bayard pistols in .45 ACP were submitted for US army trials in 1906, but were unsuccessful.

Rod Searle

Rodney Newell "Rod" Searle, Sr. (July 17, 1920 – January 5, 2014) was a Minnesota farmer, insurance agent, and public servant. Born and raised in urban New Jersey, Searle moved to rural Minnesota in 1947 with his wife Jane and their two young children. With no prior experience in agriculture, they moved to a farm, and soon were raising crops and livestock. He also became heavily involved in community activities.
Searle was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1956, and spent 24 years as a legislator, and had a particular emphasis in education. In 1979 he was selected by an evenly divided body as Speaker. Searle retired from the legislature after the 1980 session but continued in public service, serving in a variety of public and private volunteer positions for the remainder of his life. He died at his home on January 5, 2014.
Early life.
Rod Searle was born July 17, 1920, in Camden, New Jersey to Ruby Marie Barus Searle, a nurse, and newspaper editor William A. Searle. He recalled seeing Babe Ruth hit a home run at Shibe Park in nearby Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Searle graduated from Haddonfield high school in Haddonfield, New Jersey. During World War II he worked for Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, New Jersey and went to night classes at Rutgers University.
Searle married Janette (Jane) E. Christie on May 17, 1941. In 1946 they began considering relocating from the industrial East to the rural Midwest. Eight months later, in April 1947, the Searles and their two small children made the move, which Searle later characterized as "nearly traumatic at the time", but "turned out to be the biggest and wisest decision of our lives".
They began farming 280 acres of run-down land in rural Waseca County, Minnesota in partnership with Robert Christie III, his brother-in-law, in a career for which they were neither trained nor educated. They obtained advice from the agricultural Experiment Station at Waseca, a branch of the University of Minnesota Waseca, the county extension agent, and neighbors. They grew crops, tended a small dairy herd, and raised sheep and chickens.
They involved themselves in community activities, and Searle was president of the Parent-Teacher Association for the Janesville school system and also led the Waseca County Dairy Herd Improvement Association. He chaired the Waseca County Red Cross, and was in the Janesville-Waseca Squadron of the United States Air Force Auxiliary Civil Air Patrol. He was active in the local Mason lodge, the Episcopal Church, and Republican Party, chairing the Waseca County executive committee of the party.
Searle resumed his college education, transferring his credits earned at Rutgers and attending classes part-time at Mankato State College, obtaining his BA in 1960 while a legislator.
Legislative career.
Searle was first elected to represent Waseca County in 1956. He was a part of the Conservative caucus during the period in which Minnesota's legislature was officially nonpartisan. When the legislature started using partisan designations in 1975 he was a Republican. He served on a number of committees, and at various times was Chair of the Higher Education, University and College, and University committees, and Chair of the Education Division of the Appropriations Committee. Searle was named Assistant Minority Leader by his caucus in 1975.
After the election of 1978, the house was divided equally between Independent-Republicans and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Searle was chosen as speaker in a compromise between the two parties. He later acknowledged the "unique opportunity" as speaker of an evenly-divided House, and said of this period: "Out of necessity, and challenged by the legislative concerns of the times, raw politics was minimized, and a system of balance, cooperation and mutual respect produced workable solutions to the problems that confronted us."
In May 1979, Democrats gained a seat, giving the party a majority in the body, and selected Fred C. Norton as Speaker. Searle was named Minority Leader by his caucus.
Later career.
Searle retired from the House after conclusion of the 1980 session. In later years, as the Minnesota Republican Party moved further to the right, Searle became an independent, stating "My party has abandoned me." In 2010 Searle was among a group of Republican former lawmakers who endorsed Independence Party candidate for governor Tom Horner, rather than the Republican-endorsed candidate, Tom Emmer. The state Republican party took action against those in the group, preventing them from serving as a delegate to the state or national party conventions for two years.
After retirement from the legislature, Searle was president of the Minnesota State University Board, chair of the Minnesota College Merger Board, and chair of the Minnesota Higher Education Board. He served as Chair of the Upper Mississippi River Basin Commission. He also volunteered for the Minnesota Agricultural Interpretive Center ("Farmamerica"), and the Waseca County Historical Society, which he also served as a member of its board of directors.
Personal life.
Rod Searle’s first wife Jane was a librarian and volunteer who assisted children with reading disabilities. She died on October 10, 2000. Searle said of her that "she was the real speaker of the house", and had assisted him with speeches and writing. They had two sons and a daughter.
Rod Searle married Ruth A. Bartlett in 2001. Searle died on January 5, 2014 at his home since 1947, in Alton Township in rural Waseca County. He is survived by his wife Ruth and his three children from his marriage with Jane.

John Scott (architect)

John Colin Scott (9 June 1924 – 30 July 1992) was a New Zealand architect of the 20th century, known for his unique buildings that incorporated ideas from Maori and cultural architecture.
Early life.
John Colin Scott was born in Haumoana, Hawke’s Bay on 9 June 1924, the third of seven children of Kathleen Hiraani Blake and Charles Hudson Scott, a farmer. His mother and father both had British ancestry, while his father was also a descendant of Te Arawa.
John Scott had a typical Hawke's Bay childhood, riding to Haumona School on horseback. Then attending St John's College in Hastings where he was head prefect and captain of the school's First XV rugby team. After leaving school he found work as a shepherd, before volunteering for the air force as the Second World War came to an end.
In 1946 he studied at the School of Architecture at Auckland University College, but he was unsure of what he wanted to do. He disliked the university academic environment and by 1950 he reduced himself to studying part-time. Scott never achieved his architecture diploma from the College, but he was influenced by teachers Vernon Brown and Bill Wilson. In 1951 he married Wilson's sister-in-law Joan Moffatt in Auckland.
Architectural career.
After leaving University he worked for two architectural firms. later he decided to move back to Haumona in the Hawke's Bay with his wife and work for himself. His initial jobs were mostly private houses, like the Savage House and the Falls House in Havelock North (1952–53). As he developed his individual style, he became inspired by traditional New Zealand buildings such as the whare and woolshed, elements of which can be seen in his later work. Much of his work is characterised by strong geometric shapes.
His first church was designed for St John's College in Hastings (1954–56). This led to the commission of a Marist chapel in Karori, Wellington. This project, the Chapel of Futuna (1958–61) is arguably the best work of his career, and is recognised nationally and internationally. The chapel incorporates ideas from a whare - a central pole, ribs of rafters and low eaves. The building won the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal in 1968, and the first 25-year Award in 1986.
Scott mostly worked on private commissions, many of which were located in the Hawke’s Bay region of New Zealand area close to where he grew up. One of Scott’s last projects in New Zealand before he died was John’s House, a holiday accommodation located in Havelock, New Zealand. This was the second home that decorated WW2 veteran John Pattison commissioned John Scott to build, and it was completed in 1990.
Besides public commissions, Scott designed several other public buildings. The Maori Battalion Memorial Centre in Palmerston North (1954–64) used carved panels and tukutuku for decoration. The Urewera National Park Headquarters building (1974–76) was designed as a pavilion to suit the neighbouring bush, and shows that sense of place and landscape were critical to his architectural thinking.
Late life.
John Scott died on 30 July 1992 in Auckland after a major heart operation. In 1999 he was awarded another gold medal by the New Zealand Institute of Architects for his unique contribution to architecture.

Marie d'Albret, Countess of Rethel

Marie d'Albret, Countess of Rethel, Countess of Nevers (25 March 1491 – 27 October 1549) was the suo jure Countess of Rethel, a title which she inherited at the age of nine upon the death of her mother, Charlotte of Nevers, Sovereign Countess of Rethel, on 23 August 1500. She was the wife of Charles II of Cleves, Count of Nevers.
Family.
Marie was born in the Chateau de Cuffy, France on 25 March 1491, the eldest child of Jean d'Albret, Sire of Orval, Governor of Champagne (died 10 May 1524), and Charlotte of Nevers, Countess of Rethel (1472- 23 August 1500). She had two younger sisters, Charlotte d'Albret, wife of Odet de Foix, Count of Comminges; and Hélène d'Albret (16 July 1495- 28 October 1519). She had two illegitimate half-siblings, Jacques d'Albret, Bishop of Nevers, and Françoise d'Albret, Abbess of Notre Dame de Nevers. 
Her paternal grandparents were Arnaud Amanieu d'Albret, Sire d'Orval (died 1463) and Isabelle de La Tour d'Auvergne (died 8 September 1488), daughter of Bertrand V de La Tour, Count of Auvergne and Boulogne and Jacquette du Peschin. Her maternal grandparents were John II, Count of Nevers, Count of Rethel and Pauline de Bosse-Bretagne. Marie's paternal great-great-grandfather was Charles d'Albret, Constable of France, who was killed while commanding the French troops at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. 
Marie became the sovereign Countess of Rethel at the age of nine upon the death of her mother, Charlotte, at the Chateau de Meillan-en-Berry, who had herself held the "suo jure" title.
Marriage.
On 25 January 1504, Marie married her cousin, Charles II of Cleves, Count of Nevers (died 17 August 1521), the son of Engelbert, Count of Nevers and Charlotte of Bourbon-Vendôme. Upon her marriage she became the Countess of Nevers. Together Charles and Marie had a son:
Marie became a widow in 1521. In 1539, she took the title of Duchess of Nevers, although in point of fact, her son Francis was the "suo jure" duke.

Peronospora hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina

Peronospora hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina is a plant pathogen infecting tobacco.
Background information.
Peronopora Hyoscyami Blue mold of tobacco is caused by "Peronospora tabacina"; it is a fungus like organism that is highly destructive toward seed plants. The tabacina is also very alarming towards humid farming zones, like the southeastern and eastern U.S., Canada, and countries boarding the Caribbean. The disease was first identified in 1921 in Florida and Georgia Ten years later the same disease was found once again in the same region of the U.S. The disease began to spread into Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. A few years later the disease reached Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1960 a blue mold epidemic spread on tobacco in approximately eleven countries. There was approximately twenty five million dollars in losses which is nearly thirty percent of tobacco plants. Each year Peronospora Hyoscyami is introduced as blue mold, known as windblown spores from outside the region by infected transplants.
Symptoms.
Tobacco plants with an upright position of small patches of the seed bed are typically early signs of blue mold. These leaves are usually two to four centimeters in diameter, and normally spotted with yellow, gray, or a bluish mold in the lower surface. Younger plants that are up to four weeks old and are affected by the disease are easily killed by the fungus. Older plants become deformed and dark, indicating that parts of the plant are dead. In more severe cases the stem and root become infected and turn to a brownish color. The observation of downy mold in the lower surface of the leaf is the most reliable symptom of blue mold. Downy mold carries thousands of small reproductive units called conidia If conidia forms at different spots in the seedbed an outbreak is more than likely to occur. The symptoms usually take place before it’s obvious. The symptoms evolve rapidly and are typically noticeable over night.
The fungus frequently takes place when the vein of the leaves reaches vascular tissue of the stem, causing weakness and lodging. This infection is called "systemic infection". The infection causes a stunt in growth and the leaves become narrow and short. The vascular system of the plants usually turns brown in color and the weakened stalk usually causing the stalk to fall over.
The fungus is highly weather sensitive. During the time when the weather is cool, wet, or when there’s an overcast the disease can evolve in a greenhouse or field. The disease spreads rapidly because of the fungal pathogen. The rate of continental spread is based on the potential for high levels of inoculum and effective wind spores. When the weather is clear, dry, and hot the disease usually stops spreading and more than likely stops all together.
Spreading the Disease.
A major way blue mold spreads is by the distribution of infected transplants. Even though they may appear to be healthy they can still hold the infection.Farmers generally buy transplants from other growers, and take risks of possibly buying diseased plants. If these plants are diseased they are risking their other plants of getting blue mold. This can affect their entire region of their tobacco plants.
A five- to seven-day symptom-free plant takes place before the first appearance of a diseased plant is visible. When weather conditions are reasonable a second set of spores evolves around a seven- to a ten-day period. If these plants are not chemically treated quickly the cycle may be repeated several times during the growing season. This can cause a huge epidemic causing many plants to be infected. Blue mold has been found to come into play three times each week from March to August 
Prevention.
"The disease is getting harder to manage and is becoming a problem". The way to prevent the disease is to manage your own crops. Protect plants with fungicides when they are most vulnerable. Take control of these crops early on. Make the environment less favorable for the pathogen to survive and protect the tobacco. Always keep the pathogen out of tobacco and the area for as long as possible. Farmers are always able to grow their own plants so as to not purchase them from others which should reduce the chance of planting diseased plants.

Capitol Park and Lagoon

The Capitol Park and Lagoon is a provincial park located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, in the Philippines. One of the features of the park are matching sculptures depicting a woman standing alongside a water buffalo and that of a man pulling another water buffalo. These sculptures are located at the northern and southern ends of the lagoon. These figures were executed by Italian sculpture Francesco Riccardo Monti who also did the sculptures of the Metropolitan Manila Theater and the University of the Philippines - Visayas Iloilo campus. Guillermo Tolentino also contributed as a sculptor of the figures. 
Attractions and landmarks.
Popular activities at the park include jogging, aerobics, school dance rehearsals, promenading, Arnis and martial arts practice and feeding the tilapias of the lagoon.
The main landmark in the park is the Negros Occidental Provincial Capitol building. It is the official seat of the Governor of the province. Different government offices of the province serving its thirteen cities and municipalities are also located in the vicinity of the park.
The first Panaad sa Negros Festival, also known as the "Panaad Festival", was held here in a three-day affair in 1993 that began April 30. The festival was held at the Capitol Park and Lagoon fronting the Provincial Capitol for the first four years. As the festival grew each year, it became necessary to look for a more spacious venue. In 1997, the festival was held at the reclaimed area near the Bredco Port. The construction of the Panaad Stadium and sports complex paved the way for the establishment of the Panaad Park as the permanent home of the festival.
The park today has become a popular spot for local families to hold picnics on Sundays and holidays and a major tourist attraction of Negros. A man-made lake or lagoon in the middle of the park contains live tilapia fish. The park has recreational value as well, as bands, orchestras and other forms of entertainment are provided for free in its open-air auditorium in events aptly called "Concert at the Park".

<doc id="21619765" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21619765" title="Sexuality and disability">
Sexuality and disability

Sexuality and disability refers to the sexual behaviour and practices of people with a disability (PWD). Physical disabilities such as a spinal cord injury may change the sexual functioning of a person. However, the disabled person may enjoy sex with the help of sex toys and physical aids (such as bed modifications), by finding suitable sex positions, or through the services provided by a qualified sex worker.
Relationships and disability.
The experiences of people with disabilities has shown that the basic human need to form close relationships is as relevant for PWD as it is for humans without a disability. However, a long history of seclusion and segregation of people with disabilities is evident in Western culture, and this has greatly inhibited the ability of PWD to freely meet and socialize with other people. Furthermore, the social networks of people with disabilities can be small and this restricts the ability to form new relationships.
Disability stereotypes add to the difficulty and stigma experienced by people with disabilities. The following myths about people with disabilities have been identified: 
According to one survey, up to 50% of adults with disabilities are not in any sexual relationship at all. Online dating sites specifically aimed at people with disabilities have been founded to fill this void. 
Misperceptions from the broader community has been raised as a prominent issue for PWD in terms of their own relationships. The head of a disabled dating service explained in 2010: "Like anyone else, people with disabilities have different preferences. Someone with good mobility may prefer someone also mobile; others don’t limit at all." In a 2012 "Sydney Morning Herald", the mother of a man with cerebral palsy explained, "It's hard being a parent and this comes up. People see them sitting in their wheelchair think, that's it. They don't see what's going on in their lives and Mark [son would dearly love a relationship."
Self-image and disability.
Having a disability may sometimes create an emotional or psychological burden for the person with the disability. They may feel inhibition about pursuing relationships, fearing rejection on the basis that they have a disability. Self-image may suffer as a result of disfigurement, or lack of confidence. A New York disabled dating service manager explains, "Sexuality, travel, mobility, pain: Everything takes on a different dimension.” In "The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability", Miriam Kaufman points out that attempting to hide a disability or minimize its existence is ultimately an added burden, encouraging readers to "come out" to themselves as disabled, to accept their disability.
Sexual activity.
The mechanics of sex may be daunting, and communication, experimentation, medication and manual devices have been cited as important factors for sexual activity where disability is involved. Additionally, recognition of the pleasure that is derived from sexual activity beyond penetration and intercourse is also highlighted; for example, sensitivity to touch can increase above the lesion location in someone with paralysis from a spinal injury. From research undertaken by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, orgasm was achievable for 79% of men with incomplete spinal cord injuries and 28% of men with complete injuries.
Oral sex is another alternative where penetration is not possible or not wanted, and wedge devices can be used to aid with positioning—wedges can be used as an aid in sex generally. Sex toys may be used as assistive devices as well; for example, vibrators can be used to provide extra stimulation and in circumstances where hand mobility is impaired. Other supportive devices include manual stimulation pumps, for erection promotion and maintenance, and "sex furniture", whereby rail or clamp enhancements, or specialised designs facilitate sexual activity.
Writer Faiza Siddiqui sustained a serious brain injury that led to a decrease in her sexual drive and the loss of her ability to orgasm, with the latter most likely the result of damage to Siddiqui's hypothalamus. Siddiqui explained her learning process in relation to sexual activity following the accident in a 2013 article: 
I had to clear away all the thoughts I had about my imperfect body ... Since then, I’ve started to feel less shame about my unresponsive body ... My brain can’t concentrate on as many things anymore, so I have to focus more on every little twinge and the lightest of touches. Surely that’s going to mean better sex? I can’t say that the sex is exactly better – I can’t be on top anymore – but I’m learning that it doesn’t really matter ... I had to grow up. Growing up is something that we’re all having to do.
Sex work and disability.
In February 2013, it was reported that citizens with a disability in the Netherlands were eligible for a government-funded scheme that provided funds to cover up to 12 occasions of sexual service per year. During the same period, Chris Fulton, a campaigner in the UK with cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, called upon the UK government to also provide financial support for sexual services for PWD. Fulton explained:
The idea is to give disabled people more of a choice. There’s still a lot of stigma attached disabled people having relationships from research I’ve done and experiences I’ve had. I think it would be good to bring the Dutch scheme over here to take away that stigma about disabled people having sex. But it’s not just about that. It’s about disabled people being accepted when they have relationships ... It needs to be brought out into the open in a managed and constructive way.
In early 2013, former brothel owner Becky Adams spoke with the media about her intention to open a non-profit brothel exclusively for disabled people in the UK, which, if launched in 2014, will be the nation's first legal initiative of this nature. Adams stated that she will invest £60,000 into the brothel after suffering a stroke in 2009—Adams explained that after the stroke, her "eyes were suddenly opened. I was utterly unaware that such a big group was suffering so enormously." If she is approved for a permit, Adams plans to open a two-room service in Milton Keynes, near London, that will be staffed by sex workers and assistants. 
Adams also founded the Para-Doxies service in 2012, which connects disabled people throughout the UK with sex workers—at the time, Adams ran the service on a completely voluntary, non-profit basis. In April 2013, the service was receiving over 500 enquiries a week from men, women and couples, and was struggling to cope with the demand. 
A 2011 Australian documentary directed by Catherine Scott, "Scarlet Road", explores another aspect of sexuality and disabilities through the life of a sex worker who has specialized for 18 years in a clientele who have disabilities. In 2012, the topic was highlighted in a fictional film based on the real life experience of writer Mark O'Brien. "The Sessions" portrays the relationship between O'Brien, who survived polio as a child, and a "sexual surrogate" to whom he loses his virginity to. A member of the British Polio Fellowship states that post-polio syndrome, which affects polio survivors later in life, is a little-known condition that could have been explored in the film.
A survey conducted by the "Disability Now" magazine in 2005 found that 19% of female participants would see trained sex workers, compared with 63% of the male respondents. Dr Tuppy Owens, sex therapist and disability professional, explained in 2013 that women with disabilities "don't trust male sex workers to be honourable".
Sexual harassment, assault, and domestic violence.
People with disabilities are as vulnerable as anyone to the problems that accompany sexual relationships. These problems include harassment, assault, and domestic violence. People with disabilities are more vulnerable to sexual assault than the general public, being targeted due to the physical or mental impairments that they have. The "American Journal of Preventive Medicine" has published results of a survey that found that males with disabilities are 4 times more likely to be sexually abused. Other studies have shown that for women with disabilities, "regardless of age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or class are assaulted, raped, and abused at a rate two times greater than women without disabilities [... the risk of being physically assaulted for an adult with developmental disabilities is 4-10 times higher than for other adults".
Resources.
Sex guides depicting various sexual positions, as well as other written material, can be helpful for couples who need to address mobility impairments, as well as for those who are caring for or working with PWD. Such resources, written by people with expertise in disability issues, are in print, including: "Sexuality and Learning Disability", by Claire Fanstone and Zarine Katrak; "The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability", published by Cleis Press, which consists of advice from disabled people; and "Holding On, Letting Go", a book for parents written by John Drury, Lynnne Hutchinson and Jon Wright.
The creation of the "Sexual Respect Tool Kit" was initiated by Alex Cowan, a professional working in the disability field in the UK, and Dr Owens after the Outsiders/Royal Society of Medicine conference "Disability: Sex Relationships and Pleasure", held in 2009. Cowan, a consultant with multiple sclerosis (MS) who discovered the lack of sex-related support for PWD through personal experience, worked with Owens to form a group of experts, consisting of people such as human rights law lecturer Claire de Than and sex educator Sue Newsome, to further develop the tool kit concept. The finished resource is designed to assist health professionals in the UK to initiate discussions on sex and related matters with disabled people.
"Disability Horizons" is a UK magazine co-founded by Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley, who both have Spinal Muscular Atrophy and continue as co-editors. The publication is self-described as a "21st Century View of Disability" and seeks to "help disabled people achieve whatever they wish." "Disability Now" is another UK magazine that is published by Scope, a national cerebral palsy organisation. The publication appointed its first disabled editor in September 2007 and had a circulation of 20,000 at the time. 
An academic journal, founded in 1978, called "Sexuality and Disability" exists and is described by its publisher, Springer Publishing, as "A Journal Devoted to the Psychological and Medical Aspects of Sexuality in Rehabilitation and Community Settings". Its current Editor-in-Chief is Sigmund Hough.
Organizations.
Australia.
The subject of the "Scarlet Road" documentary, Rachel Wotton, also cofounded and helps run Touching Base, an organization based in New South Wales, Australia that provides information, education and support for disabled clients, sex workers and Disability Service Providers. The organisation has been active since October 2000 following the formation of the founding committee that consisted of disability and health organisation representatives. Wotton explains, "I am a sex worker and I make my money from clients seeing me. Some clients just happen to have a disability." Initially, the organisation was receiving around one weekly phone call, but by 2012, enquiries were daily.
In March 2014, former Australian High Court judge Michael Kirby became a patron of the organisation, joining four other inaugural patrons: Eva Cox, Professor Basil Donovan, Associate Professor Helen Meekosha, and NSW Local Government elder statesman Peter Woods. Following his appointment, Kirby stated: "If you deny sexual expression to human beings, cut them off from that aspect of their personalities and of their happiness, then you end up with a lot of very frustrated and very unhappy people", and he praised Touching Base for recognising that people with disabilities need "to have opportunities for sexual expression".
United Kingdom.
The TLC Trust provides a web-based service that facilitates the provision of sexual services—sex workers, therapists, and teachers—for PWD, including a phone call appointment-booking service for those people with speech impairments or care workers who are unable to organise such services for clients due the policy of their employer. The TLC Trust was founded in 2000 at a Sexual Freedom Coalition Conference and the website was initially run by James Palmer, a man with a disability. The organisation has garnered praise from sex educator and performance artist Annie Sprinkle, and academic and writer A.C. Grayling.
Founded by Dr Owens, Outsiders is primarily an international social club for PWD, but the organisation also runs the Sex and Disability Helpline, a telephone support service for PWD that is staffed by both people with disabilities and health professionals. Outsiders is supported by the Outsiders Trust, which consists of a Board of Trustees that assists with the management of matters such as finances and projects. 
The Sexual Health and Disability Alliance, also founded by Owens, was first started to provided a forum in which all of the UK's disability helpline operators, and others, could meet and discuss their work. The individuals who were initially involved state that they were "eager to improve the sex-positive work we do" and the Alliance was eventually formalised in 2008 with a mission to "bring together health professionals who work with disabled people to empower and support them in their sex and relationship needs." The Alliance does not charge a fee for those interested in becoming members and meets biannually in London. It held its first conference in 2009 at the Royal Society of Medicine.
The Disabilities Trust is over 30 years old and is a leading charitable organisation in the UK. It states that it provides "residential and day services to meet the needs of individuals with Autism, Brain Injury, Physical Disability and Learning Disability", as well as helping people to live at home in the community. The Trust has produced written information on sexuality and disability, which are freely available on the Internet.

Aubrey W. Dirlam

Aubrey W. "A.W." Dirlam (October 20, 1913 – June 3, 1995) was a Minnesota politician and a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives who represented the old District 14, District 17, District 17A, and District 21B, which included all or portions of 
Brown, Kandiyohi, Redwood, Renville and Yellow Medicine counties in the southwestern part of the state. The district number and boundaries changed through the years due to redistricting.
House service and leadership.
First elected in 1940, Dirlam was re-elected every two years until he retired in 1975. During his 34 years in the House, he served as Speaker, Majority Leader and Minority Leader. He was a member of the Legislature at a time when candidates, representatives and leadership positions were officially non-partisan. He allied with the House's Conservative Caucus, and was known to be a Republican.
Dirlam originally sought the House speakership in 1963, but lost the contest by one vote to Lloyd Duxbury, accepting the majority leader position in compensation. He later succeeded Duxbury as Speaker in 1971 and was the last officially nonpartisan Speaker. He had occasion to preside over the longest special session in state history (159 calendar days) that same year after Governor Wendell Anderson called the Legislature back to Saint Paul. After a series of meetings with the governor and Senate Majority Leader Stanley Holmquist, they were able to craft the "Minnesota Miracle," which set a new pattern in the state's financing of education.
Dirlam served as chair of the Agriculture Committee from 1949–1955, and as chair of the Rules Committee from 1963–1971. He was also a member of the Education, Governmental Operations, Rules and Legislative Administration, and Taxes committees.
Background and later years.
Born in Panora, Iowa, Dirlam moved with his family to the Redwood Falls, Minnesota area in 1919, where they farmed. In addition to being a lifelong grain and livestock farmer, he and his family were also involved with a meat and locker business. He also served on the Redwood Falls School Board.
In 1981, Governor Al Quie appointed Dirlam to serve on the Minnesota Board of Residential Utility Consumers, a position he held until 1985. He died in 1995 and was buried in Redwood Falls Cemetery.

Peer Portner

Peer Michael Portner (January 8, 1940 – February 9, 2009) was a heart researcher whose work led to the development of the ventricular assist device, an electrical pump that permits patients in heart failure to survive until a heart transplant could be performed.
Portner was born on January 8, 1940 in Mombasa, Kenya. In 1968, he was awarded doctorate in experimental nuclear physics from McGill University in Montreal, which was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship in nuclear physics at the University of Oxford.
Portner was hired as a senior physicist at Andros Inc., a research and development firm headquartered in Berkeley, California, that was taken over by Novacor in the 1980s. During the 1970s, first became involved in biomedical engineering while experimenting on a device that attached to the left ventricles of the hearts of laboratory cows in order to restore the heart's pumping ability while obviating the need to remove the heart's chambers.
By 1984, this had evolved into the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which consisted of an electrical pump and bladder that was placed into the chest of the patient, connected by wires to a battery outside the patient's body. The LVAD replaced earlier devices that had run on compressed air, requiring a larger opening in the thoracic cavity that was more prone to infection. The first recipient, 51-year-old Robert St. Laurent, remained on the pump for eight days before his damaged heart was replaced in a transplant operation, and lived for 20 years in stable health before his death in 2004. St. Laurent had had a heart attack and what turned out to be unsuccessful coronary artery bypass surgery, leading to the successful implantation of the LVAD for the first time in a human. The heart St. Laurent received came from an 18-year-old college student who had been brain dead following a car accident.
He established the Novacor Medical Corporation in the 1980s to construct and distribute the device, serving as its president and chief executive before the company was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corporation in 1988. After the takeover, Portner served as chairman of Baxter's Novacor division, where he continued to improve the device, making it easier to transport and allowing patients to wash, walk and be outside the hospital for significant periods of time. By the time of Portner's death, an estimated 1,800 Novacor devices had been implanted to allow for a transition to transplants and in other cases, with devices kept in patients for up to six years. Available since 1993, the wearable version lets patients return to a largely normal lifestyle outside of the hospital.
By 1987, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted permission to use Novacor pumps on a case-by-case basis, with doctors at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh indicating that they would use the Novacor pump in lieu of Jarvik hearts until a human donor heart can be found.
Though the Novacor pump was ultimately not needed, Portner was on hand while President of Russia Boris Yeltsin was undergoing cardiac bypass surgery in 1996, ready to assist in case of emergency.
Portner served as president of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs. O. H. Frazier, director of cardiovascular surgery research at The Texas Heart Institute in Houston and developer of Thoratec's HeartMate pump, stated that "Peer Portner was an original investigator of a lifesaving technology who contributed to the literature and first generation of these devices."
In 2008, Portner was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology and inducted into their College of Fellows.
Portner died at age 69 on February 9, 2009 at his home in Kensington, California due to cancer. He was survived by his wife, two daughters; and three grandchildren.

Vrzdenec

Vrzdenec () is a village west of Horjul in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlets of Gošavje, Kisovnik, and Zagorica.
Geography.
Vrzdenec is a clustered village on a small rise above the marshy Šujica Valley. Prominent elevations in the area include Reber Hill (480 m) to the north, and Baš Hill (, 420 m) and Tičina Hill (380 m) to the east. There are several springs in the area. Sopošče Spring has its source above the church and serves as the water supply for the village. There is another spring below the village, and west of this are Deklevšek Spring and Jazba Spring. There are fields in higher areas of the Šujica Valley and extensive forested land. There are meadows and orchards on Baš Hill.
Name.
Vrzdenec was attested in written sources in 1309 as "Schönprun" (and as "Schönprunne" in 1343, and "Schönprun" in 1453). The name is a fusion of the phrase "*vьrxъ stъdenьca", meaning either 'above the spring' or 'source of the spring'. In the 19th century it was known as "Schönbrunn" (literally, 'beautiful spring') in German.
History.
Prehistoric finds, including stone and bronze axes, have been found at Tabor Hill, testifying to early settlement of the area. Tabor Hill also had a fortification during the Middle Ages that served as protection against Ottoman attacks. The village came under German bombardment during the Second World War on 1 November 1943.
Church.
The local church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Cantius and belongs to the Parish of Horjul. It is a Romanesque building, probably dating to the 13th century with poorly preserved traces of frescos from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The more modern wall paintings in the church are by the Slovene Impressionist painter Matej Sternen with scenes from the Life of Christ.

<doc id="21619982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21619982" title="Bibulca Way">
Bibulca Way

Bibulca Way (in Italian:"Via Bibulca") was an old road dating back to the 11th century that used to link up Modena with Lucca and it was
part of a much bigger network of roads. It starts where the Dragone River flows into the Dolo River in the "La Piana" locality () 
and finishes in the "San Pellegrino in Alpe" () hamlet located on the ridge that separates the Tuscany
Apennines from the Emilia Apennines. It was also called the "Imperial Way" due to its high toll that had to be paid in order to use it and that it could host a cart drawn by two oxen one beside the other, a luxury for the time. It has a length
of 18.7 miles starts from a height of 1,200 feet (360 metres) and arrives at the height of 
5,100 feet (1529 metres). Now it is used as an amateur trekking path that runs alongside the "strada provinciale 32MO" road and in certain stretches shares the same route. It takes 9 hours to go through it all on foot.
History.
This ancient Way dates back to the Roman Empire, when the ancient tribe of the "Frinati", which was part of the 
population of the "Liguri", gave battle for over twenty years to the Roman Republic. When the Romans, once defeated the "Frinati" tribe in the 175 BC (Livy), managed to settle in the area, built a thick system of paths and roads. In fact, the name comes from Latin "Bi-" meaning two and "-bulca" meaning oxen. Some people, though, think the road may even date back to "pre-Roman" period.
In the Holy Roman Empire era it was called the "via nova". At the arrival of the Lombards this road had a great loss of importance however in the 7th century the "Pass of the Radici" was opened. The most important era for this road has been when the "Frassinoro Abbey" has been inaugurated by the local ruler Matilda of Tuscany that
overtook by importance the "Pieve of Rubbiano" settlement, the local main town of the time, that used to collect the tolls for all local roads and used to look after them.
The Way was often a matter to argue about between the "Comune of Modena" and the "Frassinoro Abbey", to this latter one it was entrusted to in 1164, by 
Frederick I because of frequent robberies that took place in the nearby Garfagnana. Along the route were constructed 2 hospices; one over at the "Saint Geminiano" locality and another one over to "Saint Pilgrim in Alpe". In 1522 Ludovico Ariosto while going over to Garfagnana to take its governament, tested the conditions of the road saying that it was an "iniquitous road".
Finally in the 18th century were constructed other transapenninics roads like the "Via Vandelli" that mostly shared the same old route of the "Bibulca Way" but on the final ridge to the way to "Saint Pilgrim in Alpe" preferred another route to the old one. Towards the end of the 18th century the "Via Giardini" road was laid down by the House of Este Dukes, and the "Via Bibulca" road definitively was left abandoned.

William Theobald

William Theobald (1829 – 31 March 1908) was a malacologist and naturalist on the staff of the Geological Survey of India in Burma. That organization then covered Burma, as it was at the time still a part of British India.
Theobald was referred to in official documents as "William Theobald, Junior". He arrived in Calcutta on the ship "Hindostan" via the Suez in March 1847 and worked as a volunteer in the coal exploration of the upper Damodar and Son valleys under David Williams. During this time Joseph Hooker visited him and they spent time together. Later Theobald became an assistant to John McClelland who took over the exploration from David Williams. He went to Burma in 1855 as a staff of the Geological Survey of India and took over the "Pegu survey". He returned Bengal on completion of the survey in 1873 to be appointed Deputy Superintendent of Bengal in 1876.
Theobald was the first to publish a full catalogue of reptile specimens collected in British India, although Anderson claimed that several new descriptions by Edward Blyth were overlooked by this work. Theobald's work on Indian freshwater snails with illustrations was one of the first of its kind. He even made his shell collections available to Francis Mason for his epic work on the flora and fauna of British Burma titled "Burmah, its People and Natural Productions". The third edition of this work was completely rewritten by Theobald and was published in two volumes under the title "Burma, its people and productions; or notes on the fauna, flora and minerals of Tenasserim, Pegu and Burma" (Hertford, England, 1882 & 1883). The first volume of this work covered geology, mineralogy and zoology and was exclusively written by him while the second volume relied on several important botanical works of his time. The phanerogamic information came from printed works of Sulpiz Kurz on the Burmese flora and from the entries in Edward Balfour's works. He also relied on Le Maout's and Decaisne's general system of botany translated by Mrs. Hooker and on Gamble's "Manual of Indian Timbers". However, his efforts at reforming botanical nomenclature conflicted with the British Botanical establishment at that time a majority in British India and his botanical works were largely disregarded.
He retired from the service in June 1881 and died at Ilfracombe, Devon, England on 31 March 1908. A photograph of him as member of a group of the Geological Survey of India is published in the Centenary publication of that organization.

1970 Propane vapor cloud explosion in Port Hudson

The 1970 Propane vapor cloud explosion in Port Hudson resulted from a propane pipeline break, which led to the formation of a large, dense vapor cloud. Upon ignition, the vapor cloud exploded with tremendous force. Both near- and far-field damage indicate that this explosion may be attributed to the detonation of propane in air with an energy release equivalent to that from about 50 tons of detonating Trinitrotoluene(TNT). The violence of the explosion is likely unprecedented. As such, the accident is widely quoted as one of the first, if not the first, confirmed accidental occurrences of an unconfined vapor cloud deflagration that turns into a detonation - a so-called deflagration to detonation transition. The accident represents a "worst-possible" sort of case history for assessment of the hazards of fuel transportation.
The accident took place in Port Hudson, Franklin County, Missouri, on December 9, 1970. The pipeline was owned by Phillips Pipeline Company.

Jack Finck (21 January 1930 – 31 October 2012) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the early 1950s.
Finck, who Collingwood recruited from Heathmere, was a key position defender. As a result he kicked just eight goals in his career but half of them came in a single match, when he helped his side to defeat Carlton at Princes Park in 1953. Later that year, Finck, having missed out on a premiership in 1952 when Collingwood lost the Grand Final, got another opportunity when he was their full-back in the team which defeated Geelong in the decider.
After just four seasons and despite being aged just 24, Finck retired, citing the long commute from Portland for home games.

David Nyheim

David Nyheim (born 1970, citizen of Norway) is a peace-making strategist. His work over the last 15 years has focused on conflict early warning, dialogue process design and implementation, as well as forecasting and strategy.
Career history.
After several years in the humanitarian and public health fields, he was recruited in 1997 to establish the Forum on Early Warning and Early Response (FEWER).[http://www.fewer-international.org] His tenure as Director involved the establishment of early warning systems in the North Caucasus, West Africa, and Great Lakes region. Concerned with the absence of responses to warnings, he worked with FEWER members to combine warning systems with multi-stakeholder dialogue and planning processes in Chechnya, DR Congo, Guinea-Conakry, and Georgia.
After leaving FEWER in 2003, Nyheim established International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting Ltd. (United Kingdom) together with Anton Ivanov, Samuel Doe, and Tom Porteous. He served as its Chief Executive till 2014, after which he became the Chairman of the INCAS Consulting Ltd. group of regional consulting companies.[http://www.incasconsulting.com/history/4584480835 As a consultant, David Nyheim designed and implemented dialogue processes in Indonesia (Christian-Muslim conflicts), Mauritania (government-opposition dialogue on development), Fiji (pre-election stabilisation), and Kyrgyzstan (micro-conflicts and tensions). He worked on several stabilisation initiatives, largely for governments and companies operating in areas affected by criminalised violence. Lessons learnt and methods for this work were published by David Nyheim and Anton Ivanov in 2014.[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stabilising-Affected-Criminalised-Violent-Conflict-ebook/dp/B00JGOZIDK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402337497&sr=8-1&keywords=Stabilising+Areas+Affected+By+Criminalised+Violent+Conflict%3A+A+Guide+For+Analysis+And+Stabilisation+Strategy]
Most of Nyheim’s forecasting and strategy work has been for governments and multinational corporations. In 2003, he co-authored the "Peace and Security Strategy (PASS)" for Shell Nigeria that accurately predicted serious instability in the Niger Delta. After several years of focused work on the Niger Delta, which included support to the later President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, Nyheim returned to the North Caucasus in 2005, where worked with Anton Ivanov and others on a "Strategic Reconstruction and Development Assessment" for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (United Kingdom). That same year, he developed an integrated aid-reconciliation multi-donor strategy for Myanmar that controversially argued for active engagement with the Myanmar government.
Nyheim is considered a leading thinker and practitioner of modern conflict early warning and response. His study, "Preventing Violence, War, and State Collapse. The Future of Conflict Early Warning and Response"for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is widely quoted [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17742631554471356329.
Education.
David Nyheim received his BA in political science from McGill University (Canada) in 1992. From 1992-1994, he studied medicine at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), before joining the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) in 1994. He received his MSc. in economics from the London School of Economics/London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (United Kingdom) in 1996. During this time he served as the chairperson of the Student's Union of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Žažar

Žažar ( or "Schaschar") is a village in the hills southwest of Horjul in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlet of Razpotje. Southwest of the settlement core is the Jevše Valley with a watering hole for livestock. The Trešnica Gorge and Gošava Spring lie northeast of the settlement core. The territory of the settlement includes the following hills: Koprivnik Hill (551 m), Babca Peak (, 503 m), Gradišče Hill (547 m), and Žažar Hill (447 m). There is an opening into 130-meter-long Pajsar Cave () in the southern part of the settlement.
Name.
Žažar is also known locally as "Žajžar". The priest and historian Peter Hicinger explained the name as meaning "žarišče" 'focal point of a fire', from the verb "žariti" 'to heat (red hot)'. In the 19th century it was known as "Saschar" or "Schaschar" in German.
History.
There is a walled prehistoric burial ground on Gradišče Hill. A school was established in Žažar in 1913. A school building was built in 1927.
Second World War.
The village was partially burned by Italian troops on 9 June 1942. At the end of January 1943 the Partisans attacked an Italian stronghold at the elementary school in Žažar.
Mass graves.
On 2 August 1942, nine civilians from Šentjošt nad Horjulom and other nearby villages were taken to the forest west of Žažar by the Partisans and murdered. Their bodies were thrown into a sinkhole known as the Rupe Mass Grave () on the slope of Križman Peak () near the hamlet of Kajndol in neighboring Smrečje. Another mass grave from the Second World War is located nearby, known as the Koprivnik Mass Grave (). It contains the remains of Slovene civilians.
Church.
The local church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Anne and belongs to the Parish of Podlipa. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1526. It is a Gothic structure with ribbed vaulting. The main altar, dating from 1907, is the work of the sculptor Ivan (a.k.a. Janez) Buh from Vrhnika, and the side altars date from 1836 and 1858. The church stands in the southeast part of the settlement, north of the road. It has protected cultural heritage status.

The Royal-Imperial Route in Poznań (, ) is a tourist walk running through the most important parts of the city and presenting the history, culture and identity of Poznań. The Route leads in a westward direction, from The Church of St. John Jerusalem behind the Wall to the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Florian.
The Royal - Imperial Route in Poznań is an idea of a tourist product that would combine important places and historical monuments of the city. “The Royal - Imperial Route” axis provides cultural, artistic and educational events that integrate the activities of all parties concerned and are the platform for co-operation of various entities: public administration, culture and science institutions, representatives of the academic circle, and tourist organisations. That is why “The Royal - Imperial Route” is Poznań's first complete partner project in which the City Hall motivates the other parties to work for the development of cultural tourism of the city and region.
Historic Reference.
The name of The Royal-Imperial Route has its ground in the history of the city.
“Royal” comes from the fact that Mieszko I’s palatium served as a residence for the first kings of Poland, whose tombs are located in Poznań Cathedral’s crypt. The cathedral is the place of burial of the following rulers:
The Royal Castle (Zamek Królewski), erected on Przemysł Hill (Góra Przemysła) at the end of the 13th century as the largest of its time in Poland, was where Polish as well as foreign kings were frequently received.
Poznań was also an emperors city:
Description of the Route.
The Route shows how the city has changed and developed through the centuries and is as follows: Lake Malta – Church of St. John of Jerusalem behind the Wall – Śródka – Bishop Jordan Bridge – Ostrów Tumski (the Cathedral Island) – Chrobry Bridge – Chwaliszewo – Old Market Square – Paderewskiego Street – Wolności Square – 27 Grudnia Street – Fredry Street – Theatre Bridge – Dąbrowskiego Street – Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Florian.
The full list of Partners.
The Royal - Imperial Route Programme is based on partnership on many levels. The Programme involves Full Partners, Associated Partners and additionally Auxiliary Partners are invited to the individual projects (e.g. schools, auxiliary self-governments, NGOs). All these institutions inform one another about their actions, projects and initiatives related to the Strategy. The Mayor of Poznań controls the proper implementation of the Strategy's provisions.

Against the Dark

Against the Dark is a 2009 American action and horror film starring Steven Seagal and directed by Richard Crudo.
In a post-apocalyptic world, destroyed by a disease, which turns humans into infected strongly resembling vampires, Seagal plays Tao, the leader of a squad of ex-military vigilantes who are attempting to find and rescue a group of survivors trapped in a hospital. This is Steven Seagal's first horror film.
The film was released direct-to-video on February 10, 2009 and was Seagal's first release of 2009.
Plot.
The film begins by revealing that an epidemic disease has overwhelmed humanity, turning nearly everyone into blood-thirsty infected who strongly resemble vampires and zombies. According to the narrator, there is no known cure and very few survivors left fighting "Against the Dark". The first few scenes are used to establish the main characters, with Seagal playing a tough guy in charge of a group of vampire/zombie hunters.
The survivors in the hospital are shown to be scared, isolated and untrusting. As the characters work their way through the hospital, they drift apart numerous times, often getting lost and attacked. To make matters worse for the survivors, a massive army base is planning to "sterilize" (bomb) the area at dawn.
The survivors explain that there is only one functioning exit from the hospital (even though there seem to be numerous entrances through which they entered) and they have to get to this exit before the emergency power runs out and they are shut inside. To make matters worse many of the stairways and elevators are blocked off, forcing them to make their way level by level, finding a way to the next one down to gain the exit. 
Meanwhile, Cross (Linden Ashby) tries to prevent Lt. Waters (Keith David) from unleashing a bombing raid on the hospital. a number of survivors and a hunter are killed and one (hunter) is infected as they make their way out of the hospital. A survivor is captured by a human to be fed on by his infected daughter, but is rescued by Tao (Steven Seagal). As the humans make their way out a horde of infected chase them. As they exit the hospital just in time before the power fails the vampires become trapped inside. The surviving humans then run as jet planes bomb the forsaken hospital.

Affinity electrophoresis

Affinity electrophoresis is a general name for many analytical methods used in biochemistry and biotechnology. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so-called mobility shift electrophoresis, charge shift electrophoresis and affinity capillary electrophoresis. The methods are based on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of molecules (mainly macromolecules) through biospecific interaction or complex formation. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged detergent. Nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods has been used for estimation of binding constants, as for instance in lectin affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. For enzymes and other ligand-binding proteins, onedimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to "rocket immunoelectrophoresis", affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands.

Dixie Gentlemen

The Dixie Gentlemen, who reached some level of prominence during the 1960s, were a bluegrass band whose musical style varied between traditional and progressive bluegrass.
The group were formed as the Country Gentlemen in 1956 in Alabama by banjo player Rual Yarbrough, mandolin player Herschel Sizemore and guitarist Jake Landers. About that time, another group who went by the name of the Country Gentlemen already existed so Yarbrough's group changed their name to the Dixie Gentlemen. Soon, Jake Landers entered military service but was discharged the next year in 1957. During these early years, they toured the south eastern USA and also made personal appearances on both local radio and television stations. Their efforts bore fruit and they made their recording debut in 1959 for the tiny and obscure Blue Sky label. When the fiddler Tommy Jackson was going to record an album for Dot Records, the Dixie Gentlemen were offered to back him up. In the early 1960s, they recorded for the small Time label. Shortly they signed with United Artists Records. The Dixie Gentlemen disbanded in 1966 after having made their last album together with fiddler Vassar Clements and dobro player Tut Taylor. Later, Yarbrough and Sizemore formed the Dixiemen. The original Dixie Gentlemen were temporarily revived in 1972 and in the early 1990s.

Julia Davis (educator)

Dr. Julia Davis (November 20, 1891 – April 26, 1993) was an African-American women who for more than 60 years served as an educational force in St. Louis.
About Dr. Julia Davis.
Born in 1891, Davis graduated from Dumas Elementary, Sumner High and Normal Schools and Stowe Teacher College. She received an M.A. in Education from the State University of Iowa and continued graduate study at Lincoln, Boston, Northwestern, St Louis, Syracuse and New York Universities. From 1913 until her retirement in 1961, she taught in the St. Louis Public Schools. Thirty-five of those years were spent at Simmons Elementary. Among her lifelong interests, Davis pursued research in African-American history. She served actively at Central Baptist church and in national, state, and local Baptist educational programs with the Metropolitan Church Federation. She also served with other civic and cultural groups.
In an effort to raise public awareness of the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, Davis initiated, in 1941, a series of annual exhibits at the St. Louis Public Library. She also published many notable works on African-American history, including a calendar of African-American achievements and a compilation of biographical notes on twenty African-Americans for whom St Louis schools were named.
On November 20, 1961, the day of her retirement from teaching, she established the Julia Davis Fund at the St Louis Public Library. The fund was designed for the purchase of books, manuscripts and other materials related to the African-American contribution to world culture. Thus was initiated the Julia Davis Research Collection on African-American History and Culture. It has grown into a major research collection on the subject. The collection is public and serves a lasting tribute to African-American cultural contributions.
She was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 1981 and celebrated her 100th birthday in November 1991 with a ceremony at Central Library. She died on April 26, 1993.
About the Julia Davis Library.
On April 21, 1974, the St Louis Public Library broke with tradition by dedicating a Branch in honor of a living person. On February 14, 1993, the new Julia Davis Branch was officially opened. Built on a land donated by the Commerce Bank, it houses the collection consisting of books, manuscripts, newspapers, art work and other research materials, which document the history and cultural heritage of African Americans and people of African descent worldwide. Davis' initial gift of $2,500 in 1961 was used to begin the Library's Julia Davis Collection of Negro and African Literature and Culture. She also donated her personal collection to the Davis Collection at the same time.
The ground breaking for a new Julia Davis Branch at 4415 Natural Bridge was held on September 29, 1991. Land for the new Branch, the first Branch of the St. Louis Public Library system to be constructed since 1974, had been donated by Commerce Bank of St. Louis. The building, designed by architect Russell Lewis of By Design, Inc., features a 100-seat auditorium and space for collections of 50,000 volumes. Computers and educational and recreational software packages are available for public use. The Julia Davis Research Collection, now housed at Central Library, was moved to the new Branch when it opened in late 1992 or early 1993.

Bevke

Bevke is a village northeast of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
Bevke was attested in written records in 1391 as "zu Bewkch". The name is likely originally an accusative plural form of a masculine personal name, preserved today in the surname "Bevk". However, derivation from the Slavic personal name "*Bělъkъ" (originally an epithet for someone with light skin) is problematic because the change "-lk-" > "-vk-" did not occur until the 16th century.
History.
In 1782 Bevke had no more than 24 houses. New houses were built as the surrounding marshland gradually dried out. By 1937, the population had grown to 400 people living in 80 houses. This increased to 656 people in 1995, and over 1,000 in 2012.
Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Exaltation of the Holy Cross and belongs to the Ljubljana Archdiocese. The church was recorded as a chapel of ease associated with the parish of Vrhnika in 1689. The village cemetery formerly surrounded the church, but it was discontinued at that location in 1859 and a new cemetery was established to the south in the hamlet of Za Ježe. The cemetery was expanded and a new funeral chapel was built in 1994.

Mvumelwano Mvume Dandala (born 26 October 1951 as Mvumelwano Umdandalaza) is a former presiding bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and a former head of the All Africa Conference of Churches. He was the presidential candidate of the COPE in the 2009 South African general elections.
Background.
Mvume was born on 26 October 1951, the son of the Reverend Killion Dandala, a Methodist minister in the small village of Dandalaville (named after his great grandfather), in Mount Ayliff in South Africa's Eastern Cape, the last born of four children.
He was a pupil at Ndamase High School, near Umtata before attending the Federal Theological Seminary in Alice where he became the local chairman of the South African Students’ Organisation (SASO) where he was involved in the exploration of black and liberation theology and in developing programmes to assist communities with basic amenities such as dams, schools and clinics.
1980s.
He has an MA in Theology from the University of Cambridge.
He became a minister of the Methodist Church of southern Africa (MCSA) in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal in 1978, a post he held until 1982.
From 1983 to 1985 he was Superintendent Minister of the North Circuit of the Methodist Church in Port Elizabeth, at the time the largest Circuit of the MCSA. In Port Elizabeth he participated in reconciliation ministries among warring political factions. In July 1985 when South Africa declared a state of emergency he was detained without trial.
From 1986 to 1991 he was General Mission Secretary of the MCSA. At the Missions department, Mvume was instrumental in launching the Malihambe Missions, what was at the time a dangerous policy of sending black and white ministers to work in pairs.

He was superintendent minister of the Central Methodist Mission from 1992 to 1996, during which he convened the Institute for Evangelism both for the Southern African Methodist Churches and later a Pan African Institute for Evangelism for the Methodist churches in Africa held in Nairobi 1994. This culminated in the founding of the Pan African Methodist Leader’s Consultation, which is held bi-annually.
At the Central Methodist Mission in Johannesburg, Mvume’s mediation and conflict resolution skills were in great demand during the preparation for the political transition in the late ‘nineties. He found himself having to be at the forefront of helping to reduce violence in order to create an atmosphere where elections could happen peacefully. This led – in the years directly after the elections - to his playing a critical role in the disarmament of the African National Congress's (ANC) Self Defence Units and the Inkatha Freedom Party’s (IFP) Self Protection Units in the Eastern Areas of Johannesburg.
In 1996 Dandala was appointed the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa – the highest office in the church. He was subsequently appointed for two further terms.
In 1998 he was appointed President of the South African Council of Churches and again the following year for a second term in office.

In 2003 he became general secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC). His term ended in December 2008.
In May, 2004, he led an AACC delegation to Sudan. His subsequent reportback urged Sudan government to help end hostilities and human rights violations in Darfur, urged the world to keep the whole Sudan in focus beyond Darfur, and said there were strong grounds for investigating and monitoring reports of crime against humanity in Sudan. 1999 to 2009 he was Prior of the Order of St John in South Africa.
He was granted an honorary doctorate in Theology from Cameroon’s Protestant University in 2005.

Arthur Stanley Brown

Arthur Stanley Brown (20 May 1912 – 6 July 2002) was charged in 1998 for the 26 August 1970 rape and murder of Judith and Susan Mackay in Townsville, Queensland. The jury failed to reach a verdict and a new trial was blocked on the grounds that Brown was too senile to be tried again. Brown's arrest attracted wide publicity leading to a witness to the abduction of two children from Adelaide oval in 1973 identifying Brown as the man she had seen. Brown is considered a suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance based on the connections that have been made between him and the Adelaide oval abduction.
Life.
Arthur Brown was born in Merinda, Queensland, on 20 May 1912 and moved to Townsville with his parents when he was four. Following the separation of his parents he moved to Melbourne, Victoria with his mother where he remained until he got a drivers licence when he moved back to Townsville and obtained work as a meatpacker. He was exempted from military service in World War II as his job was listed as a Reserved occupation and in 1946 became a maintenance carpenter with the Queensland Department of Public Works where he was known to his workmates as a polite, immaculately dressed man, who ironed knife-edge creases in his work uniforms. He was nicknamed The Scarlet Pimpernel based on the verse from the play""We seek him here, we seek him there, Those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he in heaven? — Is he in hell? That dammed, elusive Pimpernel"".</ref> as he could be anywhere at any time due to flexible work hours and self supervision.
In 1944 Brown married Hester Porter (Née Andersen) following her divorce and became a stepfather to her three children. According to Hester's older sister Milly, Hester later told her that she was afraid of Brown and that she had caught him molesting a child and was trying to prevent him from being alone with children. Hester once gave a female relative the "prized" lacework she'd inherited from her mother saying that she didn't want "his next lady love to get it". When asked whom she meant, Hester had replied "Charlotte, of course". On 15 May 1978 Hester, by now bedridden with arthritis, died after hitting her head in a fall and Hester’s younger sister Charlotte, who had five children, moved in with Brown. The couple married later that year. Some members of Hester’s family believed Brown had killed her. One relative recalled that Brown wasn't grieving the day Hester died but was "shaking with fright" and looked worried. Brown told family members that he had paid for a post-mortem that found the death to be an accident but investigating police found this to be untrue and believe the family doctor had written out a death certificate without examining the body, which Brown had had cremated. 
In 1982 another of Hester's sisters told her parents that Brown had molested her while a small girl after which many more of the Anderson extended family came forward to say they also had been molested. Following legal advice that taking the matter to court could be traumatic for the victims, the incidents became a family secret. It was not entirely secret as an entry in Christine Millier's diary dated 23 January 1991 and produced at his trial in 1999 reads: ""Kids and I went for walk to Strand. Arthur Brown drove by and the kids called him "rock spider", shouting it out. Eventually they told me what a rock spider was"".
Mackay sisters.
Five-year-old Susan and seven-year-old Judith MacKay disappeared on the morning of Wednesday, 26 August 1970 from a school bus stop from their home in the Townsville suburb of Aitkenvale less than 10 minutes after leaving home.
A search for the missing girls was mounted after they failed to return home after school and continued until the girls bodies were found on Friday in the dry bed of Antill Creek, south-west of Townsville. Susan was found first and a trail of footprints from her body led searchers to where Judith's body lay. It was speculated that Judith had fled while Susan was being killed and had then been run down. A post-mortem revealed that Susan had been raped, strangled and stabbed three times in the chest, possibly after death. Judith had also been raped and stabbed three times in the chest but cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation by sand. Their school uniforms, straw hats and shoes were beside them, with each shoe containing a neatly folded sock while their uniforms were folded neatly inside their schoolbags. The community was outraged with one policeman stating that he wouldn't go home until they caught the killer. The officer slept at the Townsville police station while his wife brought him food and clean clothing. He died of a heart attack two weeks later. Police initially declined to post a reward but after interviewing more than 6,000 men who lived in the area and no progress in the investigation, posted a reward of $10,000 (2011: $101,500) with an offer of a pardon for any accomplice who came forward. 
One witness saw the girls talking to a man in a car at the bus stop at 8:10am. Just after 11am a car pulled into a service station at Ayr, south of Townsville and the driver bought $3 (around 25 litre/ 5 gll) of petrol. The two girls were in the car and the station attendant, Jean Thwaite, recalled the younger girl saying "Are we there yet?" followed by the older girl asking the driver, "When are you taking us to mummy? You promised to take us to mummy." Not long after, Neil Lunney, a soldier recently returned from Vietnam, spoke to a driver who had cut him off. Lunney stated that he saw two girls in Aitkenvale school uniforms in the vehicle and that the driver appeared to be trying to avoid being seen. The evidence given by the station attendant and Lunney were both rejected as unreliable as, in contrast to all the other witnesses who identified the car as "looking like a Holden", they had both identified the car as a Vauxhall and neither were questioned "in depth". Several witnesses reported the girls being driven around in a car. Two witnesses later reported seeing a man walking towards a car from the direction of the murder scene around 1pm that day.
Identification of the vehicle and suspect.
Several witnesses claimed the car "looked like" a Holden EH, two witnesses said it was a blue Vauxhall Victor which was a very uncommon car at that time while a car seen parked near the murder scene was described as an earlier model Holden (possibly a Holden FJ). Despite the various descriptions of the vehicle, the two witnesses who saw the children inside the car gave matching descriptions of the driver, high cheekbones, narrow skull, short dark hair and, as one put it, "Mickey Mouse" ears and both were in agreement that the vehicle had a drivers door that was a different colour from the rest of the vehicle. One of these was to eventually be a key witness at the trial as he identified Brown as the driver with two young passengers that he had argued with over erratic driving that day. Although 28 years had passed, Brown's appearance had barely changed and he was still very much recognisable as the same person when compared to photographs of him taken in the 1970s. This would be a factor in identifying him as matching the sketch of the suspect in the Beaumont and Adelaide Oval abductions.
Inexpicably, the two witnesses who said the vehicle was a Vauxhall, later changed their minds and signed statements that the vehicle may have been an FJ Holden. The Police, believing the car seen parked near the murder scene was the offender's, concentrated on finding the vehicle rather than the driver, no sketch or photofit picture of the suspect was ever released and, despite evidence from the witness who refueled the car that the petrol cap was on the left side which ruled out the vehicle being a Holden, the media only ran pictures of FJ Holdens. 
Police were unable to locate the car at the time and the murders remained unsolved. Arthur Brown, who matched the suspects description and owned a blue Vauxhall Victor with an odd coloured drivers door, was never a suspect in the original police investigation. The evidence given by the two witnesses who identified the car as a Vauxhall was rejected as unreliable solely due to the belief held by police that the car was a Holden. They were never questioned in depth which police later admitted hindered investigations as both were the only witnesses to speak to the suspect while the girls were in the car. 
The Mackay family moved to Toowoomba several months after the murders.
Suspect for Mackay murders.
In 1998, a cousin of Brown’s wife who was now living in Perth, Western Australia, who had been one of Brown’s victims and also had suspicions about his involvement with the MacKay sisters, decided to phone Crimestoppers after they aired a program on the case.
Sergeant David Hickey of the Queensland homicide squad, who was conducting the cold case review of the MacKay murders, returned the call three days later. After interviewing other family members police had 45 cases against Brown relating to pedophilia and circumstantial evidence linking him to the MacKay murders. Investigations continued and evidence accumulated. Brown, who had been working as a carpenter at the MacKay sisters school at the time, had been obsessed by the case, falsely claiming he knew the girls' father and two weeks after the murders he had offered to take two of his wife’s cousins to view the murder site. He had replaced the odd-coloured door from his blue Vauxhall Victor, buried it, then later dug it up and took it to the rubbish tip explaining to his family he did it because he didn't want anyone interviewing or annoying him. Many of his victims were taken to Antill Creek to be molested and one instance was only from where the girls bodies were found. 
Brown had twice previously confessed to the murders. In September 1970, Brown was drinking with 19 year old John White in the White Horse Tavern in Charters Towers. White, who did not know Brown, claimed that Brown had asked if he had been following the murder of the Mackay sisters a few days earlier and had then stated that police were looking for the wrong car and that he had committed the murders. White reported the conversation to the local police who had dismissed the claim after speaking to "Arty Brown". In 1975, Brown confessed to the murders to his apprentice John Hill who said he never came forward before because it seemed totally out of character and he thought Brown was joking. 
Brown was arrested on 45 charges of sexual assault and the rape of six children three to ten years of age and for the murders of Susan and Judith MacKay.
Trial and aftermath.
The trial of Arthur Stanley Brown for the murders of Judith and Susan Mackay, began on 18 October 1999.
Although evidence regarding Brown’s pedophilia had been given at the committal hearing it had been ruled prejudicial at trial and therefore could not be put before the Supreme Court jury, the jury were unable to reach a decision on the strong but circumstantial evidence.
Trial was set for 25 July 2000 where the defense argued Brown was unfit to plead and a new trial was set for 31 July but before it could start newspapers reported "the case did not proceed for legal reasons which cannot be published". The court suppressed release of the legal reasons until July 2001.
In 2001 it was revealed that Brown's lawyer had applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. The jury had rejected the application, but in the meantime Brown's wife Charlotte had referred the case to the Queensland Mental Health Tribunal who ruled that Brown had progressive dementia and was also suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and was thus unfit to stand trial. The Attorney-General lodged an appeal and the court concluded that the Mental Health Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to overrule the jury and commissioned an independent psychiatric report. In July 2001 the report concluded that Brown was unfit to stand trial because he was suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although the psychiatric report could not overrule the courts finding that the trial could proceed, Queensland's Director of Public Prosecutions, Leanne Clare, announced on 3 July that her office had decided not to proceed with the retrial and all charges against Brown were dropped.
Death.
Charlotte Brown died in April 2002. Ostracized by his family, Arthur Brown moved into a nursing home in Malanda, north Queensland where he died three months later on 6 July, officially an innocent man. Brown left instructions that no funeral notices be placed and only one stepdaughter had knowledge of the funeral details. His death was not reported until several weeks after the funeral. Stepson Robert stated "I can't believe such an insignificant little arsehole had such a profound effect on so many people's lives." 
Everybody involved with the MacKay case is satisfied that Brown committed the murders and police have closed the file.
The Beaumont children.
Along with Bevan Spencer von Einem, he is considered to be the best suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance as he bore a similarity to an identikit picture of the suspect for both the Beaumont children and Adelaide Oval cases. Brown is also a suspect in several other child murders and disappearances.
A search for a connection to the Beaumonts was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on his work history such as showing holidays when he may have travelled interstate. Some of the records were believed lost in the 1974 Brisbane flood and it is also possible that Brown, who had unrestricted access to government buildings may have deleted his own employment files. Brown is considered a suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance, based on the connections that have been made between him and the Adelaide Oval Abduction.
Although there is no proof that he had ever visited Adelaide, a witness recalled having a conversation with Brown in which he mentioned having seen the Adelaide Festival Centre nearing completion which places him in Adelaide after June 1973. The oval abduction occurred on 25 August 1973. Another witness who earlier had reported seeing a man near the oval carrying a young girl while another older girl in obvious distress followed, identified Brown as the man she had seen after seeing his picture on television in December 1998 in relation to his arrest for the MacKay murders. She had reported that the man was wearing a pair of horn rimmed glasses which had fallen to the ground, been picked up and placed in a pocket. Brown is known to have worn horn rimmed reading glasses which police consider a significant point in the identification.

Norman Biggs

Norman Witchell Biggs (3 November 1870 – 27 February 1908) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Cardiff and county rugby for Glamorgan. Both Biggs and his brother Selwyn played international rugby for Wales, though they never played together in the same match for Wales. Biggs also played cricket for Glamorgan and in 1893 was part of a team that took on Cardiff in a two-day match; he faced his brother Selwyn, who was a member of the Cardiff team.
Biggs is notable for being a member of the 1893 Triple Crown winning Wales team, being the youngest capped player to represent the Wales international team, a record he held for over a century, and the unusual circumstances of his death by poison arrow.
Early history.
Norman Biggs was born in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs. His father, who lived at Park Place in the centre of the city, was a brewer by trade who owned businesses in Cardiff and Bristol. Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including Lewinsdale School in Weston-super-Mare, before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall, Cambridge, playing rugby for both university teams. It was reported that Biggs should have won a sporting 'Blue' while at Cambridge, but an injury to his ribs ruled him out. As well as a rugby, Biggs was a keen sprinter and he was able to run 100 yards in even time, and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton Monypenny at this distance. On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business. In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against Penarth. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and Cecil, who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season.
Rugby career.
International debut.
Biggs gained his first cap for Wales when he was selected to play against the touring New Zealand Natives in 1888 at St. Helen's Ground. At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old, making him the youngest Wales international, a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by Tom Prydie in 2010. The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over-vigorous play. Biggs himself was described by the press as "palpably nervous" before the kick-off, though many of the backs appeared withdrawn, apart from William Stadden and James Webb appearing calm. Not only did Biggs have the Māori opposition to contend with, the Swansea crowd were also hostile towards their own team, as they felt the Swansea backs should have been selected instead. Biggs, as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff, was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled. Nonetheless, the Welsh team were victorious, with tries from Thomas, Towers and Hannan and a single conversion from Webb. A week later on 29 December, Biggs faced the same tourists, this time as part of the Cardiff team. Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut, but regained his form on the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park. Within 90 seconds of the start of the match, Biggs scored a "sparkling try". Biggs should have scored again, but dropped the ball after crossing the line in the slippery conditions. Cardiff won by a goal and a try to one try.
Home Nations Championship matches.
Later in the 1888–89 season, Biggs was reselected for the Welsh team as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. He was not chosen for the first game of the season against Scotland, but was accepted for the second and final game to Ireland. Under the captaincy of Arthur Gould, Biggs was partnered on the wing by Abel Davies of London Welsh. Wales lost to Ireland by two tries to nil, the first time the Irish had won on Welsh soil. Biggs and Davies were both dropped for the next season.
It took Biggs until the 1892 Home Nations Championship to regain his place in the national team, again he was chosen for the final game of the tournament against Ireland. Although the Welsh backs contained the talents of Billy Bancroft, brothers Evan and David James and Arthur and Bert Gould, the Welsh team were outclassed by Victor Le Fanu's Ireland. It was the first time Wales had lost all three games in the Championship. Despite the loss Biggs was reselected for all three games of the 1893 tournament, all under the captaincy of "Monkey" Gould. In a reversal of fortunes from the previous season, Wales managed to win all three matches, lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Biggs played an important role during the Triple Crown winning season, scoring two tries, one each in the games against England and Scotland. The 1893 away game against Scotland is described as Biggs' best international match and 'his speed and general play were the main factors in securing the first victory of the Principality over Scotland at Scotland'.
Biggs played in two more internationals for Wales, both in the 1894 Championship and both resulted in losses. The first game of the 1894 Championship was against England, and Wales suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24–3. In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded "Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!". In his final game against Ireland, Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three-quarters, along with Tom Pearson, Dai Fitzgerald and Jack Elliott. The very next international saw Biggs' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time, the brothers missing each other by just one match.
International matches played.
Wales
Club and county.
Biggs played for Cardiff from the 1886–87 season through to 1898–99, though not continuously, spending some time in the early 1890s in London. He played in 166 matches for Cardiff, was one of the highest scoring players the club had produced. He scored five or more try conversions in a single match on seven occasions, six in the same season (1893–94), against Gloucester, Bristol, London Welsh, Penygraig, Exeter and Cardiff & D.R.U. The 1893–94 season saw Biggs score 58 conversions, 25 tries and two dropped goals bringing his points tally to 199 points. This remained a club record until the 1972–73 season when it was surpassed by John Davies. Biggs ended his Cardiff career with 107 tries, four less than his brother Cecil.
Biggs played for several club teams throughout his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh. On 24 December 1890, Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff. The London Welsh team produced a 'devastating display' to beat Cardiff by a single try. At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later turned out for Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, and in the same season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians, not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion. The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899–1900 season.
In 1894 Biggs was invite to play for the Barbarians, and on 2 April, he faced Rockcliff, playing alongside his brother Selwyn, who was also making his Barbarian's debut. Biggs played twice more for the Barbarians, both matches against Bath Rugby. In the 1894 encounter Biggs converted a try in a 14-0 victory, while the 1896 match saw Biggs score a try and two conversions in a 13-13 draw.
Later life and military career.
After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Biggs volunteered for active service and was posted as a private to the Glamorgan Yeomanry, which formed 4 Company, 1st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa. Biggs later reflected how life in the Yeomanry was a constant struggle, and he engaged in 57 skirmishes with his unit coming under daily sniper fire. He was wounded near Vrede on 11 October 1900, when he was shot through the thigh whilst patrolling. He was returned to England on the hospital ship "Simla" which left Cape Town 26 November and arrived at Southampton on 18 December. He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant on 16 February 1901. On 17 April he was promoted lieutenant and attached to 4th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry. Later in the year he either received a further wound, or fell ill, since "The Times" reported on 26 September that he had been discharged from hospital and returned to duty in the week ending 8 September. He returned home on the steamship "Goorkha", which left Cape Town on 19 July. He relinquished his commission on 12 September, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant, and permission to continue wearing his uniform.
Biggs was then commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion Welsh Regiment on 13 June 1903. He was appointed an Instructor of Musketry on 10 May 1905, He was then seconded to the Colonial Office and posted to Northern Nigeria as a superintendent of police in a military area on 10 February 1906, by that time he had also been promoted captain. He was killed in 1908 when he was struck by a poison arrow, while on patrol in Kebbi State, Nigeria.

Primitive mantle

The primitive mantle is, in geochemistry, a hypothetical reservoir with the composition of the Earth's crust and mantle taken together.
The currently accepted scientific hypothesis is that the Earth formed by accretion of material with a chondritic composition. Still during the accretionary phase planetary differentiation started, giving rise to the Earth's core, where heavy metallic siderophile elements accumulated. Around it was a (in this stage) undifferentiated mantle, the primitive mantle. Further differentiation would take place later, creating the different chemical reservoirs of crust and mantle, with incompatible elements accumulating in the crust.
Today differentiation still continues in the upper mantle. Reservoirs depleted in lithophile elements are called "depleted", "fresh" undifferentiated parts of the mantle are called "enriched" or "primitive". The last name is confusing but derives from the fact that such reservoirs are comparable in composition to the primitive mantle. Volcanic rocks from hotspot areas often have a primitive composition. Because the magma at hotspots is supposed to have been taken to the surface from the deepest regions of the mantle by mantle plumes, geochemists assume there must be a relatively closed reservoir of very primitive composition somewhere in the lower mantle. One of the hypotheses is this is the so-called D"-layer at the core-mantle boundary.
The "Late veneer hypothesis" suggests that specific materials were added at the surface from extra external sources. There are arguments against this hypothesis

Vision.
Ramon Magsaysay Technological University shall be a university for sustainable development- a learning and resource center for the development of leaders and entrepreneurs responsive to appropriate and emerging advance technologies for the sustainable utilization of natural, indigenous and human resources for community-centered development within a dynamic and ever-widening society.
History.
The Ramon Magsaysay Technological University, a merger of three public education institutions in the province of Zambales, was established by virtue of Republic Act 8498, enacted on February 12, 1998 through the initiative of Congressman Antonio M. Diaz. The University Charter integrated the former Ramon Magsaysay Polytechnic College (RMPC) in Iba, the former Western Luzon Agricultural College (WLAC) in San Marcelino, and the former Candelaria School of Fisheries (CSF) in Candelaria. The strengths of its parent-institutions, which had existed since the early 1900s, served as RMTU’s springboard for its accelerated growth and development.
The RMPC in 1998, which is now RMTU’s Main Campus, was founded as a farm school in 1910. It was converted into a provincial trade school in 1919. Through the years, it metamorphosed into Zambales Trade School in 1933, Western Luzon School of Arts and Trades in 1953, Zambales School of Arts and Trades in 1957, and Ramon Magsaysay Memorial School of Arts and Trades in 1961. It became a DECS-supervised College (RMPC) in 1993 and a chartered state college in 1995.
WLAC, now the San Marcelino Campus, started as a farm school in 1927. It became the Zambales Rural High School in 1933, the Zambales National Agricultural School in 1960, the Western Luzon Junior Agricultural College in 1977, and eventually evolved into a full-fledged state college in 1985. WLAC’s integration into the university system also included its satellite campus in Botolan (1993) as well as its extension classes in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ) Compound (1996–2001) and Subic (1999–2003). The phase-out of SBFZ and Subic campuses gave rise to RMTU-Castillejos Campus starting June 2003.
The CSF-Post Secondary Department, with its component faculty and physical facilities, is known today as the RMTU-Candelaria Campus. Established in 1965, CSF started as a secondary vocational high school and eventually offered post-secondary, non-degree courses under the supervision of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Philippines) (TESDA).
Dr. Feliciano S. Rosete assumed office as the first duly elected and appointed President of the University effective February 12, 2001, the start of the full operation of the institution as a multi-campus university system. With a viable organizational structure, the institution transformed dramatically as it accelerated the full integration of its component campuses. Through strong partnership with the Provincial Government, DepEd and municipal governments, RMTU had established LGU-subsidized satellite campuses in Masinloc, Castillejos, and Sta. Cruz in the year 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Faculty development and infrastructure build-up were intensified. Degree programs increased from 12 to 65 in the last nine (9) years. Enrolment expanded from 2,000 to 8,000 per semester over the same period. Massive scholarships from various stakeholders attracted more and more students. Graduates registered commendable performance in licensure examinations especially in electrical, mechanical and civil engineering and other flagship programs. In addition to its Php 93.0M annual budget from the National Government, income from revenue-generating projects and self-liquidating academic programs reached as high as Php 80.0M per year. Major curricular programs attained various accreditation levels and RMTU achieved an unprecedented Level III-A status under the Commission on Higher Education-Department of Budget and Management-Philippine Association of State Colleges and Universities (CHED-DBM-PASUC) Leveling Scheme. The CHED also listed RMTU as one of the top 30 higher education institutions (HEIs) recognized by the People’s Republic of China, South Korea and other countries.
In terms of research, RMTU contributed to the stock of new scientific knowledge when it won the Regional Best Research Paper Award in Agriculture among 26 CLARRDEC-member agencies in 2008, and eventually emerged as Second Placer among hundreds of PCARRD-member agencies nationwide in the same year. And in 2009, RMTU also won the Regional Best Research Paper Award in energy/industry research among 19 CLIERRDEC-member agencies.
To date, RMTU stands proud with its high-performing seven (7) campuses, 65 degree programs, 8,000 students, 600-strong faculty and staff, and viable international linkages and consortium agreements. A century of visionary zeal, hardwork, dedication and commitment of its founders, pioneering and contemporary administrators, benefactors and other stakeholders has indeed paid off.
First Centennial President's Administration.
Under Dr. Rosete's presidency, RMTU became one of the fastest growing state universities in the country. This was proven when the Department of Budget and Management in 2007 classified RMTU as a Level III-A university, thus leveling with established universities in Metro Manila like the University of the Philippines and the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.

At present, the University has seven (7) campuses situated strategically in province of Zambales which include: Iba Campus (Main), San Marcelino, Botolan, Castillejos, Masinloc, Candelaria and Santa Cruz.
Before the integration of the three state colleges, the Graduate Schools in Iba (RMPC) and San Marcelino (WLAC) campuses established their linkages in consortia with state universities. WLAC operated in consortia with Central Luzon State University while RMPC worked in consortium with Technological University of the Philippines (TUP). After the integration, the University immediately collaborated with Bulacan State University (BSU) and Tarlac College of Agriculture (TCA).
In 2002, under the leadership of the first University President, Dr. Feliciano S. Rosete, the Graduate School operates independently offering graduate programs as follows: Doctor of Education (Ed. D.), major in Educational Management, Master of Arts in Education (MAEd), major in Educational Administration, Master in Public Administration (MPA) and Master in Business Administration (MBA. Later, the Master ofArts in Education (MAEd), majors in English, Filipino, Science, and Mathematics were offered during the Second Trimester, 2006-2007 in response to the call of the Department of Education (DepEd) Superintendent regarding the declining performances of students in the Division of Zambales. In the Second Trimester of SY 2011-2012, Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) has started after the RMTU Board of Regents approved the offering of this program.
The Graduate School recently established its linkages in consortium with other State Colleges and Universities like Bataan Peninsula State University in City of Balanga, offering Master of Arts in Nursing (MAN) and Wesleyan College of Manila and Manila Business College, also in Manila with the RMTU’s Master in Business Administration and Master in Public Administration, respectively.

Samuel Rollin Hesson

Samuel Rollin Hesson (September 29, 1829 – November 19, 1915) was an Irish-born merchant and political figure in Ontario, Canada. He represented Perth North in the Canadian House of Commons from 1878 to 1891 as a Conservative member.
He was born in County Antrim, the son of John Hesson and Elizabeth Dunbar, and came to Ogdensburg, New York with his family in 1831; the family moved to Upper Canada the following year. Hesson was educated in Dundas. The family moved to Stratford in 1843. Hesson worked in the lumber trade and taught school before becoming a merchant. He was named a justice of the peace and also served as postmaster for Sebringville. Hesson was a member of the town council for Stratford and served as mayor in 1875. He also served as a director for the Stratford Gas Company and chairman of the board of trustees for the Stratford, Lake Huron and Georgian Bay Railway. Hesson was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1891. He died in Stratford at the age of 86.

Charles-Louis Philippe

Charles-Louis Philippe, French novelist, was born in Cérilly, Allier, Auvergne, on 4 August 1874, and died in Paris on 21 December 1909.
Life.
Son of a village clogmaker, Charles-Louis Philippe rose from his modest background first to Secondary education via a grant, then to the world of letters. But he remained attached to the class of his birth. He wrote to the bourgeois writer and politician Maurice Barrès: "My grandmother was a beggar, my father, who was a proud child, begged before he was old enough to work for his bread. I belong to a generation which has not yet passed through the world of books. (...) I must remind you that there are in me more imperative truths than those you call ‘French truths’. You separate nationalities, that’s how you differentiate the world, but I separate by class. (...) We have been walled up like the poor, and sometimes when Life came knocking, it was carrying a big stick. Our only resource was to love each other. That’s why my writing is always more tender than my head tells me to write. I think I am in France the first person from a race of the poor to enter the world of literature."
Philippe passed the Baccalaureat in science in 1891, but failed in his attempts to enter the specialist colleges in Paris (École polytechnique, École centrale). He eventually obtained a modest office job in the administration of Paris, which allowed him to settle in the capital and pursue his vocation as a writer. Among his literary friends and admirers would be Paul Claudel, Léon-Paul Fargue, André Gide, Jean Giraudoux, Francis Jammes, Valery Larbaud.
Works.
After a short period writing poetry, he turned to fiction, publishing a collection of overheated tales of “poor love” ("Quatre histoires de pauvre amour", 1897), then two sentimental portraits of village girls ("La bonne Madeleine et la pauvre Marie", 1898), and a lyrical evocation of his own childhood and youth ("La Mère et l’enfant", 1900). A brief liaison with a prostitute inspired his best-known novel, "Bubu de Montparnasse" (1901), which earned him critical as well as popular attention. A provincial novel followed: "Le Père Perdrix" (1902) recounts the painful old age of a blacksmith, and explores the small-town class system. "Marie Donadieu" (1904) returns to Paris to tell a passionate love story tinged with individualism inspired by Nietzsche. "Croquignole" (1906) evokes the stifling office atmosphere Philippe knew well, and which his hero escapes, but briefly, through an inheritance. 
Despite some strong support (notably from Octave Mirbeau), the last three novels failed to win the new Prix Goncourt. He turned next to a fictionalised life of his father ("Charles Blanchard"), but abandoned what was to be a kind of hymn to work shortly before his sudden death, from meningitis, in December 1909. In his last years he had also written 50 entertaining short stories for a large-circulation Paris paper, "Le Matin", which were published in volume form after his death ("Dans la petite ville", 1910, "Les Contes du Matin", 1916). 
Thanks to the efforts of Gide, other occasional writings and two volumes of letters were published between 1911 and 1928 : "Lettres de jeunesse" (1911), "Chroniques du Canard sauvage" (1923), "Lettres à sa mère" (1928). 
L’Association internationale des Amis de Charles-Louis Philippe has existed since 1935 to promote knowledge of his life and work through an annual Bulletin. Secretary: d.roe@leeds.ac.uk.
Of Philippe in English.
Most of Philippe’s works listed above are still readily available in French. Although three novels, "Bubu de Montparnasse", "Le Père Perdrix" and "Marie Donadieu", have been published in English translations, all are long out of print. Though T.S. Eliot prefaced the first English translation of "Bubu de Montparnasse", little has been published on Philippe in English, and nothing in book form.

Oliver Parker Fritchle

Oliver Parker Fritchle (September 15, 1874 – August 1951) was an American chemist, storage battery innovator, and entrepreneur with electric vehicle and wind power generation businesses during the early twentieth century. His initial battery patent was awarded in 1903 and by 1904 he had established what was to become the "Fritchle Automobile & Battery Company" in Denver, Colorado. He was an early adaptor and developer of significant automotive technologies, such as regenerative braking and hybrid drivetrains, that did not reemerge on production vehicles of major car companies until late in the twentieth century. 
Fritchle achieved national celebrity for his 1908 Lincoln-to-New York endurance run in one of the first electric automobile models produced by his firm. He covered the in a stock Victoria Phaeton achieving as many as between charges through extremes in weather, terrain, and road conditions; a remarkable feat with an electric vehicle of that day. The trip journal and photographs subsequently published to promote "The 100 Mile Fritchle Electric" provided unique insight to the state of road and electric power infrastructure within the United States during the early twentieth century.
Early years.
Fritchle was born in Mount Hope, Ohio to a family of Ohio natives. His father was a veteran of the Civil War and a merchant in Holmes County. Fritchle attended local public schools followed by five years at Ohio Wesleyan University and two at Ohio State University where he graduated in 1896 with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. 
He worked as a chemical engineer at the National Steel Company for two years after college. During this time he began experimenting with storage batteries with an interest in improving their suitability for vehicle applications. Around 1899 he relocated to Denver, Colorado and became chief chemist for the Henry E. Wood Company, an ore analysis concern. He worked there for two years prior to joining the Boston and Colorado Smelting Company of Argo as their chief chemist and assayer.
Fritchle Automobile & Battery Company.
He established the "O. P. Fritchle Garage Company" in Denver, Colorado shortly after being granted his first battery patent in 1903. The new firm specialized in sales, maintenance, and recharging of electric vehicles, but also represented gasoline powered lines such as Hammer. He began developing and manufacturing better batteries in order to enhance the range, performance, and durability of his customers' vehicles, but found automobile technology the more limiting factor after several years of battery improvements. The "Fritchle Automobile & Battery Company" was established by 1908 to manufacture vehicles of his own design and by 1917 he was qualified as one of the few automotive engineers in Colorado. 
His first design halved the power consumption, nearly doubling the range, relative to competitors' vehicles. One contribution to this advantage was his successful implementation of what was known then as "electric brakes" and more recently as regenerative brakes. The concept of using the motor to recharge the batteries while slowing an electric vehicle was not new even as early as 1908. However, implementing it effectively in automobiles and trucks was still quite tricky with the technology of the period and required development of a proprietary controller. 
Fritchle produced a number of practical innovations in addition to his battery and vehicle patents, such as one of the first automobile child seats. The "Fritchle Milostat" was a clever solution to the problem electric vehicle operators had accurately estimating the driving distance available from their batteries. It was simply a hydrometer calibrated to display the percentage of charge remaining rather than the normal, but difficult to interpret, specific gravity reading. 
The Fritchle Automobile products evolved over five years from the carriage-like Phaeton to a broad line of cars and a commercial truck. Models made at various times during more than a decade of production included the Victoria Phaeton, four-passenger coupe, roadster, Stanhope runabout, two-passenger torpedo runabout, four-passenger tourer, a luxury five-passenger brougham, and a one thousand pound commercial truck. 
Fritchle took steps to establish a company presence in Washington, D.C. at the end of his 1908 cross-country trip. Additional efforts to expand into the lucrative East Coast market were made in 1912 with the opening of a sales office on Fifth Avenue in New York City and selection of a manufacturing site in Bridgeport, Connecticut as the "International Fritchle Company". However, these did not pan out and Fritchle Automobiles remained primarily a small regional manufacturer through the end of production.
1908 Lincoln-to-New York electric endurance run.
Fritchle's initial series of battery and automobile improvements culminated with production of the Victoria Phaeton in 1908, the twentieth anniversary of the electric car in America. His choice of a competitive cross-country endurance run among electric vehicles as a means for promoting the capabilities of his new product was influenced by the positive effect the annual AAA National Reliability Tour, more commonly known as the Glidden Tour, was having on the durability and perceptions of fuel-powered vehicles. Though it had become one of the most prestigious American automobile events, electric vehicles were essentially excluded by the distances of the daily legs which frequently ran well over .
Challenge and timing.
By September 1908 he had issued a general invitation to all manufacturers of electric automobiles to participate in a trip from Denver to New York with the challenge "to an endurance run between the above named points at a time in the Fall that will be satisfactory and allow the greatest number of entries possible." 
The relatively short time for responses, lack of electric service on the western end of the proposed route, and poor timing for a trip across northern states cast some doubt as to whether he was actually expecting challengers. The failure of any competitors to accept became a fact leveraged in his advertising. 
Less than sixty days from the September invitation, Fritchle proceeded with the trip on his own. Arrangements for re-charging were made by an associate of his firm, W. P. Pfaff, who usually travelled ahead by rail, though occasionally rode in the car with Fritchle. The starting point was moved to Lincoln, Nebraska due to the unworkable distances between charging facilities that still existed further west. The stock Victoria Phaeton was transported to Lincoln and ready to go by the end of October.
Roads.
Fritchle departed from Lincoln at 7:30 a.m. on 31 October 1908. Many of the early inter-city roads in the Midwest had been established along existing railroad lines. His route generally followed the Burlington from Lincoln to Omaha and the Rock Island from Omaha to Des Moines. 
The Nebraska roads and those in western Iowa were especially brutal. Government road programs had not been implemented yet, so both the roadways and any signage were privately maintained, if maintained at all. It would be another two years before local automobile enthusiasts would adopt the western Iowa segment as the White Pole Road. At the time of Fritchle's trip, the route was poorly marked and the deep mud of the "blue clay" roadways difficult to pass. The county and railroad route maps brought for navigation were inadequate. He became lost on several occasions and at times had to resort to following a compass heading or listening for passing trains in order to reconnect with the proper route. The wrong turns, low speeds required for the road conditions, and the need to stop early due to driver exhaustion put him behind schedule. Differences between odometer readings entered in his log and mapped route distances indicated well over of wrong turns between Lincoln and Cedar Rapids, Iowa; most of which likely occurred west of Des Moines.
He drove north out of Des Moines to pick up the Northwestern in Nevada, Iowa and followed it into Chicago. Condition of the roads along the Northwestern were much better and there were several stretches where Fritchle was able to make up time by using high speed. In Chicago he purchased 1908 Glidden Tour (AAA) and White Route (Motor Age) books which were used for the eastern part of the trip. 
Substantial portions of the route east of Chicago were based upon long established pikes and trails that would later form the Lincoln Highway; the most significant exceptions were a more northern route through Toledo in Ohio, a side trip to his home town of Mount Hope, and more easterly roads out of Pittsburgh. He still managed a few wrong turns due to errors in the guides and in some of the places he chose to deviate from them, though the impact in terms of extra miles was much less significant than it had been in Nebraska and Iowa. 
He raised the possibility of differences in roadway design considerations between electric and fuel-powered vehicles on the turnpike east of York, Pennsylvania. He noted that the downhill stops required by placement of all sixteen tollgates in the middle of downgrades significantly reduced the effectiveness of his electric's regenerative braking system.
The press report that he followed the 1908 Glidden Tour route between Pittsburgh and New York was somewhat misleading. Fritchle appeared to retrace the Glidden route in only a few segments of that stretch, mainly in the area of Bedford, Pennsylvania. Close enough for him to emphasize that his electric had been able to traverse roads through the Alleghenys in November that the fuel-powered "Gliddenites" had found difficult to pass in July. He arrived at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Times Square New York at 6:00 p.m. on 28 November 1908.
Highlights.
Fritchle drove the eighteen hundred miles between Lincoln and New York in twenty-nine days averaging close to ninety miles per battery charge across extremes in weather, terrain, and road conditions. The time included about twenty-one days of driving and eight for rest, sightseeing, and visits. Fritchle recorded it as a 29 day trip beginning on 31 October in his journal, but did not seem to object when the newspapers reported it a day shorter beginning on 1 November. 
Required repairs and maintenance were trivial. They included one flat tire on the road out of Chicago, a 150 A fuse that was blown throwing the car into gear from a dead stop on a steep mountain incline, and a new set of camel hair brake linings to replace the ones worn out in the Alleghenys. The brake repairs could have been avoided by installing asbestos linings prior to leaving Denver, but the decision was made to keep the vehicle completely stock.
The Victoria Phaeton had to be towed once in Iowa by a gasoline-powered automobile when an inaccurate distance estimate led to the batteries being depleted two miles (3 km) short of the charging station. Fritchle was later able to even the record by towing a disabled Oldsmobile ten miles (16 km) to service near York, Pennsylvania. 
A wide variety of alternating and direct current power sources were used for recharging. These ranged from a dynamo borrowed from a physician's X-ray machine to a direct connection at a community power plant. Most of the garages he stopped at could safely recharge his vehicle, but in other situations he was often left to figure it out on his own. Fritchle acknowledged that touring in an electric car was only feasible for an "expert electrician" due to the complications of safely recharging from the variety of power sources and connections that existed at that time. He was not trying to portray electric vehicles as practical for cross-country travel, but rather demonstrate that his electric vehicles were as robust as the best of the fuel-powered automobiles. 
Fritchle drove the Victoria Phaeton from New York to Washington, D.C. with plans to continue to Chicago in order to attend an auto show. He and the automobile later returned to Denver by rail.
After "The 100 Mile Fritchle Electric".
As robust as the Fritchle electric vehicles were for their time, initial growth of the electric vehicle segment peaked in 1912 and became a declining niche unable to compete on price, range, or servicing with the substantially higher volume gasoline powered alternatives. A Fritchle hybrid gas-electric model utilizing a four-cylinder air-cooled engine was developed in 1916, but failed to sustain the automobile business. Production ceased sometime after 1917, though the last "Fritchle Electric" may have been sold as late as 1922. 
The automobile business was followed by the "Fritchle Electric Company". This firm developed and sold wind power generation systems into the late 1920s that were based upon the windpumps common on farms and ranches throughout much of North America. He later worked for the Buick Motor Company and remained active in the radio and electric power industries until his retirement in 1941.

Fabia Numantina is generally believed to be the daughter of Paullus Fabius Maximus and Marcia, a maternal first cousin of Augustus. However, it is possible that she was the daughter of Paullus' brother, Africanus Fabius Maximus.
Marriages.
Fabia Numantina was married twice:
Firstly to Sextus Appuleius (III), a half-great-nephew of Augustus, by whom she had a son, Sextus Appuleius (IV), who died young and who Fabia set up a tombstone to as 'last of the Appuleii'.
Secondly to Marcus Plautius Silvanus (II) (praetor 24), the son of Marcus Plautius Silvanus (I), consul in 2BCE, and his wife, Lartia. However, they seem to have been divorced prior to 24, as Silvanus was by then married to a woman named Apronia, who he apparently murdered by throwing her out of a window. 
Shortly after the murder of Apronia, Fabia was "charged with having caused her husband's insanity
by magical incantations and potions", but was acquitted.
Other Children.
It is uncertain if Fabia had any children apart from Sextus Appuleius (IV). One possibility is a young man named Fabius Numantinus, who was admitted to a sacerdotal college in the Neronian era.

Bistra, Vrhnika

Bistra () is a small settlement in the Municipality of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
"Bistra" and names like it (e.g., "Bistrica"), as well as the German adaptation of the name as "Feistritz", are common in Slovene ethnic territory. Such names were originally hydronyms that were later applied to the settlements along rivers or streams with these names. The names are derived from Slavic "*bystrica" 'swiftly flowing river', from the Slavic adjective "*bystrъ" 'swiftly flowing, rushing'. Bistra is named after the Bistra River, a right tributary of the Ljubljanica. The settlement was known as "Freudenthal" in German.
Bistra Castle.
It is best known for Bistra Castle, a large castle and monastic complex which has housed the collection of the Technical Museum of Slovenia since 1951. It contains a number of collections on forestry, carpentry, fishing, electricity, and transport including a large collection of Tito's cars. One of the sources of the Ljubljanica River is right next to the castle.

<doc id="21620577" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21620577" title="Science and technology of the Han dynasty">
Science and technology of the Han dynasty

The Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) of ancient China, divided between the eras of Western Han (206 BCE – 9 CE, when the capital was at Chang'an), Xin dynasty of Wang Mang (r. 9–23 CE), and Eastern Han (25–220 CE, when the capital was at Luoyang, and after 196 CE at Xuchang), witnessed some of the most significant advancements in premodern Chinese science and technology.
There were great innovations in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE – 256 BCE) previous inventions of the blast furnace and cupola furnace to make pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine up to the surface to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.
The quality of life was improved with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century CE had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime "junk" ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with the invention of the seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of "pi", and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.
Modern perspectives on science and technology during Han.
Jin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, assert that the latter part of the Han dynasty was a unique period in the history of premodern Chinese science and technology. They compare it to the incredible pace of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). However, they also argue that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science continued to lack a definitive structure:
From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty). . .Han studies of the Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.
Joseph Needham (1900–1995), a late Professor from the University of Cambridge and author of the groundbreaking "Science and Civilisation in China" series, stated that the "Han time (especially the Later Han) was one of the relatively important periods as regards the history of science in China." He noted the advancements during Han of astronomy and calendrical sciences, the "beginnings of systematic botany and zoology", as well as the philosophical skepticism and rationalist thought embodied in Han works such as the "Lunheng" by the philosopher Wang Chong (27–100 CE).
Writing materials.
The most common writing mediums found in archaeological digs from ancient sites predating the Han period are shells and bones as well as bronzewares. In the beginning of the Han period, the chief writing mediums were bamboo (Chinese: 竹簡) and clay tablets, silk cloth, and rolled scrolls made of strips of bamboo sewn together with hempen string passed through drilled holes (册) and secured with clay stamps. The written characters on these narrow flat strips of bamboo were arranged into vertical columns.
While maps drawn in ink on flat silk cloths have been found in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the earliest known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.
Ceramics.
The Han ceramics industry was upheld by private businesses as well as local government agencies. Ceramics were used in domestic wares and utensils as well as construction materials for roof tiles and bricks.
Han dynasty grey pottery—its color derived from the clay that was used—was superior to earlier Chinese grey pottery due to the Han people's use of larger kiln chambers, longer firing tunnels, and improved chimney designs. Kilns of the Han dynasty making grey pottery were able to reach firing temperatures above 1000°C (1832°F). However, hard southern Chinese pottery made from a dense adhesive clay native only in the south (i.e. Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and southern Jiangsu) was fired at even higher temperatures than grey pottery during the Han. Glazed pottery of the Shang (c. 1600 – c. 1050 BCE) and Zhou (c. 1050 – 256 BCE) dynasties were fired at high temperatures, but by the mid Western Han (206 BCE – 9 CE), a brown-glazed ceramic was made which was fired at the low temperature of 800°C (1472°F), followed by a green-glazed ceramic which became popular in the Eastern Han (25–220 CE).
Wang Zhongshu states that the light-green stoneware known as celadon was thought to exist only since the Three Kingdoms (220–265 CE) period onwards, but argues that ceramic shards found at Eastern Han (25–220 CE) sites of Zhejiang province can be classified as celadon. However, Richard Dewar argues that true celadon was not created in China until the early Song dynasty (960–1279) when Chinese kilns were able to reach a minimum furnace temperature of 1260°C (2300°F), with a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F) for celadon.
Metallurgy.
Furnaces and smelting techniques.
A blast furnace converts raw iron ore into pig iron, which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BCE during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached the bottom of the furnace.
Although Chinese civilization lacked the bloomery, the Han Chinese were able to make wrought iron when they injected too much oxygen into the cupola furnace, causing decarburization. The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and steel by using the finery forge and puddling process, the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near Mount Song of Henan province. The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with refractory bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay. Besides charcoal made of wood, Wang Zhongshu states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were "coal cakes", a mixture of coal powder, clay, and quartz.
Use of steel, iron, and bronze.
Donald B. Wagner writes that most domestic iron tools and implements produced during the Han were made of cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities. During the Han dynasty, the typical 0.5 m (1.5 ft) bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly 1 m (3 ft) in length. The ancient dagger-axe ("ge") made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron "ji" halberds. Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, until the end of the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron. Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the plowshare, pickaxe, spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails. Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, scissors, kitchen knives, fish hooks, and needles. Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron. Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.
Agriculture.
Tools and methods.
Modern archaeologists have unearthed Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.
Alternating fields.
During Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BCE) reign, the Grain Intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) invented the alternating fields system ("daitianfa" 代田法). For every "mou" of land—i.e. a thin but elongated strip of land measuring 1.38 m (4.5 ft) wide and 331 m (1085 ft) long, or an area of roughly 457 m2 (0.113 acres) — three low-lying furrows ("quan" 甽) that were each 0.23 m (0.7 ft) wide were sowed in straight lines with crop seed. While weeding in the summer, the loose soil of the ridges ("long" 壟) on either side of the furrows would gradually fall into the furrows, covering the sprouting crops and protecting them from wind and drought. Since the position of the furrows and ridges were reversed by the next year, this process was called the alternating fields system.
This system allowed crops to grow in straight lines from sowing to harvest, conserved moisture in the soil, and provided a stable annual yield for harvested crops. Zhao Guo first experimented with this system right outside the capital Chang'an, and once it proved successful, he sent out instructions for it to every commandery administrator, who were then responsible for disseminating these to the heads of every county, district, and hamlet in their commanderies. Sadao Nishijima speculates that the Imperial Counselor Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) perhaps had a role in promoting this new system.
Rich families who owned oxen and large heavy moldboard iron plows greatly benefited from this new system. However, poorer farmers who did not own oxen resorted to using teams of men to move a single plow, which was exhausting work. The author Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) wrote in his "Simin yueling" (四民月令) that by the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE) an improved plow was invented which needed only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it, had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil, and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.
Pit fields.
During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE), Fan Shengzhi wrote a manual (i.e. the "Fan Shengzhi shu" 氾勝之書) which described the pit field system ("aotian" 凹田). In this system, every "mou" of farmland was divided into 3,840 grids which each had a small pit that was dug 13.8 cm (5.5 in) deep and 13.8 cm (5.5 in) wide and had good quality manure mixed into the soil. Twenty seeds were sowed into each pit, which allegedly produced 0.6 L (20 oz) of harvested grain per pit, or roughly 2,000 L (67,630 oz) per "mou". This system did not require oxen-driven plows or the most fertile land, since it could be employed even on sloping terrains where supplying water was difficult for other methods of farming. Although this farming method was favored by the poor, it did require intensive labor, thus only large families could maintain such a system.
Rice paddies.
Han farmers in the Yangzi River region of southern China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow for much of the year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.
Mechanical and hydraulic engineering.
Literary sources and archaeological evidence.
Evidence of Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers ("jiang" 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.
Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. As written by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt drive was first used for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles. The invention of the belt drive was a crucial first step in the development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the chain drive and spinning wheel.
The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the "Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital". The official and poet Sima Xiangru (179–117 BCE) once hinted in his writings that the Chinese used a censer in the form of a gimbal, a pivot support made of concentric rings which allow the central gimbal to rotate on an axis while remaining vertically positioned. However, the first explicit mention of the gimbal used as an incense burner occurred around 180 CE when the artisan Ding Huan created his 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions' which allowed burning incense placed within the central gimbal to remain constantly level even when moved. Ding had other inventions as well. For the purpose of indoor air conditioning, he set up a large manually operated rotary fan which had rotating wheels that were 3 m (10 ft) in diameter. He also invented a lamp which he called the 'nine-storied hill-censer', since it was shaped as a hillside. When the cylindrical lamp was lit, the convection of rising hot air currents caused vanes placed on the top to spin, which in turn rotated painted paper figures of birds and other animals around the lamp.
When Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202 – 195 BCE) came upon the treasury of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BCE) at Xianyang following the downfall of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), he found an entire miniature musical orchestra of puppets 1 m (3 ft) tall who played mouth organs if one pulled on ropes and blew into tubes to control them. Zhang Heng wrote in the 2nd century CE that people could be entertained by theatrical plays of artificial fish and dragons. Later, the inventor Ma Jun (fl. 220–265 CE) invented a theater of moving mechanical puppets powered by the rotation of a hidden waterwheel.
From literary sources it is known that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.
Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in "li"). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.
Uses of the waterwheel and water clock.
By the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed various uses for the waterwheel. An improvement of the simple lever-and-fulcrum tilt hammer device operated by one's foot, the hydraulic-powered trip hammer used for pounding, , and polishing grain was first mentioned in the Han dictionary "Ji jiu pian" (急就篇) of 40 BCE. It was also mentioned in the "Regional Speech" ("Fangyan") dictionary written by Yang Xiong (53 BCE – 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical "Xinlun" 新論 written by Huan Tan (43 BCE – 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of Ma Rong (79–166 CE), and the writings of Kong Rong (153–208 CE).
In his "Balanced Discourse" ("Lunheng"), the philosopher Wang Chong (27–100 CE) was the first in China to describe the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.
While acting as administrator of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows of the blast furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.
Although the astronomical armillary sphere (representing the celestial sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power by using the constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted on a set of gears. Zhang Heng was also the first to address the problem of the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.
Seismometer.
The Han court was responsible for the major efforts of disaster relief when natural disasters such as earthquakes devastated the lives of commoners. To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a seismometer in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction. Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern Gansu). Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.
As described in the "Book of the Later Han", the frame of the seismometer was a domed bronze vessel in the shape of a wine jar, although it was 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals. The trigger mechanism was an inverted pendulum (which the "Book of the Later Han" calls the "central column") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism. The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a compass rose, thus indicating the direction of the earthquake. The "Book of the Later Han" states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device. While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider. Since the "Book of the Later Han" states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.
Mathematics and astronomy.
Mathematical treatises.
One of the earliest surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the "Book on Numbers and Computation" ("Suan shu shu"), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was "The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven" ("Zhoubi suanjing"), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the "zhoubi" school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface was added to the text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the "Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art" ("Jiuzhang Suanshu"); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE.
Innovations in the treatises.
The "Suan shu shu" presents basic mathematics problems and solutions. It was most likely a handbook for day-to-day business transactions or affairs of government administration. It contains problems and solutions for field measurements of area, proportional exchange rates for agricultural millet and rice, distribution by proportion, short width division, and excess and deficiency. Some of the problems found in the "Suan shu shu" appear in the later text "Jiuzhang suanshu"; in five cases, the titles are exact matches. However, unlike the "Jiuzhang suanshu", the "Suan shu shu" does not deal with problems involving right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, which demonstrates the significant advancements made in Chinese mathematics between the writings of these two texts.
The "Zhoubi suanjing", written in dialogue form and with regularly presented problems, is concerned with the application of mathematics to astronomy. In one problem which sought to determine the height of the Sun from the Earth and the diameter of the Sun, Chen Zi (陳子) instructs Rong Fang (榮方) to wait until the shadow cast by the 8 "chi" tall gnomon is 6 "chi" (one "chi" during the Han was 33 cm), so that a 3-4-5 right-angle triangle can be constructed where the base is 60,000 "li" (one "li" during the Han was the equivalent of 415 m or 1362 ft), the hypotenuse leading towards the sun is 100,000 "li", and the height of the sun is 80,000 "li". Like the "Jiuzhang suanshu", the "Zhoubi suanjing" also gives mathematical proof for the "Gougu Theorem" (勾股定理; i.e. where "c" is the length of the hypotenuse and "a" and "b" are the lengths of the other two sides, respectively, a2 + b2 = c2), which is known as the Pythagorean theorem in the West after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras (fl. 6th century BCE).
The "Jiuzhang suanshu" was perhaps the most groundbreaking of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE? – 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE – 23 CE). Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the "Jiuzhang suanshu", as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the "Jiuzhang suanshu". While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).
Approximations of pi.
For centuries, the Chinese had simply approximated the value of pi as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With "D" as diameter and "V" as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9⁄16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio. To fix this, Zhang added 1⁄16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9⁄16D3 + 1⁄16D3 = 5⁄8D3. Since he found the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the inscribed circle is √8:√5. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162. After the Han, Liu Hui approximated pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429–500 CE) approximated pi at 3.141592 (or 355⁄113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.
Musical tuning and theory.
Mathematics were also used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE "Huainanzi", compiled by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's Comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.
Astronomical observations.
The ancient Chinese made careful observations of heavenly bodies and phenomena since observations of the cosmos were used for astrology and prognostication. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi was the first in history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as thought in the West after Einhard's observation in 807 CE), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE). Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan province), the "Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images" ("Tianwen qixiang zazhan" 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.
The Han-era Chinese noted the passage of the same comet seen in Persia for the birth of Mithridates II of Parthia in 135 BCE, the same comet the Romans observed close to the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, Halley's comet in 12 BCE, the same comet noted by Roman historian Cassius Dio (c. 155 – c. 229 CE) for 13 CE, and (what is now known to have been) a supernova in 185 CE. For various comets discussed in the Han-era history books "Records of the Grand Historian" and "Book of Han", details are given for their position in the sky and direction they were moving, the length of time they were visible, their color, and their size.
The Han-era Chinese also made star catalogues, such as historian Sima Qian's (145–86 BCE) "A Monograph on Celestial Officials" ("Tianguanshu" 天官書) and Zhang Heng's 2nd-century-CE star catalogue which featured roughly 2,500 stars and 124 constellations. To create a three-dimensional representation of such observations, Astronomer Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) provided his armillary sphere with an equatorial ring in 52 BCE. By 84 CE the elliptical ring was added to the armillary sphere, while Zhang Heng's model of 125 CE added the celestial horizon ring and meridian ring.
Han calendars.
The Han Chinese used astronomical studies mainly to construct and revise their calendar. In contrast to the Julian calendar (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days (like the Julian calendar of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar. Besides the use of the calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems ("gan" 干) and Earthly Branches ("zhi" 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.
Astronomical theory.
Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century commentary in the "Zhoubi suanjing" describes two astronomical theories: in one, the heavens are shaped as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, while the other compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where the heavens are shaped as a celestial sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his "Model Sayings" ("Fayan" 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his "Spiritual Constitution of the Universe" ("Lingxian" 靈憲) of 120 CE. Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a geocentric model for the immediate solar system and greater universe, as opposed to a heliocentric model.
The Han-era Chinese discussed the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, or were they rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that the side of the moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.
In his "Balanced Discourse" ("Lunheng"), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) wrote that some Han thinkers believed that rain fell from the Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.
Structural engineering and public works.
Materials and construction.
Timber was the chief building material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, as well as the often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.
Thatched or tiled roofs were supported by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they were supported by "dougong" brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.
Courtyard homes.
Valuable clues about Han architecture can be found in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.
Chang'an and Luoyang, the Han capitals.
The ruins of the walls of Han's first capital Chang'an still stand today at 12 m (40 ft) in height with a base width of 12 to 16 m (40 to 53 ft). Modern archaeological surveys have proven that the eastern wall was 6,000 m (19,685 ft) long, the southern wall was 7,600 m (24,934 ft) long, the western wall was 4,900 m (16,076 ft) long, and the northern wall was 7,200 (23,622 ft) long. Overall the total length of walls equalled 25,700 m (84,318 ft), and formed a roughly square layout (although the southern and northern walls had sections which zigzagged due to topographical concerns: rough terrain existed along the southern wall and the course of the Wei River obstructed the straight path of the northern wall). The city's moat was 8 m (26 ft) wide and 3 m (10 ft) deep; the remains of what were wooden bridges have been discovered along the moat. Chang'an had twelve gatehouses leading into the city, three for each side of the wall, and acted as terminus points for the main avenues. Every gatehouse had three gateway entrances that were each 6 m (20 ft) wide; Han-era writers claimed that each gateway could accommodate the traffic of four horse-drawn carriages at once. The drainage system included many drainholes that were dug under these gates and lined with bricks that form arches, where ceramic water pipes have been found that once connected to the ditches built alongside the major streets. Only some wall sections and platform foundations of the city's once lavish imperial palaces remain. Likewise, the stone foundations of the armory were also discovered, but its wooden architecture had long since disappeared.
Some sections of the wall ruins of Han's second capital Luoyang still stand at 10 m (32 ft) in height and 25 m (82 ft) in width at the base. The eastern wall was 3,900 m (12,795 ft) long, the western wall was 3,400 m (11,155 ft) long, and the northern wall was 2,700 m (8,858 ft) long, yet the southern wall was washed away when the Luo River changed its course centuries ago; by using the terminus points of the eastern and western walls, historians estimate that the southern wall was 2,460 m (8,070 ft) long. The overall walled enclosure formed a rectangular shape, yet with some disruptive curves due to topographical obstructions. Like Chang'an, Luoyang had twelve gatehouses, three for each side of the wall, while each gatehouse had three gateway entrances which led to major avenues within the city. The rammed earth foundational platforms of religious altars and terraces still stand today outside of the walled perimeter of Luoyang, dedicated to the worship of deities and where state sacrifices were conducted. They were approached by long ramps and once had timber halls built on top with verandas on the lower levels.
Underground tombs.
By the 1980s, over ten thousand brick-and-stone underground Han tombs had been discovered throughout China. Earlier Chinese tombs dating to the Warring States were often vertically dug pits lined with wooden walls. In digging the tomb sites, Han workers would first build vertical pits and then dig laterally, hence the name "horizontal pits" for Han tombs; this method was also used for tomb sites dug into the sides of mountains. The walls of most Western Han tombs were built of large hollow bricks while the smaller, non-hollow brick type that dominated Eastern Han tomb architecture (with some made out of stone) appeared in the late Western Han. The smaller brick type was better-suited for Han tomb archways at entrances, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.
The layout of tombs dug into the sides of mountains typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.
A total of twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates ("que") from the Han dynasty have survived and can be found in the aboveground areas around Han tomb and shrine sites. They often formed part of outer walls, usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the corners of walled enclosures. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.
Boreholes and mining shafts.
On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, scenes of borehole drilling for mining projects are shown. They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes to the surface so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt. The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from 610 m (2,000 ft) below the surface could cause an explosion if it was not properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a draft animal, usually oxen or water buffaloes. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface. Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.
Ceramic model buildings.
There are Han-era literary references to tall towers found in the capital cities; they often served as watchtowers, astronomical observatories, and religious establishments meant to attract the favor of immortals. The court eunuchs Zhao Zhong and Zhang Rang discouraged the aloof Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 CE) from ascending to the top floors of tall towers (claiming it would cause bad luck), in order to conceal from him the enormous palatial mansions the eunuchs built for themselves in Luoyang. It is not known for certain whether or not miniature ceramic models of residential towers and watchtowers found in Han-dynasty tombs are completely faithful representations of such timber towers, yet they reveal vital clues about lost timber architecture.
There are only a handful of existing ceramic models of multi-story towers from pre-Han and Western Han eras; the bulk of the hundreds of towers found so far were made during the Eastern Han period. Model towers could be fired as one piece in the kiln or assembled from several different ceramic pieces to create the whole. No one tower is a duplicate of the other, yet they share common features. They often had a walled courtyard at the bottom, a balcony with balustrades and windows for every floor, roof tiles capping and concealing the ceiling rafters, human figures peering out the windows or standing on the balconies, door knockers, and pets such as dogs in the bottom courtyard. Perhaps the most direct pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature ceramic tower models are faithful representations of real-life Han timber towers are tile patterns. Artistic patterns found on the circular tiles that cap the eave-ends on the miniature models are exact matches of patterns found on real-life Han roof tiles excavated at sites such as the royal palaces in Chang'an and Luoyang, and even the tiles of the original White Horse Temple. The ceramic model towers featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty:
Besides towers, other ceramic models from the Han reveal a variety of building types. This includes multi-story storehouses such as granaries, courtyard houses with multi-story halls, kiosks, walled gate towers, mills, manufactories and workshops, animal pens, outhouses, and water wells. Even models of single-story farmhouses show a great amount of detail, including tiled roofs, courtyards, steps leading to walkways, farmyards with troughs and basins, parapets, and privies. Models of granaries and storehouses had tiled rooftops, "dougong" brackets, windows, and stilt supports raising them above ground level. Han models of water wells sometimes feature tiny tiled roofs supported by beams that house the rope pulley used for lifting the bucket. The ceramic models featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty:
Roads, bridges, and canals.
In order to facilitate commerce and communication as well as speed the process of tax collection and movement of military troops, the Han government sponsored the building of new roads, bridges, and canal waterways. These include repairs and renovation work on the Dujiangyan Irrigation System of Sichuan and Zhengguo Canal of Shaanxi, both of which were built by the previous State of Qin. Accepting the proposal of Ni Kuan (:zh:兒寬), in 111 BCE Emperor Wu commissioned Er to lead the project of creating extensions to the Zhengguo Canal that could irrigate nearby terrain elevated above the main canal. Since a large amount of silt had built up over time at the bottom of the Zhengguo Canal (causing flooding), in 95 BCE another project was initiated to tap irrigation waters from further up the Jing River, requiring the dredging of a new 100 km (62 mi) long canal following a contour line above the Zhengguo.
Roadways, wooden bridges, postal stations, and relay stations were occasionally repaired, while many new facilities such as these were established. As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, yet there is uncertainty over the materials used; Joseph Needham speculates that they were rubble and gravel. The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could pass at once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast. Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as Shanshan (Loulan) near the Lop Desert, while Han forces utilized routes that traversed north of the Taklamakan Desert towards Kashgar. A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the Qin Mountains was consolidated during the Han, known as the gallery roads. During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories in what is now Yunnan in the far southwest as well as the Korean Peninsula in the far northeast.
One of the most common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle beam bridge, described by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge. In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there. Floating pontoon bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.
Medicine.
Much of the beliefs held by Han-era physicians are known to modern historians through such texts as the "Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon" ("Huangdi neijing") medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the "Book of Later Han". It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the five phases and yin and yang dictated their medical decisions and assumptions. The Han-era Chinese believed that each organ in the body was associated with one of the five phases (metal 金, wood 木, water 水, fire 火, earth 土) and had two circulatory qi channels (任督二脉). If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health. For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart—associated with the fire phase—caused one to become sluggish, then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire). The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis, a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted "vital energy" ("qi") and what qualities the latter had, in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering. Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as the proper way to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess. The "Huangdi neijing" noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of circadian rhythm, although explained in terms of the five phases.
In his "Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber" ("Jinkui yaolue"), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150 – c. 219 CE) was the first to suggest a regulated diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi. Zhang's major work was the "Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders" ("Shanghan zabing lun"). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the "Huangdi neijing" and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.
Historical sources say that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first mentioning of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the "Huangdi neijing". Acupuncture needles made of gold were found in the tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the tombs of Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era calisthenics.
Cartography.
Map-making in China preceded the Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, displaying the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues that these are to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE – 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.
In Chinese literature, the oldest reference to a map comes from the year 227 BCE, when the assassin Jing Ke was to present a map to Ying Zheng 嬴政, King of Qin (ruling later as Qin Shi Huang, r. 221–210 BCE) on behalf of Crown Prince Dan of Yan. Instead of presenting the map, he pulled out a dagger from his scroll, yet was unable to kill Ying Zheng. The "Rites of Zhou" ("Zhouli"), compiled during the Han and commented by Liu Xin in the 1st century CE, mentioned the use of maps for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and locations of ores and minerals for mining facilities. The first Chinese gazetteer was written in 52 CE and included information on territorial divisions, the founding of cities, and local products and customs. Pei Xiu (224–271 CE) was the first to describe in detail the use of a graduated scale and geometrically plotted reference grid. However, historians Howard Nelson, Robert Temple, and Rafe de Crespigny argue that there is enough literary evidence that Zhang Heng's now lost work of 116 CE established the geometric reference grid in Chinese cartography (including a line from the "Book of Later Han": "Heng cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it"). Although there is speculation fueled by the report in Sima's "Records of the Grand Historian" that a gigantic raised-relief map representing the Qin Empire is located within the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, it is known that small raised-relief maps were created during the Han dynasty, such as one made out of rice by the military officer Ma Yuan (14 BCE – 49 CE).
Nautics and vehicles.
In 1975, an ancient shipyard discovered in Guangzhou is now dated to the late 3rd century BCE, made during either the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) or early Western Han dynasty. It had three large platforms capable of building wooden ships that were 30 m (98 ft) long, 8 m (26 ft) wide, and had a weight capacity of 60 metric tons. Another Han shipyard in what is now Anhui province had a government-operated maritime workshop where battle ships were assembled. The widespread use of iron tools during the Han dynasty was essential for crafting such vessels.
The southward expansion of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue in what is now modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE — as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs — the Chinese would have been able to brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the "junk" design ("jun" 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.
Although horse and ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China long before the Han dynasty, it was not until the 1st century BCE that literary evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.
Weaponry and war machines.
The pivot catapult, known as the traction trebuchet, had existed in China since the Warring States period (as evidenced by the "Mozi"). It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged. The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated crossbow (and to a lesser extent, the repeating crossbow), first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE. Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able to twist their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow.
The Han Chinese also employed chemical warfare. In quelling a peasant revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows that were used to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.
To deter pursuits of marching infantry or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls with sharp spikes sticking out in all directions) that could be scattered on the ground and pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them.

Morsleben radioactive waste repository

The repository for radioactive waste Morsleben (Endlager für radioaktive Abfälle Morsleben-ERAM) is a deep geological repository for radioactive waste in the rock salt mine Bartensleben in Morsleben, district Börde in the federal state Saxony-Anhalt.
History.
After closure of the salt mining activities Bartensleben was designated as a repository for radioactive waste by the former government of East Germany. Today, the shaft is operated by the "Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Bau und Betrieb von Endlagern für Abfallstoffe mbH (DBE)" under supervision of the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz.
Potash.
The salt mining industry in this region is over a century-old, and started with the first potash mining shaft "Marie" in 1897. Shaft "Bartensleben" started between 1910–1912 and is of current depth 525 m. The mine levels in shaft "Bartensleben" are interconnected with shaft "Marie" at depths 326, 426, 466 and 506 m. The main mine structure is between 320 and 630m depth.
Weapon production and forced labor.
During the Third Reich, from February 1944 until April 1945, forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners from Ravensbrueck, and Buchenwald were employed. From August 1944, 2,500 German, Soviet, Polish, Hungarian and French female concentration camp prisoners, also from the Neuengamme camp, were moved to the Beendorf camp. Initially this was a sub camp of Buchenwald and latterly of the Neuengamme camp. They worked in the salt mine. 
They were forced to work in the underground tunnels of more than 400 meters depth on the production of components for the Me 262 jet aircraft and for rockets, including the V1 and V2. The components included parts for guidance systems. For secrecy the underground shafts "Marie" at Beendorf and "Bartensleben" in Morsleben were named "bulldog" and "polecat".
Site selection.
In 1965 the Staatliche Zentrale für Strahlenschutz (SZS) of East Germany (later: Staatliches Amt für Atomsicherheit und Strahlenschutz (SAAS)) started with a search for a central storage location for all types of radioactive waste. During the selection process, ten sites were considered. Three of them came up for the final selection, which included the shafts "Bartensleben" (Morsleben) and "Marie" (Beendorf). In 1965 the decision was made to select Morsleben as the site for the "Zentralen Endlager Grube Bartensleben" (ZEGB). Important criteria were salt as a disposal medium, the size and availability of underground caverns and the early viability of the mine. The site permits were issued in 1972-73.
Inventory.
The first partial authorization for retrievable storage of 500 cubic meters of radioactive waste from the crowded central storage depot in Lohmen near Dresden, East Germany was granted in 1971/72. These deposits were made due to economic considerations ahead of the conversion operations (deployment authorization of 1974) of the salt mine as a disposal site. In the years that followed smaller quantities of radioactive materials were stored until the commissioning approval in 1978/79. On June 20, 1981 the temporary approval for continuous use was published, followed by the final license on April 22, 1986.
A request for a closure permit, under which the evidence of long-term security had to be provided, was not granted. In the late 1980s the preparations started for an additional approval stage for the storage of high level radioactive waste. In the wake of the unification of East and West Germany the approval process was halted.
In the first storage period from 1971 to February 1991, approximately 14432 cubic meters of intermediate- and low level radioactive waste and 6227 sealed objects with a total activity of about 0.29 P Bq were stored. The waste came mainly from the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant and Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Plant and from the ELBE of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf research reactor. The rest of the radiation and radioactive waste sources were products from the radionuclides used in research, medicine and industry and consisted of about 40% solid waste, particularly mixed and solidified evaporator concentrates, and almost 60% of liquid evaporator concentrate.
In the context of the German reunification the responsibility for the repository was transferred to the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz (BfS). 
In the period 1994 to 1998 approximately 22320 m³ of radioactive waste with a total activity of 0.08 TBq alpha radiation and 91 TBq in beta and gamma radiation was stored in Morsleben. 88% of the waste came from the entire federal territory and the nuclear powerplants in Rheinsberg and Lubmin. 3% of the waste came from the national depots, and a further 9% from research institutions and other bodies. Again it was primarily mixed waste, evaporator concentrates, resins, waste under high pressure and sealed sources. The nuclear industry contributed 138 Million Euro in the period 1994- 1998 for deposit costs.
Altogether, up to the termination of the storage operation in 1998 (including the period before reunification) at least 36753 m³ of low and intermediate level radioactive waste was stored in Morsleben. With an additional 6621 (other sources speak of 6892) sealed sources. The total radiation activity is specified at about 0.38 PBq .
Delayed closure.
The request on October 13, 1992 from Saxony-Anhalt's Ministry of Environment to initiate a planning process under § 9 b AtG for the continued operation of the site from June 30, 2000 onwards was limited on May 9, 1997 to a decommissioning of the repository Morsleben. The Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz notified the planning authority on April 17, 2001 that it irrevocably waived approval of the regulations that permit the continued use of the site and acceptance of other radioactive waste and their storage in the repository Morsleben. The planning procedure for the closure will now be accelerated. Whether it succeeds to stabilize the mine and maintain long-term security is still unclear. 
Since the suspension of nuclear waste storage in Morsleben in 1998 the stability of the salt domes deteriorated to a state in which collapse could occur. Since 2003 480.000 m³ of salt-concrete has been pumped into the pit to temporarily stabilize the upper levels. In addition another 4.000.000 m³ of saltconrete will be used to temporarily stabilize the lower levels. 
The governmental costs for the remedial measures and closure of the mine is estimated at 2.2 billion euro 
. The work is carried out by the Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Bau und Betrieb von Endlagern für Abfallstoffe (DBE). which is 75% owned by the Gesellschaft für Nuklear Service (GNS) with shared owners E.ON (48%), RWE (28%), EnBW (18.5%) and Vattenfall (5.5%).

Halloween Night

Halloween Night is a 2006 American horror film produced by The Asylum. Despite sharing a similar title with the 1978 film "Halloween", "Halloween Night" is itself an original film as opposed to a mockbuster film, for which The Asylum are infamous.
Plot.
The film follows Chris Vale (Scot Nery), a young man who was wrongly convicted of murdering his family in 1982, and admitted into an insane asylum based largely on the fact that Chris had been found at home with the bodies by the police.
After 10 years of life in the asylum, in which he has been bullied by inmates and staff alike for the incident, Chris has now quite literally turned insane and, to prove his innocence, he escapes from the asylum on October 31 to his home, which is now occupied by a new family who are holding a Halloween party.
As the night draws on, Chris attempts to search the house for any clues that will testify his innocence, but in an effort to conceal himself from the partygoers and the authorities who are searching for him, begins his own killing spree that leads to a massacre far worse than the original.

Cholamandal Artists' Village

Cholamandal Artists' Village, established in 1966, is the largest artists' commune in India, whose artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s–1980s), which brought modernism to art in South India. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India, and is shown regularly in galleries across the country; in fact several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America. Situated at village Injambakkam, 9 km from Chennai, India, it has over twenty resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills; they also run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., made by the artists living the village, making the village a self-supporting entity.
The community was founded by K. C. S. Paniker, the principal of the Madras School of Arts, along with his students and a few artists associated with the college. It used the `art-meets-craft' approach where artists made handicrafts for a living even as they pursued their art. By the 1970s, the village became self-sufficient, and grew into one of the most important meeting places for international artists in India, and today, it remains one of the few artist-driven movements in India. Four decades on, it is one of the few artists' colonies in the world to survive successfully and its foundation remains one of the "10 biggest art moments" in India.
History.
Most of the original founding creative artists, painters and sculptors were students and artists associated with the Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai (Madras School of Arts), where K.C.S. Paniker, noted metaphysical and abstract painter, was principal 1957 to 1967. These artists desired to form a congenial space for practising their art; thirty eight of them got together and formed the 'Artists Handicrafts Association' (AHA) in 1963 initially to sell the works of artists.
Gradually the artists started working together, producing handicrafts in their spare time, they were among the first in the country to produce batik fabric, proceeds of their first batik exhibition went into buying the of land in 1966, which was to make up the village. By now K.C.S. Paniker had retired and founded the artists commune in April 1966. It was named after the Chola dynasty, which is known to have encouraged arts and ruled the region, 9-13th century AD; called "Cholamandalam" in Tamil, which literally translated as "The realm of the Cholas,". Chola also lends its name to the Coromandel Coast of Bay of Bengal, which is few minutes of walk away from the village. Another reason was the Paniker was "worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions".
In the same year six artists moved into live and work on their own land. In the 60s, while they could hardly sell their paintings, avant garde wood and leather work, batik, ceramics and metal craft made by them, found a good market, this sustained them for the duration, while the local buyers were familiarized to modernism, which their art represented.
Electricity was provided only in 1968 and till 1972 the mud road ended at Muttukadu. Then situated on a lonely, bumpy road, now known as the East Coast Road highway to Mahabalipuram, from Adyar, and Chennai was still further away, though today due to rapid expansion, it is right at its door steps, and the road is busy with traffic and shops and commercial establishments. Over the years, built their houses, studios, exhibition gallery, theatre, workshop and kitchen, which they jointly owned along with all the infrastructure of the village. Apart from that it nurtured artists such as P.S. Nandan, Haridasan, S. Nanda Gopal, Vasudev, K.Jayapala Panicker, Gopinath, Senathipathy, M.V. Devan and Richard Jesudas. Soon they formed a cooperative to look after the viilage, also built a gallery, which displayed and sold their works; 20% of their sales went to their association ‘Cholamandal Artists Handicrafts Association’, which used the funds for the upkeep of the Village. In time the cooperative became self-sufficient and held exhibition of their work in major cities of India.
K.C.S. Paniker died in 1977, but by this time the village had become self-sufficient, without any government funding, and the module had proven sustainable. Over the years, work done by the artists at the village, initiated a period in south Indian art called the 'Madras Movement', which brought modernism to south Indian art. Progressive Painters’ Association (P.P.A), one of the oldest art associations in India founded by Paniker in Chennai in 1944, after remaining inactive for many year after Paniker's death, the association was revived in 2006, and a new committee formed, it is now being carried forward by artists at the village, and an annually elected general council of members administers Cholamandal. The village still continues to produce artists of great talent such as S. Ravi Shankar, A. Selveraj and Shailesh B.O. amongst many others.
Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art.
During his last days Paniker had offered his oeuvre to the Madras government on the condition that a separate gallery be created for his work, when no response came from the government, eventually the Trivandrum Art Gallery took up the offer, an now houses an important collection of Paniker's work, but the artists at the village wanted a place for displaying all the works of Madras Movement at the place, thus idea of the art museum took place.
The artists raised money from the private sector to found a museum within the village, which would house a permanent collection of artworks representative of the Madras Movement. While the initial design was made by a visiting Dutch couple, the design for the art centre was made by architects Sheila Sri Prakash of Shilpa Architects and M. V. Devan, as project gathered momentum help came in from various artists and corporates alike. Finally after three and half years of construction the building was, and thus started a long search for works that exemplified the Madras Movement, which flourished between the early 50s and the 80s. Eventually about 60 per cent of the works were donated by senior artists and the rest were given on extended loan by art collectors around the country.
The 'Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art' was opened at the village on Feb 1, 2009; it has a 'Museum of the Madras Movement', which display works of all prominent artist of the 'Madras Movement' apart from that of Paniker, including M. Senathipathi, Late A.P. Santhanaraj, P.S. Nandhan, S.G. Vasudev, K.V. Haridasan, Thotta Tharani, Sculptor S. Nandagopal. Apart from the museum and a gallery for Cholamadal artists, the centre has two commercial galleries, 'Labernum' and 'Indigo', that can be rented free of commission charge, an art book store, and a craft shop. Outside it is surrounded by tree-shaded sands which sport an international sculpture garden, displaying sculptures made by visiting artists from across India and the world through the decades 
Facilities.
Today, the village houses a number of art galleries, museums, and an open-air theatre on the site also houses dance and theatre performances. The original Artists Handicrafts Association is still in charge of the colony, and Paniker's son, sculptor S. Nandagopal, is the Secretary of the Village. Out of the original forty artists, many are no more, and some have moved out, only twenty one remain today, and Cholamandal does not accept new members, though it has at least a dozen artists living or working there at any time in the year, plus many artists-in-residence are also at work here.
The village is open daily from 10am to 5pm. It is 10 minute walking distance from the Golden Beach. Local transport is now easily available and the Chennai International Airport the nearest airport.

York St John University Rowing Club

York St John University Rowing Club(YSJBC) has a history beginning in 1852, eleven years after the founding of the institution where it is based. YSJBC is the longest standing club of the university and has an affiliation to the British Rowing.
The club has 50 members and is one of the clubs of the York St John Students' Union. The vast majority of members learn to row on arrival at university. YSJBC welcomes students, alumni and staff to participate in the club.
The boathouse is based beside the River Ouse, opposite York City Rowing Club between Lendal Bridge and the Scarborough Railway Bridge next to the Museum Gardens.
Boathouse and facilities.
The club's boathouse sits on 21 km of row-able water, on the River Ouse; it is approximately 12 km downstream from 'The Split' (where the Nidd and Ouse meet, but where on approaching from York the rivers 'split') and 9 km upstream from Naburn Lock. The stone and concrete boathouse nestles into land adjacent to the Museum Gardens. The building replaced the wooden boathouse at the bottom of Marygate in York during an early heyday for the club in the 1960s at the request of the then St John's College Principal, Canon Lamb, by the George Pace firm of architects, who also refurbished the College Chapel and built a new Chapel in 1966.
Racing.
The club competes at a number of regattas and head races throughout the academic year (September - August). Prior to Christmas the club's main focus is BUCS competition and the York Small Boats Head. These events provide developing crews with the academic year's first taste of inter-university competition and the beginner crews with the first chance to apply what they have learnt in race conditions. The club also sends its athletes to the National Indoor Rowing Championships.
After Christmas, the club enters a number of events during the continuing head season. These include Durham Small Boats Head and a Varsity match against the University of York Boat Club. From 2010 the club has entered the women's and men's Head of the River Races too. Following further training in the Easter vacation the summer sees attendance at the York Spring Regatta, the BUCS Regatta and other regional regattas such as Doncaster, Durham, Bradford, Tees and York Summer.
Kit and blades.
Club members race in a tri-colour kit. It is Royal Blue and Sky Blue and White side stripes. In addition to this, the vast majority of the club own numerous other items of kit including the ubiquitous splash jacket A rowing splash jacket is a wind and splash proof, ventilated, long-sleeved jacket that is designed for rowing and bankside activity. The Club crest is similar to the York St John University crest but includes two rowing blades with the blade colours.
The current blades are Sky Blue with a Royal Blue 'Y" representing the geographical location of the club, York. The previous blades were white with three chevrons; bottle green, gold and black (green nearest the blade tip) on a white background.

British Dragon Boat Racing Association

The British Dragon Boat Racing Association (BDA) is the UK governing body for dragon boat racing as a sport and recreation, recognised by the UK Sports Council.
The BDA controls the sport through its Executive Committee and Council.
The BDA Executive Committee is responsible for the policy, organisation and administration of the sport, at UK level, and for the selection of British crews competing abroad.
As a National Governing Body, the BDA is a member of both the International Dragon Boat Federation (IDBF) and the European Dragon Boat Federation (EDBF).
History.
Dragon Boat Racing first featured competitively in the UK in September 1980 at the Hong Kong in London Chinese Festival. Races held on the River Thames were won by the Richmond Canoe Club in both the Men's and Women's classes. In 1981 racing featured in the World Canoe and Kayak Racing Championships, held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham. The Lincoln Imps crew won this 500 metre event.
The formation of the DBRC (Dragon Boat Racing Club of Great Britain) in June 1985, was the first serious attempt to organise the sport on a national scale in the British Isles. With the three Hong Kong wooden boats imported for the London Festival in 1980, the DBRC raced fairly regularly during 1986/87, and with the support of the HKTA, built the first fibre-glass dragon boat in the country.
After making its debut on the BBC TV's 'Blue Peter' programme, in May 1986 a dragon boat was raced from London to Nottingham via the canal system by a crew of soldiers in aid of charity. The crew paddled 180 miles (including 180 portages for canal locks) in 9 days and raised over £4,000 for Sport Aid en route. In 1986 and early 1987 specialist dragon boat groups were formed in Sheffield, Liverpool and Tyneside (although none of them had dragon boats, at this stage).
In July 1987, following an initiative by the DBRC, these groups came together to form the British Dragon Boat Racing Association – the BDA, which was formally constituted as the governing body for the sport of Dragon Boat Racing in the UK at an inaugural meeting held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham.
The 1st National Championships were held in October 1987 on the Serpentine Lake in London's Hyde Park, where 19 crews contested the 500m races. Elmbridge Kayak Club were the first BDA National Champions over this distance. During 1988 the sport expanded rapidly when over 20 events were held in the UK and the BDA was recognised by the Central Council for Physical Recreation (CCPR) as the sport's governing body and admitted into its membership.
The sport of Dragon Boat Racing was recognised by the Sports Council in 1992 and the BDA as its Governing Body received recognition in 1994.
Lord Sebastian Coe is the current Patron of the BDA.
There are currently over 20 member teams in the BDA National League, these are split into the Standard League and the Premier League [http://www.dragonboat.org.uk]

, is a Japanese owarai duo of as boke and as tsukkomi, formed in 2000. The duo has won 2nd place in the M-1 Grand Prix 2008 competition. As of February 2009, the duo belongs to the management company K Dash Stage Co., Ltd.
Biography.
Formed under the name of in 2000, Kasuga initially was the "tsukkomi" and Wakabayashi the "boke". After almost 6 years of unsuccessful activities, Wakabayashi was one day told by a TV playwright in person that his mate, Kasuga, is as a "tsukkomi", and that he had "better look for another mate". When Wakabayashi tried to explain to Kasuga what he had been told, Kasuga "thought he was just joking." Rejecting the idea but swapping their roles instead, they finally started to make first appearances on terrestrial TV broadcasts in 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way to the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation. After the first session of the final, competed and broadcast live on the same day, they were temporarily in the top position ahead of the other eight duos, but ended up 2nd overall behind NON STYLE.
The manzai performed by Audrey is characterized by Kasuga's trying to shoot "tsukkomi" but each time turning out to be terribly off-the-line "boke", interrupting Wakabayashi's talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. Wakabayashi, on the other hand, either reacts fast and hard with his "tsukkomi" in return, or sometimes just "ignores" him.
In 2009, they were on TV commercials for major global companies such as Toyota Motor, Nintendo and KFC.

Paullus Fabius Maximus

Paullus Fabius Maximus was the elder son of Quintus Fabius Maximus (suffect consul 45 BCE). He had one younger brother, Africanus Fabius Maximus and a sister, Fabia Paullina. Their father died on the 31st of December, 45 BCE.
Paullus was named in honour of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, who was either his natural paternal great-great-grandfather or great-great-great-grandfather.
Career.
The first known post of Paullus was quaestor under Augustus during the latter's travels through the eastern provinces in 22-19 BCE. 9/8 BCE or 6/5 BCE, during which, he minted coins with his own image [http://www.coinarchives.com/a/results.php?search=Fabius+AND+Maximus+AND+Phrygia&s=0&results=100. His last known post was as legate of Tarraconensis in 3BCE.
Paullus was also a member of the Arval Brethren.
Marriage and children.
In the 10s BCE, Paullus married Marcia, daughter of Lucius Marcius Philippus (suff. 38BCE) and Atia (a maternal aunt of Augustus). As a result of her maternity, Marcia was a first cousin of Augustus.
Paullus had at least one child by Marcia, a son, named Paullus Fabius Persicus (consul 34), who was probably born in 2 or 1 BCE. A second child may have been Fabia Numantina, although it is possible that she was a daughter of Paullus' brother, Africanus Fabius Maximus.
Patron of Poetry.
Paullus is mentioned by Juvenal as having been a generous patron of poetry. He is also mentioned (along with Iullus Antonius by name in Horace's third poem (from the year 13 BCE) and hinted at in one of Horace's odes. He is also the recipient of a wedding song composed by the poet Ovid. Ovid also wrote to Paullus during the exile of the former.
A New Calendar in the Province of Asia.
Sometime around 9BCE, the provincial council of the province of Asia decided that it needed to try to find a unique way to honour Augustus. As such, it decreed a competition to find such an honour with the winner to receive a crown from the province. It was Paullus himself, while proconsul of Asia, who came up with the winning proposal, specifically a new calendar for the province of Asia, wherein the new year would start on September 23, Augustus' birthday.
Later Life and Death.
Paullus died in the summer of 14CE.
It is reported by Tacitus that prior to his death, Paullus accompanied Augustus on a secret visit to Augustus' last surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus, where grandfather and grandson were reconciled. However, Paullus is said to have mentioned this event to his wife, Marcia, who, in turn, informed Augustus' wife, Livia. It is said that Augustus was angered by this betrayal of his trust, and that Paullus' death was a direct or indirect result of this.
However, there have been doubts expressed as to the accuracy and truth of this report.
Paullus was succeeded in the Arval Brethren by his son, Paullus Fabius Persicus.

M-Pesa

M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile-phone based money transfer and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India and in 2014 to Eastern Europe. M-Pesa allows users with a national ID card or passport to deposit, withdraw, and transfer money easily with a mobile device.
History.
In 2002, researchers at Gamos and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation, funded by Department for International Development UK, documented that in Uganda, Botswana and Ghana, people were spontaneously using airtime as a proxy for money transfer. Africans were transferring airtime to their relatives or friends who were then using it or reselling it. Gamos researchers approached MCel in Mozambique, and in 2004 MCel introduced the first authorised airtime credit swapping – a precursor step towards M-Pesa. The idea was discussed by the Commission for Africa and DFID introduced the researchers to Vodafone who had been discussing supporting microfinance and back office banking with Mobile phones. S Batchelor (Gamos) and N Hughes (Vodafone CSR) discussed how a system of money transfer could be created in Kenya. DFID amended the terms of reference for its grant to Vodafone, and piloting began in 2005. In April 2007, following a student software development project from Kenya, Safaricom launched a new mobile phone based payment and money transfer service, known as M-Pesa. The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using SMS technology to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money. Users are charged a small fee for sending and withdrawing money using the service. M-Pesa has spread quickly, and by 2010 had become the most successful mobile phone based financial service in the developing world. By 2012, a stock of about 17 million M-Pesa accounts had been registered in Kenya.
The initial work of developing the product was given to a product and technology development company known as Sagentia. Development and second line support responsibilities were transferred to IBM in September 2009, where most of the original Sagentia team transferred to.
Concept.
The initial concept of M-Pesa was to create a service which allowed microfinance borrowers to conveniently receive and repay loans using the network of Safaricom airtime resellers. This would enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to offer more competitive loan rates to their users, as costs are lower than when dealing in cash. The users of the service would gain through being able to track their finances more easily. When the service was piloted, customers adopted the service for a variety of alternative uses and complications arose with Faulu, the partnering MFI. In discussion with other parties, M-Pesa was re-focused and launched with a different value proposition: sending remittances home across the country and making payments.
M-Pesa is a branchless banking service, meaning that it is designed to enable users to complete basic banking transactions without visiting a bank branch. The continuing success of M-Pesa in Kenya has been due to the creation of a highly popular, affordable payment service with only limited involvement of a bank.
M-Pesa is also criticized for stopping the government from getting seigniorage revenues.
Services.
M-Pesa is operated by Safaricom and Vodacom, mobile network operators (MNO) not classed as deposit-taking institutions, such as a bank. M-Pesa customers can deposit and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets acting as banking agents. The service enables its users to:
The user interface technology of M-Pesa differs between Safaricom of Kenya and Vodacom of Tanzania, although the underlying platform is the same. While Safaricom uses SIM toolkit (STK) to provide handset menus for accessing the service, Vodacom relies mostly on USSD to provide users with menus, but also supports STK.
Cost, transaction charges, statistics.
The transaction charges range is from 66% down to 0.16% depending who is involved and the amount of money:
Markets.
Kenya.
M-Pesa was first launched by the Kenyain mobile network operator Safaricom, where Vodafone is technically a minority shareholder (40%), in March 2007. M-Pesa quickly captured a significant market share for cash transfers, and grew to 17 million subscribers by December 2011 in Kenya alone.
The growth of the service forced formal banking institutions to take note of the new venture. In December 2008, a group of banks reportedly lobbied the Kenyan finance minister to audit M-Pesa, in an effort to at least slow the growth of the service. This ploy failed, as the audit found that the service was robust.
Tanzania.
M-Pesa was launched in Tanzania by Vodacom in 2008 but its initial ability to attract customers fell short of expectations. In 2010, the International Finance Corporation released a report which explored many of these issues in greater depth and analyzed the strategic changes that Vodacom has implemented to improve their market position. As of May 2013, M-Pesa in Tanzania has five million subscribers.
Afghanistan.
In 2008 Vodafone partnered with Roshan, Afghanistan's primary mobile operator, to provide M-Pesa, the local brand of the service. When the service was launched it was initially used to pay policemen's salaries set to be competitive with what the Taliban were earning. Soon after the product was launched, the Afghan National Police found that under the previous cash model, 10% of their workforce were ghost police officers who did not exist; their salaries had been pocketed by others. When corrected in the new system, many police officers believed that they had received a raise or that there had been a mistake, as their salaries rose significantly. The National Police discovered that there was so much corruption when payments had been made using the previous model that the policemen did not know their true salary. The service has been so successful that it has been expanded to include limited merchant payments, peer-to-peer transfers, loan disbursements and payments.
South Africa.
In September 2010 Vodacom and Nedbank announced the launch of the service in South Africa, where there were estimated to be more than 13 million "economically active" people without a bank account. M-Pesa has been slow to gain a toehold in the South African market compared to Vodacom's projections that it would sign up 10 million users in the following three years. By May 2011, it had registered approximately 100,000 customers. The gap between expectations for M-Pesa's performance and its actual performance can be partly attributed to differences between the Kenyan and South African markets, including the banking regulations at the time of M-Pesa's launch in each country. According to MoneyWeb, a South African investment website, "A tough regulatory environment with regards to customer registration and the acquisition of outlets also compounded the company's troubles, as the local regulations are more stringent in comparison to our African counterparts. Lack of education and product understanding also hindered efforts in the initial roll out of the product." In June 2011, Vodacom and Nedbank launched a campaign to re-position M-Pesa, targeting the product to potential customers who have a higher Living Standard Measures (LSM) than were first targeted.
India.
M-Pesa, was launched in India as a close partnership with HDFC bank in November 2011. Development for the bank began as early as 2008. The service continues to operate in a limited geographical area in India. Vodafone India had partnered with both HDFC and ICICI bank, ICICI launched M-Pesa on 18 April 2013.
Vodafone plans to rollout this service throughout India.
The user needs to register for this service by paying 200 Rupees and there are charges levied per M-Pesa transaction.
Eastern Europe.
In March 2014, M-Pesa expanded into Romania, while mentioning that it may continue to expand elsewhere into Eastern Europe, as a number of individuals there possess mobile phones but not traditional bank accounts. It is unlikely, as of May 2014, however, that the service will expand into Western Europe anytime soon.
Other markets.
M-Pesa expanded into Mozambique, Lesotho, and Egypt in May, June, and July 2013, respectively. A full listing of countries in which M-Pesa currently operates can be found on M-Pesa's website.
Regulation and KYC rules.
M-Pesa sought to engage Kenyan regulators and keep them updated on the development process. M-Pesa also reached out to international regulators, such as the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) to understand how best to protect client information and adhere to internationally recognized best practices.
Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements impose obligations on prospective clients and on banks to collect identification documents of clients and then to have those documents verified by banks. The Kenyan government issues national identity cards that M-Pesa leveraged in their business processes to satisfy their KYC requirements.
M-Pesa obtained a "special" license from regulators, despite concerns by regulators about non-branch banking adding to the current state of financial instability.

National Premier Leagues Western Australia

The National Premier Leagues Western Australia is a regional Australian semi-professional soccer league comprising teams from Western Australia. As a subdivision of the National Premier Leagues, the league is sits at Level 1 on the Western Australian league system (Level 2 of the overall Australian league system). The competition is administered by Football West, the governing body of the sport in the state. In 2014, the league, formally known as the Football West State League Premier Division was rebranded into what exists today.
History.
Several of the clubs currently playing in the league were formed as the soccer arm of cultural associations of recently migrated Australians, with certain teams having associations with particularly nationalities e.g. Swan United (formerly Swan Italian Club), Bayswater City and Perth SC (formerly Perth Italia) with Italian Australians, Morley Windmills with Dutch Australians, Floreat Athena with Greek Australians, Fremantle Spirit with Portuguese Australians, Inglewood United with Ukrainian Australians, Western Knights (formerly North Perth Croatia) and Cockburn City with Croatian Australians, Shamrock Rovers with Irish Australians, Dianella White Eagles with Serbian Australians and Stirling Lions with Macedonian Australians. In 1994 clubs were forced by the sport's governing body to remove all references to ethnicities from their names, which resulted in several named changes, including North Perth Croatia to Western Knights, Benfica United to Fremantle Spirit, Swan Italian Club to Swan United, Stirling Macedonia to Stirling Lions, Bayswater Inter to Bayswater City, Dianella Serbia to Dianella White Eagles, Inglewood Kiev to Inglewood United and Perth Italia to Perth SC. It is only recently that clubs have begun to be based geographically, with Mandurah City and ECU Joondalup recently established clubs.
In the 2011 season, the West Australian National Training Centre was introduced to the State League Premier Division. They do not play for points and is mostly used for Development of the upcoming youth. Although there has been controversy towards this movement as of the 2012 season it was announced that all games for teams against NTC will now be played for points. This will now enable first teams to put out competitive sides to obtain bonus points.
In 2013 Football Federation of Australia introduced the new second tier competition for football in Australia, the National Premier Leagues. In 2014 Football West then reorganised the former State Premier League league into the National Premier Leagues Western Australia conference and the divisions one and two with a few new teams due to a freeze in promotion and relegation between the NPL and the first division for two seasons until the 2016 season.

The 29 kilometre-long line is one of the new high-speed lines being built to strengthen rail transport system in Italy and in particular freight and passenger transport in Campania. The line is part of Corridor 1 of the European Union's Trans-European high-speed rail network, which connects Berlin and Palermo.
Route and features.
The infrastructure of the new line was completed in April 2008 with its electrification, which operates at 3 kV DC, not the 25 kV AC used on most new high-speed railways in Italy. It became available for training in May 2008 and for public operations in the following month. The line allows the reduction of congestion of rail traffic on the Naples–Salerno coast line, as trains can travel on the new line.
The new line starts at "Roma Est" junction, which allows trains from the Rome–Naples high-speed line to continue south on a branch to "Casoria" junction where there is a link with the main rail node of Naples. The line passes the towns of Volla, Pomigliano d'Arco, Sant'Anastasia, Somma Vesuviana, Nola, Ottaviano, San Gennaro Vesuviano, Palma Campania, Poggiomarino and Striano, through a series of small cut-and-cover tunnels and elevated sections, reaching the commune of San Valentino Torio, where it is currently connects at "Sarno" junction to the end of the line from Sarno.
The Italian government announced in an economic statement in July 2004 that a future high-capacity line would be built from the end of the line at San Valentino Torio to Battipaglia to create a four-track line through Salerno to Battipaglia as part of a project to build a high-capacity trunk line to Reggio Calabria.
The new line will allow high-speed trains to avoid Naples once the section from "Roma Est" junction to the new Napoli Afragola station is open. From June 2008, most Trenitalia Eurostar Italia, Intercity and Intercity Plus trains between Naples and Salerno were routed over the new line, allowing an increase in commuter trains on the old coast line under a project to develop a Campania "regional metro".
Proposed new Vesuvio Est interchange station.
The Region of Campania and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI, the owner of the rail network) have identified the site for the construction of a new passenger station called "Vesuvio Est" (Vesuvius East) in the commune of Striano, which will allow passengers to interchange with the Circumvesuviana Naples–Ottaviano–Sarno railway line. On 30 March 2007 an international competition was launched for the preliminary and final design of the station with a prize of €1,245,000. The estimated cost of the new station is €32.5 million and according to the agreement between Campania and RFI was planned to be completed in 2008 or 2009. The station will have an area of 10,000 m2 indoors and 50,000 m2 in total. Its catchment area will be the Agro Nocerino Sarnese area and the area south-east of Mount Vesuvius, which have a total population of 742,000. It will offer fast connections with Salerno and Naples and eventually with Rome, Battipaglia and Reggio di Calabria.
According to RFI estimates, the new station will be served by about 196 trains a day (52 long distance trains and 144 Circumvesuviana trains, a train every 15 minutes) and will be used by about 10,000 passengers per day, including 2,000 in the peaks. It is expected that about 1,500 non-travellers will go to the station for other reasons as it is planned to provide space for commercial uses, banking, a post office and restaurants. It is proposed to build a 1,000 place car park and areas for taxis and buses to stop; there will also be a possible link with the A30 motorway and the SS268 highway.

<doc id="21621300" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621300" title="Fuck You (Lily Allen song)">
Fuck You (Lily Allen song)

"Fuck You" is a song by English singer Lily Allen from her second album "It's Not Me, It's You" (2009). It is her third international single.
The song became a quasi-gay anthem because of the song's lyrical message. The song was featured in the pilot of ABC's "Suburgatory".
Song.
The song originally appeared on Allen's Myspace page in 2008 alongside the songs "I Could Say" and "I Don't Know" (later released as "The Fear") under the title "Guess Who Batman". The song samples the piano of the theme to the Australian television show Neighbours. The song was written by Allen and Greg Kurstin. Allen wrote: "We are the youth, we can make coolness for our future, it's up to us. Go green and hate hate."
Despite its titular reference to the Caped Crusader, according to "NME" and "Rolling Stone" magazines the song is a George W. Bush protest. At an 2 April 2009 concert at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, Allen stated that the song was about Bush. At a concert in São Paulo, Brazil, Allen stated "It was originally written about this fucking arsehole who used to be the President of the United States of America. His name is George W. Bush."
The "Urban Review" states that it was originally inspired by the right-wing British National Party, adding Allen now "feels the track is relevant everywhere now so has removed a particular target." At the 2009 Glastonbury Festival prior to performing the song, Allen made reference to the elections to the European parliament that had commenced three weeks earlier in which the British National Party gained their first ever representative seats, citing this as a reason to sing the song.
Chart performance.
The song made its chart debut at number 37 on the Canadian Top 100 on 28 February 2009 despite not being released as an actual single. The song also entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 68 on the same week, being her third song on entry.
In the UK the song made its debut on the UK Singles Chart at number 154 on the strength of digital downloads due to the video having a lot of airplay on UK music channels despite not being released as an official single there.
In the Netherlands the song was released as the album's second single and debuted on the Dutch Top 40 on 18 April 2009 at number 23 and has peaked at number three. The song reached number one in Belgium on 6 June 2009. It has also peaked at number four in Finland and Norway, number 18 in Sweden, number nine in France, number 23 in Australia and number 16 in Switzerland.
Music video.
A music video for the song was posted on the official Parlophone YouTube page on 15 June 2009. EMI hired the French production company "Frenzy Paris", who in turn hired the art collective "AB/CD/CD" and the post-production company "Firm". The video is shot from Allen's point of view (she can be seen using a polaroid she takes of herself). She is seen to be making the journey from her hotel room to a television studio. Throughout the video, Allen warps the shape and size of her surroundings using her hands and her own perspective; for example, by moving her hands apart she stretches the Eiffel Tower and enlarges a man's afro hairstyle.
In popular culture.
The song was chosen as the theme song for the TV programme "Periodismo para todos" () in Argentina. "Periodismo para todos" is a controversial Argentine television program that has been labeled as investigative journalism. The song was chosen because it had been used in a telenovela of the state-owned TV Pública, in a satirical Spanish lyrics version. The opening of the show features photos of the audience making the "fuck you" sign.
The song has a medium rotation on radio stations like "La 100", from Buenos Aires (owned by "Grupo Clarín", which also belongs "Canal 13 (Argentina)" who broadcast "Periodismo para todos" weekly). However, it was the second most popular song of 2012 in the chart show TUS 25 () of Tu Dial, an argentinian web radio station based in Mexico. The song was performed by The Sockapellas in the 2012 film "Pitch Perfect".

I-351-class submarine

The was a class of tanker/transport submarines built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. The IJN called this type of submarine . The IJN designed these submarines to support flying boats in forward areas. By the time the first submarine was finished, this capability was no longer needed and she was converted into an oil tanker. That boat, "I-351", was sunk on the return leg of her second voyage in 1945; the second boat was destroyed by an American air raid before she was completed. Four additional submarines were planned, but were cancelled before they were laid down.
Design and description.
The "I-351"-class submarines were ordered under the 5th Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942 to support IJN flying boats in areas where there were no shore facilities and seaplane tenders could not operate. They were designed to support up to three flying boats with fuel, ammunition, water and even replacement aircrew. 
These submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. They had a diving depth of and a crew of 77 officers and enlisted men plus accommodations for 13 aircrew.
The boats had two propellers, each of which was driven by a diesel engine as well as a electric motor. This arrangement gave the "I-351"-class submarines a maximum speed of while surfaced and submerged. They had a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged. This gave them an endurance of 60 days.
The boats were equipped with four torpedo tubes in the bow and they carried four torpedoes. For surface combat they were designed to carry one deck gun, but this was unavailable when the submarines were under construction and three Type 3 mortars were substituted. The submarines were fitted with seven 25 mm Type 96 anti-aircraft guns, in two twin and three single mounts.
The "I-351"-class submarines were initially equipped to carry of aviation gasoline, of fresh water, and either sixty bombs or 30 bombs and 15 aircraft torpedoes. Four of the torpedoes could be replaced by an equal number of reload torpedoes for the submarine.
Construction and service.
Only "I-351" and "I-352" were actually laid down, the other four submarines were cancelled before their keels were laid.
"I-351" was modified before completion into an oil tanker. The boat made one round trip from Singapore, carrying of aviation fuel, and was sunk on the return leg of her second trip in the South China Sea at coordinates by the American submarine on 14 July 1945. "I-352" was 90 percent complete when she was destroyed during an air raid by Boeing B-29 heavy bombers on 22 July.

Akam rushes to Abijot's apartment, but she finds Roop there. After seeing Akam, Roop calls her Mitro. Akam remembers Abijot said that he will call her by Mitro instead of Akam. Then she sees pictures of a girl that looks exactly like her and remembers that Abijot told her he met 2 girls that arent't related but look exactly the same. Akam is confused so she asks who is Mitro and where is Abijot? Roop says Mitro is Abijot's love, and that Abijot went to India. Akam misunderstands and thinks Abijot did a favor on her and went back for Mitro. Roop says Mitro died a year ago and that he went back to meet his sick father. Akam is shocked.
Abijot's engagement preparations are being made until Roop brings Akam up. Everyone is shocked and can't believe this is Mitro because she died. Abijot tells them that this is Akam, and he also tells them that before dying, Mitro said she will meet him again in this birth and here she is. The two families finally realize that two lovers can never be separated and allow their union. Abijot and Akam live happily ever after.

Scottish businessman Norman Loudon purchased Littleton Park in 1931 for use by his new film company, Sound Film Producing & Recording Studios; the facility opened in 1932. The studios, which produced both short and feature films, quickly became successful and expanded rapidly. Proximity to the Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands, which attracted German bombers, disrupted filming during the Second World War, as did the requisitioning of the studios in 1941 by the government, who first used it for sugar storage and later to create decoy aircraft and munitions for positioning in the Middle East. The Ministry of Aircraft Production also took over part of the studios for the production of Vickers Wellington bomber components early in the war.
After re-opening in 1945, the studios changed hands. When Sir Alexander Korda purchased British Lion Films, he also acquired a controlling interest in Sound City and Shepperton Studios. Among the films in which he was involved during this period were "The Fallen Idol" (1948) and "The Third Man" (1949), which was shot both at the studios and on location and has been referred to as the best British "film noir".
In spite of such successes, British Lion ran into financial difficulties in the 1950s when it was unable to repay a 1949 loan from the National Film Finance Corporation and subsequently went into receivership. In 1955, a new company, British Lion Films, was formed and Roy and John Boulting took over at Shepperton Studios. Their comedies, such as "I'm All Right Jack" (1959), were produced there, as were dramas from other film-makers such as J. Lee Thompson's "The Guns of Navarone" (1961). The 1968 musical "Oliver!", also made at the studios, won the Sound Department's Academy Award.
1960s to the present.
Despite the financial ups and downs of British Lion and the changing of hands, the studios remained active until the early 1970s. In 1969, the studios produced 27 films; by 1971, this number had fallen to seven. Production throughout the 1970s was erratic, reaching a low of two films by 1979. Among the problems faced by Shepperton Studios during this time was the desire of new British Lion director John Bentley to sell the grounds for housing, since re-purposing the land would have nearly doubled its value. A compromise was proposed, and in 1973 the area of the studios was reduced from to .
The studio's 1960s credits includes among others Stanley Kubrick's famous Dr Strangelove from 1964.
The studios' 1970s credits include Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), Richard Attenborough's "Young Winston" (1972) and Fred Zinnemann's "The Day of the Jackal". In 1975, the studios were again transferred to new ownership and in spite of sparse production schedules served as the filming site of some high-budget productions, including Richard Donner's "The Omen" (1976), Franklin Schaffner's "The Boys from Brazil" (1978), Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979), David Lynch's "The Elephant Man" (1980), Attenborough's "Gandhi" (1982) and David Lean's "A Passage to India" (1984). In 1978, rock band The Who filmed live concert scenes at Shepperton especially for their documentary "The Kids Are Alright".
In 1984, Shepperton Studios changed hands yet again, coming under the control of brothers John and Benny Lee, who renovated the studios but soon lost control as a result of the "Black Monday" of 1987, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike and internal issues within their company, Lee International. Bankers Warburg Pincus acquired the studios, which became busy with the filming of TV shows as well as such films as Franco Zeffirelli's "Hamlet" (1990), Kevin Reynolds' "" (1991) and Nicholas Hytner's "The Madness of King George" (1994). In 1995, the studios were purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which led to an extensive renovation of the studios as well as the expansion and improvement of its grounds.
In 2001, Shepperton Studios underwent another merger to form part of The Pinewood Studios Group, which also owns Pinewood and Teddington Studios in the UK, as well as Pinewood Studio Berlin in Germany, Pinewood Toronto Studios in Canada, Pinewood Indomina Studios in the Dominican Republic and Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in Malaysia.
Stages and locations.
Shepperton Studios has 15 stages, ranging in size from to , five of which are equipped with interior tanks. Although often described as the home of independent film and TV production in the UK, the studios have also served as a production base for high-budget films such as "" (2011), the filming for which used eight of the fifteen stages. The children's TV series "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends" was shot on the "T Stage" from 1984 to 2008, after which the live action models originally used were replaced with computer animation.
The nearby Little House and surrounding grounds have been used as a filming location for films such as "The Omen" (1976) and "The Young Victoria" (2009). The studios also have two large backlots, which have recently been used to create two castle compounds for the upcoming film "47 Ronin".

<doc id="21621404" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621404" title="Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO">
Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO

The Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO concept is Mercedes' attempt at the alternative fuel movement. The BlueZERO is a flexible concept that has the ability to accommodate the three different types of future alternative fuels: electric, hybrid, and hydrogen fueled. It was first introduced at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show which took place January 11–25. It features a single vehicle architecture that accommodates three models with different electric power-train configurations, each of which are fully developed and ready for testing. The Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO electric drive system gives each model the same performance specifications for acceleration and top speed. The Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO electric drive modular design accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62.5 mph) in under 11 seconds, and the top speed is electronically governed to a maximum of 150 km/h (93.75 mph) in the interests of optimal range and energy efficiency. Peak torque is 320 Nm and as with all EVs maximum torque is available from zero rpm with torque output exceeding the figure achieved by a current V6 gasoline engine at 2500 rpm.
"The flexible BlueZERO concept allows electro-mobility for every requirement and highlights the fact that Mercedes-Benz is the world's only car manufacturer to already have in place all the key technologies for electric cars offering full everyday practicality", says Dr Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars.
The BlueZERO Concept serves as a stand alone vehicle pushing the boundaries of hybrid vehicles and also serves as a launching pad for future Mercedes-Benz hybrid vehicles.
Design.
Leading-edge technology is uniformly and attractively packaged in all three BlueZERO variants. The unique and distinctive Mercedes design idiom displayed by the body highlights the progressive nature of Concept BlueZERO straight away. The powerfully elegant front end is dominated by the radiator grille with its centrally located star. The excellent aerodynamics of the BlueZERO are partly due to the closed front apron, whose design means that cooling air intakes are not required. The 20-inch wheels have also been aerodynamically optimized, while low-friction tires reduce rolling resistance. The striking character lines along the flanks lend the BlueZERO an extremely dynamic side line and accentuate its nature inspired structure. Some argue that Mercedes took a page from the BMW styling handbook with its bionic look. 
The compact rear end of the Concept BlueZERO is characterized by its curvy tail lights. The Mercedes designers have also achieved a new-quality light production: transparent lenses that produce a red light curtain which tapers smoothly towards the sides, creating a lightly diffused effect. This effect is repeated in white by the front headlamps. What's more, the front lights feature new lens technology and a plexiglass edge to produce "C" shaped daytime driving lights with the help of state-of-the-art LED technology.
Translucent surfaces make the normally concealed technology visible. The light-grey tailgate is made completely from lightweight but highly robust Lexan that allows a view of the aluminium structure that makes up the rigidifying frame, for example. At the same time this transparent tailgate provides a view of the vehicle interior, making the advantages of the sandwich-floor platform obvious at a glance: for maximum customer benefit, the luggage compartment and passenger area remain fully usable, since there are no technical components that need to be accommodated here.
Architecture.
The BlueZERO concept is based on a single architecture, a sandwich floor|sandwich-floor architecture, which allows all of the drive components to be located on this sandwich floor design. This makes it possible to obtain a low center of gravity and also leaves ample trunk and interior space. No compromises are made when it comes to passenger space or luggage capacity. 
With all the major power-train components located between the axles, the BlueZERO has achieved an extremely high passenger safety standard which is commonly associated with Mercedes.
Variants.
BlueZERO F-Cell is the fuel cell version. The F-cell would contain a fuel cell and most likely use a hydrogen fuel source, maintaining the green aspect of the vehicle. This will allow the vehicle to attain a range. 
The BlueZERO F-CELL will suit communities where plans for hydrogen fuel delivery capability are at an advanced stage, like in the State of California, or in Germany and France.
Battery electric vehicles.
BlueZERO E-Cell is the all-electric vehicle, with 35 kWh battery capacity (that gives an only-electric range), a compact electric motor of 100 kW (continuous output 70 kW) that is going to be produced in 2010. This all electric version has a range of on a single charge, which makes it ideal for city travel and running errands. 
BlueZERO E-Cell Plus is a series plug-in hybrid vehicle (extended range electric vehicle), that includes an optional use gasoline engine, which is primarily used as a generator to the on-board electric motor, with a range on a single tank and only-electric range. The E-CELL PLUS features a rapid charging option with a capacity of 20 kW, enough power to allow for a cruising range in about 30 minutes. To achieve full electric charge, a little over an hour is needed, which will then allow the BlueZERO E-CELL PLUS to achieve its maximum range of .
They both uses cooled lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Li-Tec that boast a full recharge time of 2 hours.
Color Options.
The Mercedes-Benz designers have emphasised this aspiration by introducing paint finishes in three new ALU-BEAM colours. Each of the three variants makes its individual mark: the BlueZERO E-Cell is painted in a fresh ALU-BEAM Yellow, while the BlueZERO F-Cell has ALU-BEAM Green paintwork. Confidence-oozing ALU-BEAM Orange was chosen for the BlueZERO E-Cell PLUS.
History and the Future.
The BlueZERO was a joint venture partnership project between Daimler and Evonik Industries. Daimler used the battery and hybrid ideas of Evonik Industries to produce this vehicle. Mercedes is also looking into expanding upon the BlueZERO project with an updated F-Cell roadster called the B-Class and will reportedly go into production around this time. It will have its basis on the hydrogen fuel cell model that they think will power the future.
Environmental Impact.
The Mercedes-Benz BlueZERO has a minimal, almost absent carbon footprint. The BlueZERO is similar to many other hybrid vehicles in the fact that it achieves lower emissions and greater fuel economy than its internal combustion engine vehicle counterparts. These environmental gains are achieved by using its electric motor and fuel cell combined to optimize peak power or fuel economy depending on the mode the car is set on. The batteries are also capable of recharging in stop and go traffic due to the on board engine-generator in the F-Cell. The BlueZERO is also able to save energy by shutting down its electric motor when it is stopped, say at a red light.

St. Margaret's Uniting Church

St Margaret's is a Uniting Church Congregation in Hackett, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. 
The soaring spire of the church building it shares with Holy Cross Anglican congregation is a major landmark in North Canberra, at the intersection of the four suburbs of Watson, Dickson, Downer and Hackett.
The church is home to Meg's Toybox, the major toy library for North Canberra, and the Stepping Stones for Life disability support organisation. 
History.
St. Margaret's Uniting Church, together with Holy Cross Anglican Church, are the only remaining congregations from rival denominations in the Australian Capital Territory to continue to share a church, hall and grounds, and on occasions ministers and even services.
The Church was founded in 1964 as a shared congregation of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches in the then newly built North Canberra suburbs of Watson, Dickson, Downer and Hackett. In doing so it predated by over a decade the family of churches it now belongs to, the Uniting Church in Australia, which was formed in 1977 when the Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian churches came together.
Services were initially held in school rooms until the completion and official dedication of the Church building on 1967-12-16.
It faces the Australian Catholic University's Canberra Campus (Signadou), built in 1963 as the Dominican Sisters' Teacher Training College, across Antill Street.
Tradition.
Worship at St Margaret's is in the liberal Protestant tradition of the Uniting Church in Australia.

Dragoynovo

Dragoynovo () is a village in central southern Bulgaria, in the Parvomay municipality of Plovdiv Province.
Geography.
The region of Dragoyna is located where the Maritsa valley merges with the high mountains of the Rhodopes. The Dragoyna peak has two summits - Golyama (Big) and Malka (Little) Dragoyna, with an attitude difference of some . They are connected by a saddle.
As the highest point in the region, the peak has an extensive view. 
History.
The name of the village until 1906 was "Kozluk".
In the 5th century BC, the powerful Odrysian kingdom was established in the Maritsa valley. The kingdom survived for centuries. The region of Dragoyna was probably a local centre of the Thracian aristocracy within the Odrysian kingdom. A high concentration of Thracian "tumuli" has been registered in the area. A golden ring has been found in Ezerovo near Dragoyna bearing an inscription that is thought to be in Thracian using the Greek alphabet. It indicates that the owners of the ring dedicated it to their deceased relatives. A settlement, most probably related to the sanctuary, was located close to the modern village of Dragoynovo.
In the 1st century AD this part of Thrace was added to the Roman Empire, and later it remained a part of its eastern half, the Byzantine Empire. It is known that a town centre, fortifications and churches from the Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages existed in the region. Probably in this period the legend – about queen Dragoyna – was made up.
Culture and nature.
A Thracian sanctuary was discovered on Dragoyna Peak in 2004. The highest part of the peak of Golyama Dragoyna – an area of about 2 dka – is surrounded by a stone wall, which can be seen on the surface as stone ruins four to ten metres in width. The ruins consist largely of local stones with irregular shape, together with some large dressed stone blocks. A concentration of artifacts has been registered on the surface and in the treasure hunters' "trenches" within the area, surrounded by the stone wall as well as north of the stone wall. Pottery and treasure hunters' digs can be found also in an area of about 1 dka in the saddle between Golyama and Malka Dragoyna, where one of the ways to the peak is located. Traces of an ancient road are visible on the eastern slopes of the peak, which offers the shortest way to the site. Some artifacts have been registered on the southeast slopes. The artifact mapping suggests that they were part of the road.

Binignit

Binignit is a Visayan vegetable soup from the central Philippines. The dish is traditionally made by Visayans with slices of sabá bananas, taro, and sweet potato. 
The meat of a mature coconut is grated and the "thick" milk is extracted. Two cups of water are added to the grated coconut and a second extraction is made. This becomes the "thin" milk. This "thin" coconut milk extract is added to cubed "kamote" (sweet potato), "gabi" (taro) and "ube" (purple yam), sliced ripe "sabá" (plantain) and "langka" (jack fruit), and tapioca pearls. Sometimes, young coconut meat strips are also added. The mixture is brought to a boil; being stirred occasionally until done. Just before removal from the flame, the "thick" coconut milk is added.
The people of the neighbouring island of Leyte usually include "landang" (palm flour jelly balls), jackfruit, and anise, and thicken it with milled glutinous rice. The vegetables and the pearl sago are cooked in a mixture of water, coconut milk and "landang", and sweetened by "muscovado" or brown sugar.
The soup is usually cooked and eaten during Holy Week, especially during Good Friday when the faithful are fasting. A popular afternoon snack, it is best served when hot. Some Filipinos serve it chilled or even frozen, eating the dessert much like ice cream.
It is comparable to various "guinataán" (coconut milk-based) dishes found in other regions such as "bilo-bilo". "Binignit" is also called ""giná-tan"" in Bikolano, ""tabirák"" in Mindanao, ""alpahor"" in Chavacano, ""ginettaán"" in Ilokano, and ""ginat-an"" in Hiligaynon.

Comonotonicity

In probability theory, comonotonicity mainly refers to the perfect positive dependence between the components of a random vector, essentially saying that they can be represented as increasing functions of a single random variable. In two dimensions it is also possible to consider perfect negative dependence, which is called countermonotonicity. 
Comonotonicity is also related to the comonotonic additivity of the Choquet integral.
The concept of comonotonicity has applications in financial risk management and actuarial science, see e.g. and . In particular, the sum of the components is the riskiest if the joint probability distribution of the random vector is comonotonic. Furthermore, the -quantile of the sum equals of the sum of the -quantiles of its components, hence comonotonic random variables are quantile-additive.
For extensions of comonotonicity, see and .
Definitions.
Comonotonicity of subsets of.
A subset of is called "comonotonic" (sometimes also "nondecreasing") if, for all and in with for some }, it follows that for all }.
This means that is a totally ordered set.
Comonotonicity of probability measures on.
Let be a probability measure on the -dimensional Euclidean space and let denote its multivariate cumulative distribution function, that is
Furthermore, let denote the cumulative distribution functions of the one-dimensional marginal distributions of , that means
for every }. Then is called "comonotonic", if
Note that the probability measure is comonotonic if and only if its support is comonotonic according to the above definition.
Comonotonicity of -valued random vectors.
An -valued random vector is called "comonotonic", if its multivariate distribution (the pushforward measure) is comonotonic, this means
Properties.
An -valued random vector is comonotonic if and only if it can be represented as
where stands for equality in distribution, on the right-hand side are the left-continuous generalized inverses of the cumulative distribution functions , and is a uniformly distributed random variable on the unit interval. More generally, a random vector is comonotonic if and only if it agrees in distribution with a random vector where all components are non-decreasing functions (or all are non-increasing functions) of the same random variable.
Upper bounds.
Upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound for cumulative distribution functions.
Let be an -valued random vector. Then, for every },
hence
with equality everywhere if and only if is comonotonic.
Upper bound for the covariance.
Let be a bivariate random vector such that the expected values of , and the product exist. Let be a comonotonic bivariate random vector with the same one-dimensional marginal distributions as . Then it follows from Höffding's formula for the covariance and the upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound that
and, correspondingly,
with equality if and only if is comonotonic.
Note that this result generalizes the rearrangement inequality and Chebyshev's sum inequality.

Sites Homestead

The Sites Homestead, also known as the Wayside Inn or the Sites Inn, is located near Seneca Rocks, West Virginia. The log house was built by Jacob Sites "circa" 1839 below the Seneca Rocks ridge. The house was expanded in the mid-1870s with a frame addition, remaining in the Sites family until it was acquired by the U.S. Forest Service in 1968 as part of Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area in Monongahela National Forest. The house had been used as a storage shed for some time and was in poor condition. It was restored by the Forest Service in the 1980s and became a temporary visitor center in 1992 after the Seneca Rocks visitor center burned. It is now part of the Seneca Rocks Discovery Center facility, operated by the Forest Service.

Post-80s

The Post-'80 (also the Post-1980, ) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 to 1989 in Mainland China after the introduction of the One-child policy. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from 23 to 33, making up a major portion of China's young adult demographic.
Etymology.
In English, this group is also sometimes called China's Generation Y after the use of the term in the book "China’s Generation Y" by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981-1995 )
It is a generation of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for consumerism, entrepreneurship, and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an economic superpower.
These people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as computers, MP3 players and mobile phones. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable generation gap between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the Mao Zedong era, experienced famine and political instability and lack proper education because of the policies set forth under the Cultural Revolution, they live in an environment of tremendous economic growth and social change, high technology, and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism.
A clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, career pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of Internet bars each year that prevent the excessive use of the Internet. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from modernization.
Future.
The Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, consumerism, modernization, and technology.
Little emperors.
Some parents over-indulge their only child. The media referred to the indulged children in one-child families as "little emperors" (xiaohuangdi 小皇帝). Many Chinese families the 4-2-1 format, 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child, takes place, resulting with a child has no siblings to compete with.Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.
Almost all Chinese families usually put a set of traditional Confuciansim values to teach their only child. Because the Confuciansim is considering Ren (love and social responsibility) the core reliogional emotion that transferring other moral conceptions into personal motivation. So the child may have received too much love but also been high mental and physical restrictions due to heavy school work, because the economic future of the family depends on the success of the single child. Such a situation would directly lead to a situation that are often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children and would been reversing the traditional Chinese Confuciansim value of Ren (love and social responsibility仁) and some filial piety (xiao 孝) There are also evidents that many young Chinese feel a heavy burden and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family.
Depending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confuciansim codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor to develop self-discipline.
While being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have sibling who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficultes as the child grows. 'Lacking adapting capabilities"(meiyou shiying nengli) is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation. Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient.
Having grown up in times of modern consumerism and popular media, rather than the ideals of the cultural revolution, many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus a cornerstone of retail sales. Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistc sphere, while poorer families often still put efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc.
Post-'80 in Hong Kong.
Post-'80 in Hong Kong and the after-eighty generation in mainland China are for the most part different. The term Post-'80 (八十後) came into use in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2010, particularly during the course of the opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, during which a group of young activists came to the forefront of the Hong Kong political scene. They are said to be "post-materialist" in outlook, and they are particularly vocal in issues such as urban development, culture and heritage, and political reform. Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of Lee Tung Street, the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented Kowloon West Art district. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as anti-colonialism, sustainable development, and democracy.

Old Icelandic Homily Book

The Old Icelandic Homily Book (Stock. Perg. 4to no. 15), also known as the Stockholm Homily Book, is one of two main collections of Old West Norse sermons; the other being the Old Norwegian Homily Book (AM 619 4to), with which it shares eleven texts. Written in around 1200, and both based on earlier exemplars, together they represent some of the oldest examples of Old West Norse prose. 
The Old Icelandic Homily Book (OIHB) contains 62 texts and parts of texts, 50 of which are homilies. For this reason it is better considered a homiletic hand-book rather than a homiliary. Further, the ‘homilies’ it contains, as with most Old Norse homilies, conform more closely to the definition of sermons. The other texts are wide-ranging and include excerpts from Stephanus saga, a translation of part of pseudo-Ambrose’s Acta Sancti Sebastiani, and a fragment of a text dealing with musical theory, amongst others.
History.
Nothing of the history of the OIHB is known for certain until 1682 when it was bought by Jón Eggertsson for the Swedish College of Antiquities. In 1789 it was moved, along with the other manuscripts of the college, to the Royal Library of Sweden.
The manuscript has been variously dated between the end of the 12th century and the middle of the 13th century, but it is now generally accepted that it was written ‘around 1200’. Both the handwriting and orthography confirm that the manuscript was written in Iceland.
Description of the manuscript.
The manuscript is written on 102 leaves of parchment, bound in a sealskin cover, which folds over in a flap at the front. Both the front cover and the flap have a number of signs carved into them, most of which can be identified as runes. The back cover has three signs which appear to be in Gothic script.
The text is predominantly in Carolingian minuscule script with insular thorn and wynn, written in brown ink. There are a number of headings in red ink and occasionally the first word of a sermon has been filled in with red ink. There are numerous marginal entries; some contemporary with the manuscript and others dating from the 16th – 19th centuries.
There a number of very early alterations to the manuscript which appear to date from a controversy between Theodor Wisén, the text's first editor, and Ludvig Larsson, who published a study which contained nearly 2000 corrections of Wisén’s edition. Linbald (1975) concluded that in almost 1200 instances Larsson’s readings were correct and in around 150 cases, his readings were incorrect. But in the majority of the instances where Larsson’s readings seem to be incorrect, there have been alterations to the text: identified as very young by the “shape of additions, ink and the quality of pen used”.
Page 77v has three drawings: two lions engraved by dry-point and an ink drawing of a man pointing with his hand. The clearest lion is of Romanesque-type and has been dated to the first part of the 13th century.
There has been much debate concerning the number of hands involved in the writing of the manuscript, with opinions ranging from 1 to 14. The two most recent studies quoted by van Leuwen, (Rode 1974) and (Westlund 1974) place the number of hands at 14 and 12 respectively. Van Leuwen states that she is drawn to there being only one hand involved. Stefán Karlsson similarly holds this view.
Contents.
The OIHB is principally distinct from the Old Norwegian Homily Book (ONHB) in that unlike the latter it is not arranged according to the church year. The source material for the OIHB has been traced to a number of the Church Fathers, though a full study of the sources has yet to be carried out. However, the OIHB also made use of material available in other homiliaries. For example, it contains a close translation a sermon included in the “Pembroke-type homilary”: a Carolingian preacher’s anthology. 
The style of the OIHB is closer to that of the Íslendingasögur than the Latinate vocabulary and syntax of later Old West Norse religious prose. It makes use of abrupt changes in tense and from indirect to direct speech, particularly in paraphrases of the gospels. It occasionally uses “native proverbs and everyday similitudes” which contribute to its simple, practical style. However, rhetorical devices are sometimes used to achieve a high style and some sentences can be scanned as verse.
Of the 11 sermons in the OIHB and ONHB have in common, two are found in what is possibly the oldest Icelandic manuscript fragment, AM 237a fol: dated to 1150. These texts are the ‘Stave-church Homily’ and a sermon for St. Michael’s Day. Indrebø has shown that the 11 sermons in common are copies of copies, at least. Similarly, he concluded that AM 237a fol is a copy of a copy, and was itself probably a remnant of a homiliary itself. This implies that at least some material in the manuscript belongs to before 1150. 
As well as sermons found in the ONHB and AM 237a fol, some sermons feature in other Old Norse manuscripts such as Hauksbók.

Alfred George Gardiner

Alfred George Gardiner (1865–1946) was a British journalist and author. His essays, written under the pen-name Alpha of the Plough, are highly regarded. He was also Chairman of the National Anti-Sweating League, a pressure group which campaigned for a minimum wage in industry.
Early life.
Gardiner was born in Chelmsford, the son of a cabinet-maker and alcoholic. As a boy he worked at the "Chelmsford Chronicle" and the "Bournemouth Directory". He joined the "Northern Daily Telegraph" in 1887 which had been founded the year before by Thomas Purvis Ritzema. In 1899, he was appointed editor of the "Blackburn Weekly Telegraph".
Editor of the "Daily News".
In 1902 Ritzema was named general manager of the "Daily News". Needing an editor, he turned to his young protégé to fill the role. The choice soon proved a great success; under Gardiner's direction, it became one of the leading liberal journals its day, as he improved its coverage of both the news and literary matters while crusading against social injustices. Yet while circulation rose from 80,000 when he joined the paper to 151,000 in 1907 and 400,000 with the introduction of a Manchester edition in 1909, the paper continued to run at a loss.
Though close to the owner of the "Daily News", George Cadbury, Gardiner resigned in 1919 over a disagreement with him over Gardiner's opposition to David Lloyd George.
Essayist.
From 1915 he contributed to "The Star" under the pseudonym Alpha of the Plough. At the time "The Star" had several anonymous essayists whose pseudonyms were the names of stars. Invited to choose the name of a star as a pseudonym he chose the name of the brightest (alpha) star in the constellation "the Plough." His essays are uniformly elegant, graceful and humorous. His uniqueness lay in his ability to teach the basic truths of life in an easy and amusing manner. "The Pillars of Society", "Pebbles on the Shore", "Many Furrows" and "Leaves in the Wind" are some of his best known writings.
The end of the essay "The Vanity of Old Age" is typically neat: "For Nature is a cunning nurse. She gives us lollipops all the way, and when the lollipop of hope and the lollipop of achievement are done, she gently inserts in our toothless gums the lollipop of remembrance. And with that pleasant vanity we are soothed to sleep."

Core area network

A core area network (CAN) is an island network that exists within both LANs and WANs offering both collaboration and hard security within the domain. The configuration of a CAN structure is done using existing hard and soft technologies. And depends more upon configuration and architecture than do some new technologies. The use of soft layering is important, but CANs can be configured without them. 
A CAN environment is set up using traditional IP and subnet partitioning with forward and reverse lookups, and port redirection rather than software solutions such as active directory. A core is configured as a single entity network, and then additional cores are added, both as an Island LAN, then with links to other cores by IP configuration. Access is controlled by traditional NAC packages.
An advantage of CANs is that the network architect and engineer have greater control over network security and configuration isolation rather than software isolation, leaving the core less vulnerable to attack.

Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary

The Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary is a project to compile a comprehensive dictionary of the Sumerian language. It is run out of the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and funded by both private donors and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The project began under the direction of Åke W. Sjöberg and Erle Leichty in 1974 and was modeled on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, itself begun in 1921. In 1976 it received its first federal funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and in 1984 published its first section for the letter B; only 750 copies were originally printed, but more were soon published as the first batch sold out surprisingly quickly at US$40 a piece. As of 1989 Sjöberg was still project director, and despite retiring in 1996 continues to contribute.
In 1991 Steve Tinney joined the project, and several years later decided to reconfigure the project from an envisioned 18-volume series into an online electronic dictionary that could be progressively updated. The new, online format was named the "electronic Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary," or ePSD. Many shorter definitions were added as opposed to the original format of long entries in the printed A and B volumes. The data sets from several other projects attempting to put Sumerian texts in electronic form on the Internet are expected to be eventually integrated into the dictionary project. In July 2002, Tinney became the project's director.
As of April 2002 the project had received a new two-year US$302,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, though Tinney subsequently stated that because the dictionary project had changed into more of a process with no end date, they could no longer ask for federal funds, and instead would try to establish two permanent research positions for the dictionary with US$3,000,000 in donations.

<doc id="21621677" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621677" title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology">
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is a staff division of the Office of the Secretary, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ONC leads national health IT efforts, charged as the principal federal entity to coordinate nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health information technology and the electronic exchange of health information. 
The position of National Coordinator was created in 2004, through an Executive Order, and legislatively mandated in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009.
Mission.
With the passage of the HITECH Act, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is charged with building an interoperable, private and secure nationwide health information system and supporting the widespread, meaningful use of health information technology.
'"ONC’s mission is looking ahead as it begins its second decade in 2014.
ONC is working to improve these five areas:"'
The concerted initiative on interoperability in 2014 seeks to achieve the ability of two or more systems to exchange health information and use the information once it is received.
The mission of ONC is to optimize the paths to reach these five health IT goals along with interoperability to support the Triple Aim. Widely adopted by the healthcare sector, the Triple Aim was developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to 1) improve patient experience of care, 2) improve the health of populations, and 3) reduce per capita costs of healthcare.
The Federal Health IT Strategic Plan from 2011-2015 had set these five goals"'
In its ongoing work, ONC is looking to address these priorities in 2014:
"ONC's mission had previously been described as"
Leadership.
Physician and public health leader Karen DeSalvo, MD, MPH, MSc, became National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in January 2014, after serving as Health Commissioner for the City of New Orleans and Senior Health Policy Advisor to New Orleans Mayor Mitchell Landrieu. The role of National Coordinator is responsible for developing and executing the nation's Health Information Technology agenda. In New Orleans Dr. DeSalvo modernized and improved the effectiveness of the health department, and restored health care to devastated areas of the city, including leading the establishment of a public hospital. Prior to joining the Mayor’s administration, DeSalvo was a professor of medicine and vice dean for community affairs and health policy at Tulane University School of Medicine.
The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT had been previously led by physician and public health expert Farzad Mostashari from early 2011 until October, 2013. As National Coordinator Mostishari led ONC's major implementation phase after first joining ONC as its deputy national coordinator in July 2009. As deputy he developed a series of grant programs to promote electronic health record adoption, furthered the development of health information exchange, and helped construct the workforce development program. His vision has been instrumental in the formulation of the ONC’s Health IT Strategic Plan, the creation of ONC’s Authorized Testing and Certification Bodies, and influenced future stages of Meaningful Use. Preceding Mostashari as National Coordinator, physician and Harvard Medical School Professor David Blumenthal (2009-2011), set the inaugural tone and led the accelerated ramp up and development of the vastly expanded and fully funded role of ONC with the development of the many programs authorized by the HITECH Act, with the cooperation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. While operating with very small budgets, the previous National Coordinators, psychiatrist Robert Kolodner (interim 2006, permanent 2007-2009) and the first National Coordinator of Health Information Technology physician and venture capitalist, David Brailer (2004-2007), both laid critical groundwork for a vision of the role extensive use of electronic health records could play in the modernization of clinical paperwork and digitization of healthcare. 
The current structure of the agency offers insight into its strategic goals, and the agency's continued interest in collaborative, transparent, experienced leadership. Dr. DeSalvo has three deputies: Acting Principal Deputy National Coordinator Jacob Reider, MD, a family physician who has implemented and developed health IT systems for both enterprise and small practice settings, Deputy National Coordinator for Programs and Policy Judy Murphy, RN, FACMI, FHIMSS, FAAN, a nurse who has extensive enterprise health IT leadership experience, and Deputy National Coordinator for Operations Lisa A. Lewis, who is a recognized leader in the field of grants management. Also reporting to DeSalvo are Chief Privacy Officer Joy Pritts, JD, a lawyer who provides critical advice to both the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Coordinator in developing and implementing ONC’s HITECH privacy and security programs and had previously worked in academia focusing on the critical issues surrounding the privacy of health information and patient access to medical records at both the federal and state levels, and Acting Chief Medical Officer Amy Helwig, MD, MS, a physician who brings government and private sector experience to quality and safety activities including improvements in patient safety using health IT. 
Additional key leadership roles at ONC currently include Doug Fridsma, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Science Officer & Director, Office of Science & Technology; Michael F. Furukawa, Ph.D., Director, Office of Economic Analysis, Evaluation, and Modeling; Nora Super Acting Director, Office of Public Affairs and Communications; Jodi G. Daniel, JD, MPH, Director, Office of Policy and Planning, and one of the ONC's original staff members; Kimberly Lynch, MPH, Director, Office of Provider Adoption Support; Lygeia Ricciardi, EdM, Director, Office of Consumer eHealth; Lee Stevens, Acting Director, ONC Office of Certification; Chris Muir, Director, State Health Information Exchange Program; and Kelly Cronin, Health Care Reform Coordinator.
The scope and leadership of the ONC had grown during Dr Mostashari's tenure to reflect the major implementation phase of programs at ONC. As National Coordinator, Mostashari appointed two deputies: David Muntz and Judy Murphy both with extensive enterprise health IT leadership experience, and a Chief Medical Officer - Jacob Reider. They joined existing leaders at ONC: Claudia Williams, Jodi Daniel, Joy Pritts and Peter Garrett. ONC also created an "Office of Consumer e-Health" directed by Lygea Riccardi in 2012.
Programs.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act seeks to improve American health care delivery and patient care through an unprecedented investment in health information technology. The provisions of the HITECH Act are specifically designed to work together to provide the necessary assistance and technical support to providers, enable coordination and alignment within and among states, establish connectivity to the public health community in case of emergencies, and assure the workforce is properly trained and equipped to be meaningful users of Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
EHR Incentive Program Payments and Meaningful Use
The HITECH Act set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs — that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) managed and distributed these federal funds for the meaningful use of electronic health records in conjunction with state Medicaid departments with the cooperation and support of ONC and ONC programs. 
As of March 2014, more than $22.5 billion in combined Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made since 2011. More than $14.8 billion in Medicare EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between May 2011 and March 2014. More than $7.7 billion in Medicaid EHR Incentive Program payments have been made between January 2011 (when the first set of states launched their programs) and March 2014. More than 470,000 eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals are actively registered in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs as of March 2014. According to Modern Healthcare, payments have been made to 90.4% of the 5,011 estimated eligible hospitals; and 69.6% of the estimated 527,200 eligible professionals.
ONC Programs
The following ONC programs help to build the foundation for every American to benefit from an electronic health record, as part of a modernized, interconnected, and vastly improved system of care delivery. "Note: The list of programs below is in the process of being revised and updated."
"*Combined Results of Community College and University-Based Training:" In total the two programs trained 21,437 students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands at 91 academic institutions. For more information, please read the Workforce Development Programs Final Evaluation Report, completed by NORC of the University of Chicago
Advisory Committees.
ONC also created two Federal Advisory Committees (FACAs), the Health IT Policy Committee, which the National Coordinator chairs, and the Health IT Standards Committee, which will be chaired by Acting Principal Deputy National Coordinator Jacob Reider, MD. Until April 2014, the Standards Committee had been chaired by Jonathan Perlin of Hospital Corporation of America, who is leaving to focus on his chair role at the American Hospital Association. The advisory committees actively gather public input and provide expert recommendations about Health IT use in the United States. As of April 2014 Dr. DeSalvo has asked both of these committees to look at revamping the organization of their workgroups to better reflect the goals ahead as they continue to work together.
Health IT Policy Committee
The Health IT Policy Committee recommends a policy framework for the development and adoption of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that permits the electronic exchange and use of health information. Vice-chair of this committee is Paul Tang, MD, MS, who is Vice President, Chief Innovation and Technology Officer at Palo Alto Medical Foundation. This "Health Affairs Blog" post "Trusting Government: A Tale Of Two Federal Advisory Groups" gives some insight into the workings of the HIT Policy Committee. 
Health IT Standards Committee
The Health IT Standards Committee recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. The Standards Committee also harmonizes, pilot tests, and ensures consistency with the Social Security Act. Vice-chair of this committee is John Halamka, MD, MS, who is Chief Information Officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Professor at Harvard Medical School, and a practicing Emergency Physician. Halamka recaps the monthly Standards Committee meetings on "Life as a Healthcare CIO" blog, as in this April 2014 post.

Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)

Roberta "Bobby" Marshall (née Simpson; previously Morgan) is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera "Home and Away", played by Nicolle Dickson. She was introduced in the pilot episode by executive producer Alan Bateman. Nearly four hundred actresses auditioned to play Bobby, with Dickson taking the role. Bobby is described as a trouble-making teen who is rebellious and a loner. Bobby became a popular character because of her confronting attitude. Bobby's story lines have focused on finding her biological parents, her feud with Roo Stewart, adoption and her marriage to foster brother Frank Morgan. Bobby's marriage to Frank was only implemented when script writers were sure viewers approved of it. At certain points in Bobby's duration, Dickson disapproved of her actions, for instance she became frustrated with her because she decided to find her biological parents without thinking about her foster parents' feelings. Dickson decided to leave the serial in 1993, and the character was subsequently killed off in a boat accident. In 1995 Dickson made a cameo appearance when Ailsa Stewart has hallucinations of Bobby in her fridge door. Dickson has received a Logie Award for her portrayal of Bobby and she has been referred to as a "Summer Bay icon".
Casting.
Nearly four hundred actresses auditioned for the role of Bobby, compared to the three hundred hopefuls that auditioned for the roles of the other foster children, with actress Nicolle Dickson receiving the role of Bobby. Dickson was eighteen when she was cast and had nearly decided to quit acting in favour of a "normal career".
Initially Dickson found the role hard to adjust to because she never got to see her friends any more and has stated she found it odd that the serial's production staff were having her transported around on first-class flights and in limousines. The fame also took Dickson by surprise, whilst interviewed by newspaper "Evening Times" she stated: "I'm just an ordinary teenage girl but my life changed completely almost over-night. When I started playing the role of Bobby I had no idea of the effect it was going to have." Dickson has also revealed that fans are scared to talk to her because they assume she will act like Bobby, stating: "I sometimes think people are scared to talk to me, because I might bite their head off. But I'd much rather just have a chat." In 1991, it was revealed that Dickson has signed another years contract to stay with "Home and Away" but said she was "nervous" about doing so. After Dickson's exit the remaining older cast members were offered pay rises because Seven feared they would follow her decision to quit.
Character development.
The serial's writers of 1989 stated that: "Bobby Simpson is Summer Bay's premiere juvenile delinquent - the product of sixteen years of emotional rejection by her parents, and later, grandparents." They also brand her a loner, streetwise and describe her attitude in her early years stating: "If she liked you she'd do anything for you, if she had an anti against you she was a little demon who'd only stop short of crime in her actions towards you." Further describing these traits Dickson adds: "She'll stick by you to the end, but then she can turn around and stick her fingers up at you if she doesn't like you. I think a lot of people can relate to the way Bobby is. [...] I enjoy playing her, I think she's really sweet because she puts on this tough exterior and yet inside she's longing for somebody. Bobby has little control over the others." Dickson also believes that Bobby's popularity stems from the fact she does the things people in real life wish they could do but are not brave enough to. Dickson has also described why Bobby hides behind a tough exterior stating she is so aggressive because she is hurt inside. In the "Home and Away" Annual for 1989 Kesta Desmond writes that she is a loner, a juvenile delinquent, a rebel and forthright. In the book "Home and Away Special" she is described as: "Bobby is a loner, she has very few friends, only the tearaways of the town, and claims to need nobody." Describing the similarities between character and actress Dickson adds: "I think I'm more independent and mature. She is afraid to trust anyone, but I love affection."
One of Bobby's storylines saw her try and track down her real father, the plot was unpopular with Dickson who stated: "When Bobby turned her back on her foster parents to go off and look for her real father, I just became totally frustrated with her." Another storyline was her relationship with foster brother Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), they get together after Roo Stewart (Justine Clarke) leaves him on their wedding day. Dickson describes the fan reaction stating: "They're all on Bobby's side, and clearly not Roo's!" On-screen Bobby is constantly worried that she is a substitute for Roo, of this Dickson states: "The character of Bobby has always felt intimidated by Roo because she's so beautiful and sexy. She knows Frank has always fancied Roo and can't help suspecting that he's marrying Bobby on the rebound". Papps said that Bobby "still had a lot of attitude" but by then she had "softened a lot." Dickson had to film many scenes around this time which involved Bobby crying with worry, she stated she found the scenes easy to prepare for. When script writers initially planned Bobby and Frank's wedding, but they were unsure how viewers would react to it. Dickson and Papps were sent on a publicity stunt to find out the what the public reaction would be to the proposed marriage. They stood in a crowded shopping centre and hugged each other, which got the crowds attention as they cheered, Papps then shouted: "Let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry". The crowd heavily approved and all voiced their approval. Delighted producers gave the marriage the green light and they married. Dickson later stated: "Everyone wanted to sort of see them finally get together because Bobby was keen on him for such a long time." Concluding that their marriage served as relief to everyone because Bobby finally got her happy ending. In 1990, Bobby discovers she is pregnant. Though in the 1991 series return episode, Bobby is told she has miscarried her unborn baby. Dickson said the scenes were "very harrowing". Bobby tries "to keep calm" throughout her ordeal.
In a March 1995, a "TV Week" reporter revealed that Dickson had reprised the role of Bobby. While her character was killed off, Bobby would return in scenes to coincide with a planned mental breakdown for the character of Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn).
Storylines.
Backstory.
Bobby was born in Summer Bay as the illegitimate daughter of Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) and Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). Morag kept the pregnancy a secret. She was adopted by Doris and Al Simpson (George Leppard; Terence Donovan), who she moved with to the city when she was two years old. Al was a violent alcoholic was imprisoned seven years for petty crime. Meanwhile, Doris and Bobby returned to Summer Bay to stay with her grandparents. By this point, Bobby had begun rebelling and earned a reputation as a wild child. When she was fifteen, her mother Doris died of cancer, and her grandparents sold their store to Ailsa. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) soon felt sympathy for her and got her a job at the store and allowed her to live behind his boatshed, she resented Alf being an authority figure to her but slowly warmed to Ailsa.
1988–95.
Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa Fletcher (Vanessa Downing) arrive with their foster children to take a look at the caravan park, Bobby is hiding in one in of the vans with the help of Neville (Frank Lloyd) and Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly), after being accused of breaking into Donald Fisher's house. Neville and Floss try to keep her away from Alf and the Fletchers, as they do not want any more trouble. Bobby sees Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) snooping, Bobby tries to make an escape but knocks over little Sally in the process. Bobby tries to get Sally to keep quiet and runs off. She is later caught by Tom and Frank when Sally identifies the girl who pushed her, and is placed under citizens arrest by Fisher who has been searching for her due to his suspicions about her robbing him. She is then handed over to the police.
Bobby decides to harass the Fletcher girls at the beach and blames their family for her earlier arrest. The night the Fletchers move into the caravan park house, one of the vans burst into flames. The blame is immediately pointed at Bobby, but she is adamant she has done anything wrong. Fisher tries to have her arrested again as he wants to see justice, but Tom and Pippa refuse to press charges as they believe Bobby is innocent. Pippa starts to feel sorry for Bobby and offers her a chance to live in one of the caravans free of charge, which Bobby refuses, as she does not want to be seen as anyone's charity case. However, Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), comes to her defence when she is harassed by Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson) on the beach. Bobby soon befriends Steven and as a result she decides to accept Pippa's offer. But Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), objects to Bobby staying in the caravan park and a fight breaks out between them just as a man from community services stops by to assess the Fletchers living arrangements. Bobby feels guilty that she might be responsible for splitting the family up, so she goes to the city to convince Tarquin Pearce (John O'Brien), the man from the department not to take the kids away from Tom and Pippa.
Pearce is so impressed with what Bobby told him, he not only wants the Fletchers to stay together, he also persuades Tom and Pippa to take on Bobby as their sixth foster child. She later moves in with them and quickly settles in and becomes a part of the family. Now reformed and living in a stable home, Bobby and Ailsa decide to set up a new business, The Bayside Diner. She also develops feelings for her foster brother Frank, but he is in love with Roo. Bobby and Roo clash on many different occasions, whilst Bobby is secretly jealous. Bobby evens starts dreaming she is marrying Frank and rubbing it in Roo's face. Bobby is delighted when Roo and Frank seem to be having a rough time. Frank and Roo however then agree to get married, which makes Bobby even more angry. On the day of their wedding, Roo starts having second thoughts. Frank is devastated to find out Roo has jilted him. Bobby decides she will be there for Frank in his time of need.
After a while, their friendship starts developing into feelings. Frank decides they have to make a move and they start a relationship of their own. Bobby constantly worries however that he is on the rebound; this makes her cry a lot and let her usual strong image fade. Frank decides to show his commitment to Bobby and asks her to marry him. Delighted, Bobby accepts the offer. On the day of their wedding, Bobby's birth mother Morag secretly turns up to the wedding; at this point, Bobby still is not aware of the identity of her biological parents. Their marriage starts to face problems and Bobby refuses to let go of the thought he is on the rebound. So after constant disagreements, Frank decides to leave Summer Bay for New York to reconcile with Roo. Bobby is distraught to realise she was right all along.
She attempts to trace her birth parents, without giving a thought for her foster parents' feelings. After a series of hurdles, Bobby decides she has tried hard enough and gives up. Morag is admitted to hospital and Alf decides to tell Bobby his secret because he feels the timing is appropriate. Bobby is shocked at the secret because it means Morag was in fact her mother. Bobby is very angry when she finds out the truth and continues to pester Morag even after she is released from hospital. After a while, she gives in and reveals all to her. Bobby is more upset to find out Donald is her father because they have previously hated each other. Initially neither can handle the situation, but eventually the two decide to put their past differences aside and develop a close father-daughter relationship. When she discovers she is pregnant, she tells everyone but Donald; she tries to but is scared of what he will think. He is annoyed when he finds out and Bobby thinks he disapproves, but Donald tells her he is proud of her. At one point, Donald resigns from his job because of problems at the school so she enlists Pippa and Grant Mitchell's (Craig McLachlan) help to get his job back. After coming to terms with the prospect of being a mother, Bobby develops stomach pains and is devastated to find out she has suffered a miscarriage. When she gets her head together, she decides to take a leaf out of Pippa's book and looks into the prospect of fostering a child of her own.
After a series of hits and misses, she wonders if it is the right thing to do. However, this all changes when she finds a young boy named Sam Nicholls (Ryan Clark). The two get on really well in the end and form a close relationship. Bobby and Sam's delight is soon put to an end when his biological father, Greg Marshall (Ross Newton), turns up in Summer Bay; after finding out their address from someone, he turns up and announces he is here to take Sam back home. Bobby is terrified at the thought of losing Sam, and she refuses to let Greg near him. Eventually, Bobby and Greg become close and start a relationship and they marry, much to the happiness of Sam.
When a fair is held, Bobby's friend Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) wants to go for a boat ride with her and Luke Cunningham (John Adam). Suddenly, the boat collides with a large piece of driftwood in the water and overturns, causing everyone fall out of the boat and into the water. Bobby is then found but is in a coma, attempts are made to save her but she is found to be brain dead. After a few days, Bobby's friends and family each say their goodbyes to her, before the decision is made by Greg to turn off her life support machine. The whole town is affected by her death. Even her estranged mother Morag finds it hard to come to terms with. Adam is not charged with causing her death, but despite it being accidental, he is still treated like an outcast as he becomes hated by all the Bay's residents and he only forgiven until he saves Sam from a fire. He leaves soon after. When Ailsa is going through a rough time in 1995, she starts hallucinating due to the medication she is prescribed. One night, Ailsa hallucinates and Bobby's ghost suddenly appears before her on the fridge door, telling Ailsa that Alf cares about her.
Reception.
Dickson won the Logie for "Most Popular New Talent" at the 1989 Logie Awards for her portrayal of Bobby. At the 1991 Logie Awards, Dickson was nominated in the category of "Most Popular Actress". In his book, "Super Aussie Soaps", Andrew Mercado describes Bobby as the serial's "breakout star" both on and off-screen, also branding her as extremely rebellious. Bobby has been received negatively by the editors of Australian weekly magazine "The Bulletin" stating: "From memory, Bobby whinged and whined a lot before Dickson left the show for anonymity." Televisionau.com also brand Bobby as rebellious but state she's also an outsider compared to the other foster children. Darren Rowe of entertainment website Digital Spy refers to both character and actress as an icon of the serial. Eamonn McCusker writing for The Digital Fix attributes the origins of cheap television to Bobby's infamous beach scene in which she first says "Rack Off!'. Dickson has revealed that she received high volumes of fan mail every time Bobby punched another character, an amount she stated: "became time consuming". Murray Clifford writing for the "Evening Times" brands her as the serial's "tearaway tomboy". A columnist for "Inside Soap" said that Bobby was a "tearaway" who eventually became the "pillar of the community".

Le Tour de la France par deux enfants

Le Tour de la France par deux enfants (1877) is a French novel/geography/travel/school book. It was written by Augustine Fouillée (née Tuillerie) who used the pseudonym of G. Bruno. She was the wife of Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée. The book was widely used in the schools of the Third Republic, where it was influential for generations of children in creating a sense of a unified nation of France. Its success was such that it reached a circulation of 6 million copies in 1900, by 1914 it sold 7 million copies, it was still used in schools until the 1950s and still in print to this day. It was sometimes known as "the little red book of the Republic."
The story recounts the journey of two young brothers from Phalsbourg in Lorraine, Andrew and Julian Volden, who, following the annexation of the Alsace-Lorraine by the Prussians in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War, and the death of their father, went in search of family members through the French provinces. The diversity of the people they meet lead them on to learn more. There are passages on the taste of local foods, the strange patois, mitigated by methodical learning. It is very patriotic and emphasises civic and moral education, as well as geography, science, history. The story teaches about monuments and symbols, exemplary lives of inventors, soldiers and patriot benefactors. They are very zealous to learn more about France. The accumulated wealth of knowledge: agriculture, home economics, hygiene... leads them to establish a perfect farm called "La Grand'Lande", symbolic of the nation of France.
The book was reissued in 2000 by Belin, and in 2006 by France Loisirs.

<doc id="21621719" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621719" title="SS Cavalry Brigade">
SS Cavalry Brigade

The SS Cavalry Brigade ("SS-Kavallerie-Brigade") was a unit of the "Waffen SS" formed from cavalry regiments created for occupation duties in German-occupied Poland. Later, while serving in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, the brigade was involved in the genocide of the Jewish population and anti-partisan operations. It also filled gaps in the front line when called upon in emergencies. In 1942, the brigade was disbanded and became the cadre of the 8th SS Cavalry ("Florian Geyer") Division, during its formation.
Formation.
The SS Cavalry Brigade can trace its origin to the SS "Totenkopf" Horse Regiment (), which was raised in September 1939, for internal security duties in Poland, under the command of Hermann Fegelein.
By April 1940, it consisted of 8 Saber Squadrons, 9th Replacement, 10th Heavy and 11th Technical Squadrons and a 12th Horse Battery of four 80mm guns. In May it was divided into two regiments, SS "Totenkopf" Horse Regiments 1 & 2, each of four squadrons, 5th Heavy and 6th Horse Battery also included were Signals, Engineer and Motorcycle platoons.
In March 1941 they were renamed SS Cavalry Regiments () 1 and 2 and reformed again into 1st, 2nd and 3rd Saber Squadrons, 4th (Machine Gun), 5th (Mortar and Infantry Gun), 6th (Technical), 7th (Bicycle) and 8th (Horse Battery) Squadrons.
In early August 1941, Himmler ordered the SS Cavalry Brigade to be formed under the command of Hermann Fegelein from the 1st and 2nd SS cavalry regiments. Personnel were taken from the saber squadrons to form the brigade's Artillery, Engineer and Bicycle (Reconnaissance) Squadron's. They were also given a Light Anti-Aircraft Battery. The brigade now had a strength of 3,500 men 2,900 horses and 375 vehicles.
Soviet Union.
After the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), the SS cavalry regiments, along with the 1 SS Infantry Brigade were assigned to pacify what was seen as the main trouble spots in the occupied territories. On 17 July 1941, the SS cavalry regiments were transferred to the general command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach for action in the area of the Pripet marsh, a large area of land that covered parts of Belorussia and the Northern Ukraine. Thereafter the regiments combined to become the SS Cavalry Brigade. They were ordered to perform the "systematic combing of the Pripyat swamps". The SS Cavalry Brigade was assigned because it was more mobile and better able to carry out large-scale operations; the brigade played a pivotal role in the transition from "selective mass murder" to the wholesale extermination of the Jewish population of the occupied part of the Soviet Union.
By 1 August, the SS Cavalry Regiment was responsible for the death of 800 people; five days later, on 6 August, this total had reached 3,000 "Jews and Partisans".
Also on 1 August, after a meeting between Heinrich Himmler, Erich von Bach-Zelewski and Hinrich Lohse, the Brigade received the following order:
Gustav Lombard, on receiving the order, advised his Battalion that "In future not one male Jew is to remain alive not one family in the villages".
Throughout the next weeks, members of the SS Cavalry Regiment 1, under Lombard's command, murdered an estimated 11,000 Jews and more than 400 dispersed soldiers of the Red Army.
Franz Magill and his men of the SS Cavalry Regiment 2, assisted in the roundup of all the men aged 18 to 55 in the city of Pinsk, where 5,000 to 8,000 men were shot and shortly afterwards, another 2,000 residents including women, children and older men were executed.
General of Infantry Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Center described their operations the following way:
The SS Cavalry Brigade operates as follows: at dawn, without prior reconnaissance, the troop tasked with the inspection of a village rides into it at full speed and out the other end, occupies the outer edges of the village in a trice, in accordance with an agreed plan, and then gathers the whole population together, including women and children, for inspection. In many cases the skill and experience of the commanding officer, and also of the accompanying SD and GFP groups together with their interpreters, will decide upon the composition of the male inhabitants and their occupation, as well as upon their fate, so that the area is cleared of opposition and pacified.
After the Soviet counterattack in January 1942, the only large formation not already committed was the SS Cavalry Brigade. Launching an attack on 7 January, it was also forced back after only one day's fighting when it had run out of ammunition. One of its Battalions also reported 75% casualties when fighting in the woods north of Rzhev. The Brigade was found to be wanting and not equipped or trained to take on the Soviet Armoured units.
In March 1942, the SS Cavalry Brigade was used as the cadre in the formation of the 8th SS Cavalry Division "Florian Geyer".

Apoño

Antonio Galdeano Benítez (born 13 February 1984), commonly known as Apoño, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for UD Las Palmas as a central midfielder. A player with both hard-working and playmaking skills, he is also a penalty kick specialist.
Club career.
Early career.
Born in Málaga, Apoño began his career with local "Unión Deportiva San Pedro" and, for the 2004–05 season, moved to Andalusia neighbours UD Marbella in Segunda División B, where he would remain three years.
Málaga.
In July 2007, Apoño joined Segunda División side Málaga CF – after having emerged through its youth system – also in his native region, being an instrumental figure in its return to La Liga after a two-year absence. He was brought in as the club was coached by Juan Ramón López Muñiz, who had briefly managed the player at Marbella.
In the following campaign, Apoño remained a starter: he made his top division debut on 31 August 2008, in a 0–4 loss at Atlético Madrid, and finished the campaign with nine league goals – best in the squad with striker Nabil Baha – seven from penalty kicks, notably in a 3–4 loss at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium against Real Madrid.
On 30 July 2010, after a season with many injury problems, with Málaga only ranking in 17th position, Apoño signed a contract extension with Málaga, running until June 2014. He made his 100th official appearance for the club alongside teammate Weligton, in a 1–4 home defeat against Real Madrid on 16 October 2010, and finished 2010–11 with 27 league appearances (26 starts) and one goal.
After the first match in the following campaign, a 1–2 away loss against Sevilla FC in which he was replaced at half-time – with the score at 2–0 for the hosts – reacting angrily, Apoño was suspended by coach Manuel Pellegrini. He returned to action nearly two months after, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–4 home defeat against Real Madrid; on 9 January 2012 the Chilean told the player to start looking for a new club, as their altercation had continued for too long.
Zaragoza.
On 19 January 2012, Apoño was loaned out to fellow top-divisioner Real Zaragoza for the rest of the season. He made his debut for his new team three days later, starting in a 0–0 draw at Levante UD.
Apoño scored his first goal(s) for the Aragonese on 21 March, netting a brace (one penalty) for bottom-placed Zaragoza in a 2–1 away win against Valencia CF. The following round, again from the 11-meter spot, he scored in the 95th minute for the game's only goal in a home success over Atlético Madrid, and featured heavily as the club again retained its division status in the last round.
Personal life.
Apoño's younger brother, Juan José, is also a footballer and a midfielder. He also appeared for Málaga, but only for the B-team.

<doc id="21621792" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621792" title="Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden">
Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden

The Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (, before 2011 "Regeringsrätten", acronym "RR" or "RegR") is the supreme court and the third and final tier for administrative court cases in Sweden, and is located in Stockholm. It has a parallel status to that of the Supreme Court of Sweden ("Högsta Domstolen"), which is the supreme court for criminal and civil law cases.
It hears cases which have been decided by one of the four Administrative courts of appeal, which represent the second tier for administrative court cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided, a leave to appeal must be obtained, which is typically only granted when the case is of interest as a precedent. The bulk of its caseload consist of taxation and social security cases.
Justices of the Supreme Administrative Court (the Swedish term is "justitieråd") are appointed by government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court. By law, there shall be fourteen Justices of the Supreme Administrative Court or such a higher a number as may be required, at the government's discretion. As of 2009, there were eighteen Justices in the court. One of the Justices serves as president and head of the court, and is appointed by the government to this function.
Since 3rd of January, 2011, Justice Mats Melin serves as the court's president.
In total the court has approximately 100 employees. 
History.
The court was founded in 1909. Before that, the Supreme Court of Sweden handed administrative court matters as well. From 1972 until 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court resided in the Stenbock Palace on the Riddarholmen islet in central Stockholm. Since 2011 the court sits in Kammarrättens hus (the former Administrative Court of Appeal Building) and the Sparre Palace on Riddarholmen.

Mala Ligojna

Mala Ligojna is a village north of Vrhnika in the Inner Carniola region of Slovenia. It includes the hamlet of Frtica.
Name.
Together with neighboring Velika Ligojna (literally 'Big Ligojna'), Mala Ligojna (literally, 'Little Ligojna') was attested in written sources in 1309 as "Luckossel" (and as "Lucozel" in 1317, "Lvkozel" in 1318, and "Oberludigoni" in 1526). The medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was "Luko(va) sela" (literally, 'Luka's village') in the 14th century, probably originally based on the name "*Ľudigojь" and then confused in the transcriptions with the similar name "Luka". If so, today's name is a result of the sound change "ľu-" > "li-" and modern vowel reduction, and means 'Ljudigoj's village'.
Church.
The local church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Leonard and belongs to the Parish of Vrhnika. The church dates from 1567 and was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century.

David Garland Rose House

The David Garland Rose House was built circa 1860 in Valparaiso, Indiana, United States. David Rose was a local businessman. This Gothic Revival house is unusual in that it is eight-sided, an octagon. Each of the eight gables include decorated wood panels. Covered porches have been added to three sides. 
The octagon house rose in popularity in 1849 with the publication of Orson Squire Fowler's book A Home For All. The idea was to develop affordable and comfortable housing for the working class. Fowler proposed the use of concrete due to its long life and low cost. Most octagon houses are of wood or brick construction. The "octagon craze" was short-lived and pre-dates the American Civil War. Fewer than 120 octagon houses survive.
David Rose.
David Rose was a successful business man in Valparaiso. At the start of the American Civil War, he was appointed as Colonel Rose, Commandant of the 54th Indiana Volunteer Infantry at Camp Morton, Indiana.

Cricket in Nepal

Cricket is the second most popular sport in Nepal, catching up with football as the country's most popular sport thanks largely to the spread of television to the rural communities and qualification of the national team in the 2014 ICC World T20 in Bangladesh.
Nepal's playing season runs from September to November and starts again in March before finishing in May. The National Cricket Academy, NCA was formally opened in January 2013 by the Cricket Association of Nepal to guide emerging players and to provide continuous training facilities to the men's national team, under-19 team and the women's national team. 
As of December 2012, there were 429 senior cricket clubs and 227 junior cricket clubs in Nepal.
History.
Beginnings.
Cricket was introduced to Nepal by the ruling Rana dynasty when they returned from England, after their studies, in the 1920s. Though the game was kept very much for themselves and other members of the elite, the Cricket Association of Nepal was formed in 1946 to promote cricket amongst the aristocracy.
When King Tribhuvan overthrew the Rana regime in 1951, cricket began to spread to the rest of the population. In 1961, in an effort to promote cricket in the whole of Nepal, the Cricket Association of Nepal became part of the National Sports Council. Nevertheless, the game tended to be limited to Kathmandu until the 1980s.
ICC and ACC Membership.
Improvements to the communication and transport infrastructure in Nepal allowed the game to expand outside Kathmandu in the 1980s, and Nepal became an Affiliate Member of the ICC in 1988. A major development programme was begun in the early 1990s, with regional and district tournaments established and cricket being promoted in schools. Nepal became an Associate Member of the ACC in 1990 and became a full member in 1994.
Interest in cricket increased quickly in the 1990s, and demand to play was such that the number of teams in tournaments had to be restricted until more facilities were built. Nepal became an Associate Member of the ICC in 1996,
Governing Body.
The Cricket Association of Nepal is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Nepal. It was formed in 1946.
Cricket Grounds.
There are 65 grounds in Nepal with 17 turf wickets. International matches can be played only at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground. A new international standard ground is under construction at Mulpani, Kathmandu and another is going to be built at Pokhara with some help from the Asian Cricket Council.
The following are the major cricket stadiums in Nepal.
Men's National Team.
The Nepal National Cricket Team represents Nepal in international cricket matches. 
They have been participating in international matches since 2013, including every ACC Trophy tournament, the 2001 ICC Trophy and two ICC Intercontinental Cups.
Nepal also has an Under-19 Cricket Team.
Women's National Team.
The Nepal National Women's Cricket Team represents Nepal in international women's cricket matches. They made their international debut in the ACC Women's Tournament in Malaysia in July 2007.
Domestic Cricket.
Domestic cricket is divided into 9 regions (Kathmandu, Janakpur, Birgunj, Baitadi, Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Pokhara and Mahendranagar along with the APF and the Nepal Army). The men's and women's teams from these regions compete in One Day and Twenty20 matches in various age groups.
Similarly, from 2014 onwards a franchise based event comprising Twenty20, One Day and Two Day tournaments was initiated.

Richard Becker (music publisher)

Richard Stanley Becker is an American music publisher who gave rise to major innovations within the recording industry, most notably with The Beatles (Anna Go To Him) and The
Rolling Stones (You Better Move On).
Becker's work and collaborations have received lots of recognition, ranging from Tony Awards and nominations for his show, to inclusion in the collections of some of the world's most prestigious libraries, and even the dedication of a park bench in New York City's Gramercy Park. Becker is also well known for his promotion work and his ability to launch new talent, so much so that he has often been referred to as a "star maker." Throughout his career, Becker has encouraged musical development in young people, as shown in his 1976 establishment of the Richard S. Becker Scholarship at the Juilliard School of Music.
Career.
Becker's earliest major work was with Pat Boone on the #1 hit "Moody River". His work with The Beatles on "Anna (Go To Him)" and The Rolling Stones ("You Better Move On") not only brought forward the Muscle Shoals Sound for the first time, but also produced the first crossover hit from R&B to pop. 
Among his other collaborations, Becker worked with a team to adapt gospel music to Broadway. This team initially included Alex Bradford, on a production commissioned by the Italian government for Gian-Carlo Menotti's Two Worlds Festival held in Spoleto, Italy, entitled "Black Nativity". The show, based on the play by Langston Hughes,
proved such a success that two years later, the group was asked to do another production. The result was "Your Arms Too Short to Box with God".
The Tony Award-winning production of "Your Arms Too Short to Box with God" became the first show fully funded in its production by the Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.. President Jimmy Carter chose "Your Arms" as the first show presented by his administration "Your Arms" went on to enjoy a lengthly run at Broadway's Lyceum Theater, and is one of the only shows to experience two revivals in four years. "Your Arms" gave rise to Tony Award-nominated Performances (Al Green), reinvigorated the career of Patti LaBelle, and showcased the professional debut of Jennifer Holiday. "Your Arms" has influenced more than music - for example, the prominent televangelist James Dobson makes frequent reference to the musical and devoted an entire section to its influence in one of his best selling books.
Becker has worked with many genres over the course of his career. For example, he was responsible for bringing the first country music show to New York City's Madison Square Garden in 1964.
Many of Becker's works have been included in many collections. Some examples are his inclusion for his popular records (including Pat Boone and The Beatles) in Collier's and the "Encyclopædia Britannica". In addition, Becker's work with Alex Bradford has been included in James Weldon Johnson's private collection at the Beinecke Library at Yale University, his own submission of the Richard S. Becker music collection at the Beinecke, the Richard S. Becker collection of Alex Bradford Gospel Music Materials Archives at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and many of his songs (such as "Anna", "Moody River" and "You Better Move On") are featured within the collections of The British Library.
Becker has worked with a wide range of people. In the 1980s, he collaborated with astrologer Jeane Dixon and one of her songs was recorded by The Chuck Wagon Gang.

Muliaage

Muliaage (Dhivehi: މުލިއާގެ, pronounced ) was the 'Official Residence of the President of the Maldives'. Muliaage is located at the historic centre of Malé in close proximity of the Medhu Ziyaarai, the Friday Mosque, and the "Munnaru" (Grand Minaret of Malé).
History.
The Beginning.
The construction of Muliaa’ge, was initiated in the year 1914 and completed in 1919. It was commissioned by Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III for his son and heir Prince Hassan Izzuddin. It was built on the style of bungalows in vogue during the colonial era in Ceylon and completed in preparation for the return of Prince Hassan Izzuddin to Male’ in 1920 after completing his education at the Royal College of Colombo. 
Muliaage, meaning the ‘’new house of Muli’’ was built on the site of ‘’Mulee’ge’’, the ancestral home of Shamsuddeen. Mulee’ge was also the home of Sultan Hasan 'Izz ud-din (or ‘’Dhon Bandaarain’’ 1759-66) from his maternal side. It remained with the Huraa Dynasty rulers throughout its history. The last occupant of Mulee'ge was Prince Mulee’ge Manippulhu, who later ascended the throne as Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III in 1892. 
Neither Muliaa’ge nor Mulee’ge ever served as a Royal Palace. However, it is located just a stone's throw away from the site of the former royal palace, now the Sultan's Park and the National Museum of Maldives. Most of the buildings in the royal palace grounds were demolished during Ibrahim Nasir’s presidency in the late 1960s. As such, today the nearest one could get to a royal Maldivian palace is Muliaa’ge in Male’ and the Utheemu Ganduvaru on the island of Utheemu. 
Muliaa’ge was occupied by Prince Hassan Izzuddin between 1920 and 1934. The house did not prove auspicious for the prince, though he apparently spent a lot of time there. It was famous throughout Male’, as a place for merriment and gaiety with numerous music and dance performances organised by the young prince for his entertainment. Izzuddin however soon became the victim of a smear campaign organized by his uncle Al Ameer Abdul Majeed Rannabandeyri Kilegefaanu and cousin Hassan Fareed. Ultimately he was discredited and banished in 1934 to the isolated southerly island of Fuvahmulah where he died in 1938.
Rise and Fall of the First Republic.
Following Prince Izzudin’s arrest, Muliaa’ge remained abandoned and in disuse until the second World War when it was used as the Ministry of Home Affairs by Mohamed Amin Didi. Following the abolition of the Maldivian Monarchy in 1952, the new President Mohamed Amin Didi officially made Muliaa’ge the Presidential Palace on 1 January 1953. Following Amin's ouster later that year it became the Prime Minister's Office under Ibrahim Faamuladheyri Kilegefaanu after the restoration of the monarchy under Sultan Muhammad Fareed Didi.
During the Second Republic.
After a long period of disuse, the first president of the second republic, Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan once again declared Muliaa’ge as the Presidential Palace in 1968. Although it was the official residence of the president, Nasir only took temporary residence at Muliaa’ge while his own house Velaanaa’ge was under construction. Initially President Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom resided at Muliaa’ge for the first two decades of his presidency. However deeming Muliaa’ge insufficient, Maumoom commissioned Theemuge to be built and declared it the official Presidential Palace in 1998. Muliaa’ge was under much neglect and it served as the President’s Office and later the Supreme Court during the latter years of Maumoon’s presidency.
In 2008, after defeating Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom in the Maldives’ first democratic multi-party elections, Mohamed Nasheed became the third president of the second republic. Nasheed was a strong critic of Maumoon’s government and its alleged overspending. On these grounds president Nasheed refused to use Theemuge due to the high costs of maintaining it as a house of residence and stayed at his own house Yaagoothu’ge for the first few months of his presidency. However, on February 4, 2009, former president Nasheed moved to Muliaa’ge once again declaring it the official residence of the Maldivian President. After the resignation of Nasheed on February 2012, the palace became vacant. 
Famous guests who stayed at Muliaa’ge include Queen Elizabeth II during Nasir’s presidency and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India under president Maumoon.
