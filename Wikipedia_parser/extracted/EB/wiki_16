Social development theory

Social development theory attempts to explain qualitative changes in the structure and framework of society, that help the society to better realize its aims and objectives. Development can be broadly defined in a manner applicable to all societies at all historical periods as an upward ascending movement featuring greater levels of energy, efficiency, quality, productivity, complexity, comprehension, creativity, mastery, enjoyment and accomplishment. Development is a process of social change, not merely a set of policies and programs instituted for some specific results. During the last five centuries this process has picked up in speed and intensity, and during the last five decades has witnessed a marked surge in acceleration.
The basic mechanism driving social change is increasing awareness leading to better organization. When society senses new and better opportunities for progress it develops new forms of organization to exploit these new openings successfully. The new forms of organization are better able to harness the available social energies and skills and resources to use the opportunities to get the intended results.
Development is governed by many factors that influence the results of developmental efforts. There must be a motive that drives the social change and essential preconditions for that change to occur. The motive must be powerful enough to overcome obstructions that impede that change from occurring. Development also requires resources such as capital, technology, and supporting infrastructure.
Development is the result of society's capacity to organize resources to meet challenges and opportunities. Society passes through well-defined stages in the course of its development. They are nomadic hunting and gathering, rural agrarian, urban, commercial, industrial, and post-industrial societies. Pioneers introduce new ideas, practices, and habits that conservative elements initially resist. At a later stage, innovations are accepted, imitated, organized, and used by other members of the community. Organizational improvements introduced to support the innovations can take place simultaneously at four different levels—physical, social, mental, and psychological. Moreover four different types of resources are involved in promoting development. Of these four, physical resources are most visible, but least capable of expansion. Productivity of resources increases enormously as the quality of organization and level of knowledge inputs rise.
Development pace and scope varies according to the stage society is in. The three main stages are physical, vital ("vital" refers to the dynamic and nervous social energies of humanity that propel individuals to accomplish), and mental.
Terminology.
Though the term "development" usually refers to economic progress, it can apply to political, social, and technological progress as well. These various sectors of society are so intertwined that it is difficult to neatly separate them. Development in all these sectors is governed by the same principles and laws, and therefore the term applies uniformly.
Economic development and human development need not mean the same thing. Strategies and policies aimed at greater growth may produce greater income in a country without improving the average living standard. This happened in oil-producing Middle Eastern countries—a surge in oil prices boosted their national income without much benefit to poorer citizens. Conversely, people-oriented programs and policies can improve health, education, living standards, and other quality-of-life measures with no special emphasis on monetary growth. This occurred in the 30 years of socialist and communist rule in Kerala in India.
Four related but distinct terms and phenomena form successive steps in a graded series: survival, growth, development, and evolution. Survival refers to a subsistence lifestyle with no marked qualitative changes in living standards. Growth refers to horizontal expansion in the existing plane characterized by quantitative expansion—such as a farmer increasing the area under cultivation, or a retailer opening more stores. Development refers to a vertical shift in the level of operations that causes qualitative changes, such as a retailer turning into a manufacturer or an elementary school turning into a high school.
Human development.
Development is a human process, in the sense that human beings, not material factors, drive development. The energy and aspiration of people who seek development forms the motive force that drives development. People's awareness may decide the direction of development. Their efficiency, productivity, creativity, and organizational capacities determine the level of people’s accomplishment and enjoyment. Development is the outer realization of latent inner potentials. The level of people's education, intensity of their aspiration and energies, quality of their attitudes and values, skills and information all affect the extent and pace of development. These factors come into play whether it is the development of the individual, family, community, nation, or the whole world.
Process of emergence of new activities in society.
Unconscious vs. conscious development.
Human development normally proceeds from experience to comprehension. As society develops over centuries, it accumulates the experience of countless pioneers. The essence of that experience becomes the formula for accomplishment and success. The fact that experience precedes knowledge can be taken to mean that development is an unconscious process that gets carried out first, while knowledge becomes conscious later on only. "Unconscious" refers to activities that people carry out without knowing what the end results will be, or where their actions will lead. They carry out the acts without knowing the conditions required for success.
Role of pioneering individuals.
The gathering unconscious knowledge of society matures and breaks out on the surface in the form of new ideas—espoused by pioneers who also take new initiatives to give expression to those ideas. Those initiatives may call for new strategies and new organizations, which conservative elements may resist. If the pioneer's initiatives succeed, it encourages imitation and slow propagation in the rest of the community. Later, growing success leads to society assimilating the new practice, and it becomes regularized and institutionalized. This can be viewed in three distinct phases of social preparedness, initiative of pioneers, and assimilation by the society.
The pioneer as such plays an important role in the development process—since through that person, unconscious knowledge becomes conscious. The awakening comes to the lone receptive individual first, and that person spreads the awakening to the rest of the society. Though pioneers appear as lone individuals, they act as conscious representatives of society as a whole, and their role should be viewed in that light.
Imitation of the pioneer.
Though a pioneer comes up with innovative ideas very often the initial response to a pioneer is one of indifference, ridicule or even one of outright hostility. If the pioneer persists and succeeds in an initiative, that person's efforts may eventually get the endorsement of the public. That endorsement tempts others to imitate the pioneer. If they also succeed, news spreads and brings wider acceptance. Conscious efforts to lend organizational support to the new initiative helps institutionalize the new innovation.
Organization of new activities.
Organization is the human capacity to harness all available information, knowledge, resources, technology, infrastructure, and human skills to exploit new opportunities—and the face challenges and hurdles that block progress. Development comes through improvements in the human capacity for organization. In other words, development comes through emergence of better organizations that enhance society's capacity to make use of opportunities and face challenges.
The development of organizations may come through formulation of new laws and regulations, or through new systems. Each new step of progress brings a corresponding new organization. Increasing European international trade in the 16th and 17th centuries demanded corresponding development in the banking industry, as well as new commercial laws and civil arbitration facilities. New types of business ventures formed to attract the capital needed to finance expanding trade. As a result, a new business entity appeared—the joint-stock company, which limited the investors' liability to the extent of their personal investment without endangering other properties.
Each new developmental advance is accompanied by new or more suitable organizations that facilitate that advance. Often, existing inadequate organizations must change to accommodate new advances. 
Many countries have introduced scores of new reforms and procedures—such as the release of business directories, franchising, lease purchase, courier service, credit rating, collection agencies, industrial estates, free trade zones, and credit cards. Additionally, a diverse range of Internet services have formed. Each new facility improves effective use of available social energies for productive purposes. The importance of these facilities for speeding development is apparent when they are absent. When Eastern European countries wanted to transition to market-type economies, they were seriously hampered in their efforts due to the absence of supportive systems and facilities.
Organization matures into institution.
At a particular stage, organizations mature into institutions that become part of society. Beyond this point, an organization does not need laws or agencies to foster growth or ensure a continued presence. The transformation of an organization into an institution signifies society's total acceptance of that new organization. 
The income tax office is an example of an organization that is actively maintained by the enactment of laws and the formation of an office for procuring taxes. Without active governmental support, this organization would disappear, as it does not enjoy universal public support. On the other hand, the institution of marriage is universally accepted, and would persist even if governments withdrew regulations that demand registration of marriage and impose age restrictions. The institution of marriage is sustained by the weight of tradition, not by government agencies and legal enactments.
Cultural transmission by the family.
Families play a major role in the propagation of new activities once they win the support of the society. A family is a miniature version of the larger society—acceptance by the larger entity is reflected in the smaller entity. The family educates the younger generation and transmits social values like self-restraint, responsibility, skills, and occupational training. Though children do not follow their parents' footsteps as much as they once did, parents still mold their children's attitudes and thoughts regarding careers and future occupations. When families propagate a new activity, it signals that the new activity has become an integral part of the society.
Education.
One of the most powerful means of propagating and sustaining new developments is the educational system in a society. Education transmits society's collective knowledge from one generation to the next. It equips each new generation to face future opportunities and challenges with knowledge gathered from the past. It shows the young generation the opportunities ahead for them, and thereby raises their aspiration to achieve more. Information imparted by education raises the level of expectations of youth, as well as aspirations for higher income. It also equips youth with the mental capacity to devise ways and means to improve productivity and enhance living standards.
Society can be conceived as a complex fabric that consists of interrelated activities, systems, and organizations. Development occurs when this complex fabric improves its own organization. That organizational improvement can take place simultaneously in several dimensions.
Such organizational innovations occur all the time, as a continuous process. New organizations emerge whenever a new developmental stage is reached, and old organizations are modified to suit new developmental requirements. The impact of these new organizations may be powerful enough to make people believe they are powerful in their own right—but it is society that creates the new organizations required to achieve its objectives.
The direction that the developmental process takes is influenced by the population's awareness of opportunities. Increasing awareness leads to greater aspiration, which releases greater energy that helps bring about greater accomplishment.
Resources.
Since the time of the English economist Thomas Malthus, some have thought that capacity for development is limited by availability of natural resources. Resources can be divided into four major categories: physical, social, mental, and human. Land, water, mineral and oil, etc. constitute physical resources. Social resources consist of society's capacity to manage and direct complex systems and activities. Knowledge, information and technology are mental resources. The energy, skill and capacities of people constitute human resources.
The science of economics is much concerned with scarcity of resources. Though physical resources are limited, social, mental, and human resources are not subject to inherent limits. Even if these appear limited, there is no fixity about the limitation, and these resources continue to expand over time. That expansion can be accelerated by the use of appropriate strategies. In recent decades the rate of growth of these three resources has accelerated dramatically.
The role of physical resources tends to diminish as society moves to higher developmental levels. Correspondingly, the role of non-material resources increases as development advances. One of the most important non-material resources is information, which has become a key input. Information is a non-material resource that is not exhausted by distribution or sharing. Greater access to information helps increase the pace of its development. Ready access to information about economic factors helps investors transfer capital to sectors and areas where it fetches a higher return. Greater input of non-material resources helps explain the rising productivity of societies in spite of a limited physical resource base.
Application of higher non-material inputs also raises the productivity of physical inputs. Modern technology has helped increase the proven sources of oil by 50% in recent years—and at the same time, reduced the cost of search operations by 75%. Moreover, technology shows it is possible to reduce the amount of physical inputs in a wide range of activities. Scientific agricultural methods demonstrated that soil productivity could be raised through synthetic fertilizers. Dutch farm scientists have demonstrated that a minimal water consumption of 1.4 liters is enough to raise a kilogram of vegetables, compared to the thousand liters that traditional irrigation methods normally require.
Henry Ford's assembly line techniques reduced the man-hours of labor required to deliver a car from 783 minutes to 93 minutes. These examples show that the greater input of higher non-material resources can raise the productivity of physical resources and thereby extend their limits.
Role of technological development.
When the mind engages in pure creative thinking, it comes up with new thoughts and ideas. When it applies itself to society it can come up with new organizations. When it turns to the study of nature, it discovers nature's laws and mechanisms. When it applies itself to technology, it makes new discoveries and practical inventions that boost productivity. Technical creativity has had an erratic course through history, with some intense periods of creative output followed by some dull and inactive periods. However, the period since 1700 has been marked by an intense burst of technological creativity that is multiplying human capacities exponentially.
Though many reasons can be cited for the accelerating pace of technological inventions, a major cause is the role played by mental creativity in an increasing atmosphere of freedom. Political freedom and liberation from religious dogma had a powerful impact on creative thinking during the Age of Enlightenment. Dogmas and superstitions greatly restricted mental creativity. For example, when the astronomer Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view of the world, the church rejected it because it did not conform to established religious doctrine. When Galileo used a telescope to view the planets, the church condemned the device as an instrument of the devil, as it seemed so unusual. The Enlightenment shattered such obscurantist fetters on freedom of thought. From then on, the spirit of experimentation thrived.
Though technological inventions have increased the pace of development, the tendency to view developmental accomplishments as mainly powered by technology misses the bigger picture. Technological innovation was spurred by general advances in the social organization of knowledge. In the Middle Ages, efforts at scientific progress were few, mainly because there was no effective system to preserve and disseminate knowledge. Since there was no organized protection for patent rights, scientists and inventors were secretive about observations and discoveries. Establishment of scientific associations and scientific journals spurred the exchange of knowledge and created a written record for posterity.
Technological development depends on social organizations. Nobel laureate economist Arthur Lewis observed that the mechanization of factory production in England—the Industrial Revolution—was a direct result of the reorganization of English agriculture. Enclosure of common lands in England generated surplus income for farmers. That extra income generated additional raw materials for industrial processing, and produced greater demand for industrial products that traditional manufacturing processes could not meet.
The opening of sea trade further boosted demand for industrial production for export. Factory production increased many times when production was reorganized to use steam energy, combined with moving assembly lines, specialization, and division of labor. Thus, technological development was both a result of and a contributing factor to the overall development of society.
Individual scientific inventions do not spring out of the blue. They build on past accomplishments in an incremental manner, and give a conscious form to the unconscious knowledge that society gathers over time. As pioneers are more conscious than the surrounding community, their inventions normally meet with initial resistance, which recedes over time as their inventions gain wider acceptance. If opposition is stronger than the pioneer, then the introduction of an invention gets delayed.
In medieval times, when guilds tightly controlled their members, medical progress was slow mainly because physicians were secretive about their remedies. When Denis Papin demonstrated his steam engine, German naval authorities refused to accept it, fearing it would lead to increased unemployment. John Kay, who developed a flying shuttle textile loom, was physically threatened by English weavers who feared the loss of their jobs. He fled to France where his invention was more favorably received.
The widespread use of computers and application of biotechnology raises similar resistance among the public today. Whether the public receives an invention readily or resists depends on their awareness and willingness to entertain rapid change. Regardless of the response, technological inventions occurs as part of overall social development, not as an isolated field of activity.
Limits to development.
The concept of inherent limits to development arose mainly because past development was determined largely by availability of physical resources. Humanity relied more on muscle-power than thought-power to accomplish work. That is no longer the case. Today, mental resources are the primary determinant of development. Where people drove a simple bullock cart, they now design ships and aircraft that carry huge loads across immense distances. Humanity has tamed rivers, cleared jungles and even turned arid desert lands into cultivable lands through irrigation.
By using intelligence, society has turned sand into powerful silicon chips that carry huge amounts of information and form the basis of computers. Since there is no inherent limit to the expansion of society's mental resources, the notion of limits to growth cannot be ultimately binding.
Three stages of development.
Society's developmental journey is marked by three stages: physical, vital, and mental. These are not clear-cut stages, but overlap. All three are present in any society at time. One of them is predominant while the other two play subordinate roles. The term 'vital' denotes the emotional and nervous energies that empower society's drive towards accomplishment and express most directly in the interactions between human beings. Before the full development of mind, it is these vital energies that predominate in human personality and gradually yield the ground as the mental element becomes stronger. The speed and circumstances of social transition from one stage to another varies.
Physical stage.
The physical stage is characterized by the domination of the physical element of the human personality. During this phase, society is preoccupied with bare survival and subsistence. People follow tradition strictly and there is little innovation and change. Land is the main asset and productive resource during the physical stage and wealth is measured by the size of land holdings. This is the agrarian and feudal phase of society. Inherited wealth and position rule the roost and there is very little upward mobility. Feudal lords and military chiefs function as the leaders of the society. Commerce and money play a relatively minor role. As innovative thinking and experimental approaches are discouraged, people follow tradition unwaveringly and show little inclination to think outside of established guidelines. Occupational skills are passed down from parent to child by a long process of apprenticeship. 
Guilds restrict the dissemination of trade secrets and technical knowledge. The Church controls the spread of new knowledge and tries to smother new ideas that does not agree with established dogmas. The physical stage comes to an end when the reorganization of agriculture gives scope for commerce and industry to expand. This happened in Europe during the 18th century when political revolutions abolished feudalism and the Industrial Revolution gave a boost to factory production. The shift to the vital and mental stages helps to break the bonds of tradition and inject new dynamism in social life.
Vital stage.
The vital stage of society is infused with dynamism and change. The vital activities of society expand markedly. Society becomes curious, innovative and adventurous. During the vital stage emphasis shifts from interactions with the physical environment to social interactions between people. Trade supplants agriculture as the principal source of wealth.
The dawning of this phase in Europe led to exploratory voyages across the seas leading to the discovery of new lands and an expansion of sea trade. Equally important, society at this time began to more effectively harness the power of money. Commerce took over from agriculture, and money replaced land as the most productive resource. The center of life shifted from the countryside to the towns where opportunities for trade and business were in greater abundance. 
The center of power shifted from the aristocracy to the business class, which employed the growing power of money to gain political influence. During the vital stage, the rule of law becomes more formal and binding, providing a secure and safe environment for business to flourish. Banks, shipping companies and joint-stock companies increase in numbers to make use of the opportunities. Fresh innovative thinking leads to new ways of life that people accept as they prove beneficial. Science and experimental approaches begin to make a headway as the hold of tradition and dogma weaken. Demand for education rises.
As the vital stage matures through the expansion of the commercial and industrial complex, surplus income arises, which prompts people to spend more on items so far considered out of reach. People begin to aspire for luxury and leisure that was not possible when life was at a subsistence level.
Mental stage.
This stage has three essential characteristics: practical, social, and political application of mind. The practical application of mind generates many inventions. The social application of mind leads to new and more effective types of social organization. The political application leads to changes in the political systems that empower the populace to exercise political and human rights in a free and democratic manner. These changes began in the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and gained momentum in the Reformation, which proclaimed the right of individuals to relate directly to God without the mediation of priests. The political application of mind led to the American and French Revolutions, which produced writing that first recognized the rights of the common man and gradually led to the actual enjoyment of these rights.
Organization is a mental invention. Therefore it is not surprising that the mental stage of development is responsible for the formulation of a great number of organizational innovations. Huge business corporations have emerged that make more money than even the total earnings of some small countries. Global networks for transportation and communication now connect the nations of the world within a common unified social fabric for sea and air travel, telecommunications, weather reporting and information exchange.
In addition to spurring technological and organizational innovation, the mental phase is also marked by the increasing power of ideas to change social life. Ethical ideals have been with humanity since the dawn of civilization. But their practical application in daily social life had to wait for the mental stage of development to emerge. The proclamation of human rights and the recognition of the value of the individual have become effective only after the development of mind and spread of education. The 20th century truly emerged as the century of the common man. Political, social, economic and many other rights were extended to more and more sections of humanity with each succeeding decade.
The relative duration of these three stages and the speed of transition from one to another varies from one society to another. However broadly speaking, the essential features of the physical, vital and mental stages of development are strikingly similar and therefore quite recognizable even in societies separated by great distance and having little direct contact with one another. 
Moreover, societies also learn from those who have gone through these transitions before and, therefore, may be able to make the transitions faster and better. When the Netherlands introduced primary education in 1618, it was a pioneering initiative. When Japan did the same thing late in the 19th century, it had the advantage of the experience of the USA and other countries. When many Asian countries initiated primary education in the 1950s after winning independence, they could draw on the vast experience of more developed nations. This is a major reason for the quickening pace of progress.
Natural vs. planned development.
Natural development is distinct from development by government initiatives and planning. Natural development is the spontaneous and unconscious process of development that normally occurs. Planned development is the result of deliberate conscious initiatives by the government to speed development through special programs and policies. Natural development is an unconscious process, since it results from the behavior of countless individuals acting on their own—rather than conscious intention of the community. It is also unconscious in the sense that society achieves the results without being fully conscious of how it did so. 
The natural development of democracy in Europe over the past few centuries can be contrasted with the conscious effort to introduce democratic forms of government in former colonial nations after World War II. Planned development is also largely unconscious: the goals may be conscious, but the most effective means for achieving them may remain poorly understood. Planned development can become fully conscious only when the process of development itself is fully understood. While in planned development the government is the initiator in the natural version it is private individuals or groups that are responsible for the initiative. Whoever initiates, the principles and policies are the same and success is assured only when the conditions and right principles are followed.
India's Green Revolution.
The Green Revolution in India is a good example of a planned development initiative that brings out all the essential features of the development process. Until 1960 agriculture in India did not differ markedly from what it had been during the colonial period beginning 200 years ago. The Green Revolution is usually described as the introduction of hybrid varieties of wheat and rice, but the adoption of hybrids alone is not sufficient to explain the phenomenal achievements of the Green Revolution. Success was made possible by a comprehensive and well-coordinated program involving multiple changes in the way society managed the production of food.
Prior to the Green Revolution, Indian agriculture was largely based on subsistence-level farming, which did not generate sufficient production to meet the country's food requirements. In the past, this led to periodic food shortages and famines, which were managed by huge imports from abroad. The Green Revolution was an attempt to break out of this condition and increase food production to make the country self-sufficient. 
The Indian government realized that it needed to do many things to win the cooperation of Indian farmers to make the green revolution successful. First, the government had to convince farmers to accept the hybrid varieties that would lead to increased yields. Then, they had to assure farmers that increased production would not drive down prices as bumper harvests had done in the past. The government had to ensure a supply of quality seeds, fertilizers, and provide adequate storage space. It also had to train a network of extension agents to train farmers to cultivate their fields with new methods.
The government accomplished all this by setting up many new organizations. It set up the Food Corporation to buy food grains from surplus production areas and distribute it in areas with shortages. It constituted an Agricultural Pricing Commission to ensure a minimum floor price to farmers so that there was no disincentive for increased production. Seed and fertilizer corporations were formed to ensure supply of good quality seeds and timely supply of fertilizers, etc. Agricultural scientists were motivated to do their work better by the offer of better pay scales and greater infrastructural facilities.
On top of all this the government established 100,000 demonstration plots across the country to prove to the farmers that the hybrid varieties were indeed more productive.
The Green Revolution succeeded not only because it was a planned initiative, but also because it was a conscious and well-conceived program. It adopted the right approaches and was alive to the needs and aspirations of the farmers. Therefore it was well received. The planning and awareness exhibited in the project helped create a higher level organization that could harness the enthusiasm and energies of the farmers more effectively.
Planned development differs from natural development, in the sense that it is a program sponsored by the government to accelerate the development process. The success of a planned initiative depends on its ability to ensure the terms and conditions that help the natural process succeed. Many planned government initiatives fail because they begin without proper understanding of the conditions necessary for their fulfilment. During the 1960s only the Government of India had the resources necessary to launch a massive program of such dimensions. But today, India's private sector is perhaps even better equipped than government to bring about rapid development as illustrated by the dramatic expansion of the country's IT industry.
The Green Revolution was so successful that it helped India achieve food self-sufficiency within five years and double food production within ten years. This was totally unexpected, and took even many experts by surprise. More than the increased food production, the elevation of agricultural operation in India to a higher level of organization was a more noteworthy achievement. It was a perfect demonstration of the success that a planned initiative could achieve when implemented with the required knowledge and awareness.

Sid Jenkins

Sidney "Sid" Jenkins is a fictional character in the television series "Skins" portrayed by Mike Bailey. In the first series, Sid is portrayed as a nice guy stereotype, an unlucky virgin who is nervous around girls, and has low self-esteem. Tony Stonem (his best friend) is his role model, whom he frequently looks up to. However, by the second series, Sid is more dependable and following Tony's accident, becomes more confident in his own skin, leading him to have sexual relationships with both Cassie Ainsworth and Michelle Richardson, as well as standing up for himself more often.
Characterisation.
Sid is initially portrayed as a virgin who has a crush on his best friend Tony Stonem's girlfriend, Michelle Richardson, although he later realises that his true feelings are for Cassie Ainsworth. Manipulated by Tony, he is frequently unlucky; losing an expensive amount of cannabis, getting beaten up by Jal Fazer's brothers, getting urinated on by a dog and a homeless person. He is also at first oblivious to the machinations of his best friend who, aware of Sid's undying adoration of Michelle, exploits it for his amusement. Despite this, he seems, at least in earlier episodes, to idolise Tony, replying to the question 'Is that all you do Sid, hang around with Tony?' with 'pretty much'.
Sid is generally portrayed as a character with good intentions, juxtaposed with Tony's self-serving egotism. He is extremely loyal towards his friends, including Tony and Anwar Kharral, who frequently abuse his loyalty and cause him a great deal of difficulty. Sid's nice guy attitude is quick to win the affections of Cassie, but Sid is oblivious, which leads to him hurting her feelings on numerous occasions. Sid is also very intelligent but underperforms in school because he is easily distracted and lacks direction. When faced with failing his coursework however, Sid is able to write an entire history dissertation in one night. Like his father Mark, Sid is good with finances. Sid also has a fair cooking ability. His characterisation is often completed by his choice of clothes, including a bright yellow 'Mega Dog' T-shirt, which includes a button which when pressed produces a 'Mega Dog' catchphrase from a sewn on speaker.
In an interview with Sky, Mike says:
It could be inferred from the meek manner in which Sid accepts the manipulation of Tony, and the anger of his Scottish father Mark, that Sid is weak, and his self-esteem is certainly low. But on the occasions when it is most needed, he shows remarkable strength of character, especially in the episode "Sid". When Sid's father fails to prevent his mother leaving, Sid explodes with anger, and although his mother never moves back in permanently, this demonstration of strength improves Sid's relationship with his father in the long run. Also, Sid goes on a 'mission of love' to profess his love to Cassie in the final episode of the first series, and later in the second series where he searches for her in New York.
In the series 2 finale, it is shown that Sid attains a B and two C's on his A-level finals, even though he didn't apply to University.
Character history.
Series 1.
In "Tony" he is promised by Tony that he will lose his virginity to Cassie before he turns seventeen. He also loses the cannabis for Abigail Stock's party, putting drug dealer Madison Twatter phd out to find him. Sid pines for Michelle, unaware of Cassie's presence. In "Cassie", Cassie comes to think Sid loves her and is sending her messages saying to eat, but later realises it's all in her head. Madison Twatter becomes a substitute teacher at Sid's school. In "Jal", Madison corners Sid and Jal, about to beat up Sid, smashes Jal's clarinet as a warning. Jal's brothers, thinking he is the problem, nearly beat up Sid before chasing after Madison and his associate.
In "Sid", Cassie asks him on a date, only for him to be grounded by his father Mark and has to cancel the date. When later he is offered by Tony a chance to see Michelle, he takes it. After being beaten up by chav girls, he finds Cassie waiting at his house, upset he had stood her up. She tries to be positive, but is hurt and jealous that Michelle has his love without earning it. After Tony makes Sid believe he can have Michelle, he takes her back before his eyes, affirming his power over them both. Cassie, distraught by Sid's cancelling of their date takes an overdose of pills combined with vodka, and ends up in hospital, accompanied by Jal Fazer, who places the blame squarely with Sid.
In "Maxxie and Anwar", he helps Anwar liberate a girl from what they believe to be her abusive father, although he turns out to be her husband. He also sees a picture of Cassie drawn by Maxxie Oliver, remarking on how beautiful he has made her look. "Michelle" is the episode where Sid realises he really wants Cassie. After a rebounding Michelle attempts to have sex with him, he realises that his love for her is at a level where she can only be his friend. They then both go to find Cassie at her rehab clinic, to tell her. After Sid confesses he likes her, she reveals her new boyfriend, also at the clinic.
In "Effy", Sid is dragged by Tony to help him find his missing sister, Effy Stonem. Eventually, Sid and Tony come to blows, deriding each other's perceived character flaws: Tony sees Sid as wishing to emulate him, whereas Sid sees Tony as something he would never want to become. Later, Sid sees Cassie, agrees to meet with her, and the two finally kiss. Their reunion is cut short by a call from Michelle, which prompts him to try to find Tony and Effy who may be in danger. After he takes Tony and Effy to the hospital, he is the one to defend Tony, who he refers to as his best friend, against his parents' accusations.
Sid spends the beginning of the first series finale wondering about Cassie and attempts to write a letter explaining how much he loves her. Sid hurriedly dresses in mismatching clothes and rushes to Cassie's rehab clinic, just after she leaves in a taxi. In the clinic, the nurse locks Sid in a padded room, deducing that Sid needs their help. Tony comes to his aid and Sid is released from the clinic and the two then look for Cassie. At the end of the episode, it's revealed after Sid left Anwar's party he was meeting with Cassie, who is sitting on a bench overlooking Bristol. He sits besides her, where they then hold hands.
Series 2.
In the second series, Sid's relationship with Cassie deteriorates and he begins to distance himself from Tony, who has awakened from his coma and is slowly recovering from the brain damage inflicted by his accident. In "Tony and Maxxie", Sid refuses to visit Tony, who becomes frustrated by the lack of contact from his former best friend. In the "Lost Weeks", web episodes, it is revealed that Sid was the one who attended to Tony in hospital following the accident, reading entire novels out loud to a comatose Tony and even recording messages to help "wake" him up.
Sid also struggles with not being able to see Cassie. Sid reveals that he lost his virginity to Cassie before she moved to Scotland, but there is a lack of contact between them, which Sid resents.
In "Sid", he misinterprets Cassie's closeness with her gay Scottish friend and angrily accuses her of cheating on him, later destroying the laptop he used to communicate with her. In the same episode, a family visit proves too much for Mark to take and he dies, his body discovered by Sid the next morning. Still in shock, Sid goes to school as usual, but finally breaks down in front of Tony while at a concert. The two end up going back to Sid's house together to deal with the situation, which seems to patch up their damaged friendship. At the end of the episode, Sid is seen on a train, presumably headed to Scotland to see Cassie. At the same time, Cassie is seen taking a train in the opposite direction, presumably to visit Sid in Bristol.
In "Michelle", a grieving Sid ends up having sex with his longstanding crush Michelle - who has also given up on Tony - while on a camping trip. Sid and Michelle are soon caught kissing in Sid's bedroom by Cassie, who had returned from Scotland to see Sid.
In "Chris", Cassie angrily confront Sid and Michelle in front of their friends after running into the couple at a club. This also exposes Sid and Michelle's new relationship to Tony, who seems hurt by it. Sid attempts to explain things, but Cassie slaps him, telling him that he can't do whatever he wants even though his father is dead.
In "Tony", Sid goes with Michelle to try to make amends with Tony, but it proves difficult as Tony is hiding under his bed. After coming back from the university interview, Tony finds Sid and Michelle having sex in the toilets of a club, where he tells them he loves them both, and even kisses Sid, saying he loves him even though he's a "useless fucker". Tony also tells Sid that he neither loves nor belongs with Michelle, he belongs with Cassie.
In "Effy", Sid has to do Effy's art coursework in exchange for her "Sorting Out his Fucking Soap Opera". When he finishes, after describing his emotion as "Hopeless" in her CW, sees pictures of Cassie kissing another boy, which Effy had taken and attached to him. Horrified, Sid goes to Cassie's house and finally confronts her. The two reconcile.
In the series two finale, Sid is told by Chris's dad that the gang can not attend the funeral so he and Tony steal Chris's coffin. They return it when Jal and Michelle demand that they do so. Sid is forgiven by Tony and given a ticket to New York to find Cassie. Tony hugs him and tells him to lose the hat as it "makes you look retarded" and that he always "loved him best". He arrives in New York with a photograph of Cassie and eventually walks past the restaurant where she is working. He is turning his head to face the window where he will undoubtedly see her standing when the episode ends.
Series 3.
In the first episode of series 3, JJ, Freddie and Cook opened Sid's locker, discovering his beanie, the "Asian Fanny Fun" magazine as well as his name written inside. Cook acknowledges Sid, stating "I don't know who this Sid guy is, but he has a great taste in gash."
All of Sid's possessions in the locker are then set on fire by Cook as part of a dare concocted by Effy.
Series 5.
In the sixth episode of series 5, "Asian Fanny Fun" appears again, a reference to Sid.
Series 7.
In "Skins Pure", Cassie returns to London from America. Whether Sid found her in New York or not is not directly confirmed, but Cassie states in a conversation with her roommate that before moving to London she was traveling around America with a boy, but decided to end the relationship because it couldn't go any further. Cassie stated that if the relationship didn't end, it would have lasted forever. Cassie does not give the boy's name, but "Skins" co-creator Bryan Elsley, who wrote the episode, confirmed that this was intended as a reference to Sid.

Governor General Loudon (ship)

Governor General Loudon () was a mail steamer and excursion vessel which survived the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa.
Ship history.
The ship was built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, in 1875 and operated by the "Nederlandsch Indische Stoomboot Maatschappij" ("Netherlands Indies Steamship Company") until 1891, when the assets and business of the company was taken over by the "Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij" ("Royal Packet Navigation Company"). She was named after James Loudon (1824–1900), a Dutch politician and governor of the Dutch East Indies (1872-1875).
In 1883, while captained by Johan Lindeman, the ship was present at the eruption of Krakatoa and survived the subsequent tsunami when the captain steered the ship head on into the wave. After the wave passed, pyroclastic airfall was the ship's biggest enemy. A foot of ash could have made the ship capsize, but the people on board survived because the crew kept the decks clear while the captain moved the passengers into the ship's hold to maintain stability.
After surviving the tsunami caused by the eruption of Krakatoa, the ship was stranded and lost off the Tengga Batoe reef south of Saleier in 1898.

Chom Thong District, Chiang Mai Province

Chom Thong (; ) is a district ("amphoe") in the southern part of Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand.
History.
According to the legend of "Wat" Phra That Si Chom Thong Worawihan, the location of the temple is on a small hill which looks similar to a termite hill ("Chom Pluak" in Thai). The hill is covered by "Thong Kwao" or Bastard teak ("Butea monosperma") and "Thong Lang" or Coral trees ("Erythrina variegata") forest. Thus the people called the hill Chom Thong.
After Lord Buddha entered parinirvana, King Asoka the Great visited the hill to place Buddha's relics there. The temple was built on the hill and named Wat Phra That Chom Thong in 1451. Later the temple was upgraded to be Royal temple and at the same time renamed to Wat Phra That Si Chom Thong Worawihan.
The government created a district in the area in 1900 and named the new district Chom Thong following the legend. The district office was originally located in Ban Tha Sala, Tambon Khuang Pao. In 1933 the office was moved to the southwest of Wat Phra That Chom Thong.
Geography.
Neighbouring districts are (from the south clockwise) Hot, Mae Chaem, Mae Wang, Doi Lo of Chiang Mai Province, Wiang Nong Long and Ban Hong of Lamphun Province.
The important river is the Ping River.
The Doi Inthanon National Park is located in the district.
Administration.
The district is subdivided into 6 subdistricts ("tambon"), which are further subdivided into 106 villages ("muban"). Chom Thong is a township ("thesaban tambon"), which covers parts of "tambon" Ban Luang, Khuan Pao and Doi Kaeo. There are further 6 Tambon administrative organizations (TAO).
Missing numbers are "tambon" which now form Doi Lo district.

<doc id="9667106" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667106" title="Minimal polynomial (field theory)">
Minimal polynomial (field theory)

In field theory, a branch of mathematics, a minimal polynomial is defined relative to a field extension "E/F" and an element of the extension field "E". The minimal polynomial of an element, if it exists, is a member of "F"["x"], the ring of polynomials in the variable "x" with coefficients in "F". Given an element "α" of "E", let "J""α" be the set of all polynomials "f"("x") in "F"["x"] such that "f"("α") = 0. The element "α" is called a root or zero of each polynomial in "J""α". The set "J""α" is so named because it is an ideal of "F"["x"]. The zero polynomial, whose every coefficient is 0, is in every "J""α" since 0"α""i" = 0 for all "α" and "i". This makes the zero polynomial useless for classifying different values of "α" into types, so it is excepted. If there are any non-zero polynomials in "J""α", then "α" is called an algebraic element over "F", and there exists a monic polynomial of least degree in "J""α". This is the minimal polynomial of "α" with respect to "E"/"F". It is unique and irreducible over "F". If the zero polynomial is the only member of "J""α", then "α" is called a transcendental element over "F" and has no minimal polynomial with respect to "E"/"F".
Minimal polynomials are useful for constructing and analyzing field extensions. When "α" is algebraic with minimal polynomial "a"("x"), the smallest field that contains both "F" and "α" is isomorphic to the quotient ring "F"["x"]/⟨"a"("x")⟩, where ⟨"a"("x")⟩ is the ideal of "F"["x"] generated by "a"("x"). Minimal polynomials are also used to define conjugate elements.
Definition.
Let "E"/"F" be a field extension, α an element of "E", and "F"["x"] the ring of polynomials in "x" over "F". The minimal polynomial of "α" is the monic polynomial of least degree among all polynomials in "F"["x"] having "α" as a root; it exists when "α" is algebraic over "F", that is, when "f"("α") = 0 for some non-zero polynomial "f"("x") in "F"["x"].
Uniqueness.
Let "a"("x") be the minimal polynomial of "α" with respect to "E"/"F". The uniqueness of "a"("x") is established by considering the ring homomorphism sub"α" from "F"["x"] to "E" that substitutes "α" for "x", that is, sub"α"("f"("x")) = "f"("α"). The kernel of sub"α", ker(sub"α"), is the set of all polynomials in "F"["x"] that have "α" as a root. That is, ker(sub"α") = "J""α" from above. Since sub"α" is a ring homomorphism, ker(sub"α") is an ideal of "F"["x"]. Since "F"["x"] is a principal ring whenever "F" is a field, there is at least one polynomial in ker(sub"α") that generates ker(sub"α"). Such a polynomial will have least degree among all non-zero polynomials in ker(sub"α"), and "a"("x") is taken to be the unique monic polynomial among these.
Properties.
A minimal polynomial is irreducible. Let "E"/"F" be a field extension over "F" as above, α ∈ "E", and "f" ∈ "F"["x"] a minimal polynomial for α. Suppose "f" = "gh", where "g,h" ∈ "F"["x"] are of lower degree than "f". Now "f(α)" = 0. Since fields are also integral domains, we have "g"("α") = 0 or "h"("α") = 0. This contradicts the minimality of the degree of "f". Thus minimal polynomials are irreducible.
Examples.
If "F" = Q, "E" = R, "α" = √, then the minimal polynomial for "α" is "a"("x") = "x"2 − 2. The base field "F" is important as it determines the possibilities for the coefficients of "a"("x"). For instance, if we take "F" = R, then the minimal polynomial for "α" = √ is "a"("x") = "x" − √.
If "α" = √ + √, then the minimal polynomial in Q["x"] is "a"("x") = "x"4 − 10"x"2 + 1 = ("x" − √ − √)("x" + √ − √)("x" − √ + √)("x" + √ + √).
The minimal polynomial in Q["x"] of the sum of the square roots of the first "n" prime numbers is constructed analogously, and is called a Swinnerton-Dyer polynomial.
The minimal polynomials in Q["x"] of roots of unity are the cyclotomic polynomials.

Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)

In linear algebra, the minimal polynomial of an matrix over a field is the monic polynomial over of least degree such that . Any other polynomial with is a (polynomial) multiple of .
The following three statements are equivalent:
The multiplicity of a root of is the largest power such that "strictly" contains . In other words, increasing the exponent up to will give ever larger kernels, but further increasing will just give the same kernel.
If the field is not algebraically closed, then the minimal and characteristic polynomials need not factor according to their roots (in ) alone, in other words they may have irreducible polynomial factors of degree greater than . For irreducible polynomials one has similar equivalences:
Like the characteristic polynomial, the minimal polynomial does not depend on the base field, in other words considering the matrix as one with coefficients in a larger field does not change the minimal polynomial. The reason is somewhat different from for the characteristic polynomial (where it is immediate from the definition of determinants), namely the fact that the minimal polynomial is determined by the relations of linear dependence between the powers of : extending the base field will not introduce any new such relations (nor of course will it remove existing ones).
The minimal polynomial is often the same as the characteristic polynomial, but not always. For example, if is a multiple of the identity matrix, then its minimal polynomial is since the kernel of is already the entire space; on the other hand its characteristic polynomial is (the only eigenvalue is , and the degree of the characteristic polynomial is always equal to the dimension of the space). The minimal polynomial always divides the characteristic polynomial, which is one way of formulating the Cayley–Hamilton theorem (for the case of matrices over a field).
Formal definition.
Given an endomorphism on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field , let be the set defined as 
where is the space of all polynomials over the field . is a proper ideal of . Then the minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial which generates . Thus it must be the monic polynomial of least degree in .
Applications.
An endomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space over a field is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial factors completely over into "distinct" linear factors. The fact that there is only one factor for every eigenvalue means that the generalized eigenspace for is the same as the eigenspace for : every Jordan block has size . More generally, if satisfies a polynomial equation where factors into distinct linear factors over , then it will be diagonalizable: its minimal polynomial is a divisor of and therefore also factors into distinct linear factors. In particular one has:
These case can also be proved directly, but the minimal polynomial gives a unified perspective and proof.
Computation.
For a vector in define:
This definition satisfies the properties of a proper ideal. Let be the monic polynomial which generates it.
Example.
Define to be the endomorphism of with matrix, on the canonical basis,
Taking the first canonical basis vector and its repeated images by one obtains
of which the first three are easily seen to be linearly independent, and therefore span all of . The last one then necessarily is a linear combination of the first three, in fact
so that: 
This is in fact also the minimal polynomial and the characteristic polynomial : indeed divides which divides , and since the first and last are of degree and all are monic, they must all be the same. Another reason is that in general if any polynomial in annihilates a vector , then it also annihilates (just apply to the equation that says that it annihilates ), and therefore by iteration it annihilates the entire space generated by the iterated images by of ; in the current case we have seen that for that space is all of , so . Indeed one verifies for the full matrix that is the null matrix:

Marsovin

The Marsovin Ltd. is Malta's largest producer of premium wine, pressing approximately 50% to 55% of locally grown grapes. It was founded in 1919 and is situated in Paola [http://www.marsovin.com].
The high standard of Marsovin wines is attributed partly to Malta’s favourable climatic conditions but also to the stringent controls maintained by experts from the viticultural aspect to the vinification process in order to ensure that the optimum level of quality is achieved. Such quality has also been recognised by independent parties through the years when Marsovin wines have been put to the test by participating in international competitions and awarded gold,silver and bronze medals. Such comepetitions include Efffervescents du Monde, International Wine Challenge, Challenge du Vin, Emozioni del Mondo amongst others. 
Today, Marsovin owns 199.7 tumoli of land which make up their five Estates, testimony to Marsovin’s commitment to the culture of wine. These Estates are owned by Marsovin and the Cassar family and are specifically intended for the production of premium quality, single-estate wines. Over the recent years Marsovin has also introduced several wines into its portfolio all of which are produced from contracted land, owned by Maltese and Gozitan who produce grapes according to Marsovin’s specifications, Marsovin currently contracts a total of 1116 tumoli/125 hectares.
Marsovin has an extensive variety of brands in its portfolio from table wines all the way through to Single Vineyard, Methode Traditionnelle and high profile sweet wines. Due to the fact that Marsovin has been established from so many years, since 1919, the winery has been in the fortunate position where it could slowly build up an extensive range of wines for different palates and budgets. These wines are classified either as table wines, I.G.T Maltese islands, D.O.K Malta or Gozo, D.O.K Superior, Single Vineyard Estate wines and Boutique wines.
Marsovin has been the pioneer in wine making in Malta during the course of its history. In the early 70’s Marsovin was the first to come out with a Mono varietals range of wines, which at the time stood as Malta’s most premium wine. In the early Marsovin planted its largest ever vineyard in the south of Malta, Marnisi between Żejtun and Marsaxlokk. This vineyard then produced two wines of noble character, Antonin and Marnisi both of which well known in Malta as two of the leading premium red wines on the island.
Following this Marsovin moved onto its next great achievement, the production of the first ever Brut, methode classique from the chardonnay grape variety, Cassar De Malte. This project started off in 1997 to then be launched at the Millennium.
Needless to say that in between these great milestones for the winery, Marsovin also introduced other very significant brands such as Grand Maitre which was launched in 1999, this wine today is recognized by many wine enthusiasts on the island as Malta's most distinguished premium red wine.
Marsovin is the only wine maker in Malta that produces 'champagne'. The Cassar de Malte is vinified using the same procedures of the "methode traditionnelle" used to create champagne but nevertheless cannot be labelled as Champagne because the terms ‘champagne’ and" 'methode champegnoise' "are restricted to those wines produced by the "methode traditionelle" in the confines of the Champagne region in France. This Marsovin wine takes its name from the wine-making family, in keeping with tradition. It is made from Chardonnay grapes harvested from the family’s private 15-tumolo estate in Wardija, where there are 7,500 vines. No more than 8,000 bottles are produced from each harvest, and the process takes more than two years, including two fermentations and 15 months in which the bottles are left to lie on lees, allowing the conversion of yeast into sediment. The bottles are placed on special racks called pupitres were they are turned by hand every day for four weeks in a process called riddling or remuage in French, so that the sediment collects in the neck, from where it is finally removed to allow the addition of the liqueur d’espedition, which determines its classification as Brut.
Today Marsovin has a presence in the United States Of America, Japan, China, Hong Kong and ships directly to end-consumers world wide.
History.
After World War I Chev. Anthony Cassar founded a wine company with the name of "A. & G. Cassar". Since 1956 the firm still owned by the Cassar family has been called "Marsovin Ltd.". In the beginning, only imported grapes were pressed, but since the 1950s Marsovin has its own vineyards [http://www.marsovin.com.mt, where red and white grapes are grown, mostly French types.

Jean Lombard (26 September 1854 – 17 July 1891) was a French novelist of the late nineteenth century. 
Lombard was born in Toulon, Var. His work, with its themes of orientalism, androgyny and paganism, had deep affiliations with the Decadent movement in literature. Although almost completely forgotten today, he influenced contemporaries such as Rachilde and Jean Lorrain. His best-known work, based on the Roman emperor Heliogabalus, is "L'agonie" (1888), for which Octave Mirbeau wrote a preface. According to William Sharp, Lombard died in 1891 in poverty, bordering on starvation.

Michelle Richardson

Michelle "Chelle" Richardson is a fictional character in the British teen drama "Skins". She is played by April Pearson.
Characterisation.
Michelle is portrayed initially as primarily interested in serving her boyfriend Tony Stonem's needs and in "looking shaggable" which she places as her primary function, compared with Jal Fazer's interest in the clarinet. She is very confident in her appearance; on the "Skins" website in a Myspace-style "about me" section, she protests that her photos have not been Photoshopped, and that she is "this gorgeous in real life". She is well aware that Tony's friend, Sid is in love with her, and sometimes wonders if he would be a better boyfriend than Tony. She is often angry at Tony for him calling her "nips" in reference to her nipples, and protesting that her breasts are uneven.
Despite lack of academic interest, she is a very talented linguist. It is stated that she is very talented with languages and seems to be fluent in French and Spanish. Also, in the first episode of Series One, she seems to understand Italian when it is spoken near her. It is also hinted in the last episode of series 2 that her oldest/longest known friend is Chris Miles when she says she first met him when she was 7. However, on the Skins website she states that she and her best friend Jal have been in the same class since they were 4.
On Michelle's MySpace page she says that her favourite musicians are Stevie Nicks, Peaches, and Eminem, but she doesn't like Keane and James Blunt. Her favourite films are Mean Girls, Emperor's New Groove, and The Last Seduction, and her favourite television shows are One Tree Hill, Scrubs, and Extreme Makeover; stating the latter brings her to tears. 
Michelle was one of the original characters from Jamie Brittain's original concept for the show. He has stated in an interview that her name was originally Annie. She, Sid and Tony were the characters in Brittain's novel he wrote as a teenager, but never finished. Jamie Brittain has said that while his original story line wasn't strong enough, he believed the characters were strong enough to carry in a television series.
Character history.
Series 1.
In the first episode Michelle has convinced one of her best friends, Cassie Ainsworth, to take friend Sid's virginity, at her boyfriend Tony's request. In "Jal" she starts to worry about Tony's interest in posh girl Abigail Stock, and in "Chris" she laments that she feels Tony who she loves will never love her in the way Sid does. In "Sid", as an experiment, Tony kisses Abigail at a concert before Michelle's eyes to prompt her to angrily break up with him, especially when she "catches" him fondling Abigail backstage. After a brief run in with some chav girls where she's assaulted, emotional and upset, she tells Sid she believes he was in on her humiliation and becomes angry with him as well. Tony urges Sid to try to score with Michelle on the rebound, and just as Michelle appears to find comfort in him, Tony appears and forces Sid to watch as he takes Michelle back instantly, affirming his power over them both.
In "Maxxie and Anwar" she and her best friend Jal attempt to reconnect while on a school trip in Russia, going out to a bar and getting incredibly drunk. Believing she is passed out, Tony attempts to seduce Maxxie Oliver although Michelle is in the same room. However, she is completely conscious, and witnesses everything up until Maxxie abruptly stops, just before Tony tries to go further sexually. The next day on the plane home, Michelle doesn't confront Tony immediately, but rather tries to get him to tell her first by subtly probing him, but he fails to confess.
Michelle finally breaks up with Tony at the start of the next episode "Michelle". When Jal questions if Tony cheated "again", Michelle is hurt when she finds out that Jal has known about Tony's past infidelity (which includes Abigail, who Tony promised he never cheated with), and has never told her. Maxxie also comes to Michelle, where he apologises and begs her not to tell anybody what had happened in Russia. Although Michelle becomes depressed and even gets caught by Angie drinking in the school supply room, she is adamant about not seeing Tony, and has been ignoring his pursuits to get her back. Meanwhile at home she is becoming hugely annoyed with her mother's latest husband Malcolm, feeling that he uses her mother, in addition to his rude habits.
At school she gets the chance to confront Abigail, and is introduced to Abi's brother, Josh. Tony later tries to talk to Michelle, and she asks him to "prove" that he loves her completely, but he is unconvincing. Michelle then turns to Sid on the rebound, as she is well aware that he has been in love with her for many years. She discovers that Sid, surprisingly, has come to love her as just a friend, so she takes him to see Cassie — Sid's true love — who has gone back into rehab after a suicide attempt. At the rehab clinic, she bumps into Josh once again, who asks her out on a date.
Michelle finds that she genuinely enjoys her time with Josh, and is able to have an equal conversation with him, unlike Tony who she describes as difficult to talk to. She learns that Josh's mother, a psychiatrist, medicates him, but otherwise their relationship progresses nicely. Meanwhile Tony has been spying on her, and eventually sabotages her and Josh's developing relationship by sending lurid pictures of Abigail from Josh's phone to Michelle. Michelle finds comfort with Jal, but is both distraught and disgusted with Josh—figuring the photos were related to his mental illness. Later, after helping to repair her mother and stepfather's hollow relationship, Tony makes another futile attempt to regain Michelle as his girlfriend, in spite of a slightly better attempt to explain that he loves her—however Michelle rejects him.
In the series finale, Michelle briefly visits Tony's sister Effy Stonem, who was just recently involved in an incident orchestrated by Josh to get back at Tony for the events in the episode "Michelle". Although Effy doesn't speak, Michelle asks her why Tony hurt her, but Effy genuinely doesn't know. Michelle shows Effy some affection before leaving. Later in the episode Michelle attends with Jal to friend Anwar Kharral's 17th birthday party. Tony comes as well, along with Effy, but neither of them actually go inside. Effy calls Tony a "wanker" for hurting Michelle, and he finally calls her on his phone to confess his love to her. Michelle listens to the phone while crying, and just as Tony crosses the street, he is hit by a bus. Michelle can be seen calling presumably an ambulance at the end of the episode.
Series 2.
In the second series, we learn that Michelle has had no contact with Tony during the six months after his accident. Instead she has been drinking at bars, flirting with men, and presumably having sex as well. It's clear that she is confused how to approach the situation with Tony, although she is quite aware that what she has been doing is wrong. In addition to her problems with Tony, her relationship with Sid is strained, an example of this being seen when Sid catches Michelle dancing with two guys and snogging at a club, to which she runs away guilty and humiliated having been seen. Later in the episode, through an emotional confession to Sid, we learn that Michelle has gone to seen Tony only once since the accident.
School eventually resumes and Michelle is now in her final year of college. In an Unseen Skins episode, Maxxie encourages Michelle to sign up for the school play ("Osama! The Musical"). Although Michelle declines because of stage fright, she eventually auditions where she shows she has an aptitude for singing, and eventually gets the lead role alongside Maxxie. During a kissing scene during rehearsal between Maxxie, Sketch -- Maxxie's stalker -- puts Michelle's life into danger when she purposely drops a heavy stage light out of jealousy.
Later at a costume fund raising party for Drama, Michelle wears a costume modeled on Princess Leia, only to be insulted by Abigail, who is also dressed as Leia. To make matters worse she came to the party with Tony, who is dressed as Luke Skywalker. Michelle is hurt that Tony dressed "for" Abigail, although Tony is unclear himself of the circumstances of his costume, let alone his relationship with Abigail. Michelle takes Tony into a private area where she confronts Tony as to why he took Abigail to the party. We learn that Abigail has been convincing Tony that she is his girlfriend, not Michelle. After both a failed attempt at seducing Tony and being deeply hurt that Tony doesn't remember her, Michelle comes to realisation that Tony isn't the same person anymore.
When word gets around that Sketch was assaulted by their Drama teacher Bruce (a false story Sketch made up), Michelle shows kindness and compassion when she attempts to befriend her and invites her to sit with her during lunch. Michelle learns Sketch's true nature only when she gives her pills that make her sick, causing her to drop out of the school play just moments before the show (and subsequently fulfilling the role).
In episode 4 Michelle once again asks Tony how much he remembers, however he doesn't remember much if anything about their relationship at all. When Michelle tries to seduce Tony, Tony has developed an erectile dysfunction, which frustrates Michelle and prompts her to slap him, blaming him for his accident and subsequent condition. Although she apologises, she tells Tony she cannot wait for him and the two officially end their relationship. Before leaving Tony gives her an early birthday gift, and Michelle invites him along on her birthday camping trip, to which he declines.
Meanwhile, we learn that her mother has ended her relationship with Malcolm, and has recently married one of her clients, Ted. They have also moved in with him into his newly renovated upscale home, which Michelle dislikes greatly. To make matters worse, Ted has a spoiled daughter named Scarlett -- who are alarmingly too close for comfort for Michelle—who decides she'd move in as well.
At school, Scarlett wins Michelle's friends over with her charm and sex appeal. When she invites herself on the camping trip, offering the use of her car, Michelle feels annoyed. On the trip she feels alone and irritated with Scarlett's presence there, and finds comfort from both Sid and Maxxie. Later that night she catches Scarlett trying to seduce Sid, and finally decides to confront her. However she learns that Scarlett isn't as much of a bad person as she pretends to be, and goes after Sid instead.
In an intense moment, Sid expresses his grief to Michelle over his recently deceased father, and the two of them kiss and make love for the first time with each other on the beach. They decide to keep their relationship private, feeling that they're not ready to tell their friends, and preferring to spend more time with each other. However after returning to Sid's home where they passionately attempt to have sex in Sid's bedroom, they're interrupted by Sid's girlfriend Cassie, who has been watching the entire time from Sid's bed.
Cassie blatantly announces to the gang of Michelle and Sid's new relationship, much to everyone's surprise. Tony pretends not to care, however Jal is angered that Michelle didn't tell her since she's her best friend. Michelle and Sid remain, even if apologetically, together however.
It isn't until one night at a club, at the end of the episode "Tony", Tony confronts Michelle and Sid in the bathroom stall during sex. Tony, who is finally ready, tells Michelle that they're meant to be together, opposed to her and Sid, who is meant to be with Cassie. Sid admits that he isn't in love with Michelle anymore, leaving Michelle both shocked at Sid's change of heart and Tony's sudden determination.
In "Effy", Tony spends the episode trying to reach Michelle, who is ignoring his many phone calls and text messages. It is apparent that she wants nothing to do with him, especially after he ruined her relationship, and even sends the watch he got her for her birthday back to him. However Effy gets the watch fixed, engraved with the word "forever", and sends it back to Michelle, finally softening Michelle enough to answer Tony's phone call. At the very end of the episode she answers the phone, with merely "I love you too" before hanging it up again.
In the next two episodes leading up to the finale we learn that Michelle and Tony are trying to take their relationship "slow" and to not "make a thing of it". She's worried about their relationship what with exams interfering, and Jal's time of need ever since the death of friend Chris, keeping them apart. Although she proclaims to still be angry about the situation, her and Tony seem genuinely happy together, if not a bit sheepish in each other's presence. Tony can be seen bringing her flowers, walking her to class, and carrying her books—their relationship is progressing.
However, in the finale of the series, Michelle receives her A-levels: 2 As and 1 B, and she has plans to further her studies at York, whereas Tony plans on attending Cardiff. There is tension between the two as they inwardly struggle how they'll deal with their relationship, what with their plans on going to separate universities. In the last moments of the series' finale, Michelle and Tony reflect on their relationship in a private moment, leaving the audience dubious whether they're going to continue their relationship or say goodbye forever.

John Bull (magazine)

The original John Bull was a Sunday newspaper established in the City, London EC4, by Theodore Hook in 1820.
Publication dates.
It was a popular periodical that continued in production through July 1892. Titles with the same name were being published at least until 1957
A magazine of that name was reportedly being published in 1899 and 1903. Horatio Bottomley an MP for the Liberal Party, became the publisher of the magazine on 12 May 1906. It continued production during the First World War.
In 1920, the company was merged into Odhams Press. In 1923, the magazine was said to be 'ultra patriotic'. Around that time, the editor was Geoffrey Williamson. The magazine was in print in 1931, 1939 and 1944.
The magazine was published by Odhams from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Similar in style to the iconic American magazine "The Saturday Evening Post", the John Bull covers encapsulated post-war Britain and employed some of Britain's finest illustrators. They also included short stories by major British authors such as H. E. Bates, Agatha Christie, Nicholas Monsarrat, N. J. Crisp, Gerald Kersh, J. B. Priestley and C. S. Forester. During its run it incorporated other magazines such as The Illustrated, Passing Show, News Review and Everybody's Weekly. At one point, its picture editor was Elkan Allan; John Sandilands also worked for it.
End of publication.
Following a sharp drop in circulation, the magazine was renamed "Today, The New John Bull" in 1960. It attempted to appeal to a younger readership with features on aspects of youth culture, such as rock and roll. In 1964, its circulation was just over 700,000, but advertising revenue did not meet its costs, and it was closed. Officially, it was merged with "Weekend" magazine.

Mai Ghoussoub

Mai Ghoussoub () (2 November 1952 Beirut – 17 February 2007 London) was a Lebanese writer, artist, publisher and human rights activist. She was the co-founder of the Saqi bookshop and publishing house.
Life.
Her father, Raymond Ghoussoub, a Maronite Christian, was a professional footballer. She studied at the French lycée in Beirut, then math at the American University of Beirut, and French literature at the Lebanese University, and later sculpture at Morley College and the Henry Moore Studio in London.
She was a Trotskyite at the start of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, but soon became disillusioned and moved on to humanitarian work, establishing two medical dispensaries in a poor Muslim area after the doctors had left and the pharmacies had closed.
She lost an eye in 1977, after her car was hit by a shell while taking someone to hospital. She moved to London to be treated, and spent time in Paris, where she worked as a journalist for Arab newspapers. She wrote "Comprendre le Liban" with her childhood friend André Gaspard, under the pseudonyms Selim Accaoui and Magida Salman.
In 1979, she founded the Al Saqi bookshop in Westbourne Grove, London, with Gaspard, the first London bookshop to specialise in Arabic works. 
They began to publish works in Arabic in 1983. They sold the Serpent's Tail imprint to Pete Ayrton in 1987, but continued with the Saqi and Telegram imprints. An Arabic publishing house, Dar al-Saqi, was founded in Beirut in 1990.
She was a feminist, publishing works on a range of controversial issues and producing challenging artistic installations. She wrote for Open Democracy. 
Her autobiographical book, "Leaving Beirut: women and the wars within", was published in 1998. She was passionately opposed to censorship, arguing in her 2006 play "Texterminators", performed at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith and Dominion Theatre in London, the Unity Theatre, Liverpool, and the Marignan Theatre in Beirut, that "Words don't kill; humans do."
Family.
She married twice. She married the Lebanese writer Hazem Saghieh in 1991.
She died in London. She was survived by her father, mother, Maggie Ghoussoub, sister, Houda, and husband, Hazem Saghieh.

Sarafian is the founding director of the Gomidas Institute in London, which sponsors and carries out research and publishes books and the journal "Armenian Forum". Among the institute's publications are English translations of Armenian texts related to the Armenian Genocide. He edited a "Critical Edition" of the "The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916", commonly known as the "Blue Book" (originally published in 1916 by British historians Lord James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee), as well as a Turkish edition of the book.
Research.
Sarafian conducted research in the Turkish Prime Minister's Ottoman Archives in the 1990s, together with Hilmar Kaiser.
In February 2007, Sarafian accepted the suggestion of the then-chairman of the Turkish Historical Society, Yusuf Halaçoğlu, to cooperate on a joint project. Sarafian later proposed a joint case study of "what happened on the Harput Plain" and "how many people died" during the deportations.
A month later, Halaçoğlu announced that Sarafian has declined to carry out the study, and added that Sarafian "was disturbed by the institute’s initiative to study the archives of Tashnak, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation". In an interview, Sarafian said Halaçoğlu's "explanation was not true because I had not said any such thing. The case study came to an end when Halacoglu stated that the relevant records, which he had initially agreed to use as the basis of the joint case study, were not available." Halaçoğlu's choice to withhold archival records and pull out of the project was criticized at the time in the Turkish press.

Pacifica (Fred Frith album)

Pacifica is a studio album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was composed by Frith in 1994 as "a meditation for 21 musicians with texts by Pablo Neruda", and was performed, under the direction of Frith, by the Bolognese Eva Kant ensemble in 1995 in Modena, Italy. Texts, taken from the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda's works, were recorded by Sergio Meza in September 1997 in Santiago, Chile and were added to the music in 1998. The album was released on Tzadik Records' Composer Series in 1998.
Frith does not perform on this album.
Background.
"Pacifica" was composed by Frith at Big Sur, California in a cabin overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It is "a slow meditation on life and death" and reflects a series of events that occurred in Frith's life at the time, namely the death of two close friends and the birth of his daughter.
"Pacifica" was composed for an ensemble that included prepared guitars, wind instruments, percussion, a vocalist and a performer on records, CDs and tapes. The 19 member Eva Kant ensemble (named after a 1960s comic strip heroine, Eva Kant) performed the piece, with fragments of recited text from the Death Song of the Cupeño tribe of California and the tribal names of all the original inhabitants of California. The recording was supplemented later with texts from Pablo Neruda's "Soneto IX" and "Cien sonetos de amor", read by Sergio Meza.

<doc id="9667364" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667364" title="Energy drift">
Energy drift

In computer simulations of mechanical systems, energy drift is the gradual change in the total energy of a closed system over time. According to the laws of mechanics, the energy should be a constant of motion and should not change. However, in simulations the energy might fluctuate on a short time scale and increase or decrease on a very long time scale due to numerical integration artifacts that arise with the use of a finite time step "Δt". This is somewhat similar to the flying ice cube problem, whereby numerical errors in handling equipartition of energy can change vibrational energy into translational energy.
More specifically, the energy tends to increase exponentially; its increase can be understood intuitively because each step introduces a small perturbation δv to the true velocity vtrue, which (if uncorrelated with v, which will be true for simple integration methods) results in a second-order increase in the energy
Energy drift - usually damping - is substantial for numerical integration schemes that are not symplectic, such as the Runge-Kutta family. Symplectic integrators usually used in molecular dynamics, such as the Verlet integrator family, exhibit increases in energy over very long time scales, though the error remains roughly constant. These integrators do not in fact reproduce the actual Hamiltonian mechanics of the system; instead, they reproduce a closely related "shadow" Hamiltonian whose value they conserve many orders of magnitude more closely. The accuracy of the energy conservation for the true Hamiltonian is dependent on the time step. The energy computed from the modified Hamiltonian of a symplectic integrator is formula_2 from the true Hamiltonian.
Energy drift is similar to parametric resonance in that a finite, discrete timestepping scheme will result in nonphysical, limited sampling of motions with frequencies close to the frequency of velocity updates. Thus the restriction on the maximum step size that will be stable for a given system is proportional to the period of the fastest fundamental modes of the system's motion. For a motion with a natural frequency ω, artificial resonances are introduced when the frequency of velocity updates, formula_3 is related to ω as 
where "n" and "m" are integers describing the resonance order. For Verlet integration, resonances up to the fourth order formula_5 frequently lead to numerical instability, leading to a restriction on the timestep size of 
where ω is the frequency of the fastest motion in the system and "p" is its period. The fastest motions in most biomolecular systems involve the motions of hydrogen atoms; it is thus common to use constraint algorithms to restrict hydrogen motion and thus increase the maximum stable time step that can be used in the simulation. However, because the time scales of heavy-atom motions are not widely divergent from those of hydrogen motions, in practice this allows only about a twofold increase in time step. Common practice in all-atom biomolecular simulation is to use a time step of 1 femtosecond (fs) for unconstrained simulations and 2 fs for constrained simulations, although larger time steps may be possible for certain systems or choices of parameters. 
Energy drift can also result from imperfections in evaluating the energy function, usually due to simulation parameters that sacrifice accuracy for computational speed. For example, cutoff schemes for evaluating the electrostatic forces introduce systematic errors in the energy with each time step as particles move back and forth across the cutoff radius if sufficient smoothing is not used. Particle mesh Ewald summation is one solution for this effect, but introduces artifacts of its own. Errors in the system being simulated can also induce energy drifts characterized as "explosive" that are not artifacts, but are reflective of the instability of the initial conditions; this may occur when the system has not been subjected to sufficient structural minimization before beginning production dynamics. In practice, energy drift may be measured as a percent increase over time, or as a time needed to add a given amount of energy to the system. The practical effects of energy drift depend on the simulation conditions, the thermodynamic ensemble being simulated, and the intended use of the simulation under study; for example, energy drift has much more severe consequences for simulations of the microcanonical ensemble than the canonical ensemble where the temperature is held constant. Energy drift is often used as a measure of the quality of the simulation, and has been proposed as one quality metric to be routinely reported in a mass repository of molecular dynamics trajectory data analogous to the Protein Data Bank.

Klockgjutargränd

Klockgjutargränd (Swedish: "Bell-Founder's Alley") is a small alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Passing under a low vault, it connects the street Västerlånggatan to the public square and courtyard Brantingtorget, forming a parallel street to Salviigränd and Kolmätargränd.
Mentioned as "Klåchgiuatre gränden" in 1687, the alley is named after a German bell-founder named "Jurgen Putens", likely immigrated from Lübeck in 1620 and in Swedish sources referred to as "Jöran Putenson", who is mentioned as having bought a house in an alley called "Olof Köttmånglares gränd" ("Alley of Meat Hawker Olof"). Known as a talented craftsman, he founded the bells of the Stockholm Cathedral and introduced the fire-extinguisher in 1621, badly needed during the great fire of 1625. He was among the first craftsmen to have relocated his foundry to Kungsholmen in 1647. The alley is mentioned as "Hiortens gränd" in 1720.

Chacala

Chacala is a picturesque beach-town set in small cove on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the State of Nayarit. It is located about north of Puerto Vallarta. The name means "where there are shrimp" in Náhuatl, and is part of the coastline known as the Riviera Nayarita. The population consists of approximately 300 full-time residents, but can swell to over 1000 during Mexico's most popular vacation periods such as Semana Santa, (Easter Week) and Christmas. Chacala is known for its physical beauty, unhurried lifestyle.
History.
Pre-Columbian era.
The region encompassing Nayarit and Jalisco was originally home to the Texcoxquin (Teqectequi) indigenous culture millennia before the European conquest. The Altavista petroglyphs, not far from Chacala, are believed to date from 2300 BCE. This extensive group of rock carvings is still used today for ceremonial religious purposes by the native Huichol.
Colonial era.
The bay was first seen by Europeans when the Spaniard Francisco Cortés de Buena Ventura, a nephew of Hernán Cortés reached here in 1524. Although Chacala was never as historically significant a port as San Blas to the north or Puerto Vallarta to the south, the sheltered bay saw a visit from explorer Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño, sailing out of Manila, who arrived in Chacala on January 7, 1596 in a small launch after the Manila Galleon "San Agustin" was wrecked on the northern coast of California. The notable but idiosyncratic Jesuit missionary Father Eusebius Francesco Kühn, commonly known as 'Padre Kino', and his party departed from Chacala on his Atondo expedition in May 1683. Many members of the expedition abandoned him after he proposed that his ship be pushed across the Sonoran Desert.
Modern era.
After slumbering for decades as a small fishing village and coconut plantation, Mexican doctor Laura del Valle's arrival in 1980 spurred a period of change which, in a relatively brief 15 years, transformed the town into one of Mexico's more distinctive destinations. Del Valle first built simple accommodations at Chacala's south end, where dense virgin first-growth rainforest teeming with wildlife, including ocelot, margay and jaguarundi, grows down the flanks of a small collapsed volcano and plunges into the Pacific. She built the lodge to house visiting American medical students volunteering at the local health clinic she founded to serve the Mexican poor. Today it has evolved into a Retreat & Wellness Center called Mar de Jade that still supports and runs a variety of non-profit projects for the local community and the neighboring impoverished farming town of Las Varas.
A Zen Buddhist with a strong commitment to helping the less-fortunate, the word of del Valle's work soon spread, and Chacala started attracting others with similar ideals, along with 'eco-tourists' looking for a tranquil, unspoiled and little-visited beach-town 'off the beaten path'. 
Another distinctive establishment is the Hotel Majahua whose owners, Carmen and José Enrique work to develop a socially responsible tourism industry, working with the local fishing community. Over the next decade-and-a-half others looking for an environ where efforts to help a local populace resulted in changes which could be seen and felt, or those just looking for an idyllic charming beach-town found their way to Chacala. Two events in the mid 90's would change the area dramatically. Chacalilla, the small cove just north of Chacala and the surrounding land was purchasd by a developer to build a gated complex with luxury homes ranging from approximately $550,000 to $1,800,000 USD. To provide access to the construction site and town, a paved road from Highway 200 to the beach replaced the often-flooded poor-quality circuitous dirt road which had previously kept all but the most-dedicated from visiting Chacala.
Geography.
Location.
Chacala is located on the south west portion the Nayarit coast, which itself is located about mid-way on the Mexican Pacific Coast. Nayarit encompasses , which makes it a little larger than the state of Maryland in the U.S.A. It has of Pacific coastline. Nayarit is bordered by the states of Sinaloa, Zacatecas and Durango to the north, and by Jalisco to the east and south. The town is off Highway 200 and is situated on the Pacific coastal plain. The coastal plain is the strip of land that runs along most of the west coast of Mexico between the Pacific Ocean and the foothills and mountains.
Climate.
Chacala (and all of Nayarit) lies south of the Tropic of Cancer, thus it is located in the true Tropics, and its climate is Tropical - hot and humid. The actual classification is 'warm subhumid tropical'. Nayarit is characterized by its high rainfall - the fifth highest in the country, averaging 1000-1500mm (40-60 in.) per annum. 
Some parts of the state receive up to 2640mm (104 in.) of rainfall a year. The rains are concentrated in periods of brief intense thunderstorms, often occurring in the afternoons, most during the summer wet season between May and October, although a lesser but significant winter wet season exists as well. The wet seasons are separated by spring and fall dry seasons. Chacala received moderate to severe damage from Hurricane Kenna in October 2002.
Flora.
Nayarit's [http://www.rivieranayaritmexico.com] natural floral habitat consists of tropical coastal savannah, tropical deciduous forest, tropical semi-deciduous forest and riparian wetland. The region also includes large and small tracts of cultivated land. The lush Nayarit jungle is home to over 300 species of orchids alone. The biodiverse tropical deciduous forests of Mexico, such as those of Nayarit's foothills and mountains, contain up to 40% of Mexico's flora and fauna diversity. Parts of the tropical deciduous forest on the Pacific Coast near Nayarit have been found to be among the top 10 most species-rich floral habitats on earth.
Fauna.
The fertile coastal plain and lush jungle of the foothills and mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental support a wide variety of fauna, including over 400 bird species, and a rich diversity of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and other animal species. Some of the significant birds include the Amazon Parrot, Tropical Kingbird, Great Kiskadee, Hooded Oriole, and the Blue-footed Booby. Mammals include an incredibly wide range of 'big cats' such as Ocelot, Margay, Jaguar, Jaguarundi and Puma along with deer, wild boar, coati mundi, skunk, badger, coyote, wild rabbit, armadillo, various snakes, lizards, and frogs.

Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita

"Muehlenbeckia horrida" subsp. "abdita", commonly known as Remote Thorny Lignum, is a critically endangered shrub endemic to Western Australia.
Description.
It is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers.
Distribution and habitat.
"M. h." subsp. "abdita" is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia.
It grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed.
Conservation.
Populations of "M. h." subsp. "abdita" have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.
It is listed as "critically endangered" under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and as "Rare" under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The whole lake bed ecosystem has been classified as a critically endangered threatened ecological community under the name Bryde.

Ankhu

Ankhu was an Egyptian vizier who lived in the 13th Dynasty around 1750 BC.
Biography.
Ankhu is known from several monuments dating to the reigns of the 13th Dynasty kings Khendjer and Sobekhotep II, attesting that he served several kings. Ankhu appears in the Papyrus Boulaq 18 as the head of the court officials. The papyrus is dated to the reign of Sobekhotep II and mentions Queen Aya. The queen's image appears also on a stela which shows that she was part of Ankhu's family. A stela found at Abydos dated to the reign of Khendjer reports on building works at the Osiris temple. In the Amun temple at Karnak he erected statues of himself, his father and his mother. The latter is one of the very few statues belonging to a woman placed in this temple.
Ankhu was the son of a vizier, perhaps of Zamonth and the father of two viziers, Resseneb and Iymeru. The family formed a strong dynasty of high court officials.
Ankhu ruled at least under two, perhaps even under five, kings of the 13th Dynasty. His situation illustrates that during this period the viziers were the real power behind weak kings. The kings were only in power for a short period, while the viziers remained in power for longer periods.

Allahabad is a city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Historically it had been an important place of learning, attracting people from other places to the city to gain education. Allahabad University, built by the British and once called the Oxford of the East, has always been famous for its intellectual atmosphere and for providing the best education to its students though for the past two decades it had declined a lot while Universities and Colleges in other parts of the country gained ground. But recently Allahabad University was declared a Central University (like it had once been previously) and this has given a boost to bringing back the past glory of this prestigious University.

<doc id="9667552" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667552" title="Periodic boundary conditions">
Periodic boundary conditions

Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are a set of boundary conditions which are often chosen for approximating a large (infinite) system by using a small part that called an "unit cell". PBC are often used in computer simulations and mathematical models. The topology of two-dimensional PBC is equal to that of a "world map" of some video games; the geometry of the unit cell satisfies perfect two-dimensional tiling, and when an object passes through one side of the unit cell, it re-appears on the opposite side with the same velocity. In topological terms, the space made by two-dimensional PBC can be thought of as being mapped onto a torus (compactification). The large systems approximated by PBC consist of infinite number of unit cells. In computer simulations, one of these is original simulation box, and others are copies called "images". During the simulation, only the properties of the original simulation box need be recorded and propagated. The "minimum-image convention" is a common form of PBC particle bookkeeping in which each individual particle in the simulation interacts with the closest image of the remaining particles in the system.
In molecular dynamics simulation, PBC are usually applied to calculate bulk gasses, liquids, crystals or mixtures. A common application uses PBC to simulate solvated macromolecules in a bath of explicit solvent.
Born-von Karman boundary conditions are periodic boundary conditions for a special system.
PBC requirements and artifacts.
Three-dimensional PBC are useful for estimating a bulk systems of gases, liquids, and solids. Three-dimensional PBC are also applied to simulate planar surfaces, however, two-dimensional PBC are more suitable for these systems. Two-dimensional PBC for planar surfaces are called "slab boundary conditions"; PBC are used for two cartesian coordinates (e.g. x and y), and the third coordinate (z) remains vacuum to infinity.
PBC can be used in conjunction with Ewald summation methods (usually particle mesh Ewald) of accounting for electrostatic forces in the system. However, PBC also introduces correlational artifacts that do not respect the translational invariance of the system, and requires constraints on the composition and size of the simulation box.
In simulations of solid systems, the strain field arising from any inhomogenuity in the system
will be artificially truncated and modified by the periodic boundary. Similarly, the wavelength
of sound or shock waves and phonons in the system is limited by the box size.
In simulations containing ionic (Coulomb) interactions, the net electrostatic charge of the system must be zero to avoid summing to an infinite charge when PBC is applied. In some applications it is appropriate to obtain neutrality by adding ions such as sodium or chloride (as counterions) in appropriate numbers if the molecules of interest are charged. Sometimes ions are even added to a system in which the molecules of interest are neutral, to approximate the ionic strength of the solution in which the molecules naturally appear. Maintenance of the minimum-image convention also generally requires that a spherical cutoff radius for nonbonded forces be at most half the length of one side of a cubic box. Even in electrostatically neutral systems, a net dipole moment of the unit cell can introduce a spurious bulk-surface energy, equivalent to pyroelectricity in polar crystals.
The size of the simulation box must also be large enough to prevent periodic artifacts from occurring due to the unphysical topology of the simulation. In a box that is too small, a macromolecule may interact with its own image in a neighboring box, which is functionally equivalent to a molecule's "head" interacting with its own "tail". This produces highly unphysical dynamics in most macromolecules, although the magnitude of the consequences and thus the appropriate box size relative to the size of the macromolecules depends on the intended length of the simulation, the desired accuracy, and the anticipated dynamics. For example, simulations of protein folding that begin from the native state may undergo smaller fluctuations, and therefore may not require as large a box, as simulations that begin from a random coil conformation. However, the effects of solvation shells on the observed dynamics – in simulation or in experiment – are not well understood. A common recommendation based on simulations of DNA is to require at least 1 nm of solvent around the molecules of interest in every dimension.
Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention.
To implement PBC algorithm, at least two procedures are needed.
At first, an object which went out through one face of the simulation box should be go back to the box through the opposite face. This is simple operation and can be thought the following code, for example (for the x dimension, assuming an orthogonal unit cell centered on the origin):
Secondly, every distance between objects should have a length which corresponds to the minimum image criterion.
To achieve this, the following code can be thought (assuming the one-dimensional distance from object i to object j):
Naturally both operations should be repeated in all 3 dimensions.
These operations can be written in much more compact form for orthorhombic cells if the origin is shifted to a corner of the box. Then we have, in one dimension, for positions and distances respectively:
For non-orthorhombic cells the situation can be considerably more complicated.
In simulations of ionic systems considerably more complicated operations
may be needed to handle the long-range Coulomb interactions.
Unit cell geometries.
PBC requires the unit cell to be a shape that will tile perfectly into a three-dimensional crystal. Thus, a spherical or elliptical droplet cannot be used. A cube or rectangular prism is the most intuitive and common choice, but can be computationally expensive due to unnecessary amounts of solvent molecules in the corners, distant from the central macromolecules. A common alternative that requires less volume is the truncated octahedron.
Conserved properties.
Under periodic boundary conditions, the linear momentum of the system will be conserved. Angular momentum is not conserved because the PBC system is not rotationally symmetric. When applied to the microcanonical ensemble (constant particle number, volume, and energy, abbreviated NVE), using PBC rather than reflecting walls slightly alters the sampling of the simulation due to the conservation of total linear momentum and the position of the center of mass; this ensemble has been termed the "molecular dynamics ensemble" or the NVEPG ensemble. These additional conserved quantities introduce minor artifacts related to the statistical mechanical definition of temperature, the departure of the velocity distributions from a Boltzmann distribution, and violations of equipartition for systems containing particles with heterogeneous masses. The simplest of these effects is that a system of "N" particles will behave, in the molecular dynamics ensemble, as a system of "N-1" particles. These artifacts have quantifiable consequences for small toy systems containing only perfectly hard particles; they have not been studied in depth for standard biomolecular simulations, but given the size of such systems, the effects will be largely negligible.

Kadhal Sadugudu

Kadhal Sadugudu is a 2003 romantic comedy film in Tamil directed by Durai, who also directed "Mugavaree". It stars Vikram and Priyanka Trivedi, with Prakash Raj in the supporting role of Priyanka's father. The film is mostly remembered for its comedy performances by Vivek and Paravai Muniyamma which are very popular in Tamil cinema.
Plot.
The film starts off by showing Chithambaram(Prakash Raj), and how he's an important man in the village. He is an adamant character who always sticks on to his decisions. When the temple festival starts, Kausalya(Priyanka) goes to her grandfather's house to celebrate. There she meets Suresh(Vikram) and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Chithambaram gets into many conflicts with Suresh, not even knowing who the other was. All the things that Suresh did were unintentional but Chithambaram doesn't realize this. Therefore, Chithambaram ends up with a very negative opinion of Suresh. When the day comes that everyone in Kausalya's grandfather's's home find out that Suresh and Kausalya are in love, they try to get Chithambaram (Kausalya's father) to agree to the wedding. He, however stubbornly sticks to his decision that the marriage should not take place. Finally Suresh asks him what would make him happy. Chithambaram says that he would be happy if Suresh dies. Realizing arguing further would be futile, Suresh decides to go back to Madras. Kaushalya tries to join him at the railway station to go with him, but Suresh refuses saying "If I Marry you, It will be with your father's permission and acceptance". At that time Chithambaram had arrived at the station to prevent his daughter from eloping with Suresh to Madras. He hears this conversation and finally decides to accept Suresh as his daughter's love, and fiance. Suresh, seeing that Chithambaram is no longer withholding consent for their match, also agrees.

King (2002 film)

King is a 2002 Tamil language film directed by Prabhu Solomon and produced by Krishnakanth. The film featured Vikram in the title role, while Sneha, Vadivelu and Nassar played supporting roles. Dhina scored the film's music, while Rameshhandled cinematography. It released in September 2002. The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu as "Remo".
Plot.
The story evolves around Raja (Vikram), a business management student and professional magician living in Hong Kong with his single-father, Shanmugam (Nassar), who he loves a lot. Then one day, they end up in a car accident, and when Shanmugam is in need of blood, he is given an unanalyzed amount of blood which was infected with multiple sclerosis. Dr. Cheenu suggests to Raja that he take his father to his old home in India, and to keep him happy for the last 2 months of his life. It is then that Raja finds out that Shanmugam was exiled from his home 25 years ago because he had a love marriage. But all that changes when the family meets him again, and when they meet Raja for the first time. However, Shanmmugam's father still doesn't talk to his son until Raja threatens him by attempting suicide. It is around then that Raja meets his crush, named Tamil (Sneha). It is revealed that Tamil's father and Shanmugam were good friends, and he gives her a picture of him with her father. Shanmugam also says that Tamil is the ideal daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, Raja is doing a countdown of his father's life, trying to express his love to Tamil, and entertaining his cousins.
It is then revealed in the film that it was Raja who was infected with multiple sclerosis, and Shanmugam persuaded Dr. Cheenu, who is also a good friend of his to lie to Raja, and the doctor has been trying his level best to find some form of treatment for this incurable disease. A month after he was diagnosed, Dr. Cheenu called saying the symptoms will start arising within Raja, which consist of headaches, colour blindness, and a hole appearing in his vision. Raja realizes something is wrong and his doubts are cleared in a telephone conversation with Dr. Cheenu, and using his ventriloquist abilities, he talks to the doctor while imitating his father's voice, but Shanmugam and Dr. Cheenu don't know that the secret is out.
The movie concludes with an open ending where Raja goes for his treatment silently promising Tamil to be bonded with her forever.
Production.
"King" was the first production venture of S. K. Krishnakant, who had earlier worked as the production executive for Lakshmi Movie Makers. The film was written and directed by A. X. Solomon who had directed the Arjun-Sonali Bendre starrer "Kannodu Kanbathellam" in 1999, under the name Prabhu. However as that film did not perform to expectations at the box office, the director wanted to be credited as A. X. Solomon for his second Tamil film. He has since gone on to make a career under the name of Prabhu Solomon.
The film was initially titled as "Vikadan" with Suvalakshmi being the first choice lead actress. During the period Vikram had accepted another film titled "King" where he was set to play dual roles, but the film eventually was shelved, hence the title "King" was chosen to replace "Vikadan" in this project. Vikram took up magic lessons and learnt how to roller-blade for his role in the film.

Kasi (film)

Kasi is a 2001 Indian Tamil tragedy drama film, written and directed by Vinayan. The film has Vikram playing the eponymous character of a blind village singer. A remake of the director's own 1999 Malayalam film "Vasanthiyum Lakshmiyum Pinne Njaanum", the film has Kaveri, reprising her role from the original and Kavya Madhavan making her Tamil debut in supporting roles. The film was produced by Aroma Mani for Sunitha Productions. The film score and soundtrack was composed by maestro Ilaiyaraaja.
The film was released on November 14, 2001 and won positive reviews from critics upon release. Vikram won the Filmfare Best Actor Award.
Plot.
Kasi is a tale about the deception of appearances. Kasi(Vikram) is a blind poet and singer who supports his family by his songs. He has an older brother Sevalai(Thalaivasal Vijay) who spends what money he has drinking, an abusive, crippled father and a younger sister Lakshmi(Kavya Madhavan). When the local landlord, Raghupathi(Rajeev) returns to the district, he brings along with him Mr Dinesh, the CM's son and his wife Radhika(Aishwarya). Raghupathi has a reputation as a God in the area because of his charitable works and when a specialist eye doctor arrives he promises to pay the fees for an operation to give back Kasi's vision. Elated by this news, Kasi learns that he has to find an eye-donor and his girlfriend Kaveri(Kaveri), who cannot speak, offers one of her eyes. Unfortunately, something happens that shows that the 'God-like' Raghupathi and Mr Dinesh are not what they seem. Blissfully unaware of the sadness of those around him, Kasi looks forward to his operation.
Production.
The shooting was completed in just 45 days. Vikram had rolled up his eyes to look convincingly blind in the film for this deglamorised role of an innocent, rural, struggling blind lead character. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack album was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Lyrics were penned by Pulamaipithan, Muthulingam, Mu. Mehta and Palani Bharathi. All the songs have been sung by Hariharan.
Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" said, "The magic touch, in the music of the maestro (Ilaiyaraja) is missing in "Kasi"".
Critical response.
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. "The Hindu" applauded the off-beat attempt stating, "A film without predictable ingredients is a rarity. The "Kasi" team has to be appreciated for its boldness, in telling a story, in a simple, straight forward manner without the evitable distractions". While Vikram's portrayal was appreciated, "As a blind man, with his eyeballs completely in and with facial twitches so typical of the visually impaired, his portrait is realistic", the two lead actress too received acclaim, "Kavya Madhavan and Kaveri, have excellently expressive eyes, which have been put to good use". S. R. Ashok Kumar said, "As the blind Kasi, he touched a chord". "Sify" noted, "Vikram, it goes without saying that he is the life and soul of Kasi. As the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one’s throat. Vikram has given an extraordinarily detailed performance, which only a Kamalhassan can do!" and summed up saying its an emotionally powerful movie. Balaji Balasubramaniam wrote, "The movie is populated with characters that have a big effect, both positive and negative, on us".
"Kasi" was commercially successful as well.
Remakes.
A remake of the Malayalam film "Vasanthiyum Lakshmiyum Pinne Njaanum", "Kasi" was further remade in Kannada, Telugu and Sinhala. "Namma Preethiya Ramu", the Kannada version, starred Darshan in the lead and was released on November 2003. "Seenu Vasanthi Lakshmi", the Telugu version, starring R. P. Patnaik in the lead released on March 24, 2004. The Sinhalese Tamil version "Sooriyaa" is directed by Dr. Niranjan starring himself in the title role.
The film was also dubbed and released in Telugu as "Kashinath" in 2012. It was produced by Gajula Nageswara Rao and distributed by Kumari G. Kirthana of Sri Siva Parvathi Productions. The lyrics were written by Vanamali.

<doc id="9667612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667612" title="Bernhard Hoesli">
Bernhard Hoesli

Bernhard Hoesli (1923–1984) was a Swiss architect and collage artist.
Early age.
Hoesli was born in Glarus, Switzerland from a German-Swiss father and a French mother. He later moved at an early age with his family to live in Zürich. After graduating from high school with a mathematics degree he joined ETH Zurich where he obtained a degree in architecture in 1944.
Career.
In 1947 Hoesli moved to Paris, France to join architect Fernand Léger's team and later was accepted by Le Corbusier as an assistant. In 1948 he was sent to La Plata, Argentina to supervise the construction of the Curutchet House. A year later, he was appointed to take charge of the Unité d'Habitation project in Marseille.
The Texas Rangers.
Hoesli moved to the United States in 1951. He first joined the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of architecture. It was there where he was joined by architects Colin Rowe, John Hejduk and Werner Seligmann among others to form the Texas Rangers group of architects. He then returned to teach at ETH Zurich.
Teaching at the ETH Zurich.
In 1959, which Hoesli hails as the year Modern Architecture became teachable worldwide, many opinions on architectural instruction changed. In that year, the year of the death of Frank Lloyd Wright, his Guggenheim museum was completed, as were the Birmingham Museum of Art and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. At this point, Hoesli felt free to discuss the procedure of design with students through pedagogy. His design problems, which "were so formulated that the student had to solve tasks within a given framework of requirements and achieve precise results", were arranged by types. The types of problems were created in order to instruct the students in a specific skill through their own self-discovery with trial and error. Hoesli relates this process to the Socratic method, in which students are constantly faced with important questions and debates. When Hoesli began teaching architecture at the ETH in 1959, some of his duties included 'looking after' fifth-year students. At this point, Hoesli realized that most of the fifth-years had an understanding of design as being dependent upon a flash of inspiration rather than a building of design steps upon each other. These students completed projects that had no room for growth or adaptation, and they would not accept criticism or suggestions for improvement. Hoesli felt that this approach was counterproductive and set about changing the way the entire curriculum was structured. 
Also at the time Hoesli began teaching at the ETH, the design process revolved around different building types. Students would complete an assignment from a specific building group. "Design began with a garden house, then continued with a holiday home, family dwelling, then on to a multi-family dwelling, then on to a multi-storey block, school building and shopping centre, until at the end of the studies a church or theatre was ventured upon."
Of the contrary opinion, Hoesli believed that steps of design were more important than mere function. He saw transparency and wise space definition as the ultimate goals for architectural work. "Transparency," Hoesli wrote, "frees us, because we allow it, to see buildings and structures in connections and independent of the differences between 'historical' and 'modern'." He also articulated that transparency as referenced with the modern tradition became an important tool for instruction in the schools of architecture throughout the world. 
Further, Hoesli felt that students should have the opportunity to branch out in creativity through a more structured process than was present at the ETH. He felt the structure of the ETH curriculum at the time was too dependent on chance and the fleeting feelings of a fine art mentality rather than a practical design process. 
After his University of Texas experience, Hoesli's leadership skills and persuasive discussions were at their peak. He was able to formulate new course structures and implement them with ease. He also possessed the wherewithal and energy to pursue the course of action he saw as best for the schools. 
At the time Hoesli decided to alter the ETH"s pedagogy, he was delighted to discover a common Modern manifesto arising as society pronounced Modern architecture dead. He stated, "In order that the Architecture Department of the ETH can reach the standard of international architectural development, the introduction into architectural design had to be consciously and systematically based on Modern Architecture and the work of its protagonists." He saw the three main protagonists as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and Mies van der Rohe. His obsession with the Modernist tradition led him to defend it after it became passe and the public pronounced it dead. He suggested that not only did students need to survive the Modern movement, but embrace it as history. He also felt that the Cubist and De Stijl painters had similar perceptions of the continuity of space and drew inspiration from them. He commented profusely on the Modernist concept of continuous space in both writings and lectures regarding his three protagonists as well as many others. He used Modernism as a source of history and theory for his lessons.
"First", it is written of his changes in the ETH, "it was decided what should be taught. Then, from this, situations and programmes were formulated. The student sees himself confronted by a problem. He deals with it, makes his own experiences, and on the basis of a review of the theme in the lecture and discussion, it is possible for him, at the same time, to understand what he has experienced."
The Basic Design course.
Hoesli began his curriculum overhaul with the basic design course. In his opinion, "the basic course should allow for the architecturally still "unskilled" people to recognize: what an architectural idea is; how it results, how it can be drawn out; upon what it is based; and how it can be developed, treated." This theory was put into action with several design exercises. One in the first semester involved extensive writing on the subject of the design concurrent with its first conceived sketches. This project involved first describing the everyday functions of the space to be designed, along with space requirements and basic diagrams. This was based on Hoesli's obsession with space. He stated as the first point of knowledge for architects, "The architect creates space." The students for this project started with a vague concept and explored avenues through which to improve their ideas as each step progressed. The openness of this first design step allowed for much more learning than the previous structure, as students were not as conceptually attached to a particular building before all the kinks in its design had been resolved. In short, "the first spatial organization is tested against the requirements and developed further…. The design is, above all, a spatial organization." 
Hoesli taught new definitions of space as a continuous function. One key project in the first semester demonstrating this concept was called 'space within space.' Students were to design a space that was "defined without indicating and above or below." The point of this exercise was to separate function from design; a surface or a defining of space was not necessarily a floor or a ceiling or a wall- those titles are added by people. He based this assignment off a quote by Le Corbusier that includes the phrase "the floor that is a horizontal wall." This exercise, similar to the way many sculpture classes are taught, required that the finished product be equally viable from all sides. It could not contain a top or bottom or any other defining characteristic. This project, with so few but such stringent guidelines, challenged students to think about space in a different way. They also considered their materials in different ways, as many students attempted this exercise with many different media. They then faced the task of refining their materials to match their ideas or vice-versa, another key concept Hoesli aimed for. The project also encouraged a great variety in creativity as students sought to execute the concept as thoroughly as possible. Students were encouraged to complete as much of the first step as possible independently in order to allow this creativity. In the second phase of this problem, which happened in the winter semester, students worked with advising groups together. They continued this exploration, defining the space within the space. They put the space they had created into another space, a cube, giving it a context of reference. Hoesli enforced his concept of 'geometry as image' during these space- exploring assignments. This, along with his preoccupation with collaging of materials in a geometric manner, was clearly communicated to the students based on their final products.
Another assignment during the first semester was the 'Extension to a House' project. Hoesli was interested in communicating that not every architectural creation needed to be a freestanding object, but that architecture involved working with the space that already existed- be it an empty lot or a pre-existing structure.
In this project, the students followed three concise steps. They first analyzed the existing structure, generally a home built by one of Hoesli's Texas Ranger friends. They analyzed both form and function of every part of the existing building, strengthening skills in drawing as well as proportion and geometry. They next did sketches and ideas for their proposed solutions to the problem and worked through these with help from faculty. They discussed the pros and cons of each idea they had before deciding on a final plan. The third step was actual work on the project, including material decision-making and discussions on how to integrate the new addition into the old structure both aesthetically and physically. This assignment also reinforced Hoesli's idea of working in steps and allowing revising to take a role in the creative process.
During the second year, students had the clubhouse assignment. They were to create a set of buildings- a clubhouse, an airplane hangar, and a workshop that worked together as a group without necessarily touching. The intent of this exercise was to teach yet more process, involving organization, site evaluation, architectural themes, construction and form, as well as practical presentation skills.
Another second-year project was known as the pottery. Students were faced with a much more difficult space to address: one in an existing urban environment. This meant that street space and a house on the lot would interact significantly with the structure they designed, including even a common courtyard-type exchange between the two structures. The location as well as function was specified for students: the building was to be a pottery business, including a shop and a studio. The process again went through many steps and revisions in order to reach its final outcome.
Career changes.
In 1969, Hoesli was appointed Chairman of the architecture school. Unfortunately for him, this coincided with some serious political unrest both in Switzerland as a whole and within the university. He had a very difficult time adapting to the changes within the student body and their demeanor. His old methods of teaching from Texas and his prior ETH career didn't seem to work with the skeptical new generation. In 1979 he also suffered a major car accident and his wife died, adding to his emotional anguish. At this point, Hoesli realized he'd rather spend time working with students in the higher level classes who had already decided on their goals as architects. He left his first year courses in the same design and focused on the later year studios. He, along with Paul Hofer and Adolph Max Vogt, founded the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture within the ETH and pronounced himself director. This allowed him to work with only the most elite students. 
After Hoesli questioned the third and fourth year design class practices he’d seen from other faculty, he made the decision to teach the third year design course with Paul Hofer. After the two collaborated on the course curriculum for that first year (1978/1979) Hoesli took over the design course. The course for the third and fourth year was not divided into semester work, but rather consisted of a single project for those years. This project, called the Venice Project, was a housing unit for an urban setting, specifically the Cannaregio district in Venice, and contained six sections in its program.
The Venice project.
The first step discussed the idea of a city as a working unit. In this step, students worked in clay to create massing models in order to understand the various interactions within volumetric shapes. They also attended related lectures. 
In the next step students analyzed different types of dwellings. Criteria for this analysis include size, layout in space, variation options, and so on. They refine the ideas in the clay designs they created. 
The third step, related to the second, deals with using the analyses of step two in order to create a structure that relates to the architecture around it. The knowledge of the architecture of the area informs the ideas students originally had and gives more structure to their ideas. Natural lighting becomes a factor. The students learned about a typical layout in a Venetian town, including even the piazza with the church, and altered their designs accordingly. 
The fourth step refers specifically to the student's design and the important relationship between the inside and outside of the building. Students decide on a theme for their final designs as they address the transition from inside to outside space. This relates back to the very first assignment regarding the shaping and defining of space- continuous space rather than an inside versus an outside. 
The next step seems quite difficult. Students must turn their ideas of spatial understandings for their plans into volumetric shapes; i.e. they must turn volume into mass. They did, in essence, a figure-ground reversal. This served to ensure that every space in the final design was active and engaging. Hoesli used as a basis for this step the common observation that it seems Le Corbusier's Unite is a volumetric explanation for the space in the Uffizi. 
The final step was to design the scale models of their housing project, involving all the previous steps in their final designs. 
What is considered the seventh step in the process is actually the selection of a new project for the following semesters. The students work together with faculty juries in order to select the goals for this project. The project is chosen as a general urban section that each student can contribute to in an individualized manner. They divide up sections of the area and provide solutions to the individual problems they present themselves with. In this way, students were able to become fully involved in the process while retaining a respect for a larger picture.
During the designing process, students were presented with lectures and instruction on common Venetian facades and asked to incorporate this information into their designs. This consisted the eighth step.
The ninth step was the final submission of the design. 
The obsession with space and transparency continued throughout Hoesli's teaching career. He commented, "Transparency arises wherever there are locations in space which can be assigned two or more systems of reference—where the classification is undefined and the choice between one classification possibility or another remains open." 
Death.
Hoesli's unexpected death in 1984 was a shock to students and faculty. They remember him as an extremely influential figure in the shaping of the ETH architecture school as well as in their personal lives and thought patterns.

Viña del Mar International Song Festival

The Viña del Mar International Song Festival () is a music festival held annually during February since 1960 in Viña del Mar, Chile. It is considered the most important musical event in the Americas.
The Festival features a song competition on two categories (pop music song and folk song), interspersed with performances by international music stars from around the world, encompassing such diverse genres as rock, pop music in various languages, merengue, salsa, reggaetón, bachata and others. The event takes place in the Quinta Vergara Amphitheater, and has been broadcast for Chilean television over the years by TVN, Canal 13, Megavisión or Chilevisión.
History.
Between 1984 and 1989 Leonardo Schultz and Gary H. Mason (Mason is one of the Pioneers of the Reggaeton Movement) teamed up to help revamp the festival and streamline its operations. They arranged for the appearance of Artists including: The Police, Air Supply, Eddie Money, Sheena Easton, Jose Feliciano (they also produced his Grammy nominated album "Escenas de amor" in 1982, as well as the Grammy winning album "Me enamoré" in 1983), Andy Gibb, Neil Sedaka, Gloria Gaynor, Mr Mister, Krokus, Foxxy, Nazareth, and Thomas Anders to name a few. In 1988 and 1989, Thomas Anders (of Modern Talking fame) was a headliner of the festival in Viña del Mar, which was one of the first times an artist was ever invited back two years in a row to perform.
Schultz and Mason also arranged for major international jurors including: George Martin (producer of the Beatles), Maurice Jarre (did the film scores for "Dr. Zhivago", "Lawrence of Arabia", "Witness", "Passage To India", "Ghost" and many others), Manoela Torres (Mason produced her hit duet, which was written by Schultz entitled "No me mires así"), Joey Travolta, Connie Stevens and many others.
In the 90's the broadcast rights to the Festival were given to Televisa, and featured prominent Mexican Artists, as well as major Latin Artists.
In 2008, American rock music band Journey played their first concert with new vocallist Arnel Pineda at the festival. The 2008 Viña Festival was hosted by Sergio Lagos and Tonka Tomicic, and headlined by Nelly Furtado, Wisin & Yandel, and Earth, Wind & Fire.
In 2009, artists such as Latin sensation Daddy Yankee and British legend Simply Red captivated the audience of Viña. On its 50th edition, this famous festival was hosted by Felipe Camiroaga and news reader Soledad Onetto.
"El Monstruo".
Traditionally, the audience attending the Quinta Vergara for a Festival each year openly demonstrates its acceptance or displeasure on the acts that perform there, be they contestants in the two competitions or established artists. As a result, Chilean media has nicknamed audiences at the Festival as ""El Monstruo"" ("The Monster"). Earning acceptance from ""El Monstruo"" usually has a direct impact on an artist's popularity -particularly that of Spanish language pop stars- on the rest of Latin America. Conversely, booing artists offstage is not uncommon.
Artist compete in the Festival's regular competitions for one of three awards, given in this order: ""Antorcha de Plata"" (Silver Torch), ""Antorcha de Oro"" (Golden Torch) and ""Gaviota de Plata"" (Silver Seagull). However, audience response from the ""Monster"" may demand that one of the three awards -or, progressively, all three- also be granted to an established act as their performance progresses. An artist that "tames The Monster" by earning all three awards receives recognition as a major star by Chilean and Latin American media almost immediately after a successful performance.

Angela King

Angela Evelyn Vernon King (28 August 1938 – 5 February 2007) was a Jamaican diplomat. She worked for the United Nations for 38 years, from 1966 to 2004, working mainly for equal rights for women. She was appointed Assistant Secretary-General for gender issues in 1997, remaining in that post until she retired in 2004.
Early life.
King was born in Kingston, Jamaica. Her father was Canon R.O.C. King; her brother was Peter King. She was educated at St Hilda's High School and Wolmer High School in Kingston, and studied for a B.A. in history at the University College of the West Indies. She received an MA in educational sociology and administration from the University of London in 1962. She then joined the Foreign Office of the newly independent Jamaica, and was posted to Jamaica's Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York.
UN career.
King joined the UN Secretariat in 1966, working on matters relating to human rights and social development. She was a founding member of the UN's Group on Equal Rights for Women (GERWUN), and chaired the UN's United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UN CSW). She headed the UN Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) in 1992 to 1994, as apartheid was dismantled. Boutros Boutros Ghali's decision to choose a black woman to head the mission was praised by Nelson Mandela, who also complimented King her work.
Angela King was named Director of the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW) of the Department for Economic and Social Affairs on 1 February 1996. In February 1997, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Ms. Angela E.V. King as his Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. The appointment, at the level of Assistant Secretary-General, took effect on 1 March 1997. Ms. King chaired the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender and Equality and was supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women.
King participated in the UN conferences on women’s rights, from the inaugural meeting in Mexico City in 1975 to the landmark Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing 20 years later which led to the Beijing Platform for Action. She organized a special session of the UN General Assembly in 2000 to review its implementation, known as "Beijing+5", and pushed for the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 1325 (2000), calling for greater protection for women in war, and prosecution of offenders against women. She retired in 2004, but continued to attend and address UN meetings on women's issues, including the 50th session of the Commission on the Status of Women.
Death.
She died of breast cancer, aged 68 at New York City's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre. She was survived by her son.

Vinnukum Mannukum

Vinnukum Mannukum (English: For Space, For Land) is a 2001 Tamil language movie directed by the Tamil Director Rajakumaran. It stars Vikram, Sarath Kumar, Devayani and Kushboo in the lead roles. It flopped miserably at the box-office.
Plot.
Sakthivel (Sarath Kumar) is the leader of his village and is adored by the people. His only brother is Selvam (Vikram) who after completing his education in Singapore returns to the hamlet. Both Sakthivel and his wife Lakshmi (Kushboo) are very fond of Selvam and want him to get married and live happily. Selvam is keen on marrying a girl he has seen in his dream. Sakthivel is prepared to go anywhere to find the girl. 
Selvam actually comes across the photograph of his dream girl in a TV advertisement and discovers that she is an actress (Devayani). 
A film crew lands in the village for shooting, and Devayani, as she is called in the film too, is in the group. Sakthivel approaches her with his brother's proposal but she insults him. 
"I am beautiful and famous and cannot marry a villager," she says. Does Vikram accept defeat or manage to bring her round?
Production.
After the success of "Nee Varuvai Ena", Rajakumaran was given another chance by R. B. Chowdary to make a film under his banner. The project was titled as "Vinnukkum Mannukkum". Vikram was selected after the success of his previous film "Sethu". To ensure success in rural areas, Choudhary selected his lucky mascot Sarathkumar for eighth time in the film but Vikram was not happy with the decision and he wanted to be the single hero but later changed his decision.
A shooting schedule took place at the AVM Studios in Chennai, where Vikram celebrated his birthday on the sets, with the unit members and Sharat Kumar. In an interview to Hindu in 2008, Vikram has mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong. From the beginning, the film was considered a certain Deepavali release. But the director Rajakumaran failed to utilize the call sheets of Sarathkumar to optimum use. Sarath got wild because of this. He too caused some delay in finishing off the shootings. Rajakumaran dragged and finished the film in two years causing delay.
The film created a hype and sensation in media due to the marriage of Devayani and the film's director Rajakumaran.
Release.
The film was finally released on March 2001 and got flopped in the box office. RB Choudhary incurred huge losses through this film and dubbed film "Paapa" later he gained profits through films like "Aanandham" and "Samuthiram".
Critical reception.
The film received mixed reviews. Hindu wrote:"Director Rajakumaran has taken special care in the choice of songs and locations to make the film entertaining. He should have paid more attention to the first half and more important, must have extracted more work from Vikram, who has the potential, and Devayani, for whom it is a cakewalk".

<doc id="9667722" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667722" title="Clan Line">
Clan Line

The Clan Line was a passenger and cargo shipping company that operated in one incarnation or another from the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.
History.
Foundation and early years.
The company that would become the Clan Line was first founded as C. W. Cayzer & Company in Liverpool in 1877 by Charles Cayzer (see Cayzer baronets). It was set up to operate passenger routes between Britain and Bombay, India via the Suez Canal. The next year, Captain William Irvine joined the company and it was renamed Cayzer, Irvine & Company.
In 1881 the company was joined by an influential Glasgow businessman, and the Clan Line Association of Steamers was established. The company opened a new head office at 109 Hope Street, Glasgow. Cayzer Irvine built and managed ships for the association and Cayzer himself retained ownership of the original six Clan ships. At the same time, they expanded their operations to South Africa. In 1890 the company became The Clan Line of Steamers Limited with Cayzer holding the majority interest. The company again expanded its operations with the purchase of the Persian Gulf Steam Ship Company in 1894, bringing four more ships into the company. They used these new assets to expand their routes into the Persian Gulf and to North America, and to begin to carry cargo.
The company was incorporated in 1907 as Cayzer, Irvine & Company, Limited, with the Cayzer family retaining control. Charles Cayzer died in 1916, with his sons continuing to run the company. In 1918 they acquired and incorporated the assets of the Scottish Shire Line. Despite suffering losses in the First World War, the company had recovered by the 1930s to become the largest cargo carrying concern in the world.
The Clan Line at war and after.
Clan Line saw a large number of its ships either requisitioned by the British government, or otherwise used to ship vital supplies to Britain during the First and Second World Wars. Their ubiquitousness led to them being called the 'Scots Navy' (due to their officers' sleeve rings being identical to those of the Royal Navy) and they were often in dangerous environments, at risk from mines, air attacks or German U-boats.
During the Second World War, for example, three of the Line's Cameron class steamers were requisitioned in 1942 by the Royal Navy whilst still under construction at Greenock Dockyard and commissioned as (aircraft transporter), (aircraft transporter) and (submarine depot ship for X-craft). The Clan Line lost a total of 30 ships in the 1939-45 war.
After the end of the war, the Clan Line commissioned six vessels of the "Clan MacLaren" class (commonly known as the "MacL's") to replace war losses and resume a level of pre-war services. Construction started in 1946 and all six had entered service by 1949. Meanwhile the immediate shortage was alleviated by the acquisition of a number of wartime standard construction ships, such as the American Liberty ships. Most of these would continue to serve with the Clan Line fleet until 1962, by which time the first vessels of the "Clan MacIver" class were entering service. Meanwhile management attempted to further alleviate the shortfall with the purchase of the Thompson Steam Shipping Co. in 1952 and the conversion to motor ships throughout the 1950s.
Post war restructuring.
In 1956 the Clan Line joined with the Union-Castle Line, King Line and Bullard King & Company to form British & Commonwealth Shipping Limited. A number of transfers then took place between the component companies. They formed the Springbok Shipping Company in 1959 to take over the operations of their South African services, and several of the Clan Lines' ships were transferred to it. In 1961 the Springbok Shipping Company became part of Safmarine.
Decline.
In the 1970s, British and Commonwealth began to diversify into financial services as passenger shipping declined and cargo shipping evolved into container shipping. By the mid-1980s, the business had evolved into one of the country’s largest financial services companies. The Clan Line, now a subsidiary of British & Commonwealth, ceased trading in 1981 with the final voyage made by "SS Clan Macgregor". By 1986 British & Commonwealth had disposed of their last ship.
With the move from the third to the fourth generation of the Cayzer family, the family shareholders were becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the reduction in control over British and Commonwealth, caused by its expansion using shares as currency. In 1987 they decided to sell their stake in British and Commonwealth and to concentrate their collective investment in Caledonia Investments, whose function until that time had primarily been as a holding company. This was a timely decision: the sale took place just prior to the Black Monday stock market crash and, two years later, British and Commonwealth went into receivership.
Shipping.
The ships of the Clan Lines were often distinguishable by their names, which in the vast majority of cases had the prefix 'Clan'. Their funnel markings were black with two red bands divided by narrow black band, and they flew the house flag, which was a rectangular red flag bearing a white diamond with a red rampant lion in the centre.
Legacy.
It was one of the shipping companies commemorated by the Merchant Navy class of Southern Railway locomotives. Locomotive number 35028 built in 1948 carries the name "Clan Line" and is currently maintained in fully operational condition for hauling excursion trains on the UK's national railway system.

Polyphonic song of Epirus

The Polyphonic song of Epirus is a form of traditional folk polyphony practiced among Albanians, Aromanians, Greeks and Macedonian Slavs in southern Albania and northwestern Greece. 
The polyphonic song of Epirus is not to be confused with other varieties of polyphonic singing, such as the yodeling songs of the region of Muotatal, or the Cantu a tenore of Sardinia.
Polyphonic Music in Greece and Albania.
In Greece.
Among Greeks, polyphonic song is found in the northwestern Greek region of Ioannina (villages of Ano Pogoni) Parakalamos and some villages north of Konitsa), in very few villages in northeastern Thesprotia (Tsamantas, Lias, Vavouri, Povla) and mainly among the Greek minorities in southern Albania (Northern Epirus), for instance in the Greek-speaking villages such as Delvinë, Dropull, Pogon (Kato Pogoni), Poliçan, Himara and the cities of Sarandë and Gjirokastër. Among Greeks a second kind of polyphonic singing differing in maximum roughness is also performed in Karpathos and Pontos.
In Albania.
Among Albanians, all four regions of Myzeqe, Toskeri, Chameria, and Labëria have the polyphonic song as part of their culture. Among Albanians a related form of polyphonic singing is also found in northern Albania in the area of Peshkopi, the Albanian communities of Kaçanik in Kosovo, the areas of Polog, Tetovo, Kicevo and Gostivar in Macedonia and the region of Malësia in northern Albania and southern Montenegro.
The region of Labëria is a particular region known for multipart singing and home to many different genres like that of "pleqërishte". Songs can be of two, three, or four parts. Two part songs are sung only from women. Three part songs are more diffused and can be sang by men and women. Four part songs are a Labëria specialty. Research has shown that four part songs have come after three part ones and that are the most complex form of polyphonical singing.
The Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival, Albania, (), has been held every five years in the month of October, starting from 1968 and it has typically included many polyphonic songs.
The tradition of polyphonic singing has been contested and used by both sides of the Greek and Albanian border in a nationalistic manner.
Structure.
Polyphonic groups of Epirus consist of four members at least. Each group has two soloists and a drone group, which provides and maintains the vocal rhythm of the song. 
The first soloist (or the taker) ( or "σηκωτής" (sikotis), , ) is the voice that sings the main melody. The first soloist performs the beginning of the song (, ), and literally acts as the narrator and leader of the group, singing the main part of the song. 
The second soloist (or the turner) () answers (or "turns") the voice ( (yirizei, turns) or "τσακίζει" (tsakizei, crimps) ). 
Sometimes, instead of the "turner", or according to some musicologists parallel with it, we find the role of the spinner ( (klostis, spinner), ). The "spinner" spins the song between the tonic and subtonic of the melody, a technique that reminds the movement of the hand which holds the spindle and spins the thread. This is a role that is often, but not always, found is the one of "rihtis", who drops () the song in the end of the introduction of "partis", by singing an exclamation (e.g. (ah oh oh) or, "άντε βρε" (ante vre)), which is a fourth lower than the tonic of the melody, resting "partis" and uniting its introduction with the entrance of the drone group. 
The drone group is composed by the rest of the members of the polyphonic group and is also called iso keepers group (, (isokrates, "iso keepers") , "one who holds the "ison"", the note that holds on the whole length of a song, from Ancient Greek "ἴσος" ("isos") generally meaning "equal" but here "equal in flight of song" + "κρατέω" ("krateo") "to rule, to hold". The words "ison" and "isos" literally mean the continuous base note and isocrates creates and holds the modal base of the song. The isokrates role is particularly important; the louder the keeping of the vocal drone, (), the more "βρονταριά" (vrontaria) (i.e. better) the song goes, because the rhythm and the vocal base of the song are maintained. The term derives from the Byzantine Greek musical tradition, where the "ίσον" also features.
The perfection of the rendition of the polyphonic song presupposes the existence and the unity of the several voices–roles of the polyphonic group. As a result, polyphonic song presupposes the collectiveness of expression and the firm distinction between the roles it reflects, and the unwritten hierarchy in the composition of the group and the distribution of the roles.

TS-50 mine

The TS-50 is a diameter circular Italian blast resistant minimum metal anti-personnel mine designed and produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica.
Description.
The mine has a ribbed plastic case which is olive green, brown or sand colored. The mine has a central raised pressure pad on the top surface of the mine, but is designed to operate even with the mine upside down. Pressure on the mine forces air through a diaphragm into a small rubber air bag, which inflates. As the bag inflates it pushes a shutter, which in turn removes the striker retaining lug. The striker is free to impact the detonator. The mine requires an average of 0.11 seconds of continuous pressure of an about 5 to 11 lbs before the fuze will detonate. This allows the mine to be laid in a high density pattern without the shock of a detonation impacting the nearby mines.
The design of the TS-50's fuze gives it a large degree of resistance to explosive overpressure clearance techniques, because the short sharp shock from an explosion does not last long enough to force enough air into the air bag to trigger the mine. This feature, combined with the use of non-magnetic metals used in the mine, make it difficult to clear using conventional techniques. A metal "detector" disc is provided with the mine to make it more detectable, however it is rarely used. 
Additionally, the mine is waterproof and can be used in shallow water. The mine can be either laid by hand or scattered by helicopter from the DAT mine dispenser system.
Production.
The mine was originally produced by "Tecnovar italiana SpA", and was in service with the Italian army. When the anti-personnel mine ban came into force the Italian army destroyed all its stocks of the mine. It is very similar to another Italian mine, the VS-50. TS-50 mines were widely exported and also were produced under license in Egypt. Uncleared minefields containing TS-50 mines are located in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Ecuador, Georgia, Kurdistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Rwanda and the Western Sahara.

<doc id="9667851" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9667851" title="Coed Talon">
Coed Talon

Coed Talon (also spelt "Coed-talon") is a small, formerly industrial village between Leeswood and Treuddyn in Flintshire, Wales. Its name is derived from the Welsh word "coed" ("wood") and the word "talwrn", anglicised to "Talon", meaning a "hillside devoid of trees" or "threshing-floor" (perhaps referring to a wood beneath a bare hillside).
The area, about four miles from the market town of Mold, was primarily agricultural until the nineteenth century, when following the discovery of coal and iron ore seams, an ironworks, collieries and brickworks were opened. There was also a silica quarry nearby at Waun y Llyn. The industries were served by a branch of the London and North Western Railway, who in 1892 introduced a passenger service to Coed Talon, running over part of the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway to Brymbo in Denbighshire.
The station closed in 1950 and the line to Brymbo was taken out of use shortly afterwards, though goods trains from Mold continued until 1963. However, the village still has a pub called the "Railway Inn". The small-scale colliery workings at Coed Talon operated until 1987, and were subsequently worked by the opencast method. A brickworks also continued in operation at Coed Talon until relatively recently.

Cambridge &amp; St. Ives Branch

The Cambridge & St. Ives Branch (as it is named on New Popular Editions Ordnance Survey maps) was a railway built by the "Wisbech, St Ives & Cambridge Junction Railway" in the late 1840s. The railway ran from Cambridge in the south, through Fenland countryside to the market town of St. Ives; more specifically, the line ran from "Chesterton Junction", where it met the present-day Fen Line north of the River Cam. Passenger services along the line managed to survive the Beeching Axe only to last until 1970; the railway continued to be used for freight until the 1990s. The railway now forms the alignment of the northern section of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway: a bus rapid transit scheme.

"Stations listed northwest to south, in the 'up' direction"
What remains.
Much of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway route has absorbed the old railway, with the only remaining section left untouched between the Fen Line and a (now-disused) level crossing over Milton Road. This alignment could, however, be utilised for an extension of the guided busway to meet the proposed Cambridge Science Park Station; the construction of the new railway station at Chesterton Sidings is proposed for 2014.

Paspaley

Paspaley Pearling Company is the largest and oldest pearling company operating in Australia.
Today, Paspaley operates a variety of businesses, some of which are dedicated to the support of pearling operations; Paspaley is a strong advocate of environmental responsibility within industry.
To this day Paspaley remains a family owned and operated business.
History.
Nicholas Paspaley Senior MBE (1914–1984) fled the Greek island of Castellorizo as a young child with his family (the Paspalis family) during World War I. As refugees, upon arrival in Australia in 1919, the family’s only option was to settle at their ship's first port of call, Cossack on the Indian Ocean coast of Western Australia. At that time, the Australian North Coast was the world’s most important pearling area, with the towns of Broome, Cossack, and Darwin being the world’s leading pearling ports.
Apart from only a few government officials on remote postings, the Paspalis family were among the few Europeans living in the area with the traditional Aboriginal inhabitants and Asian pearl fishermen. Pearling was one of the few viable industries in the area, and although Nicholas’ father, Theodosis Paspalis died in 1924, sons Michael and Nicholas and daughter Mary continued to pursue their father's fledging interest in pearling – all eventually owning their own pearling fleets. Michael and Mary discontinued pearling after WWII.
Nicholas joined the pearling trade at 14 years of age. By 1932, at the age of 19, he was at the helm of his own pearling lugger, diving for natural pearls, and for mother-of-pearl shell that fulfilled a significant portion of the global demand for mother-of-pearl buttons. When Port Hedland began to become less profitable due to the pearl fields in the area being exhausted, Nicholas made the decision to move to the uncharted waters of Darwin. In Darwin, Nicholas increased his pearling fleet to 5 pearling ships and earned respect as Darwin’s leading Pearling Master. It was in Darwin that Nicholas Paspalis changed the family name to Paspaley, and established the Paspaley Pearling Company.
At the outbreak of World War II, the Australian government impounded all pearling luggers in North Australia, including the Paspaley luggers, for fear they could be used by the Japanese army for invasion. The luggers were consequently destroyed on the beaches.
Australia and the advent of pearl culture technology.
From the late 1890s-1900’s, British biologist William Saville Kent – who was working for the Australian Fisheries Department on Thursday Island in North Australia - experimented with a new concept of “tissue graft” in pearl oysters. His experiments proved pearls could be cultured by using this unique technique. Nishikawa and Mise visiting from Japan observed these experiments.
In 1916, Nishikawa and Mise of Japan, after perfecting this technique, were granted a 20 year patent on the “tissue graft” technology to culture pearls. This technology led to the development of the Japanese Akoya cultured pearl industry. By the mid 1930s the Japanese industry was substantially developed to the extent that the supply of pearls exceeded demand and Japanese culture pearl prices declined.
Mikimoto was extremely successful at promoting the new Japanese cultured pearl to the international jewellery industry. He challenged and won against the French natural pearl dealers in the French Courts who attempted to prevent the Japanese from describing their new cultured pearls as “pearls”. The French Court concluded that cultured pearls were indeed pearls. Mikimoto became the most famous Japanese pearl farmer.
Also in 1916, Baron Iwasaki, a Japanese nobleman and then owner of Mitsubishi, commenced the first South Sea pearl farm project in the Philippines with the new Japanese pearl culture technology. South Sea pearls were the original and ultimate objective of Nishikawa’s and Mise’s technology, but to cultivate South Sea pearls required large sums of money due to the remoteness of suitable farm locations and the cost of south sea pearl oysters. Therefore South Sea pearls were out of reach of the other Japanese pearlers like Mikimoto - who focused on the smaller inexpensive Japanese Akoya pearl oysters.
South Sea pearl oysters were in limited supply in the Philippines, and Iwasaki’s project initially struggled to survive. The project was moved from the Philippines to Indonesia to Palau, and finally imported live pearl oysters from Arnhem Land in North Australia, but continued to be restricted by an inadequate supply of pearl oysters. Australia had the world’s greatest supply of pearl beds of South Sea pearl oysters, however pearl culture was prohibited at that time in Australia by the Australian Government to protect the all-important North Australian natural pearl industry.
In contrast to the booming Japanese pearl culture industry, Iwasaki’s cultured South Sea pearl project faced tremendous difficulties. However, by the early 1940s Iwasaki had a small but steady annual production of cultured South Sea pearls. The pearls achieved high prices on the world pearl market and were in high demand. By 1940 the project was extremely profitable.
World War II ended Baron Iwasaki’s cultured pearl project in the South Seas, and his pearl technicians were interned as Prisoners of War in Prisoner of War camps in Australia.
Post WWII: Paspaley today.
After WWII the Japanese Akoya pearl industry was rebuilt in Japan, and exports of Japanese Akoya cultured pearls boomed to international markets. Similarly, post World War II, the Australian mother-of-pearl shell industry also boomed as renewed demand ensured record prices for mother-of-pearl buttons right through to the mid-1950s.
Nicholas Paspaley had purchased four luggers which had been abandoned during the war by the Royal Australian Navy on Darwin's beaches. Once again, after rebuilding the luggers, Nicholas resumed pearling out of Darwin. However, the invention of the plastic button in the mid 1950s reduced demand for mother-of-pearl shell, virtually devastating the industry overnight, with the fleets of pearling luggers abandoned once more on the beaches.
Not to be defeated by this sudden collapse of the industry, Nicholas drew inspiration from the success of the booming Japanese Akoya cultured pearl industry, and sought to resurrect the South Sea pearl project commenced by Baron Iwasaki in 1916 – this time taking advantage of North Australia’s abundant and superior beds of South Sea pearl oysters - with the dream to cultivate the world’s largest and most valuable cultured pearl – the cultured South Sea pearl.
In the early 1950s Nicholas negotiated a joint venture project with the Kuribayashi family of Japan - employing the Iwasaki/Mitsubishi experts who had pioneered the project before the war. Although the Kuribayashi’s had no pearl farming experience, the Kuribayashi family were the owners of the Japanese pearling fleet that travelled from Japan each year, diving for mother-of-pearl shell and pearls off the North Australian coast. Their experience in the pearling industry made them a suitable partner for the project.
The Australian Government subsequently removed the ban on pearl culture activities in Australia, and authorised the establishment of the first two pearl farms in Australia. One at Kuri Bay (named after Kuribayashi), and one at Port Essington. Initially, the Kuri Bay project was controlled by the Kuribayashi family, and the Port Essington project was controlled by Paspaley Pearling Company. Ultimately - In 1989, under the stewardship of Nick Paspaley Jnr., the two projects were merged under the Paspaley Pearling Company banner.
During the 1950s, 1960’s and 1970’s, the Australia pearl farms operated with virtually the same pre-WWII Iwasaki/Mitsubishi technology. Pearl production flourished and increased steadily annually. Cultured South Sea pearls became known simply as “South Sea pearls”. They dominated pearl jewellery markets worldwide, and established a distinct “premier” category of cultured pearls – the “South Sea Pearl”. These pearls had the effect of resurrected the existence once more of important pearl jewellery in leading jewellery houses around the world. South Sea pearl prices were hundreds of times higher than the Japanese Akoya cultured pearl prices.
Nicholas Paspaley had lived to realise his dream of creating cultured pearls of the same quality as his natural South Sea pearls - the most beautiful and most valuable of the “old world” pearls.
In 1982 Nicholas Paspaley was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the pearling industry, to business and to community service. He was also awarded a Paul Harris Fellowship for his services to the community through Rotary International. Nicholas Paspaley lived the romantic life of a true adventurer and pioneer. He dedicated his whole life to the pearling industry in the remoteness of North Australia. He died in 1984. Nicholas’s wife Vivienne Lavinia Paspaley (1913-2003) worked with her husband to build the Paspaley Pearling Company and was also a significant figure in the social development of Darwin.
Nick Paspaley Jnr joined the Paspaley Pearling Company in 1969 after graduating from Sydney University as a Bachelor of Economics. Nick worked with his father eventually pioneering modern pearl cultivating techniques that enabled the realisation of his father’s vision.
In 1999 Nick Paspaley Jnr was awarded The Companion in the Order of Australia – Australia’s highest civilian honor – for his services to Australia’s export industry.
Nick Paspaley Jnr was instrumental in the establishment of the South Sea Pearl Consortium – the non-profit organisation committed to promoting and protecting the reputation of the South Sea pearl. Nick is a Board member of CIBJO - The World Jewelry Federation whose charter is the promotion of ethics and responsibility in the jewelry industry for the protection of consumers, and to foster confidence in the jewelry industry.
Nick is the Chairman of the Paspaley Group of Companies. His son James Paspaley is the Chief Executive Officer of the Paspaley Group of Companies. His nephews Peter Bracher and Michael Bracher oversee the worldwide distribution of the company’s pearls.
Paspaley pearls appear in the collections of retail brands such as Tiffany & Co, Cartier, Harry Winston, Chow Tai Fook, Falconer, and more. In 1992 a single Paspaley strand of 23 pearls set a world record for cultured pearls, selling for US$2.3 million at a Sotheby's Auction in New York. The record still stands today.
Paspaley Pearls today is still a family run and owned business, with offices in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and the UAE. Paspaley continues to be a joint venture with its original Japanese joint venture partners. The company operates a pearl retail business, a pearl wholesale business. Pearl production is one business unit of the diversified Paspaley Group of Companies.
Paspaley Pearls.
The pearls are particularly known for their 'orient', which is the combination of transparent lustre and unique play of colors which is exhibited by pearls with fine quality nacre.
Paspaley operates 20 pearl farms dotted along more than 2,500 kilometres of the remote coastline of North-Western Australia. Pristine environmental conditions are critical for the successful production of pearls. The ‘leave no trace’ environmental policy sets the industry benchmark for environmental standards.
In 2012, the area in which Paspaley operates was designated as a marine wilderness sanctuary. This area, where Paspaley pearl farms have operated for more than 60 years, is still in its pristine condition, and is a breeding ground for humpback whales, spanning over thousands of kilometres of the Kimberly region.
Paspaley Retail & Wholesale.
Paspaley operate nine retail stores globally, with a strong presence in Australia – most recently in Crown - Melbourne, Australia; as well as the UAE. Prices range from a few hundred dollars to several millions of dollars per piece of jewelry.
In addition to the retail stores, Paspaley also operates the Paspaley e-boutique (http://www.Paspaley.com/eboutique), designed to provide an immersive online shopping experience with access to a wide selection of Paspaley jewellery in varying price ranges.
Paspaley Pearling Company is the pearling wholesale department of the Paspaley Group of Companies. This department sells Paspaley Australian South Sea pearls to a variety of leading jewellery brands, as well as independent retailers.
Paspaley Group of Companies.
The Paspaley Group of Companies has developed a diverse portfolio of business operations, evolving from their pearling background. The primary objective of the Group is in the provision of essential services to pearling operations. Diversification came naturally as the company acquired and developed the infrastructure required to support the growing demands of the pearling industry.
Today, the following businesses operate under Paspaley Group of Companies:
• Paspaley Pearls 
• Paspaley Pearling Company 
• Paspaley Pearls Properties 
• Aviation 
• Paspaley Pastoral Group 
• Bunnamagoo Winesu
• Pearl Marine Engineering
Diving Fatality.
In April 2012, 22-year-old Jarrod Hampton died in the waters south of Broome working as a diver for Paspaley. Mr. Hampton was an experienced diver with a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver certificate and prior to joining Paspaley, he had recorded more than 600 dives in a variety of conditions including work as a dive instructor. Mr. Hampton is the only work related fatality at the company.
The incident was investigated by WorkSafe WA with the full cooperation of Paspaley. Workplace safety being of paramount importance, the company promptly complied with all the improvement notices that were issued from the investigation. A coronial inquest has now been delayed and is pending a decision from the State Solicitors Office.

1980–81 British Home Championship

The 1980-81 British Home Championship was the only British Home Nations international football championship outside of the years of the First World War and Second World War which was not completed and thus failed to produce a winner. As with the rugby union 1972 Five Nations Championship, the cause of this cancellation was The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The championship was scheduled to be played in May 1981 after the termination of the domestic season. On 5 May, however, the Provisional Irish Republican Army hunger strike leader Bobby Sands died in the Maze Prison, invoking a storm of protest and violence by republicans in Northern Ireland. Thus the English and Welsh FAs, whose teams were scheduled to travel to Windsor Park later in the month, declined to play, rendering the tournament incomplete and void.
Scotland were the only team to complete all their matches, including defeating Northern Ireland in Glasgow, and were in a strong position, having also beaten England. Wales had beaten Scotland and played a tame draw with England and so too would have claimed victory with a win or draw in Belfast. England had lost one and drawn one and were not in a challenging position, whilst Northern Ireland lost their only game. Five months later, in October 1981, Scotland were able to play a qualifying match for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Northern Ireland without significant difficulties.

Max Valentiner

Captain Christian August Max Ahlmann Valentiner (December 15, 1883 – July 19, 1949) was a German U-boat commander during World War I.
He was the third highest-scoring U-boat commander of the war, and was awarded the Pour le Mérite, the highest Prussian military order until the end of the war, for his achievements.
He was also branded a war criminal by the Allies, for killing hundreds of civilians by sinking the without warning on December 30, 1915, contrary to international law.
Early life.
The eldest of the four children of deacon "Otto Friedrich Valentiner" and "Mathilde Julie Valentiner", Valentiner was born in Tondern (Tønder), Province of Schleswig-Holstein.
In 1882 the family moved to Ketting on Als where his father held a job as a priest for two years, then moving to Sonderburg (Sønderborg). Valentiner started his time in school in Ketting, then Augustenburg (Augustenborg) and later in Sonderburg on Reimers school.
At the age of 18, he joined the Kaiserliche Marine of the German Empire on April 1, 1902, as a Seekadett on the school ship . On August 15, 1902, he saved a ship's boy from drowning in Swinemünde's harbour, and received his first of many decorations, the Rettungsmedaille.
In 1903, Valentiner joined the naval school where he attended many courses, especially in diving, his preferred topic. He ended his training on the . On May 14, 1903, he saved an able seaman in Heligoland harbour from the waves and certain death, and was awarded the Order of the Crown Medal for his courage and valour in action.
On September 29, 1905, he was promoted to Leutnant zur See and in 1907 he became an officer on . He was promoted again on March 30, 1908, to Oberleutnant zur See. From 1908 to 1910, Valentiner was company commander for "1. Matrosen-Artillerie-Abteilung" in Kiel.
In 1911, Valentiner became an officer on the U-boat salvage ship . In this job, on January 17, 1911, he saved all 30 men of by getting them out of the torpedo tube after it sank in Kiel Harbour due to an unclosed valve in the ventilation shaft. Among the saved crew was Otto Weddigen, later the commander of , and Paul Clarrendorf, the commander of "U-boot-Abnahme-Kommando" in Kiel which enlisted U-boat crews. Valentiner received the Order of the Crown 4th class for the life-saving mission.
On July 1, 1911, Valentiner took command of the new U-boat . On board he showed incredible skill and boldness and on training manoeuvres he sank several ships with drill torpedoes without ever being sighted. His performance literally changed the German vision of U-boat warfare.
On March 22, 1914, Valentiner was promoted to Kapitänleutnant and nine days later he became a teacher at the U-boat school in Kiel, a position he held until the outbreak of World War I on August 4, 1914, when the United Kingdom declared war on the German Empire.
World War I.
When World War I broke out, Valentiner took command of , the U-boat on which he three years earlier saved 30 men from dying. His orders were to sink Russian warships in the Baltic Sea, but he failed, and blamed the old U-boat which did not have the capabilities of the newer boats in the Kaiserliche Marine. Valentiner returned to base without any successes and was relieved from his command on October 27, 1914. He was sent to Berlin to face Prince Heinrich and explain the problems with the older U-boats. The prince was furious and sent him away.
When Valentiner returned to Kiel he was quite surprised to learn that he was to take command of the newest U-boat, . He was also allowed to choose his own officers from the U-boat school.
From December 5, 1914, to September 15, 1917, Valentiner was stationed by "2. U-Halbflottille/U-Flottille Pola" at the Austrian base of Cattaro, in Montenegro. From here all German U-boat activities in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took place. Until the end of March 1915, "U-38" had several problems with its diesel engine and repairs were required. Training of the new crew took place between repairs near the British east coast which were considered most safe and simple for training.
After March, "U-38" started to patrol in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and on December 30, 1915, "U-38" and Valentiner sank the British passenger ship without any warning. Of the 519 aboard, 343 perished.
The action was highly controversial, since it broke naval international law and the Rules of Prize Warfare. The action took place under Germany’s policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, but broke the Imperial German Navy’s own restriction on attacking passenger liners, the Arabic pledge. After the attack Valentiner was placed on the Allies list of war criminals. At home he was awarded with the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on May 14, 1916.
On December 3, 1916 Valentiner took "U-38" into the Funchal harbour on Madeira and sank 3 enemy ships. For this effort he was the sixth U-boat commander rewarded with the Pour le Mérite, on December 26.
On September 15, 1917, Valentiner left "U-38" and Cattaro and returned to Kiel to take command of the new . Kapitänleutnant Rabe von Pappenhein was to have taken this command but for unknown reasons this was changed. With "U-157" Valentiner undertook the longest cruise in the war, from November 27, 1917, to April 15, 1918, a total of 139 days. This cruise came to be his last and in total he sank 150 ships with a tonnage of about 300,000 tons.
Valentiner returned to the U-boat school to teach new submariners his techniques. His experience and advice were taken into account in the construction of the new boat "U-143", which was faster and had a much improved dive time, but it was never finished.
Interbellum.
Valentiner had been accused of the "cruel and inhuman treatment of crews" in fifteen different incidents involving French, British, and Italian ships. The Allies demanded to have all war criminals extradited, but most simply resigned quietly and disappeared for a while, including Valentiner.
He went first to Berlin, was deleted from the list of naval officers, and acquired a new passport under the name Carl Schmidt. He then travelled to East Prussia and lived on an estate, Kadinen, that his father managed, where he waited for the extraditions to proceed. He eventually became impatient with the wait and returned to Kiel. The peace was eventually signed, and per the Treaty of Versailles, all U-boats were dismantled. On his promotion to Korvettenkapitän Valentiner was relieved of duty.
The argument of the Kriegsmarine was that the Royal Navy's use of Q-ships and false flag attacks had changed the nature of the war, making it impossible for German submarines to surface and give a targeted ship the chance to surrender.
Valentiner started a small company in Kiel, trading engines and parts. He later became a shipowner, and also worked for both Drägerwerke (diving equipment) in Lübeck and Adeltwerke in Eberswalde, northwest of Berlin.
World War II.
In January 1940, Valentiner was appointed group commander for "U-Boots-Abnahmekommision" (UAK) in Kiel-Danzig, a position he held until March 1945. Meanwhile, on January 1, 1941, he was promoted to Kapitän zur See. On March 31, 1945, he was discharged from the Kriegsmarine.
Last years.
On June 19, 1949, Valentiner died in Sønderborg hospital from lung disease, likely precipitated by the inhalation of toxic vapours from the engines in the first U-boats, "U-10" and "U-3".

Aayudham

Aayudham () () is a 2005 Tamil action film directed by Murugesh. It features Prashanth and Sneha in the lead roles, while Subbaraju and Vadivelu amongst others played supporting roles. Featuring music composed by Dhina, the film released in January 2005 to average reviews from film critcs.
Production.
The film was directed by Murugesh, who had previously directed the film, "Indru Mudhal" (2003). Sneha was selected to play the lead female role and began work on the film in May 2004. A major portion of the film was shot at Chennai Trade Center at Nandambakkam near Chennai, while few songs were filmed in London. The first schedule of the film commenced in Chennai, where a dance number was shot at a lavish set costing Rs 40 lakh at the AVM Studios, where Prashanth and fifty dancers took part. The second schedule of forty days was held at locations in Madurai, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari and Nagercoil. Dance choreographer Dinesh choreographed two dance numbers - one in which Prashanth and Mumbai's Minal took part, the other where he danced with Rasna, a Mumbai model. Fifty girls from the musical, Bombay Dreams, were selected to feature in Sungadi saris during a song shoot at Trafalgar Square. 
Release.
The film opened to mixed reviews in January 2005 alongside three other Tamil films. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu noted that "it's all very fine if you are not looking for anything innovative in the entertainment offered", adding that "Prashanth is too experienced an actor to goof up the role. He plays Siva with ease. And as always he is more at home in action" and that "Sneha makes proper use of the couple of scenes that offer her a little scope to perform." Sify.com noted that film was "below average" and added "The film looks like a poor man’s "Ghilli" and the story is as old as the hills with no semblance of either style or substance."
The film performed poorly at the box office. The film's release was hampered by the Boxing Day Tsunami which also hit Chennai.
Soundtrack.
The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Dhina. The soundtrack was released in December 2004 and received a positive response, with a critic labelling the album as "enjoyable".

Swiss Performance Index

The Swiss Performance Index SPI is Switzerland's most closely followed performance index. It is a dividend-corrected index that includes all SWX Swiss Exchange-traded equity securities of companies domiciled in Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein. 
The underlying share universe includes approximately 230 equity issues. For a company's shares to be included, the company must be domiciled in Switzerland and the shares must have a free float equal to or greater than 20%. In 1998, all investment companies were taken out of the SPI Family and put into the specially designed Investment Index.
The SPI is divided into sectors on the basis of economic activity. This classification is based on the International Classification Benchmark ICB from Dow Jones and FTSE, which simplifies international performance comparisons significantly. Two other classification systems are used as well: classification based on market capitalisation (small, middle, large) and security category (registered shares, bearer share, participation certificates). 
Paid prices are taken into account in calculating the SPI as a whole. If no paid prices are available, the index is calculated on the basis of bid prices. The index is recalculated and published every three minutes. On 1 June 1987, the SPI was standardised at 1000 points.

Bose (film)

Bose is a 2004 Indian Tamil action film written and directed by Senthil Kumar. It stars Srikanth and Sneha in lead and Kalabhavan Mani, Nagesh, 'Thalaivaasal' Vijay and Manicka Vinayagam in supporting roles. It did reasonable business at the box-office. Upon release, the film was dubbed into Telugu as "Rakshana" and released in 2005, the film was also dubbed in Hindi as "Commando - The Force". The film was also remade in Kannada as "Yodha" and released in 2009. Bose follows the path of a soldier after he is fired after an incident where he injures a politician attempting to rape a girl. The politician hires thugs to take him down while the soldier attempts to take down the greedy politician.
Plot.
Bose, the eponymous hero (Srikanth) is a commando in the army. When a Union Minister (Kalbhavan Mani) is kidnapped by terrorists, Bose goes on a daring rescue operation and manages to pull it off. And that is enough for the Minister to have him as his personal security guard.
Up close with the Minister, Bose gets to know his other (real) side. When the Minister tries to misbehave with a college girl (Sneha) in Delhi, Bose rises up in anger. In trying to save her, he ends up shooting the Minister. Though he escapes with some injuries, the Minister gets Bose sacked from the Army.
Distraught and disconsolate, Bose lands in Chennai and meets the girl he saved in Chennai (She is a student in Kalashektra). Upon meeting her, the duo the natural thing ---fall in love.
But they have the villain's goons on their track. The Minister is waiting for revenge. After some fights, the Minister's men bump off Bose's father (Manickam Vinayakam) and kidnap his family members and his ladylove.
But by then, Bose also stumbles upon the links of the venal Minister with terrorist outfits (the first kidnapping itself was a stage-managed one to win voters' sympathy), so he goes on a fight to finish.
And finally all is well and Bose is also reinstated in the Army.
Production.
This was the third and last time Srikanth and Sneha were teamed up - after the success of 'April Madathil' and 'Partibhan Kanavu'.
Some action scenes were picturised on Srikanth, Jasper and some stuntmen at a factory in Ennore. It took eight days to shoot the scene involving 23 stunt artistes, it was choreographed by stunt master Peter Hayen. Srikanth, for the role of a commando, had trained under Major Ravi, who supervised the army scenes. Some of the locations for the film are Chennai, Thalakolam, Bangalore, Delhi and Kerala. Two of the songs have been picturised in Russia.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and released on 9 August 2004. It features 5 songs with lyrics written by Pa. Vijay, Na. Muthukumar, Thamarai and Snehan.
Reviews.
Indiaglitz wrote:"Director Senthilkumar manages to hold your interest for most part. But lets slip his guard towards the end and the climax peters on predictability". Bizhat wrote:"The film is an action entertainer without any sluggishness". Sify wrote:"story is pure balderdash. Perhaps to compensate for the lack of a coherent script, the director tries to pack in as much commercial elements like songs, crass comedy and lots of action into the storyline. The first half is crisp while the latter half drags a bit. Still the high-octane action drama is watchable". Behindwoods wrote:"The first half of the movie is good, and takes phase with decent action, but the story line sags in the second half of the movie, as unnecessary violence is let loose on the goon squad". Hindu wrote:"The first half just whizzes past. It is the second half that stretches a little and also has scenes ending rather abruptly".

Fiocchi Munizioni

Fiocchi Munizioni (Fiocchi Ammunition) is one of Italy's largest and oldest manufacturers of ammunition.
The Company's headquarters and main production plant are in Via Santa Barbara in Lecco, Italy.
History.
Fiocchi Munizioni was founded on 3 July 1876 in Lecco, Italy, by accountant Giulio Fiocchi.
In 1876, Giulio Fiocchi took over the ammunition production part of a weapon and ammunition company already based in Lecco, which produced small caliber ammunition.
At that time a radical change was introduced in firearms: the newly developed breech-loader replaced the traditional muzzle loader.
Fiocchi started manufacturing cases with primers suitable for reloading; in the early 1890s production was extended to complete cartridges loaded with bullets or shot. At the same time, Fiocchi gave up the production of black powder, as it was no longer profitable.
Fiocchi has always designed and made its own production equipment. Such a strategy has always enabled Fiocchi to guide production with up-to-date technology matching with its manufacturing configuration.
At the beginning of 20th century, Fiocchi introduced a product diversification and successfully entered a new field of activity -snaps- made using scraps left after cartridge production. This brought to the creation of Fiocchi Snaps in 1903. Snaps business assumed an important role to counterbalance the trend of the ammunition market and at the end of 80's was so attractive that, upon Fiocchi's decision to focus on ammunition as its core business, the snaps factory was taken over by the European leader in this field.
During its long life, Fiocchi has manufactured all kinds of ammunition from pinfire, shotshells, and cartridges to all kinds of cartridges and cases, both rimfire and centrefire.
Recent history.
Fiocchi Munizioni makes small gauge ammunition and offers a wide range of products. Its presence and production sites are also in the United States and in Hungary. In 2008 Fiocchi UK was opened in Great Britain.
According to a recent interview with Carlo Fiocchi, the head of Fiocchi America, more than 75% of the ammunition sold by Fiocchi in the United States is also manufactured in the United States at Fiocchi America's production facility in Ozark, Missouri. Specifically, Fiocchi America's composition of U.S. ammo manufacturing and sales according to the interview is as follows:
Qualifications and Certifications of prestige attest the level of quality achieved by the company:
Furthermore, Fiocchi shooting cartridges have contributed to several World Cups and Olympic triumphs, as the Games in Athens in 2004 as well as in those in Beijing in 2008.
In 2011 newly developed 12GA shot shells filled with chemical tracer Cyalume in which allows the shooter to see where the shots are going and will greatly help in the training of sporting clays. The tracer shots are non-toxic and biodegradable and packaged in a sealed metal can in Fiocchi's line of Canned Heat ammunition. The Canned Heat line of ammunition allows a greater shelf life and maintaining quality of the ammo throughout shipping, retail shelf, and consumer handling.
Fiocchi Munizioni is still entirely owned by private capital heading to the Fiocchi Family.

Sam Hargreave

Sam Hargreave (22 September 1875, Rusholme, Lancashire, England – 1 January 1929, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England) was the most successful bowler for Warwickshire until the success of Foster and Field in winning the 1911 County Championship.
Although the presence of Rhodes and Blythe made higher representative honours always out of his reach, for a couple of years in the early 1900s Hargreave was regarded as the best left arm slow bowler in England apart from Rhodes. His accuracy was always exceptional and on helpful pitches he could spin the ball a great deal. Being faster than Rhodes or Blythe, Hargreave was very difficult to hit and his steadiness made him valuable on the generally very plumb wickets that characterised Edgbaston in fine weather during that era. Hargreave was no batsman, but he was a capable fieldsman at point.
Sam Hargreave played for Lancashire's second eleven in the middle 1890s, but having no opportunity with Briggs so dominant he left the country to qualify for Warwickshire. He first played for Warwickshire in two matches at the tail end of 1899, and did nothing apart from a surprise 44 against Lockwood at his most destructive, which was to remain his second-highest score in first-class cricket. However, he rose very quickly to a permanent place in 1900, and in the following year, in a summer all against bowlers especially on so good a ground as Edgbaston provided in fine weather, Hargreave bowled so well under all conditions that he was in the top ten of the first-class averages. On a helpful pitch Hargreave already showed how difficult he could be with such performances as seven for 50 at Worcester and fourteen for 115 against London County, but he bowled beautifully under all conditions.
In the following two seasons, almost continuously helped by the condition of the pitches, Hargreave went from strength to strength except when mastered completely on perfect pitches against Derbyshire and Surrey in August 1902. It was thought his relatively slight frame could not cope with the heavy workload he had to carry on hard wickets, but Hargreave had his revenge on a sticky Oval wicket the following year, when in the best-known (and biggest) feat of his career he took fifteen for 76 after being initially left out after returning from a tour to New Zealand. Because the first day was blank Hargreave could take his place in the Warwickshire team, and for that year every Warwickshire victory was related to Hargreave's deadly bowling on rain affected pitches:
Heading the County Championship bowling averages (at least among those who bowled a reasonable number of overs) and taking more first-class wickets than anybody except Rhodes, Blythe and Ted Arnold, Hargreave would ordinarily have been chosen as a "Cricketer of the Year" by "Wisden", but the choices of Blythe, John Gunn and Walter Mead left no room for a "fourth" finger-spin bowler.
However, questions about Hargreave's physical strength re-emerged when in the dry summer of 1904 he was quite out of form, taking only half as many wickets as in 1903 at over twice the cost. However, for the two following years he defied his critics with his tenacity and patience on generally very easy pitches: doing, in the continued absence of Field, a great deal of work on unhelpful pitches, he remained one of the best left-arm spinners in the business. This work, however, took its toll in 1907 when the wickets should have allowed him as good an average as 1903, but Hargreave could no longer spin the ball and averaged as much as 22 runs a wicket for little more than half as many victims as in 1903. In the following year he was often left out of the team and an appalling record of over 30 runs per wicket in the wet summer of 1909 showed Hargreave to be completely past it. Warwickshire did not offer him a contract for 1910.
Always affected by ill-health for the rest of his life, Sam Hargreave died, largely unnoticed, on the first day of 1929. At the time of his death, Hargreave still was the third-highest wicket-taker for Warwickshire behind Field and Howell. Among slow bowlers, only Paine and Hollies have exceeded his tally.

United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation

The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) was set up by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in 1955. 21 states are designated to provide scientists to serve as members of the committee which holds formal meetings (sessions) annually and submits a report to the General Assembly. The organisation has no power to set radiation standards nor to make recommendations in regard to nuclear testing. It was established solely to "define precisely the present exposure of the population of the world to ionizing radiation."
Overview.
Less frequently major public reports on "Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation" are issued. As of July 2011, there have been 20 major publications from 1958 to 2010. The reports are all available from the UNSCEAR website. These works are very highly regarded as sources of authoritative information and are used throughout the world as a scientific basis for evaluation of radiation risk. The publications review studies undertaken separately from a range of sources. Reports from UN member states and other international organisations on data from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Chernobyl disaster, accidental, occupational, and medical exposure to ionizing radiation.
Originally, in 1955, India and the Soviet Union wanted to add several neutralist and communist states, such as mainland China. Eventually a compromise with the US was made and Argentina, Belgium, Egypt and Mexico were permitted to join. The organisation was charged with collecting all available data on the effects of "ionising radiation upon man and his environment." (James J. Wadsworth - American representative to the General Assembly).
The Committee was originally based in the Secretariat Building in New York City, but moved to Vienna in 1974. 
The Secretaries of the Committee have been:
Dr. Ray K. Appleyard (UK) (1956–1961)
Dr. Francesco Sella (Italy) (1961–1974)
Dr. Dan Jacobo Beninson (Argentina) (1974–1979)
Dr. Giovanni Silini (Italy) (1980–1988)
Dr. Burton Bennett (1988 acting; 1991–2000)
Dr. Norman Gentner (2001–2004; 2005 acting)
Dr. Malcolm Crick (2005–present)
Contents of UNSCEAR 2008 report.

Vasudeo S. Gaitonde

Vasudeo S. Gaitonde (V. S. Gaitonde) (1924–2001) was regarded as one of India's foremost abstract painters. He completed his art diploma at Sir J. J. School of Art in 1948, and in 1950 was invited to join the influential Bombay Progressive Artists' Group.
He received Padma Shri Award in 1971.
Early life and education.
Gaitonde was born in 1924, in Nagpur, Maharastra, to Goan parents. He received his art diploma from the J. J. School of Art in 1948.
Career.
Impressed by his work, Vasudev was invited to join the Progressive Artists Group of Bombay formed in 1947 by artists like Francis Newton Souza and S. H. Raza and M. F. Husain. He actively participated in the activities of the group. He had several exhibitions held in India as well as in foreign countries.
In 1956, he participated in the Indian art exhibition, which was held in Eastern European countries. He also participated in other group exhibitions held at the Graham Art Gallery, New York, in 1959 and 1963. Gaitonde's abstract works are produced in many Indian and overseas collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
In 1957, he was awarded the first prize at the Young Asian Artists Exhibition, Tokyo and the Rockefeller Fellowship followed in 1964. In 1971, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.
He lived and worked in Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, and died in 2001.
Style.
`A quiet man and a painter of the quite reaches of the imagination" as one of his admirers once called him, defines Gaitonde best, who has the appearance of an intellectual, literally simmering with some unexplored thought. Conceptually, he never considered himself an abstract painter and is averse to be called one. In fact he asserts that there is no such thing as abstract painting, instead he refers to his work as "non-objective" a kind of personalized hieroglyphics and calligraphic inventions, evoking the surface painted on with the most astounding intuitions, which he has realised in his inevitable meeting, in discovering Zen. ? The meditative Zen quality that transpires his speech, emoting silence is exemplified in his work best, as silence is eternal and meaningful in itself, from this point one does tend to identify the mysterious motifs, the highly personalized hieroglyphs in Gaitonde`s canvasses with the manifestation of intuitions, invested in their His work is influenced by Zen philosophy and ancient calligraphy.
Legacy.
V. S. Gaitonde was the first Indian contemporary painter whose work was sold for at a 2005 Osians art auction in Mumbai. In 2013, one of Gaitonde's untitled painting sold for , set a record for an Indian artist at Christie's debut auction in India. After the media reports of the auction interest in his work has grown, even at his birthplace Nagpur, where his painting till then lying at warehouse of Central Museum, Nagpur was sent for restoration. It was put on public display in January 2014.
In October 2014, the first retrospective of his work is to take place at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, titled "V. S. Gaitonde: Painting as Process, Painting as Life".

Campbell's law

Campbell's law is an adage developed by Donald T. Campbell:
The social science principle of Campbell's law is sometimes used to point out the negative consequences of high-stakes testing in U.S. classrooms.
What Campbell also states in this principle is that "achievement tests may well be valuable indicators of general school achievement "under conditions of normal teaching aimed at general competence." But when test scores become the goal of the teaching process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways. (Similar biases of course surround the use of objective tests in courses or as entrance examinations.)"
Campbell's law was published in 1976 by Donald T. Campbell, a social psychologist, an experimental social science researcher and the author of many works on research methodology.
Similar rules.
Closely related ideas are known under different names, e.g. Goodhart's law, and the Lucas critique. Another concept related to Campbell's law emerged in 2006 when UK researchers Rebecca Boden and Debbie Epstein published an analysis of evidence-based policy, a practice espoused by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the paper, Boden and Epstein described how a government that tries to base its policy on evidence can actually end up producing corrupted data because it, "seeks to capture and control the knowledge producing processes to the point where this type of ‘research’ might best be described as ‘policy-based evidence’." (Boden and Epstein 2006: 226)

Tevfik Fikret

Tevfik Fikret (December 26, 1867 – August 19, 1915) (توفیق فکرت, born Mehmed Tevfik) was an Ottoman poet who is considered the founder of the modern school of Turkish poetry.
Biography.
Mehmed Tevfik was born in Istanbul(once capital to Byzantions,also known as Constantinople), on December 26, 1867. His father (Hüseyin Efendi), originally from the district of Çerkeş in the sanjak of Çankırı, was mostly absent, as he was exiled for being a political foe of the ruling regime; while his mother (Hatice Refia Hanım), a Greek Muslim convert from the island of Chios, died when he was very young.
He received his education at the prestigious Galatasaray High School and graduated in 1888 as the valedictorian with the highest grades. He later became the school's principal. His sister suffered a tragic early death. In 1890 he married his cousin Nazime, and the couple had a son named Haluk in 1895. He left Galatasaray in 1894 and started teaching at another prestigious institution on the Bosphorus, Robert College, in 1896, where he kept working until his death. In 1906, he built a house inside the Robert College campus for his wife and son. Named "Aşiyan", the house is now a museum.
He was investigated by the Ottoman police numerous times because of his political views and writings, and his association with known political opponents of Sultan Abdülhamid II. 
Fikret is considered the father of modern Turkish poetry, emphasizing literary skill and knowledge over divine inspiration. Like many classic Turkish poets, he used his considerable knowledge of Turkish music in composing his poetery.
In 1894 he published the literary magazine "Malûmat". In 1896 he became the chief editor of the "Servet-i Fünun" magazine, that aimed the simplification of the Ottoman language, where he worked with other Ottoman literary lumineries such as Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil, İsmail Safa, Mehmet Rauf, Samipaşazade Sezai and Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın. In 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution, he began publishing the newspaper "Tanin", which became a strong supporter of the ruling party, the Committee of Union and Progress ("Ittihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti"). He was eventually disappointed with their politics too, and returned to Galatasaray High School as the principal. During the 31 March Incident ("31 Mart Vakası") of 1909, he chained himself to the school gates as a protest and resigned the same day. 
He had projects for a new school and magazines, however, due to complications from diabetes he refused to treat, he died in 1915 and was buried in the family plot at Eyüp. Along with many of his avant-garde contemporaries, he contributed to the literary magazine "Servet-i Fünun" ("The Wealth of Knowledge") until it was censored by the Ottoman government in 1901. Fikret's volumes of verse include "Rubab-ı Şikeste" ("The Broken Lute") from 1900, and "Haluk'un Defteri" ("Haluk's Notebook") from 1911. Because of his very fiery writings and poetry in which he criticised the Ottoman regime of Abdülhamid II, he was immortalized as the "freedom poet".

Gibson Kalamazoo Electric Guitar

The Kalamazoo Electric Guitars were a series of electric and bass guitars produced by Gibson during the 1960s and 1970s under Gibson's parent company Chicago Musical Instruments. A budget model, it had a body that was made of Medium-Density Fiberboard (MDF) and inexpensive components. The Kalamazoo name was actually a revival of a line of acoustic and lap steel guitars manufactured by Gibson from 1933 to 1942.
The Kalamazoo.
From 1965 to 1970, there were two prominent designs. The first, made from 1965 to 1968, was reminiscent of the Fender Mustang; the other, made from 1968 to the early 1970s, bore more resemblance to the Gibson SG. The headstock bore a "Kalamazoo USA" logo rather than Gibson's usual decal. A variety of configurations and pickup options were available, including a vibrola tremolo system, and single coil "melody maker" pickups. The initial run of the Kalamazoo featured the KG-1 single-coil pickup, KG-1A single-coil pickup and vibrola, KG-2 dual single-coil pickups, and KG-2A dual single-coil pickups and vibrola.
Gibson was sold to a different parent company, Norlin. The deal called for further restructuring and the Kalamazoo name was dropped. The Epiphone name took its place as Gibson's budget line marquis, a place it holds to this day.
The Kalamazoo Bass.
The Kalamazoo Bass was introduced in 1966 as a companion to the six string guitar. Like the KG, the KB was made with the two body styles resembling the Mustang and the SG. The earlier headstocks were, again, reminiscent of Fender models. Later headstocks bore a resemblance to that of the Gibson Thunderbird bass guitar. Several standard Gibson components were used in the KB, namely a typical EB series humbucker pickup used in many Epiphone basses. Sales were initially good, and during 1966-67 this was by far the best selling bass made at the Gibson plant. Production of the KB ceased in 1969.
Kalamazoo Amplifiers.
At the same time Gibson introduced the Kalamazoo guitar, they also began production of a line of Kalamazoo amplifiers. They were marketed primarily as budget model practice amps to supplement the marquis. The first amp introduced, the Model One, began production in 1965 along with the guitars. It was followed in 1966 by the Model Two. Both used vacuum tubes for power, rectification, and output. Both had roughly a 5W output and a 10" Alnico speaker manufactured by Chicago Telephone Systems (CTS). The differences between the two were few, with one major exception. The Model 2 was equipped with a tremolo circuit tube to accompany the volume and tone controls shared with the Model 1. The Model 2 proved more popular with this extra feature. The last of the Model 2's produced were given a brown, wooden finished face in place of the usual black panel. By present day standards, these models are not as desirable for use with guitars. However, they are fairly sought after by blues harmonica players for use in amplifying their sound with microphones due to their natural distortion and harmonics. However, the relatively small output and the naturally higher frequencies of the EL84 power tubes usually lead the Model One and Model Two to be used for studio recording, practice or performance in a smaller setting.
In 2013, a modernized take on the Model Two was released by Boeman Electronics of Bakersfield, California. Called the Calimazoo 2 (a conjunction of "California" and "Kalamazoo"), the amp comes in a redesigned cabinet made from knotty pine, with the optional extra of other hardwoods. It differs from the original amp in that it uses a solid state rectifier and a 10" ceramic speaker. In addition, some popular contemporary features were added, including a standby switch, an adjustable line-level output jack for recording or slaving to another amp, and a speaker disconnect function that allows the amp to safely be used as a preamp without its onboard speaker producing any sound.
Around 1969, solid state versions of the Models One and Two were issued in very limited numbers. They were succeeded thereafter by the Model 3 and Model 4 respectively. All of these amps used semiconductors in place of the vacuum tubes. These models, while novel in their day, ultimately proved unpopular.
The Kalamazoo Reverb 12 was introduced as a larger, more powerful amplifier, boasting a 12W tube driven output through a 10" speaker. The Reverb 12 featured a tremolo circuit like the Model 2, but with depth control along with frequency. The tone was managed by individual bass and treble controls as opposed to the single tone control on earlier models, and boasted a spring reverb, a feature not offered on other Kalamazoo amps. It also differed from the previous Model One and Model Two in the respect that it used solid state diodes for rectification instead of a vacuum tube. The Reverb 12 has often been favorably compared to the Fender Princeton Reverb amplifier, despite the differences of solid state versus tube rectification, and using EL84 power tubes rather than 6V6 tubes.
Gibson also produced Kalamazoo bass amplifiers. The tube-driven Bass 30 and Bass 50 were both equipped with a pair of 10" Jensen speakers, a flip-out control panel that became flush with the back of the cabinet when not in use. The later models of the Bass 30 were configured in an upright cabinet as opposed to the typical horizontal cabinet, and the flip-out panel was dropped in favor of controls on the top face of the amp to better match the later Model One and Model Two appearances. The Kalamazoo Bass (with no number attached) was usually made in a solid state form, although some specimens have been found to be equipped with tubes.

Dincolo de nori

"Dincolo de nori" (Beyond the clouds) was the Romanian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1994, performed in Romanian by Dan Bittman. This was Romania's first Contest entry, and consequently the first occasion on which Romanian was used at the Contest.
The song is a ballad, with Bittman addressing his lover directly. He tells her that he accepts that he has wronged her in the past, but that with their mutual love he will be able to treat her better. He sings, "I am not asking for forgiveness for all I have done/I am asking for a ray of love to start all over again".
The song was performed eleventh on the night, following Estonia's Silvi Vrait with "Nagu merelaine" and preceding Malta's Chris and Moira with "More than Love". At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 21st in a field of 25.
Due to the poor result, Romania was rendered ineligible to participate in the 1995 contest. Additionally, Romania's entry for the 1996 Contest did not qualify through the internal selection for that year's Contest, rendering Romania ineligible for the 1997 Contest as well. As a "passive participant" (a country broadcasting but not entering the Contest) in 1997, Romania was re-admitted the following year. Thus, the song was succeeded as Romanian representative at the 1998 Contest by Mălina Olinescu with "Eu cred".

Salt 'n' Shake

Salt 'n' Shake is one of the United Kingdom's oldest crisp brands, originally manufactured by The Smith's Snackfood Company. They are most notable for containing a blue sachet containing 0.6g of salt, allowing the purchaser to salt the crisps to their own taste.
According to the packet, Salt 'n' Shake was created by Frank Smith and was first sold in pubs in Cricklewood, London in the 1920s. Because the salt cellars he provided were being emptied so rapidly by pub visitors, Smith began to sell the packets with a small blue sachet of salt, the tradition of which continues to this day. The brand is at present owned by Walkers.
The crisps were originally called Salt 'n' Shake, but was retitled Salt & Shake when the crisps were relaunched by Walkers in January 2003. It was the January 2003 relaunch, accompanied by an advert starring Gary Lineker, that sees the crisps' latest packaging.

<doc id="9668257" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9668257" title="Pellegrino Morano">
Pellegrino Morano

Pellegrino Morano was a leader of the Neapolitan Camorra gangs in Brooklyn, New York. He operated from his "Coney Island gang" and is considered the American "Grand Master" from roughly 1907-1917.
Background.
The Camorra had a presence in Italian communities all across America from the mid-19th century and was considered a major rival of the Sicilian Mafia for power over the Italian-American underworld. In New York City, the Camorra ruled Brooklyn until the early 20th century. However, in New Orleans, the Neapolitan Camorra rivaled the Sicilian Mafia until the two absorbed after World War II.
Boss of bosses.
Morano was the godfather of the Brooklyn Camorra and had his base of operations in an Italian restaurant in Coney Island. There he met frequently with underlings for dinner and was known to make his disdain for all Sicilians known by toasting, "Long life and prosperity to all Neapolitans, death and destruction to all Sicilians!"
Morano was sought out by Camorristi from across America seeking his advice and counsel. High ranking Camorristi like Andreo Ricci of working from the "Navy Street gang". Morano led the Camorra's expansion into other areas of New York, but soon came into direct conflict with Sicilian mafiosi in Manhattan, as Morano and his group tried to take over gambling and extortion operations in the Sicilian enclaves of East Harlem and Greenwich Village.
By 1914 the Morano and the Morello crime family of East Harlem were at war for domination of the most lucrative rackets in the Italian quarters of New York such as the Italian lottery, extortion, and food distribution routes. Pellegrino Morano and his lieutenant, Alessandro Vollero, the leader of the Navy Street Gang, were planning to eliminate their Sicilian rivals in New York and take over the Italian underworld completely. Camorra leaders from across America had met in New York several times in a council of war and it was decided that the other Camorra groups would support their New York brethren against the Sicilians.
The Brooklyn Camorra's major move was expansion into the territory of the Morello crime family, the top Sicilian mafia group in New York which was based out of East Harlem, Manhattan and by 1914 the hostilities had increased and a shooting war began between the two mafia factions. The war between the Neapolitans and Sicilians had raged for close to two years when Morano decided to strike at the heart of the Sicilian leadership.
The Navy Street murders.
The Neapolitans had approached the Sicilians previously with the idea of a meeting to see if an accord could be reached between the two Italian crime groups. On September 7, 1916 Morello crime family leader, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard, Charles Ubriaco arrived at the Navy St. Cafe in Brooklyn for a sit-down with Morano. As Morello and Unbriaco reached the sidewalk in front of the cafe a five man hit team fired at the two Sicilian mafiosi in broad daylight. The Camorra leaders were sure that they would have no problems with possible witnesses in the community, but Morano and Vollero were arrested within days of the murders due to the defection of a recently inducted Camorra member who was used as one of the shooters.
Instead of wiping out the mafia the Camorristi lost their leader as Morano was prosecuted for his involvement in the murders of the Sicilian leaders and was eventually convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1917. He showed no signs of nervousness or fear after the guilty verdict was read and as the mafia leader was being removed from the courtroom, Morano was surrounded by dozens of Italians who braved the guards and bowed, showered him with kisses on his hands and forehead and wept for him. Morano was allegedly deported back to Italy in 1919.
Legacy.
The Camorra/Mafia war in New York ended soon after Pellegrino Morano was convicted and sent to prison. By 1920 the balance of power had shifted and the Sicilians began to dominate the City's underworld. The remaining Neapolitans in New York aligned themselves with the various Sicilian mafia groups within the city boroughs and the five New York crime families began to form.

Johnno Dean

John "Johnno" Dean is a fictional character from the long-running Channel 4 British television soap opera "Hollyoaks", played originally by Mark Powley. He first appeared in October 2002, and from April 2003 was replaced by Colin Wells until his exit in July 2005.
Casting.
Mark Powley originally played Johnno but the role was recast in 2003 with Colin Wells. Hollyoaks did not anticipate Johnno becoming a central character. Powley could not renew his contract due to commitments in place to other projects. A spokesperson for the show revealed that they were delighted to cast Wells in the role, but warned he would not be like the "lothario" character Jake Booth he previously played in rival soap opera "Crossroads".
Storylines.
Johnno arrived in October 2002 as part of the Dean family, and began working as a lorry driver with Les Hunter. Generally a friendly, good-natured personality and a devoted family man, Johnno's early storylines see him confront Ellie Hunter about her false testimony that her brother and his daughter Debbie Dean's boyfriend Dan Hunter committed a series of attacks, when the attacker was actually Ellie's husband Toby Mills. Johnno also caught his other daughter Steph Dean physical attacking Dan and Ellie's sister Lisa Hunter and had to pull Steph off her victim, before publicly reprimanding her for her behaviour.
The family become heavily in debt after Johnno lost his job when his workplace collapsed and the Deans had to move homes. This resulted in a number of arguments between Johnno and Frankie that almost led to the collapse of their marriage. Johnno briefly turns to alcohol to cope with his troubles but when he realises how much he feels alienated from Frankie and how distressed Steph is after she is diagnosed as having epilepsy, he stopped drinking as heavily..
After losing their house, Johnno and Frankie patched up their differences and began renting a house. Johnno began working for Richard Taylor, who took him on at his fitness club, Body Boost. When a rivalry between the Dean and Taylor families began, Richard terminated Johnno's job contract. However, Richard later re-employed Johnno at Body Boost and Jake took out a mortgage to help clear the family's debt accumulated. Still feeling alienated from Frankie, Johnno began an affair with 19-year-old student Michelle. Frankie discovered Johnno’s affair and confronted him. Frankie still tried to save the marriage but decided to divorce Johnno when he revealed that Michelle was seven months pregnant with his baby. His children decided they did not want to have any contact with their father so he left.
Johnno briefly returned in July 2005, telling his family that Michelle had left him for someone her own age and that she had told him that her baby was not his. He told them that he had missed his family and wanted a chance to make things up to them. Steph and Jake decided they were prepared to give Johnno another chance. However, Craig was unconvinced by Johnno's story so rang Michelle and found out that Johnno was lying and that he had in fact left Michelle and their newborn son Presley out of desperation after realising that he could not handle being a father again at his age.
Johnno's family then told him they were disgusted by his behaviour. Frankie nevertheless told Johnno that she had decided to forgive him for his affair as she felt life was too short to remain hostile towards the father of her children. She also said that she was far happier with her new partner Jack Osborne, and there was no hope of them reuniting. Johnno realised that Michelle and Presley needed him more than his other family did so he decided to go back home and make up with Michelle. Frankie was later told that Johnno and Michelle had married. In 2010 Johnno did not attend Steph's funeral although he was informed of her death.

Leo Vincent Brothers

Leo Vincent Brothers a.k.a. ""Vincent Bader"" (1899 – 1950) was an early 20th-century gangster who gained notoriety throughout the underworld after being convicted of the 1930 murder of Chicago Tribune reporter Jake Lingle.
Starting out as a low-level member of the St. Louis gang known as the Egan's Rats, he was once the manager and a bouncer at The Green Mill in Chicago. Brothers soon graduated into labor racketeering and contract murder. Dodging a 1929 murder indictment, Brothers fled to Chicago, where he found work in the Chicago Outfit, under the notorious crime boss, Al Capone. Leo was ultimately convicted of the Lingle murder, being sentenced to 14 years. His attorney was Louis Piquett, who later became famous as John Dillinger's lawyer.
Most observers, then and now, believe that Brothers was handed up to the state by Capone as a sacrifice. 
Mario Gomes, Capone historian says that Frank (Frankie) Foster who was a triggerman for the North Side Mob and later the Chicago Outfit was most likely the man who pulled the trigger on the Jake Lingle contract. The contract was handed out and organized by Jake Zuta. After his release in 1940, Brothers returned to St. Louis, beat his original murder case, and became hooked up with the local mob. Three months after an unsuccessful attempt on his life, Leo Brothers died of heart disease in St. Louis on December 23, 1950.

High Moon Studios (formerly Sammy Studios) is an American video game developer, that used to be a part of Sierra Entertainment. After a period as independent studio, the developer was acquired by Vivendi Games in January 2006 and retained the current name. It is now owned by Activision Blizzard, a parent company of Activision.
History.
Originally owned and operated by the Japanese publisher Sammy, the former Sammy Studios, Inc. established itself as an independent developer following Sammy's pull-out of American development in efforts to focus on its Japanese productions. In March 2005, the company announced that it had completed a management buyout from Sammy Corporation, and had changed its name to High Moon Studios, Inc., with CEO John Rowe heading the developer's continuing North American efforts on previous games from Sammy Studios and other titles (including the macabre shooter Darkwatch.) In January 2005, it was announced that Vivendi Universal Games had acquired High Moon Studios. John Rowe, president and CEO of High Moon, continues to manage the studio from Carlsbad, CA. Following the completion of Deadpool, Activision fired 40 full-time employees from High Moon Studios that worked on the project. Activision made this statement: "Activision Publishing consistently works to align its costs with its revenues – this is an ongoing process, with the completion of development on Deadpool, we are taking a reduction in staff at High Moon Studios to better align our development talent against our slate."

Robert Palk

Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet (December 1717 – 29 April 1798) was an English cleric and politician. He is mostly known for his involvement with the British East India Company and his term as governor of the Madras Presidency.
Early life.
Robert Palk was born in December 1717 at Lower Headborough Farm on the outskirts of Ashburton, on the road towards Buckland in the Moor, and baptised on 16 December 1717 at the Old Mission House, Ashburton. His father Walter Palk, born in 1686, was of yeoman farmer stock and his mother, Frances, was the daughter of Robert Abraham. Walter Palk supplemented his income by acting as a carrier of serge, from the cloth mills just down the road, over Haldon Hill to Exeter. Walter had three children, Walter, Robert and Grace. It was Robert who was to bring the family fame and fortune.
Doubts have arisen in some journals as to the exact birthplace of Robert Palk because although there were Palks recorded as living at Ambrooke in the late 15th century, in 1717 the Neyle family apparently owned Ambrooke. Robert Palk mentioned Ambrooke in reference to his line of descent, and some historians have assumed that was where he was born.
Educated at Ashburton Grammar School, he was sponsored by his godfather (who was also his maternal uncle) Robert Abraham, to attend Wadham College, Oxford, graduating in 1739.
Career.
Palk was ordained as a deacon in 1739 at Exeter Cathedral by Bishop Weston and held two curacies in Cornwall at Egloskerry and Launcells, before going to London in 1741.
During his spell in London he attracted the attention and favour of Sir Robert Walpole, generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, under whose auspices he was sent to India.
In 1747 he was appointed naval chaplain to Admiral Edward Boscawen on the "Namura", bound for India. He arrived at Fort St David in 1748, at the time when the French were in control of Fort St George in Madras. Trade supremacy was the order of the day, with the French and British both vying for the major share of the market. For a time it was merely a trade war, with a minimal presence of armed troops, whose task it was to guard the warehouses. Soon the situation evolved into armed fighting between the French and British, and eventually the British Government recognised they were in fact, now at war with France over who controlled India.
General Stringer Lawrence was given the task of forming an army, and history now remembers him as the ‘Father of the Indian Army’. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1773, which effectively took control of Indian interests away from the Company and its shareholders and placed it into the hands of The Crown.
Promotion.
Early in 1749 the chaplain at Fort St David, Francis Fordyce, publicly insulted Robert Clive, leading to dismissal, which resulted in Robert Palk taking his place. This important promotion led to disagreements regarding the seniority of Palk over other chaplains. Palk sailed to Bombay in October 1750 with the intention of resigning his post and to seek formal employment with the East India Company. However, matters were resolved and he was reinstated and returned to Fort St David in March 1751. It was at this time that Palk made the acquaintance of Stringer Lawrence, after which time they remained lifelong friends.
Robert Clive was an army officer in the East India Company and later became Governor of Bengal. He arrived in India almost penniless, and due to his hard work and dedication to the King and the East India Company, he was well rewarded with many opportunities by his mentor, Stringer Lawrence. He later became the first Baron Clive of Plassey and the fortune he made from India was probably a lot greater than Palk or Stringer Lawrence could ever have dreamt of.
In 1752 Robert Palk was appointed to the lucrative position of ‘Paymaster and Commissary in the Field’ to Lawrence’s army. In January 1754 Palk and Henry Vansittart were appointed to discuss the terms of a peace settlement with the French who had control over a large part of India. It took a year before a settlement was finally reached.
It was noted during these years that, according to Robert Orme (a colleague of Palk's in Madras) that ‘Palk had long since given up studies of history and theology and had thrown himself into active engagement with the contemporary affairs of the British at Madras.’
Palk was starting to amass a small fortune, thanks mainly due to Stringer Lawrence putting lucrative deals in his direction, but the directors of the company soon instructed Palk to confine himself to his religious duties.
This did not sit well with Palk and he returned to England. He renounced his vows and on 7 February 1761 married Anne Vansittart, the sister of Henry, his wealthy and well-respected colleague in India, whose family home was Shottesbrooke Park in Berkshire.
While back in England, the East India Company was experiencing various trading difficulties in India. At the Company’s London Headquarters during discussions concerning who might be able to help with the problem, one of the members declared: ‘Gentlemen, you forget, we have Palk at home.’ With one voice the members replied ‘The very man!’ So Robert Palk returned to India in October 1761. He was invited to serve on the Council of the Company, and was appointed to membership of the Treasury Committee. He also served as the Export Warehouse Keeper.
When George Pigot resigned in November 1763, it made way for Palk to take up the post of Governor of Madras. With his new-found authority Palk dived deeper into the world of trade, all the time enlarging his personal wealth.
Palk eventually left India in January 1767 at the age of 50, and was well received by both the King and the Court of Directors on his return. However, returning to England was not the end of his involvement with India. He introduced and was patron to many, who, like him, went with the intention of making themselves a fortune from India.
His nephew Jonathan Palk said this of his Uncle Robert: ‘"Rectitude of mind and benignity of heart formed the outline of his character. Uncorrupted by the luxury of the East, he was an encourager of bodily and mental exertion, furnishing his friends with the means not of idleness, but of being active for their own good and the good of society. My father was a little farmer with a large family; for him my uncle bought an estate, which enabled him to live a credit to his mother, and respected by his neighbours".’
Election to parliament.
Robert Palk was MP for Ashburton in 1767 and again between 1774 and 1787. In the intervening years he held the office of MP for Wareham, between 1768 and 1774. This was due to the influence of Calcraft, at the time Secretary for War. His brother Walter Palk also became an MP for Ashburton.
Despite living in Torquay and then at Haldon House near Exeter, he remained involved with Ashburton for a long time. He owned land around Ashburton and even supplied the church with a new organ.
Robert Palk took a great interest in political matters, mainly supporting the government, but taking an active interest in any matters concerning India and the British East India Company. Palk was a Tory in sentiment but resented Lord North's Act, passed in 1773, for the regulation of the East India Company.
The Warren Hastings Correspondence in the British Museum contains a large number of letters written by Robert Palk to Warren Hastings between 1767 and 1782. Hastings was the first Governor General of India and often wrote to Palk back in England. Some of the letters in the ‘Palk Manuscripts’ were from Hastings asking favours of Sir Robert. Diamonds were a key issue, which were used as a way of sending large sums of money back to England. One letter concerning the precious stones is dated March 1770:
Peerage.
Robert Palk was made a baronet on 19 June 1782 during the reign of King George III. This was in recognition of his efforts in securing India for Britain. His coat of arms portrayed an eagle displayed and the crest had a semi-terrestrial globe of the northern hemisphere with an eagle rising from it, supported by two Asian Indians in loincloths and turbans. The family motto was "Deo Ducente" meaning ‘With God as my Guide’. This was followed by the Mayor of Exeter adding him to the centuries-old roll of the City of Exeter Freemen, a privilege that his son and successive heirs retained until 1883.
With Anne, he had a son Lawrence, whose godfather was General Stringer Lawrence; and three daughters, Anne, Catherine and Emelia. Both Catherine and Emelia died young, while Anne who had married Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet in 1786, died at the age of 24.
Sir Robert Palk died at Haldon House on 29 April 1798, ten years after his wife Lady Anne.
They were both buried in Dunchideock church.
Palk Bay and the stretch of sea between India and Sri Lanka, The Palk Straits, were named after Robert Palk. A range of hills near Madras, the Palkonda Hills, were also named after him.
The Palk Arms in the village of Hennock Devon is the only pub to be named after him.

The competition was played between January and April 1914 and won by Ireland with a team that included Patrick O’Connell, Billy Gillespie, Val Harris, Louis Bookman, Samuel Young and Bill Lacey. 
1913-14 was the first time Ireland won the competition outright. The Irish had been the tournament's poorest performers over the years, but the previous year had demonstrated potential in beating England for the first time, in a 2–1 win at Windsor Park. Ireland began the 1914 tournament beating Wales 2–1 a in Wrexham on January 19 and then demolished England in England for the first time, winning 3–0 at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough. Ireland clinched the title on March 16 following a 1–1 draw with Scotland at Windsor Park while England's away victory over Wales did not salvage their poor campaign as Scotland would eventually finish as runners up, beating England 3–1 at Hampden Park. It would be six years before the trophy was again contested, and it would be with substantially different teams and in a different, increasingly global era of football.

Kalamazoo Institute of Arts

The Kalamazoo Institute of Arts (KIA) is a non-profit art museum and school in downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States.
History.
In 1924, members of the Kalamazoo Chapter of the American Federation of the Arts established the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts "to further the development of interest and education in and of regard and appreciation for the various arts."
The KIA's current facility opened in September 1961. Designed by the Chicago, Illinois, firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the structure is based on the Mies van der Rohe International Style of architecture. It offers studio classrooms, a library, auditorium, exhibit areas, a sculpture garden and office space.
In 1997, the KIA began a $14.5 million expansion and renovation. The project increased the size of the KIA to , and added a two-story lobby gallery, auditorium, classrooms and galleries, gallery shop, library and an interactive gallery for kids.
Dale Chihuly's "Kalamazoo Ruby Light Chandelier", a colorful chandelier of 400 pieces of glass, became a permanent fixture in the lobby foyer. The renovated facility, with its 10 galleries and of exhibition space, opened in September 1998.
Exhibitions.
The KIA hosts 10 to 15 temporary exhibitions each year. These include recurring shows such as the West Michigan Area Show, High School Area Show, and Young Artists of Kalamazoo County. Others are built around works lent from museums, galleries, corporations or private collections. 
The museum also mounts ticketed exhibitions; the most successful have drawn tens of thousands of visitors.
The KIA offers lectures and educational events, outreach programs and a fine arts research library.
Permanent collection.
The museum's permanent collection consists of more than 4,200 original works. Its primary emphasis is on 20th-century American art, with works by such artists as Ansel Adams, Mary Cassatt, Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Helen Frankenthaler, Edward Hopper, Luis Jimenez, Käthe Kollwitz, Tim Lowly, Ed Paschke, Norman Rockwell, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Andy Warhol, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Andrew Wyeth. The collection also includes a number of 18th- and 19th-century American works, 20th-century European works, as well as African, Chinese, Japanese, and pre-Columbian and Oceanic works.
Kirk Newman Art School.
The school has offered visual arts instruction to the community since 1931. Its goal is to nurture artistic creativity in the residents of West Michigan by providing affordable classes and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels in a range of media, including painting and drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, jewelry-making, weaving and fiber arts. Faculty members are practicing artists and educators. The school was renamed in 2006 to honor Kalamazoo artist and former school director Kirk Newman.
KIA Art Fair.
The KIA Art Fair began in 1952 as the Clothesline Art Show, an opportunity for local and regional artists to sell their works. Held the first Saturday of June in nearby Bronson Park, the KIA Art Fair is now the second oldest continuously running art fair in the United States. Each year, thousands of visitors join 200 artists in Bronson Park to view and purchase paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, jewelry, ceramics, fiber ware, sculpture and more.

The name is an acronym for "Tōkai IC Card". Just like JR East's Suica or JR West's ICOCA, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa.
As of December 2007, 350,000 cards have been issued. In the Nagoya area, 50% of the riders, or 70% of the commuter pass holders, use the card.
Usable area.
TOICA is currently accepted on JR Central lines in the following area:
Integrated services.
TOICA is also usable in Suica accepting area (Greater Tokyo Area, Sendai, and Niigata) and ICOCA accepting area (Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto and Okayama-Hiroshima) and SUGOCA accepting area (Fukuoka-Saga). Suica (including Mobile Suica), ICOCA and SUGOCA are usable in TOICA accepting area as well. However, a card has to be used within a single area; for instance, it is not possible to use a card for the trip between Tokyo and Nagoya. The integrated service with Suica and ICOCA started in March 2008 and with SUGOCA in March 2011.
Future of TOICA.
The smart card called manaca that will be introduced in February 2011 on Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu) and Nagoya Municipal Subway, and slated to replace the current system, will have integrated service with TOICA by 2012 and Suica by 2013. Service with PiTaPa for Kintetsu and other private railway networks in Kansai region is also being considered.
However, there are no known plans to have integrated services with already existing smart card systems in Shizuoka Prefecture, namely LuLuCa (Shizuoka Railway) or NicePass (Enshu Railway). There are also no integration plans with other cards, such as PASMO, SUGOCA, or Kitaca.

Hatice Sultan (daughter of Ahmed III)

Hatice Sultan was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Ahmed III and consort to Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha. She is considered to have been politically active and exerted influence on the affairs of state during the late Tulip era (1703–1730). 
Biography.
Hatice Sultan was married very young but, as was tradition with Ottoman princesses, did not live with her husband until several years after the marriage. Generally Ottoman princesses could marry as children, but their spouses were not permitted to see them alone until they were at least thirteen years old.
She was described as having had a large political influence on both her father, who left the ruling to her husband, and on her husband, the Grand Vizier. Some sources regard her as the real ruler of the later part of the Tulip era. She was said to have assisted the Marquis de Villeneuve, French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1728–1741, in favor of an Ottoman policy benefitting to French interests during the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War (1735–1739).
She has been referred to as the last "de facto" female ruler of the Ottoman Empire.

Hell (Father Ted)

"Hell" is the first episode of the second series of the Channel 4 sitcom "Father Ted", and the seventh episode overall.
In this episode, Graham Norton makes his first of three appearances as Father Noel Furlong.
Plot.
The episode begins as Ted struggles to remember why the day, 19 July, feels important to him. He and Dougal think for several minutes, before Jack emerges in swim wear and flip-flops. They realize it is time for their annual holiday. They decide to go on to Kilkelly Caravan Park, staying in the caravan of a friend. When Dougal protests, Ted reminds him that the caravan they're using this year is different from the one they used last year. Approaching the park, they see a large, luxurious caravan which they mistake as theirs. In fact, it belongs to a young couple who are showering as the priests enter. The priests are reported and are soon in trouble with the gardaí. Dougal wonders which caravan is theirs, with Ted realizing it is the small, squalid model at the other end. There is barely enough room for the three priests. 
Ted and Dougal decide to put Jack to sleep (by putting a cardboard box over his head) and search for entertainment. However, all that is available are St Kevin's Stump (an ordinary tree stump whose name is unexplained) and the Magic Road (a location in which the laws of gravity disappear). Unfortunately, a rainstorm keeps them confined to the caravan. Ted and Dougal pass their time by playing hide-and-seek and fiddling with the kettle. Ted, using model animals and ultimately in vain, tries to explain to Dougal the difference between 'small' and 'far away'.
Once they set out to visit the places of interest, Father Jack falls victim to the Magic Road and is sent plummeting over a cliff edge.
The holiday meets another setback as Ted and Dougal return to the caravan to find Father Noel Furlong and his youth group squeezed inside and having a sing-song. Noel is excitable, talkative and very camp. He manages to annoy Ted, as well as his long-suffering youth group, while Dougal is merely confounded. Eventually, Noel's behaviour is enough to make Ted and Dougal decide to leave. As Ted tries to enter the nearby outhouse, he realizes too late that the stall is occupied by the woman from the luxury caravan. Her husband, clad in only a towel, pursues the priests as they attempt to escape in their car. The man manages to jump onto the bonnet and rides along for miles, his towel blowing away. Ted finally stops, depositing the man on the road below. Furious, the man finds a glass bottle and uses it to puncture Ted's tyres. He walks away still naked then Noel and his youth group tip over the caravan by dancing in it. The priests try to hitchhike back to the parochial house. They are discovered by the island eccentric Tom, who is transporting raw sewage. When Tom tries to open his truck's doors, he accidentally releases his cargo, showering the priests in excrement. Meanwhile, Jack is seen alive and well on a yacht. He is approached by three beautiful women who offer him a generous choice of drinks. Jack can hardly believe his luck.
The episode ends with Ted and Dougal back in the caravan, with Dougal unable to find Ted during another exceedingly easy game of hide and seek.
Production.
The Caravan site is located at Fanore Beach, County Clare, on the west coast of Ireland.
The writers based the episode on their own childhood experiences. The caravan park was based on Graham Linehan's memories of being taken on 2-week long holidays to grim caravan parks where it would always rain and there would be a plentiful supply of children to bully him. He would describe it as a "holiday in Hell", hence the episode's title. The unusual attractions such as The Magic Road were based on real-life locations Arthur Matthews had visited.
During the filming of the scene in Entertaining Father Stone where the priests are playing crazy golf in a rain storm, which caused the actors to get soaking wet, Dermot Morgan joked that next time the writers will probably get them covered in raw sewage. This is the entire reason why the scene where Ted and Dougal are sprayed with sewage was written. The actors did not realise that the substance made up to look like sewage was extremely cold - this caused them to run away from it very quickly when it was sprayed on them, and the writers to feel guilty about making them do it.

Frank Wise

Frank Joseph Scott Wise AO (30 May 189729 June 1986) was an Australian Labor Party politician and the 16th Premier of Western Australia. He took office on 31 July 1945 in the closing stages of the Second World War, following the resignation of his predecessor due to ill health. He lost the following election two years later to the Liberal Party after Labor had held office for fourteen years previously.
Wise was a farmer for several years in Queensland before working in the Department of Agriculture in that state. He later moved to Western Australia as a technical adviser in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and in 1928 was commissioned to report and advise on tropical agriculture in the Northern Territory and the North West of Western Australia. 
In the 1933 state election which saw future Premiers Albert Hawke and John Tonkin also win seats, Wise successfully contested the seat of Gascoyne (now merged into Murchison-Eyre) in the state's lower house for the Labor Party. In 1936 he moved to the front bench as Minister for Agriculture and the North-West.
For reasons of ill health, John Willcock resigned his premiership on 31 July 1945 and Wise was elected into the position. Wise held the position for only two years until the 1947 election when his party lost to the Liberals headed by Sir Ross McLarty.
He was Leader of the Opposition for the next four years before taking up the position of Administrator of the Northern Territory and President of the Northern Territory Legislative Council (now replaced with the unicameral Northern Territory Legislative Assembly).
In 1942, botanist Charles Gardner named the Australian shrub "Acacia wiseana" in his honour.
In the 1979 Australia Day honours list, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to politics.

Kolmätargränd

Kolmätargränd (Swedish: "Coal Meter's Alley") is a small alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Passing under a low vault it connects the street Västerlånggatan to the square and courtyard Brantingtorget forming a parallel street to Klockgjutargränd and Stenbastugränd.
Mentioned as "Kholmetare Grenden" in 1646 and "Kåålmäterenss grändh" in 1652, the alley is named after the assessor and magistrate "Hans Kohlmeter" (1626–1686), who according to a source dated 1661 had his house built over the alley. While this name seems to have been established around 1700, the commonly used name for the alley during the 17th century was "Johan Sekreterares Gränd" ("Johannis secretereres grend", "Alley of Secretary John"), and a century earlier "Herman Ruggens gränd" (1584).
History.
The present alley is one of the shortest in the old town, and while an article about it might seem superfluous, it has reached an all but legendary status among a large number of Swedes through the still popular troubadour Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795) and his 34th epistle named "Till Movitz, när elden var lös i hans kvarter uti Kolmätargränden" ("To Movitz, when fire ravaged his block in Kolmätargränden"). The eleven verses of the song details how a fire among the brothels in the alley and the succeeding hullabaloo, embarrassingly unveils the presence of the otherwise distinguished customers, symbols for various prominent ranks left behind in the gutters, and, in the end, how Movitz escapes the scene, likened to Aeneas leaving the burning Troy, overburdened with all his musical instruments:
Furthermore, the extent of the alley was considerably tail-docked during WW2, when the planned enlargement of Kanslihuset (The "Chancellery House") caused the old blocks in the neighbourhood to be levelled to the ground, the so-called "Battle of Kolmätargränd" led by Vera Siöcrona ending in the current compromise, the circular courtyard (Brantingtorget) of the Chancellery annex ("Kanslihusannexet") surrounded by the still intact remaining buildings.

Mastering the Universe

Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea is a 2005 book by Roger Sweet and David Wecker that recounts Sweet's work behind the scenes of the corporate culture of the 1980s American toy industry.
Description.
Roger Sweet (with his co-author and nephew David Wecker) details the creation of the "Masters of the Universe" toy line, its rise to immense popularity and then dizzying crash in which profits fell from a peak of $400 million in United States sales alone in 1986 to a mere $7 million in 1987. The book is primarily a view of the corporate workplace side of creating "Masters of the Universe", but details very little of the conceptual process behind inventing the individual "Masters of the Universe" characters and products.

<doc id="9668694" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9668694" title="Death-associated protein 6">
Death-associated protein 6

Death-associated protein 6 also known as DAXX is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "DAXX" gene.
Function.
DAXX, a Death domain-associated protein, was first discovered through its cytoplasmic interaction with the classical death receptor Fas. It has been associated with heterochromatin and PML-NBs (Promyelocytic Leukaemia nuclear bodies) and has been implicated in many nuclear processes including transcription and cell cycle regulation.
This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that resides in multiple locations in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. It interacts with a wide variety of proteins, such as apoptosis antigen Fas, centromere protein C, and transcription factor erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1). In the nucleus, the encoded protein functions as a potent transcription repressor that binds to sumoylated transcription factors. Its repression can be relieved by the sequestration of this protein into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies or nucleoli. This protein also associates with centromeres in G2 phase. In the cytoplasm, the encoded protein may function to regulate apoptosis. The subcellular localization and function of this protein are modulated by post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, phosphorylation and polyubiquitination.
Structure and localization.
DAXX is uniformly expressed throughout the body, except in the testes and thymus, which have especially high expression of the protein. At the level of the cell, DAXX is found in the cytoplasm, interacting with Fas-receptor or other cytoplasmic molecules, as well as in the nucleus, where it is interacting with some subnuclear structures. Several additional interacting proteins are known, but not always is there an understanding of the specific function and relevance of this interaction.
Nuclear.
When the PML-NB are absent or disrupted, DAXX is delocalized and apoptosis does not occur. This interaction was demonstrated when PML-NB disrupted cells were treated and DAXX relocalized with the PML-NB.
ATRX, a centromeric heterochromatin component co-localizes with DAXX. This partnership is found mainly in the S-phase of the cell cycle. No expression of DAXX leads to malfunction of S phase and cells with two nuclei are formed. Another centromeric component, CENP-C, associates with DAXX during interphase. While at first DAXX was said to be a “death protein”, it is suggested that associating with centromeric components leads to another function of DAXX.
Cytoplasmic and membrane.
Fas-receptor stimulation causes Daxx to translocate out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. The breakdown of glucose produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). These induce extracellular Daxx to translocalize into the cytoplasm following an association with ASK1 (Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1). Another mechanism for exogenous Daxx import involves CRM1. This transport mechanism is phosphorylation dependent.
Nevertheless, it is not known whether the Fas-receptor stimuli or the ASK1 overexpression are caused by ROS or CRM1 mediated export.
Role in apoptosis.
Fas-induced.
After Fas stimulation, Daxx is activated and plays its role of pro-apoptotic protein in activating the c-JUN-N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway. This pathway normally regulates stress-induced cell death. It is also essential for development of nerval system by programmed cell death. The real apoptotic process starts after activating this pathway. Daxx does not activate JNK itself but rather the upstream JNK kinase kinase ASK1. Some kind of positive feedback system was also discovered; JNK activates HIPK2, which stands for the translocation of nuclear Daxx to the cytoplasm. In turn, Daxx activates ASK1.
TGF-β regulated.
TGF-β regulates a variety of different cellular developmental processes including growth, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death. Daxx interacts with the TGF-β type II receptor by binding of C-terminal domain of the protein. When the cell is treated with TGF-β, HIPK2, a nuclear kinase, phosphorylates Daxx and the activated Daxx in turn activates the JNK pathway (see "The Daxx Pathway" figure).
Miscellaneous mechanisms.
Glucose breakdown produces ROS, which leads to Daxx production and relocalization, activating JNK pathway in turn. Another inducer of Daxx production is the exposure to UV-radiation.
ASK1 will be transported to the nucleus when UV-irradiation is used to treat the cell. It is still unknown as to whether ASK1 binds Daxx, due to UV-irradiation.
Another important cell death-property of Daxx is the association with PML-NB. It was shown that Daxx associates with Pml only when exposed to high oxidative stress or UV-irradiation. Another study showed loss of Daxx pro-apoptotic function in case of a mutant without Pml.
Anti-apoptotic function.
A rather surprising property of Daxx is its anti-apoptotic function. When Daxx was not expressed or disrupted during embryonic development, it resulted in an early stage lethality. Other studies showed that lack of Daxx gene caused a higher apoptotic rate in embryonic stem cells.
Only when Daxx was bound to Pml were apoptosis rates higher, suggesting that associated cytoplasmic Daxx has the role of an anti-apoptotic molecule.
Other functions.
The omnipresence of Daxx in the cell nucleus suggests that the protein may also function as a transcription factor. Although it contains no known DNA-binding domains, Daxx can interact and suppress several transcription factors, such as p53, p73, and NF-κB. Proteins other than transcription factors are also blocked or inhibited by Daxx, such as the TGF-β pathway regulator, Smad4, conferring upon Daxx a major role in TGF-β signaling.

A. J. Kitt

Alva Ross "AJ" Kitt IV (born September 13, 1968) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from the United States. A member of the U.S. Ski Team for over a decade, Kitt specialized in the speed event of downhill, and also raced in Super-G and combined. He retired from international competition following the 1998 season with six World Cup podiums, which included one downhill victory. Kitt was a bronze medalist in the downhill at the 1993 World Championships. He also had the lead in three World Cup races which were subsequently nullified by FIS officials, due to weather conditions that did not allow the entire field of competitors to start the race. In each, Kitt was awarded the race's prize money and trophies, but not the World Cup points.
Early life.
Born and raised in Rochester in western New York, Kitt started skiing at two years of age at nearby Swain Ski Center where his parents, Ross and Nancy, were part-time ski instructors. Kitt began racing at age 6 and raced in the Genesee Valley Ski Council until age 14. In 1983 he began attending a ski academy in Lake Placid, the Mountain House School. Two years later as a high school junior, Kitt transferred to Green Mountain Vally School in Waitsfield, Vermont, where he graduated in 1986. During a post-graduate year training and racing as part of what is considered the first privateer ski team in U.S. history, Kitt and many of his training team members were selected to the U.S. Ski Team's National Training Group, the development team.
In only his first full season of World Cup racing in 1988, Kitt made the U.S. team at age 19 for the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary. He was the first American male alpine skier to compete in four Olympics, later passed by Bode Miller. Kitt is said to have "breathed life into a stagnant U.S. Ski team" when he won his first World Cup race in Val d'Isere, France, on December 7, 1991. It was the first victory of any kind for an American male in seven years. He spent much of the 1992 season ranked in the top five in the downhill standings, and finished strong at the end of the season to take third overall, the best season for an American downhiller at the time. He finished ninth in the downhill at the 1992 Winter Olympics, held on a different course than his World Cup victory two months prior.
In 1993, Kitt won the bronze medal at the World Championships in Morioka, Japan. He joined Doug Lewis as the only American men to win a World Championship medal in downhill. He was challenging for another medal in the combined, but missed a gate in the slalom's second run, hiked back up and finished 28th. During the 1990s, Kitt won four titles at the U.S. Alpine Championships.
Early in the 1996 season, he crashed hard in a downhill training run in early December at Val-d'Isère, the site of his only World Cup win four years earlier. He suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), along with other associated damage to his left knee, which ended his season, including the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain. After surgery and six months of rehabilitation, Kitt returned for the 1997 season. The remainder of his career saw only one top-10 result, several top-20's and plenty of frustration. Kitt battled chronic back injuries in his final two seasons and retired in March 1998.
Olympic results.
Kitt competed in four Winter Olympics; his best finish was ninth place in the downhill at Val-d'Isère in 1992.
Post career.
AJ Kitt continues to support ski racing in many forms. The Kitt Cup is a season long race series which takes place at the Swain ski resort where he first began his training.<br>He has been the traveling NASTAR pacesetter since 1999, and continues to provide race coaching . AJ Kitt also gives inspirational guest speaking engagements to youth ski racers everywhere.
Kitt resides in Hood River, Oregon.

1981–82 British Home Championship

The 1981-82 British Home Championship between the British Home Nations was won by a dominant England football team which won all three of its matches as the tournament returned after being abandoned in 1981 due to civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. The championship was eagerly awaited because for the first time since 1958, three of the Home Nations were featuring in a World Cup; the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain and this was a chance to see them in competitive action before the World Cup began. The end-of-season format that had been used throughout the 1970s was dropped as it was felt three games in eight days was too intense at the end of a season and prior to a World Cup. The English began impressively with a heavy victory over Northern Ireland at home, followed by victory away in Wales. The Scots could only manage a draw with the disappointing Irish by contrast although they did beat Wales. The Welsh managed to salvage a result in their third game with a 3–0 defeat of Northern Ireland to claim third place. In the final deciding match in Glasgow, England edged victory through a Paul Mariner goal and thus claimed the championship. In the World Cup, Scotland were eliminated in the first round whilst England went out in the second round without losing a game. The unfancied Irish however provided a shock by beating hosts Spain and eliminating Yugoslavia in the first round before falling victim to the inspired French in round two.

Swing Swindlers (also known as the "Bel-Etage Swing Orchestra") 
is an orchestra specializing in dance music from the thirties and forties. The 16-member orchestra was formed by Mart Sander, singer and conductor, in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2004. The group consists of young musicians, most of them the members of the Estonian National Opera.
The Swing Swindlers attempts to recreate the sound of the thirties, using authentic recording locations and experimenting with sonic landscapes and sound equipment. In 2005, the Swing Swindlers issued an album in the UK called "Five-Fifteen: A Tribute to the BBC Dance Orchestra", which was nominated as "Jazz Album of the Week" by the "Evening Standard" in January 2006. Other recordings include "Nüüd Lendame!" ("Come Fly With Me", 2005), "Tantsud Tähtedega" ("Strictly Come Dancing", 2006), "Deutsche Swingmusic / German Swing Music 1939-1945" (2006). This programme was also filmed, recreating an authentic look and atmosphere of a 1945 film, as "Musik unter Bomben" (Music under bombs, 2007). The Swing Swindlers has released 12 albums of swing music and 3 albums of theatre and concert music.
In addition to Sander, the featured vocalists include Kelli Uustani, Nele-Liis Vaiksoo, Rolf Roosalu, Koit Toome, Maarja-Liis Ilus, Hanna-Liina Võsa, Pirjo Levandi, Mariliina von Üxküll, Gerli Padar and Mikk Saar. The orchestra also features a ballet troupe.
In 2006 and 2007 the Swings Swindlers were the official orchestra of the first seasons of Estonian version of BBC's "Strictly Come Dancing", with Sander also hosting the programme. Since 2007, the orchestra has worked in the semifinal of the Estonian "Pop Idol" ("Eesti otsib superstaari"). Some of the singers that the orchestra accompanied, including finalist Luisa Värk and the winner of the second season, Birgit Õigemeel, have since performed with the orchestra. In 2012, Mart Sander also joined the panel of judges in the program.
In 2012, a new line up of young musicians was formed. The band began to move away from 'swing' towards 'sweet' of 1930s. The album, "Swing And Sweet" was released in Estonia in August 2012 and will be released internationally bu Divine Art in 2013. Their most recent project is an album dedicated to the music of the Jewish-Austrian operetta composer, Pal Abraham.

Anne West, Lady De La Warr

Anne West, Lady De La Warr (née Knollys) (19 July 1555 – 30 August 1608) was a lady at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England.
Biography.
Anne Knollys was the third daughter of Sir Francis Knollys, Treasurer of the Royal Household (1514–1596) to Queen Elizabeth I, and his wife Lady Catherine Carey.
Her maternal grandparents were Sir William Carey and Mary Boleyn. Mary was a sister of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII of England. Anne Knollys' mother was thus a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn had preceded her more famous sister in the King's affections, and had affairs with both Francis I of France and Henry VIII. Both Catherine Carey and Henry Carey may have been Henry's children, although we are unsure of their exact dates of birth. If true, this would make Anne the granddaughter of Henry VIII..
Anne's eldest sister was Lettice Knollys, chief Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth and the mother of the queen's favourite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.
Marriage and issue.
Anne Knollys married, on 19 November 1571, Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, by whom she had six sons and eight daughters:

Bombay Progressive Artists' Group

The Bombay Progressive Artists' Group, PAG, was the most influential group of modern artists in India from its formation in 1947, they combined Indian subject matter with Post-Impressionist colours, Cubist forms and brusque, Expressionistic styles.
History.
The Progressive Artists' Group was formed by Francis Newton Souza and S. H. Raza. M. F. Husain and Manishi Dey were early members, others associated with the group included S. K. Bakre, Akbar Padamsee, Ram Kumar and Tyeb Mehta. 
The group wished to break with the revivalist nationalism established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. The Group was formed just months after the 14 August, 1947 "Partition of India" and Pakistan that resulted in religious rioting and death of tens of thousands of people displaced by the new borders. The founders of the Progressive Artists Group often cite "the partition" as impetus for their desire for new standards in India, starting with their new style of art. Their intention was to "paint with absolute freedom for content and technique, almost anarchic, save that we are governed by one or two sound elemental and eternal laws, of aesthetic order, plastic co-ordination and colour composition."
In 1950, Vasudeo S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna and Mohan Samant joined the Group, following the departure from India of the two main founders Souza and Raza. Bakre also left the group. The group disbanded in 1956.
European modernism was the most distinctive influence on the group, but its members worked in dramatically different styles, from the Expressionism of Souza to the pure abstraction of Gaitonde. Specific Indian imagery and landscapes were also adopted, particularly by Metha and Husain.

Ross McLarty

Sir Duncan Ross McLarty KBE MM (17 March 189122 December 1962) was the 17th Premier of Western Australia.
Early life.
McLarty was born in Pinjarra, Western Australia, the youngest of seven children of Edward McLarty, a farmer and grazier and member of the Western Australian Legislative Council, and his wife Mary Jane, née Campbell. He attended Pinjarra State School and the Perth Boys' High School.
On 12 January 1916 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the Blackboy Hill depot. On 27 March he was promoted to corporal and assigned to the 44th Battalion, arriving in England on 21 July. The 44th Battalion departed England for the Western Front on 25 November 1916. McLarty was promoted to sergeant on 29 March 1917. In June 1918, McLarty was awarded the Military Medal for "bravery in the field" on 25 January 1918 at Passchendaele.
McLarty was commissioned on 1 May 1918 as a second lieutenant and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 August. This was the rank he held until being discharged. On 28 August 1918, during the Second Battle of the Somme, McLarty was wounded in the left hand. While convalescing in London he had a chance meeting with his brother Douglas who was serving with the 16th Battalion.
After the war, McLarty returned to farming at Pinjarra and married Violet Olive Margaret Herron on 25 October 1922. He served as a justice of the peace from 1925 and belonged to the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia.
Parliamentary career.
He campaigned in the 1930 state election as a Nationalist candidate with the slogan 'A practical farmer for a farming electorate', winning the lower house seat of Murray-Wellington. At the 1933 election, the Nationalists were defeated by the Labor Party under Philip Collier, beginning a 14-year period in opposition for the conservative parties. On 14 December 1946, McLarty succeeded the retired Robert Ross McDonald as leader of the newly formed Liberal Party, which had amalgamated with the Nationalists.
Premiership.
The 1947 election saw the Liberal-Country coalition unexpectedly defeat the Labor government of premier Frank Wise who had held the position for only two years. For the first time since 1933, the Liberal (formerly Nationalist) group in Parliament was larger than the Country Party's and, under the negotiated coalition agreement, McLarty became premier and the Country Party's Arthur Watts became his deputy.
Together with the premiership, he held the Treasury, Housing, Forests and North-West portfolios. His administration coincided with rapid post-war expansion of the Western Australian economy and, in 1950, conducted negotiations with BP to develop an oil refinery at Kwinana which subsequently developed into the state's main industrial district. His government accepted federal funding to establish the State Housing Commission. His premiership was, however, marred by discord between the two coalition parties. He was knighted in January 1953 and lost office at the election next month, continuing as opposition leader for another four years until March 1957.
Throughout his parliamentary career, McLarty travelled home to Pinjarra for most weekends. He was chairman of the Murray District Hospital Board and held a number of pastoral investments, including a controlling interest in Liveringa station, near Derby. He resigned from parliament because of poor health in May 1962 and died in December. McLarty was accorded a state funeral and is buried in the Pinjarra cemetery.

Chandler Scientific School

New Hampshire native Abiel Chandler, a Boston commission merchant, bequeathed funds to Dartmouth College to establish the Abiel Chandler School of Science and the Arts in 1852.[http://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ms869.html] The school was as a separate undergraduate college at Dartmouth comparable to the earlier Lawrence Scientific School (1847) at Harvard University and the later Sheffield Scientific School (1854) at Yale University.
Chandler students established their own fraternities (Phi Zeta Mu, now the Tabard, and Sigma Delta Pi/Vitruvian, later Beta Theta Pi); sat in their own pews for morning services in the Old Chapel in Dartmouth Hall; and had their own sports teams. Classes took place in Chandler Hall, which stood between Parkhurst Hall and the Blunt Alumni Center. The building, built by Moor's Charity School in 1835 and designed by Ammi B. Young, was remodeled with a Mansard roof by Chandler mathematics professor Frank Asbury Sherman in 1871 and received a rear addition in 1898, designed by Charles Alonzo Rich, a Chandler graduate of 1876 and designing partner of the New York architects Lamb & Rich.[http://www.dartmo.com/rich/buildings.html]
Dartmouth absorbed the Chandler Scientific School in 1893 and continued as the Departments of Zoology, Botany, and Geology.[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dietrich/history/briefhistory.html] The Chandler Fund continues to be administered by appointed Visitors and was valued at about $1.3 million in 2000.

Esma Sultan (daughter of Abdul Hamid I)

"This article is about the Ottoman princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdulhamid I. For other uses, see Esma Sultan (disambiguation page)."
Esma Sultan (17 July 1778 – 4 June 1848) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, sister of Sultan Mustafa IV and Sultan Mahmud II. She was the adoptive mother of Bezmiâlem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan.
Biography.
She was born in 1778 to Abdul Hamid I during his reign. Her mother was Ayşe Seniyeperver, the 4th wife of the sultan. Her brother Mustafa was born in 1779 and Mahmud in 1785. Since Prince Mustafa was only 10 years old when Abdul Hamid I died in 1789, her first cousin Selim ascended the throne as Selim III.
Esma Sultan was married in 1792 at the age of only 14 to Captain Pasha Küçük Hüseyin Pasha, a close friend of her cousin sultan Selim III. Thanks to the high position of her husband, she had important influence over Ottoman society. She owned a palace in Divanyolu, kiosks in Çamlıca, Maçka and Eyüp and a waterfront mansion in Kuruçeşme at Bosporus. Her husband died in 1803 when she was 25 years old. She never married again.
In 1807, the Janissaries revolted once more, dethroned, imprisoned, and later murdered Selim III. They placed his cousin Mustafa, brother of Esma Sultan, on the throne as Mustafa IV (1807–1808). Mustafa IV reigned briefly in an era of Janissary riots. He was deposed in 1808 by the rebels, and his half-brother (and Esma's brother) Mahmud, whose execution he had unsuccessfully ordered, came to the throne as Mahmud II. Mahmud II then ordered the murder of Mustafa and remained so the last male member of the house of Osman I.
Esma Sultan exercised great influence over her brother Mahmud during his reign of 31 years. Sultan Mahmud II died on June 29, 1839 at her palace in Çamlıca. Princess Esma was interested in British culture; she was said to have furnished her palace with Western furniture, putting all of the traditional Ottoman furniture in a storage room. After her death, all of her English furniture was put away in the same storage room and the old oriental ones taken out once again.
She died in 1848 and was laid to rest at her brother's burial place in Mahmud II Mausoleum on Divanyolu Street of the Çemberlitaş neighborhood of Istanbul.

Sidney Grapes

Sidney Grapes was a British comedian, the owner of a bicycle shop and later a garage in Potter Heigham, a village in northeast Norfolk.
In the years before the Second World War, he acquired a reputation as an amateur Norfolk dialect comedian, performing at social functions in many parts of the county and on the radio. However, he is most famous for "The Boy John Letters". The letters appeared in the "Eastern Daily Press", the regional newspaper, at irregular intervals. Grapes would simply write them when he felt like it - and they were always signed "The Boy John". They reported the events in the Boy John's village, and, in addition to the Boy John - a farm worker - they featured as their main characters his Aunt Agatha, Granfar, and old Mrs. W, their neighbour.
Most of the letters ended with a PS containing one of Aunt Agatha's aphorisms, which became famous throughout the county, such as "Aunt Agatha she say: all husbands are alike, only they have different faces so you can tell 'em apart".

John Michael Botean

John Michael Botean () (born July 9, 1955) is an American Eastern Catholic cleric of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. 
He is currently serving as the second bishop in the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St George's in Canton after Bishop Vasile Louis Puscas, in the United States' sole Romanian Byzantine Catholic eparchy and the sole Romanian Rite eparchy outside of Romania.
Early life and ordination.
Botean was born in Canton, Ohio to a Romanian-American couple: John and Amelia Botean (née Popa). He has one younger brother, Mark S. Botean. He was ordained a priest on May 18, 1986. In 1993 he was appointed Apostolic Administrator for the diocese and then the bishop on March 29, 1996, and formally ordained as bishop on August 24 that year by Archbishop Lucian Mureșan (assisted by co-consecrators Archbishop Judson Michael Procyk and Bishop Nicholas James Samra).
Activities.
As the second bishop in the history of a unique eparchy, a large part of Botean's activities consist of compliance work, bringing the organization into conformance with the requirements of his split jurisdiction, both American and Romanian. Most of his parishes long predate the creation of the eparchy, often by many decades. The first mission established during the lifetime of the diocese to be raised to the level of a parish will be raised on June 29, 2008. 
In 2005 Botean established traditional Romanian Byzantine Catholic monasticism in the Diocese of Canton with the transfer of Holy Resurrection Monastery to diocesan jurisdiction. On October 17, 2006, the Holy Theophany Monastery (a convent) was established as a dependency of Holy Resurrection Monastery under the jurisdiction of Botean.
Botean achieved a measure of national and international notice in his Lenten pastoral letter of 2003 which spoke out against the Iraq War. The letter was a direct condemnation of the conflict, and termed it "objectively grave evil, a matter of mortal sin". These were the most outspoken terms committed to paper by a United States Catholic bishop over the war. No other US ordinary has directly condemned the Iraq war. 
On June 28, 2008, Botean called the eparchial assembly to meet. It was the first serious effort to convoke the eparchial assembly in conformance with the 1990 Code of Cannon for the Eastern Churches (Canons 235-242) during Botean's episcopacy. This preliminary session focused on organizing issues. At that meeting the practice of yearly assemblies was announced, the next was held at St. Basil's in Trenton, New Jersey, in June 2009.
Hierarchical relations.
Botean is a member of the USCCB and also the Romanian Catholic Synod. He is in the unusual position of being directly answerable to the Pope and not necessarily to his synod. This odd position is a consequence of the very real modern development of understanding between viewing the Church as one with different rites within it and the Universal Church uniting 23 different "sui iuris" churches. The present situation of the eparchy is a midpoint between the two, within the newly formed Romanian synod but not entirely answerable to it and within the USCCB but not entirely answerable to it either.

1965–66 British Home Championship

The 1965-6 6 British Home Championship was a cause of great excitement as it supplied spectators and commentators a view of England prior to their contesting the football 1966 FIFA World Cup on home soil at which they were one of the favourites. None of the other Home Nations had qualified for the World Cup and so were determined to spoil England's preparation, leading to some very dramatic and heavily contested matches, particularly England's final game in Glasgow.
The England team began with a subduded goalless draw with the Welsh side whilst Ireland beat Scotland 3–2 in a close fought game at home. Both England and Scotland improved in their second games, England beating a tough Irish side at home 2–1, whilst the Scots put four goals past the struggling Welsh. Wales suffered further in their final match of the series, losing 1–4 at home to the Irish, who claimed a surprise second place in the tournament. England and Scotland then played a thrilling game in Glasgow, which England finally won 4–3 to take the title of British Champions, a title they would add to at the World Cup three months later.

Jon McLaughlin

Jon McLaughlin (born September 27, 1982) is an American pop rock singer-songwriter, producer and pianist from Anderson, Indiana. His debut album "Indiana" was released on May 1, 2007, preceded by his first EP "Industry", also known as "Jon McL", in February 2007. His most successful song is the 2008 single "Beating My Heart", from his second album "OK Now".
Early life and education.
McLaughlin grew up in Anderson, Indiana, playing piano since early childhood, though he disliked the lessons, and often sought to avoid them. While attending Highland High School, McLaughlin shattered both wrists in an accident that interrupted his musical expression. Rediscovering "his muse," McLaughlin attended Anderson University to study music.
Career.
McLaughlin released an independent album entitled, "Up Until Now" in 2003. This quickly led to McLaughlin becoming the first artist to sign on with the school's burgeoning record label, Orangehaus Records. The self-titled album released in 2004 to local and regional praise. He began touring, traveling throughout the Midwest and working up a grassroots following.
In 2005 McLaughlin recorded an 8-song EP, "Songs I Wrote and Later Recorded," which reached the #1 spot on AwareStore.com. Touring expanded to across the country as support continued to grow for the independent artist. He also increased his fan base by playing at Timber Wolf Lake, a Young Life camp, with his first album entitled "Jon McLaughlin". He caught the attention of other independent artists and began touring with artists such as Dave Barnes and Matt Wertz. In 2006 McLaughlin signed with iconic record label Island Records. Since then, McLaughlin has increased his presence at well-established musical venues and festivals such as Feeling Better Than Everfine (Cleveland, OH), Waterfest (Oshkosh, WI), Milwaukee Summerfest (Milwaukee, WI), Northwest State College Fest (Archbold, OH) and Lollapalooza (Chicago, IL). He has toured with Kelly Clarkson, O.A.R., Sister Hazel, Cowboy Mouth, Paolo Nutini, and Marc Broussard.
Major label debut.
Since signing with Island Records, McLaughlin increased his public image by providing music for the NBC comedy "Scrubs", episode "My Conventional Wisdom," on May 10, 2007. McLaughlin's song, "Human" was included in the episode. The same song appeared at the end of the episode "The Walk-In" of "Ghost Whisperer". "Beautiful Disaster" can also be heard in the hit TV series "A Little Thing Called Life" in the season two episode titled "The Greatest and Worst Halloween Ever." "Beautiful Disaster" sold over 420,000 digital copies.
To date, three Hollywood-released films have included songs from McLaughlin. The song "Another Layer" appeared on the soundtrack for the motion picture "Bridge to Terabithia" and "Beautiful Disaster" is used in the 2007 film "Georgia Rule". McLaughlin also made an on-screen appearance and performance of the song, "So Close" (written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz) in the Oscar-nominated Disney film "Enchanted". The song received an Oscar nomination. This led to McLaughlin performing at the 80th Academy Awards, which he attended with his wife Amy.
Rising fame.
McLaughlin opened on Kelly Clarkson's My December Tour beginning in October 2007, a role announced on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on August 7, 2007. He has also toured extensively with similarly styled and popular singer-songwriter, Sara Bareilles.
He recorded a trio with Jason Mraz and Van Hunt for the Randy Jackson duets-album "Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1". The track title is "Something to Believe In". McLaughlin's "Human" is also heard in TV Promos for CBS series' "Flashpoint".
In 2008, McLaughlin appeared as himself in the film "Enchanted" starring Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey singing "So Close", which led to a performance at the 2008 Academy Awards. In 2010, the song was used in Disney California Adventure's World of Color show.
McLaughlin's version of "Smack Into You", written and produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, was leaked to the internet in 2008, but did not appear on "OK Now". Beyoncé eventually covered the song and it was featured on her album "I Am... Sasha Fierce", re-titled as "Smash Into You".
In June 2008, McLaughlin premiered "Beating My Heart", which was released to mainstream radio on July 22, 2008, prior to being sent to Hot Adult Contemporary (Hot AC) on June 10. "Beating My Heart", first single from his second studio album "OK Now", is available with the rest of the album for download on iTunes and Amazon. The song was praised by "Billboard" single reviews editor Chuck Taylor, who wrote that "It's high time for singer/songwriter Jon McLaughlin to earn his due." following with a description of the song as "a joyous uptempo romantic romp, featuring hook after hook, from tinkling piano to driving percussion and a start-and-stop bridge, alongside a joyous effortless vocal that soars with falsetto to the high heavens. The accompanying video is simple enough, but effectively illustrates McLaughlin's charms as a palatable sex symbol. "Heart" pumps with instantaneous hit potential, and proper promotion of it could propel the artist to superstar status."
His song "We All Need Saving" (also from "OK Now") has appeared on an advertisement for the TV Show "The Event". 
McLaughlin co-wrote "Every Time You Lie" and "Falling Over Me" with Demi Lovato for her second album "Here We Go Again". The latter was originally a duet, but the final version only featured McLaughlin's backing vocals.
McLaughlin self-financed and released his third studio album "Forever If Ever" on September 6, 2011. He later signed to record label Razor & Tie and re-released the album as "Promising Promises" on May 22, 2012, remastering all the tracks and adding three new songs. The first single from the album, "Summer is Over," featuring Sara Bareilles, was released on January 10, 2012.
In July 2013, McLaughlin launched a campaign with PledgeMusic, allowing listeners to actively be involved with the making of his new album, soon to be released.
On February 15th, 2014 McLaughlin was the opening act for Billy Joel at The Palace of Auburn Hills. (Auburn Hills), Michigan.
On March 9th, 2014 McLaughlin was the opening act for Billy Joel at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Canada.

Källargränd

Källargränd (Swedish: "Basement Alley") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, connecting Slottsbacken, the slope south of the Royal Palace, to the square Stortorget. It forms a parallel street to Trångsund and is intercepted by Trädgårdsgatan.
The alley is named after the former tavern "Storkällaren" ("Great basement"), in its turn named after the vicinity to the cathedral Storkyrkan. The tavern was located under the town house, where the present Stock Exchange Building is found. The town hall was relocated to the Bonde Palace at Riddarhustorget in 1730, and when the old building was demolished in 1767, the tavern moved to Svartmangatan. The name of the alley survived in various forms: ""Stora Källaregränden", "St. Källarbrinken" (1733), "Stora Kiällare-Gränden" (1740), "Källar-Gränd" (1855). Together with the inauguration of the stock exchange a new tavern was opened, which remained in business until 1906.
The Swedish Academy and the Nobel Library are on number 4.
Two sandstone sculptures, "Hoppet" ("Hope") and "Försiktighet" ("Guardedness") by Kortz Daniel from 1702 are located in the alley.

The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)

"The Long Way Home" is the first arc from the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight" series of comic books, a direct continuation of the television series of the same name. It is written by creator Joss Whedon. It ran for four issues. The first issue was released on March 14, 2007, and the final issue of the arc was released on June 6, 2007. A collected edition of the arc was released on November 14, 2007.
Plot.
Part I (Issue #1).
Buffy is leading a squad of Slayers—including three named Leah, Rowena, and Satsu—in a raid on a large, dilapidated church protected by a forcefield. She reveals that there are at least 1800 Slayers now active, 500 of whom are working with the Scooby Gang spread over ten squads. There are two Slayers posing as decoys of her, lest she become an easy target; one literally underground and another in Rome publicly partying and dating the Immortal. Working with Xander, who is running things at Slayer headquarters in Scotland (Buffy refers to him as a Watcher despite his objections) with a team of computer workers, psychics and mystics, including a Slayer named Renee, Buffy and her squad find three monstrous demons. There are also three dead humans.
The demons are killed in battle. The humans have odd symbols carved in their chest and there are nearby automatic weapons. Buffy tells Xander to send a copy of the symbol to Giles, when another Slayer finds the machine that generated the force field, also presumably belonging to the victims. There is a shadowed spy nearby.
In Sunnydale, General Voll of the United States Army surveys the crater left after the collapse of the Hellmouth, calling the Slayers a threat to the United States government and likening their squads to terrorist cells. A government expedition is being led sixty feet under the Hellmouth, but is cut short when one of the exploratory members encounters something.
Buffy takes a break from studying the symbol to talk to Dawn. She is now giant-size; the others believe it was because her ex-boyfriend is a 'Thricewise' but Dawn remains quiet on the topic. The two have been feuding since the destruction of Sunnydale. It is revealed the government is working with Amy Madison who wants to destroy the Slayers. Amy has an ally that Voll has captured.
Part II (Issue #2).
Giles and Buffy, in different locations, are both disappointed in the fighting techniques of the Slayers they are training. They encourage the groups to use teamwork. Buffy compliments the Slayer Satsu on her skills and hair. In Southern Italy, Andrew is outside with a group of Slayers. He tries to go with a lecture on combat techniques but is distracted with talk of Lando Calrissian.
Xander wonders if Dawn has made herself giant sized to gain attention from her sister; Dawn splashes Xander in return. Elsewhere, General Voll and his assistant discuss possible plans to destroy Buffy and her Slayers, from Amy Madison to a nuclear bomb. It's revealed Voll has the same symbol as the victims Buffy found earlier. 
Buffy has a sexual dream concerning Xander, which segues into a demon crucifying her. Amy Madison tries to kill Buffy, but fails and is trapped inside the castle by magic. However, she succeeds in cursing her with a sleeping spell that can only be lifted by the kiss of true love; later established to be simply one who loves Buffy.
Renee and another Slayer discuss the attraction the former is developing for Xander. Then kilted zombies attack, summoned by Amy. As the Slayers fight the zombies, both sides taking casualties, Buffy is visited in her dreams by a mysterious figure. Willow Rosenberg appears to force Amy to stop the zombies.
Part III (Issue #3).
The figure in the duster and red shirt is revealed to be Ethan Rayne, a former friend of Giles and chaos-worshipping sorcerer. He reveals that they are trapped within Buffy's dreamspace, the conglomeration of all of a person's possible dreams. Ethan urges Buffy to escape so she can help the battle raging outside. He gives hints about 'Twilight'. 
Amy Madison is defeated, but Buffy is still locked in a coma. Only a kiss from someone who loves her can free her. Willow commands all surrounding her to close their eyes. They do and someone kisses Buffy. She awakens with the cry of "Cinnamon Buns!".
Giles contacts a demon of the same breed as those killed in Part 1, asking for information about the symbol found on the bodies. The demon insists that the symbol is meaningless to his kind. Xander warns Andrew and comforts Renee.
Despite being subdued, Amy's magics transport Willow to an Army base; it is revealed Amy has allied herself with Warren Mears.
Part IV (Issue #4).
As he prepares to torture and mutilate Willow, Warren tells how Amy found and rescued him from death, she is now his 'skin'. 
Buffy's mystical allies will only be able to transport two back to the Army base. Buffy chooses Satsu and borrows her cinnamon lip gloss. 
When the portal is opened, Voll has already set up a high powered energy cannon to blast anyone on the other side of the wormhole. Fortunately for Buffy, Xander had already taken the necessary precautions by rigging a large mirror to reflect the energy blast back through the portal, destroying the cannon and leaving Voll's squad badly damaged and uncoordinated. Buffy and Satsu then appear through the opening. Slayer Scythe in hand and Satsu at her side, Buffy takes on the entire squad, mortally wounding many. This gives her the perfect leverage for the location of her friend, as Willow will be able to heal them. 
Willow is being lobotomized but mysterious elemental beings somehow manifest. They warn her that she cannot come back if she dies at Warren's hands. They inspire her to fight back. She goes 'dark' and frees herself. She slowly heals her own injuries. Willow also channels magical energy into Buffy. This and an illusion of Catherine Madison (Amy's body-stealing mother) allows Buffy's group to win, at least temporarily.
Buffy learns they are two miles south of Sunnydale. She discovers Voll has slain Ethan Rayne and is a follower of the concept of 'Twilight', the recurring symbol supposedly means the end of the Slayer line. General Voll believes the Slayers will take power because their demonic-origins will corrupt them.
Production.
Joss Whedon returns to the series four years after writing the television series' finale. Throughout the issues, he slips references to past episodes in the dialogue. Willow's comment ""I'd like to test that theory"" was first uttered by Giles in season six. Amy's reference that Willow attempted to end the world occurred in "Grave." When Willow's hair turns black, Dawn questions her if she's evil again ("Villains.") Whedon also adds pop-culture references: Xander and Renee discuss Nick Fury, the fictional Marvel Comics character, who wears an eye patch similar to Xander's. 
Like Whedon, Georges Jeanty references past episodes as well as pop-culture in the artwork. In part 3, Buffy's inner psyche feature images of past characters and events. Such instances include The Master, her mother Joyce Summers, Angel, Faith, Caleb, Buffy's doodled notebook ("The Prom,") Joyce's corpse ("The Body,") and Buffy, Willow, Xander's high school graduation ("Graduation Day.") One image also features Joss Whedon himself. Finally, when Andrew is playing strip poker with the Slayers, one of the girls is reading "Fray", the actual graphic miniseries by Joss Whedon comic about a future Slayer. Buffy later time travels to the future and meets Fray.
Reception.
The resurrection of the series was both a critical and commercial success. "Entertainment Weekly" was quoted praising that "creator Whedon effectively sucks devotees back into his Hellmouth."
Elizabeth Anne Allen, who portrayed Amy in the television series commented favourably on the story, describing it as "awesome" and commenting that "Six/Seven was fun... but I really would have loved to play Amy in Season 8. She is much darker."
Canonical issues.
This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of "Buffy", Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this arc, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by "Buffy" and "Angel".
"Season Eight" contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as "Queen of the Slayers" and "Dark Congress", which are described as being set in an unofficial "parallel" continuity.

Magdalena Graaf

Engla Maria Magdalena Graaf (born 2 September 1975 in Gothenburg) is a Swedish model, singer, and author. In 1998, she and her sister Hannah Graaf joined together and formed the group The Graaf Sisters, who became popular with the song "You Got What I Want Baby". She was also the wife of soccer star Magnus Hedman and as a result has been voted the sexiest footballer's wife.
Early years.
Graaf was born in Gothenburg, but she grew up in Kungsängen in Stockholm County, to Swedish Pentecostal parents.
In her late teens, Graaf became pregnant with her son Isak. Instead of burdening or embarrassing her religious parents, she married her Finnish gangster boyfriend Jorma whom she was already living with. During this time, she was physically and emotional abused.
After Graaf was shot in the leg, she left her husband despite threats against her and her family. She eventually reported him to the proper authorities. As a result, she was placed under protective custody and given new identities. She and her son were moved throughout Sweden but eventually settled in Gothenburg and was given the new names of Michaela and Ville for her son.
Her husband was eventually released from prison and he put a 50 000 SEK bounty on her and a reward for hurting her sister model, Hannah. After her husband's indictment, the police did little to help Graaf. She did receive some help from a policewoman who would eventually get fired for helping Graaf. To this day, Graaf has a bitter disdain for the Swedish authorities. Her plight eventually was heard by former MC gang leader who felt bad for her and decided to protect Graaf. Finally, Graaf had enough of hiding and returned home to her mother. Later her ex-husband decided to stop the harassment.
Career.
Modeling.
Due to all the stress following the aftermath her ex-husband's indictment, Graaf lost a great deal of weight and suffered from lack of confidence. She underwent breast augmentation and started an exercise regimen. Her sister Hannah, an established model, took her to a celebrity party where she met E-Type who hit on her. She claims this boosted her confidence and being seen on the party scene with her sister landed her a modeling career.
Graaf followed the footsteps of her younger sister and began glamour modeling. Graaf would often model with her sister Hannah. The two gained noterity for appearing in countless men's magazines. The controversy catapulted lesser known Graaf's career. She has appeared in the magazines "Café", "Moore", and "Slitz". In 1998, Graaf appeared on three separate" Café "covers.
In 2004, The Graaf were looking for a come back. The sisters flew to Los Angeles and did a pictorial for "FHM" magazine.
Music.
The Graaf sisters became a cultural phenomenon and, by 1998 both sisters gave up glamour modeling to pursue a music career. That same year, she formed a musical duo The Graaf Sisters with Hannah and was quickly signed to Sony BMG. The two worked with producers Christer Sandelin, Tommy Ekman, and Rob 'n' Raz. The record yielded the Swedish #1 hit "You Got (What I Want)". The duo has since been on hiatus with both women marrying and having children.
In 2002, the sisters were involved in a civil suit against Mikael Brinkstierna. Brinkstierna alleged that the sisters began working with him in 1996 and that they had a management contract in which he was entitled to 25% of all revenues from the sisters' future disc sales. After the success of their first album, Brinkstierna received no money after he allegedly spent hours helping them be a success. The sisters claim that Brinkstierna gave them nothing but money and accused him of being a crook after a similar dispute Brinkstierna had with the pop group Aqua.
Author.
In March 2006, Graaf released her biography "Det ska bli ett sant nöje att döda dig" ("It is going to be a true pleasure to kill you"), where she tells about her childhood and her first, problematic marriage. The title of her book was the last thing her ex-husband Jorma said to her before she left him and fled with their son Isak.
Television.
Graaf participated in the Swedish edition of "Dancing with the Stars" ("Let's Dance") until the end of January 2009, when she was forced to quit due to a cerebral hemorrhage.
Personal life.
In 1995, she gave birth to her first son, Isak, with her first husband. A year and a half after Isak's birth, Graaf left her husband in 1996. In 1999, Graaf married Swedish football goalkeeper Magnus Hedman. The couple had two sons named Lancelot (born in 2000) and Tristan (born in 2004). During their early marriage, the couple lived in Scotland where Hedman was playing soccer.
After Hedman's retirement the couple resided in Stockholm. In 2006, Graaf separated from Hedman after news papers reported an alleged affair with singer Linda Bengtzing. The couple have since divorced.
Her fourth son, Charlie, was born in 2011.
Charity.
The Sisters made Time Magazine's List of European Heroes for their charity work. Magdalena along with Hannah have donated earnings from their modeling to aid orphanages in Nagpur in central India. The sisters maintain that they never have strayed too far from their Pentecostal upbringing and that their commitment for charity was inherited from their mother Linda Bergling who worked as a missionary in Asia and Africa. Not only have the donated money to the cause but they have built two orphanages and school. Magdelena's then husband, Magnus claimed Magdalena would constantly hits up friends for donations at parties.

The Robber Bridegroom (musical)

The Robber Bridegroom is a musical with a book and lyrics by Alfred Uhry and music by Robert Waldman. The story is based on the 1942 novella by Eudora Welty of the same name, with a Robin Hood-like hero; the adaptation placed it in a late 18th-century American setting. The musical ran on Broadway in 1975 and again in 1976.
Production history.
The show started with an early 1970s production at St Clements Theatre in producer Stuart Ostrow's Musical Theatre Lab, which invented the concept of the "workshop" development process for musicals. Raul Julia starred as Lockhart.. Other cast members included Steve Vinovich (Clemment Musgrove), Rhonda Coullet (Rosamund), John Getz (Little Harp), Ernie Sabella (Big Harp), Trip Plymale (Goat), Dana Kyle (Airie), Susan Berger (Salome),
John Houseman bought the show for his group, The Acting Company and took it to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York with Kevin Kline replacing Julia, Patti LuPone as Rosamund, and Mary Lou Rosato as Salome. It then was staged at the Ravinia Festival in Chicago in the summer of 1975.
The first Broadway production, with the same Ravinia cast directed by Gerald Freedman and choreographed by Donald Saddler, opened in a limited engagement on October 7, 1975 at the Harkness Theatre, where it ran for 14 performances and 1 preview before setting out on a one-year US national tour. Its success on the road convinced the producers to mount a revamped Broadway production with an extended book and expanded, heavily bluegrass-tinged score. 
The music was arranged for guitar, fiddle, mandolin, bass and banjo, deemed "country and Southern" by Clive Barnes.
The second Broadway production opened on October 9, 1976 at the Biltmore Theatre, where it ran for 145 performances and 12 previews. The show was directed by Freedman, choreographed by Saddler, scenery Douglas W. Schmidt, costumes Jeanne Button, lighting David F. Segal, associate producer Porter Van Zandt, production stage manager Mary Porter Hall, stage manager Bethe Ward, and press by Sandra Manley and The Merlin Group, Ltd. The band, or the "McVourie River Volunteers", consisted of Bob Jones (guitar, fiddle), Alan Kaufman (fiddle, mandolin), Steve Mandell (guitar, banjo), Roger Mason (acoustic and electric bass), Evan Stover (fiddle), and Tony Trischka (banjo, bandleader). The cast included Barry Bostwick (Lockhart), Steve Vinovich (Clemment Musgrove), Rhonda Coullet (Rosamund), Lawrence John Moss (Little Harp), Ernie Sabella (Big Harp), Trip Plymale (Goat), Susan Berger (Goat's Mother), Jana Schneider (Airie), Carolyn McCurry (Raven), and Barbara Lang (Salome). The residents of Rodney included George DeLoy (Kyle Nunnery), Gary Epp (Harmon Harper), B.J. Hardin (Norman Ogelsby), Mary Murray (Queenie Brenner), Melinda Tanner (Rose Otto), Dennis Warning (Gerry G. Summers), and Tom Westerman (K.K. Pone).
An original cast recording of the 1976 production was released by CBS.
Since its inception, the show has been staged regularly by regional theatres throughout the country.
Synopsis.
In modern times, Jamie and the other people involved tell of their ancestors, and the time dissolves to 18th century Mississippi.
Robin Hood-like Jamie Lockhart, a legendary character in Mississippi folklore, rescues Clemment Musgrove, who is the wealthiest plantation owner in Natchez Trace from the Harp gang and attempts to woo and win his daughter Rosamond. Standing in his way is her stepmother Salome, whose romantic designs on the gentleman robber lead her to plot the girl's murder. Her scheme falls apart when the clueless henchman she hires to do the deed mistakenly kidnaps Salome instead. What ensues is a series of escapades worthy of a Grimm fairy tale.

Einion Offeiriad

Einion Offeiriad (“Einion the Priest”) (d. 1356) was a Welsh language poet and grammarian.
Einion lived in Ceredigion, where he was a chaplain to Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd ap Hywel ap Gruffudd ab Ednyfed Fychan, a wealthy nobleman. Amongst Einion’s surviving poems is an awdl sung is praise of Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd.
Einion’s fames lies primarily with his metrical grammar, ‘llyfr cerddwriaeth’, the earliest of its kind known in Welsh. Although written in Welsh it is partly an adaption of Latin grammars in use during the early Middle Ages, in particular those of Donatus and Priscianus. It provides a description of the twenty four metres of the cerdd dafod, how they should be composed and a strict edict on proscribed faults. It also lays out the precedence for the subjects of praise: spirirual poetry in praise of God, Christ and the saints before temporal poetry in praise of the King and nobility.

T. M. Lewin

T. M. Lewin (Thomas Mayes Lewin) is a gentleman's shirt importer and was formerly a UK manufacturer.
It was founded in 1898 when Thomas Mayes Lewin opened his first shop in Jermyn Street, St James's, London.
T. M. Lewin produced shirts and accessories with a history of innovation, its founder being one of the first to make the 'coat-shirt', a shirt that the wearer put on like a coat, fastening the buttons down the front. This novelty was noted in the "London Opinion and Today" newspaper in 1905.
An article by "The Major" in a November 1905 edition of "London Opinion and Today" stated that:
"...the shirt is shaped very much like a coat and is put on in a similar manner, fastening in the front with studs. One of its greatest advantages is that it fits closer than the ordinary shirt. Another point is that it has not, of course, to be put over the head. Thus there is no chance of a man who is accustomed to brush his hair before putting on his shirt ruffling his hair in the putting on process."
T. M. Lewin & Sons traded through both World Wars and it was during this period that the company became a provider of Club Colours, becoming a supplier to the RAF, the British Army, the School tie and the sporting community.
In 1979 T. M. Lewin & Sons was acquired by the McKenna family and in 1980 Geoff Quinn, the current managing director, joined the company from Turnbull & Asser.
The McKennas and Geoff Quinn took to sourcing the shirts directly from the mills; consequently in 1983 T. M. Lewin acquired Asquith Brown, a shirt manufacturer owned by John Francomb, who subsequently became part of the T. M. Lewin management team. As a consequence of direct sourcing the company grew rapidly in the 1980s.
In 1989 T. M. Lewin opened its second store, in Lime Street, London and in 1993 Geoff Quinn became managing director following the deaths of both McKenna brothers.
During the 1990s T. M. Lewin continued to open further stores and expand its product ranges, creating the fit out which is used in all stores throughout the UK. It introduced classic suits in 2005, after two years of development.
Club ties are still a major part of the business, with regimental ties for the British Army, the RAF, colleges and universities. The ties for the London 2012 Olympic bid were supplied by T. M. Lewin.
Today's store on Jermyn Street still keeps many of the old traditions, including school ties and regimental ties, of which some belong to regiments where there are only a few survivors who still wear these colours that they earned in the Second World War and other fields of conflict.
In 2012, after making a deal with Myer in Australia, T. M. Lewin opened its first store on Australian soil on January 30, 2012 and now operates as a brand within several MYER department stores across Australia. 
Today T. M. Lewin has 75 stores in the UK and Ireland, 38 of them in Greater London, and eight House of Fraser concessions. It also operates several stores across the world, including in Sydney, Australia and Singapore. Its product range now caters for both men and women and includes:
T. M. Lewin also offers a tailoring service.
T. M. Lewin's Shirts are no longer made in the UK. The company does still provide old school ties for many major British public schools.
In the last four years it has started operating through telephony and online in addition to its branch network. In 2008, the shirtmaker announced sales of over 1.8m shirts, equating to a turnover of over £63m.

Hamilton Townhouse

Hamilton Townhouse is a building in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, which is operated by South Lanarkshire Council. It contains both the town's main public hall (formerly known as Hamilton Town Hall) and public library, as well as various council departments including licensing and community learning.
The building, although appearing to be one, was actually built in stages over a 21 year period. The library section of the complex was opened by Andrew Carnegie in 1907. The adjacent townhouse offices were opened by King George V in 1914 and finally the town hall completed the building in 1928. 
In 2002, each section of the building was closed to enable the building to undergo a massive regeneration project, costing £9 million. This was required to bring the internal facilities to current standards, while restoring the exterior of the A-listed building. In August 2004, the new integrated Townhouse complex was opened to the public, with an official opening by HRH Princess Anne in September. 
The library won two awards: the "Architect Meets Practicality Award" for libraries of significant architectural interest that are practical and user-friendly and the "Mary Finch Accessibility Award" for the library which most addresses access issues from physical through to cultural barriers.

The Children's Investment Fund Management

The Children’s Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP (TCI) is a London‐based hedge fund founded by Chris Hohn in 2003 which manages The Children’s Investment Master Fund. TCI makes long‐term investments in companies globally. The management company is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority. 
Like most hedge funds, TCI requires investors to commit their capital for multi-year periods. This long-term horizon allows the fund greater flexibility when trading and investing capital independent of any potential ad hoc time constraints.
Charity.
TCI derives its name from a charitable foundation called The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), set up by Chris Hohn and his wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn. In an example of "venture philanthropy", CIFF initially received a portion of TCI’s profits and other donations. CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries, and has grown to be one of the largest charities in the United Kingdom. After suffering a 43% loss during the 2008 calendar year, as of July 2009 the previous financial year had seen a rebound of over 70% profit and revenue for TCI.
Through changes set in motion in 2012, the fund and foundation were split up. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do on a discretionary basis.
Investor activism.
TCI has a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism. 
Some critics believe that it has taken an active role in most situations to promote its own agenda under the guise of sound corporate governance and increase shareholder value. TCI has been a major shareholder of the German stock exchange Deutsche Börse where it forced the resignation of the CEO after he refused to abandon his plan to take over the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, after acquiring 1% of the shares of major Dutch bank ABN AMRO, TCI led an attack demanding the bank split up or sell to the highest bidder to produce shareholder value. ABN was ultimately split and sold to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Fortis, and Banco Santander and was a major contributing factor in the downfall of both RBS and Fortis. In June 2007, TCI failed in its attempt to get the Japanese utility J-Power, in which it had acquired a 10% stake, to boost its dividend. The general meeting of shareholders rejected the proposal, prompting a severe selloff in the stock.
In 2006, as a shareholder of both Mittal Steel Company and Arcelor, TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for Arcelor. However, when Mittal Steel subsequently attempted to acquire Arcelor Brasil (one of Arcelor's subsidiaries) without an appropriate premium, TCI defended the rights of Arcelor Brasil’s minority shareholders, causing Mittal to raise its offer price more than 55%.
TCI initiated legal action against the Government of India using provisions in the bilateral trade treaty between United Kingdom and India regarding the under pricing of coal by Coal India Limited,in which TCI holds 1% stake.
In 2008 the company was suffering from heavy losses but recovered very well and assets under management reportedly stood around $6 billion earlier this year, and at the end of 2010, the company recorded a loss of 80% in profits as a result of reduced investment performance.
Awards.
The fund won Eurohedge’s European Hedge Fund of the Year award in 2004, 2005, 2013

These are narrow gauge railways at military establishments and former UK Government-owned explosives sites. These locations were often subject to the Official Secrets Act and other government restrictions, so many of them are less well documented.
The industrial use of narrow-gauge railways was quite extensive amongst the various military and civilian explosive factories, for example ICI Nobel's works at Ardeer and the Agency Explosive Factories run by ICI Nobel in the Second World War. To give an example, the Ministry of Supply (MOS) Factory Dalbeattie used gauge with a variety of bogie trucks mostly pushed by teams of three to six women. Stores, explosives, chemicals, rubbish and sewage, were all transported on this narrow-gauge system, which used at least of track.

Hermann Abert

Hermann Abert (; 25 March 1871 – 13 August 1927) was a German historian of music.
Life.
Abert was born in Stuttgart, the son of Johann Josef Abert (1832-1915), the "Hofkapellmeister" of that city.
From 1890 to 1896 he studied classical philology at the Universities of Tübingen, Berlin and Leipzig. While at Tübingen he joined the "Akademische Gesellschaft Stuttgardia", a student fraternity which shaped the political views of the liberalism in southern Germany. His philological studies ended in 1896 at Halle, where he had done work on Ancient Greek music. For the next three years he studied music theory at Berlin. In 1902 he qualified as lecturer by presenting his thesis on music of the Middle Ages at the University of Halle.
Abert stayed on at Halle as a lecturer, becoming a senior lecturer (or associate professor) in 1910 and a full professor in 1918. In this capacity he moved the next year to the University of Heidelberg. But after just one year, Abert took up a post at Leipzig and in 1920 he became the successor of the music theorist Hugo Riemann. In 1923 he was called to the University of Berlin, where he was seen as the most suitable successor to Hermann Kretzschmar, also a music theorist. It was there that he worked with Friedrich Blume, Rudolf Gerber, Hans Hoffmann and Theodor Schwartzkopff, on the illustrated "Dictionary of Music" which was discovered to contain plagiarisms of Alfred Einstein's "Neues Musiklexikon und Hugo-Riemann-Musiklexikon". 
In 1925 he was admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the first music theorist to be granted this honour.
On 13 August 1927, Prof. Dr. Hermann Abert died at Stuttgart, aged 56.

Arrondissement of Aalst

The Arrondissement of Aalst (; ) is one of the six administrative arrondissements in the Province of East Flanders, Belgium. It forms the Judicial Arrondissement of Dendermonde together with the Arrondissements of Dendermonde and Sint-Niklaas.
History.
The Arrondissement of Aalst was created in 1818 by the merging of the canton of Aalst from the Arrondissement of Dendermonde with the cantons of Geraardsbergen, Herzele, Ninove and Zottegem from the Arrondissement of Oudenaarde. When the language border was determined in 1963, part of the then municipality of Twee Akren, in the Arrondissement of Soignies, was added to the arrondissement.
In 1977, the then municipality of Sint-Maria-Oudenhove ceased to exist when merged with the municipalities of Zottegem and Brakel. As a result, the part of Sint-Maria-Oudenhove which was merged with Brakel was ceded to the Arrondissement of Oudenaarde.

House of Drašković

The House of Drašković, also spelled "Draskovich" in English, is one of the oldest Croatian noble families, originally descended from lower-rank nobility of the Lika region. 
There are no reliable data on them before the 15th century. The first reliable information is provided by three documents written in Glagolitic alphabet in 1490 (mentioning "35 noblemen of the Drašković family"), kept at the Budapest National Archives.
In the 15th century, they owned an estate in Donje Zazično (today's Donje Pazarište) in the Buška parish and around Knin, which is why Bartol, who started the family's noble line, was in a document from 1520. referred to as "Kninjanin" ("from Knin"). 
In the first half of the 16th century, due to the Turkish threat, Bartol left Zazično and moved to the Kupa river valley. He fathered cardinal Juraj I Gašpar who was made baron in 1567, and given Trakošćan Castle in 1569. After that, the family members were referred to as "Trakošćanski" ("from" or "of Trakošćan"). The Draskovich Family also occupied the Klenovnik Castle, the largest in Croatia before renovating Trakoscan in the mid-19th century. Klenovnik still stands as a hospital.
Famous family members.
From the 16th to the 19th century, several family members became renowned in Croatia as politicians, army leaders, and religious dignitaries.
Juraj Drašković (1525–1585) was trained for priesthood in Kraków, Vienna, Bologna, and Rome. He made a good career as a religious dignitary, and considerably added to the family fortune. In 1557, he was made bishop of Pécs and, in 1563, of Zagreb. As of 1576, he was the Croatian ban (Vice-Roy). By the end of his life, he was made a cardinal. He left behind several tractates, as well as a collection of sermons and speeches in manuscript.
Ivan I Drašković, a younger brother of Juraj, was a commander of Croatian and Hungarian forces under the supreme command of Nikola Šubić Zrinski defending Szigetvár from the Turks in 1566.
Ivan II Drašković, a nephew of Juraj and Ivan I, defended Turopolje from the Turks in 1570. He was the ban of Croatia between 1595 and 1608.
Ivan III Drašković (1603–1648) studied philosophy in Graz and law in Bologna. In 1640, he became the Croatian Vice-Roy (ban). He lead victorious battles against the Turks, and was particularly concerned with fortifying burgs and Croatian Military Border fortifications, which is why he was called "defensor Croatiae". At the assembly held in 1646 in Požun, he was made the highest Hungarian national dignitary. He was the only Croatian who had this honour during the Habsburgs' rule.
Ivan V Drašković Ban of Croatia from February 17, 1732 to his death on January 4, 1733. 
Josip Kazimir Drašković, general. Son of Ban Ivan V Draskovic. His marriage to a noblewoman of lower descent hurt his brilliant military career and made it impossible for him to advance as ban. He played a particularly important role in the seven-year war (1756–1763).
Janko Drašković (1770–1856), national reformer and politician. He was very broadly educated, and even considered as the best educated person in Croatia at the turn of the 18th century. His best known piece is "Disertacija" or "Tractate", published in Karlovac in 1832. It was the first political pamphlet written in štokavian dialect. "Disertacija" is the political, economic, and cultural programme of the Illyrian movement. In 1842, he gave a programmatic speech on the occasion of Matica ilirska's (the local cultural and publishing society's) establishment, as its first chairman. He dedicated all of his energy to his political activity and to the battle against pro-Hungarians. His "Disertacija" was translated into German in 1834. He also wrote poetry.
Juraj V Drašković: As Major-General, he fought with Radetzki, and later also with ban Jelačić. He was an MP, and one among the founders of the then Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. He started making callotypes already in 1848, his collection being one among the earliest and best preserved of its kind in the country.
Karlo Dragutin Drašković (1873–1900), amateur photographer. After finishing high school in Zagreb, he studied law and technology in Budapest. He became engaged in photography in 1892. In 1895, he became a member of the Wiener Camera Club. There are several hundred of his negatives, prints, and slides preserved from the 1894-1899 period. Particularly interesting are those recording fast movements. He was one among the most pronounced 19th-century amateur photographers.
Julijana Drašković (1847–1901) Here paintings may today be found mostly in Trakošćan. Along with her brothers Rudolf and Stjepan, and son Karlo, she was also engaged in amateur photography.
Maria Drašković of Trakošćan (1904–1969) was the first wife of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, head of the House of Wittelsbach and pretender to the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1955 to 1996, as well the jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France.

Rafael Scheidt

Rafael Felipe Scheidt (born February 10, 1976 in Porto Alegre, Brazil) is a Brazilian footballer. He was signed by the John Barnes/Kenny Dalglish management of Celtic from Grêmio for £5 million and failed to make an impact. Plagued by injury and finding it hard to settle he started one game in the 1999-00 in Scottish football against St Johnstone and was let out on loan to Corinthians by new manager Martin O'Neill after just three appearances. Indeed, Scheidt later admitted that following an umimpressive showing in a pre-season friendly O'Neill had told him "I like footballers who are not like you", further adding "I like footballers who play well." "The Guardian" newspaper called Scheidt the second worst transfer in the history of soccer in an article published in 2001.
Scheidt's loan spell at Corinthians came to an end in 2002, and he maintained his hope of making it at Celtic, informing the Sunday Herald that "I want this year to be known as the Scheidt year". However, he no longer met UK work permit requirements and Celtic paid off the remainder of his contract. He then returned to Brazil, joining Atlético Mineiro. A year later he signed for Botafogo, before being released by them in 2006.
Scheidt won three caps for Brazil in 1999 shortly prior to his transfer to Celtic. These games were friendlies and rumours later surfaced that Brazilian based players at that time were being handed caps in return for sweeteners from their clubs wanting to sell them to European clubs for large transfer fees.

1982–83 British Home Championship

The 1982-83 British Home Championship was the penultimate in the series of football tournaments between the British Home Nations which stretched back 99 years to 1884. In 1983 England and then Scotland announced their withdrawal from future competition after the 1984 competition with the arrangement of the Rous Cup between the two nations to eliminate Wales and Northern Ireland, who were seen as weaker opposition. The 1983 tournament was a tight contest, which England won with a final victory at home over Scotland following an opening victory over Wales and a draw in Belfast. The game at Wembley was played in midweek in an attempt to curb the large number of travelling Scottish supporters. The Scots came second with a win over Wales and a draw with Northern Ireland off-setting their final day defeat. The Welsh succumbed to goal difference as the points system then in use meant that the Irish, who had drawn twice and lost once without scoring themselves gained the same number of points for a smaller goal difference despite Wales' victory over them in their final game.

Niel Immelman

Niel Immelman is a South African classical pianist.
He studied with Cyril Smith, Ilona Kabos and Maria Curcio. He was still a student at the Royal College of Music (where he now teaches) when Bernard Haitink invited him to play Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. This successful début was followed by further appearances with the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic and other major orchestras at the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and it marked the beginning of a concert career that has taken him to every continent. 
His commercial recordings have received outstanding critical acclaim and have featured in Classic CD magazine's 'Pick of the Year'; his survey of the complete piano works of Josef Suk on the Meridian label is a first in recorded history. James Leonard, in Allmusic, reviewing the first volume of Immelman's Suk set, opened by noting how important a composer Suk was ("the Bohemian equal of Mahler, Suk is one of the most lyrical, the most dramatic, and the most tragic composer of the fin de siecle"), so as to indicate the importance of Immelman's project here, and then Leonard praised Immelman's playing as "passionate," "immensely emotional," "fervent," and he said that, "Immelman's performances deserve to be heard by anyone."
Immelman's style is understated, emphasizing the poetic aspects of the music, the aspects that are evocative of images and emotions reflective of the composer's intentions and culture. For this reason, Immelman's recorded performances of the Suk piano music have been considered by some to constitute a landmark of the recorded classical music literature.
Niel Immelman has given masterclasses and he regularly serves on juries of international competitions.

Everything Happens to Me (1980 film)

Everything Happens to Me () is a 1980 Italian children's comedy movie starring Bud Spencer and child actor Cary Guffey. It is a direct sequel of the 1979 movie "The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid" and is also known under the title Why Did You Pick on Me?
Plot.
Following the events of "The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid", Sheriff Hall and H7-25 (using the official identity of Charlie Warren) still get no rest from the military: because the little alien has not yet grasped the meaning of keeping a low profile, they are constantly on the move, and H7-25’s father has had to pick them out of a tight spot too many times already.
Hall and Charlie eventually arrive at the city of Munroe, where petty crime, from vandalism to armed robberies, is running rampant, more so because the town currently has no sheriff. Charlie pushes Hall into staying in this place, and somewhat reluctantly Hall takes up the job in this chaotic place, with the help of the local radio jock and City Mayor Howard (Ferruccio Amendola). Soon the riff-raff in town learns not to underestimate the new sheriff as he metes out hard-hitting advice to stay out of trouble.
However, the local thugs are the smallest of Hall’s problems. A task force of hostile alien invaders are preparing to enslave mankind with the use of hypno-wave devices and advanced androids; already they control the local authorities and military installations. Charlie immediately senses the true nature of these individuals, however, and after much persuasion convinces his big friend to look into the matter. But this arouses the suspicion of the alien leader (Claudio Undali); he has Hall arrested for snooping into matters of national security and Charlie kidnapped.
Hall manages to sneak out of prison, and after Howard has told him what happened to Charlie, the sheriff decides to take up the fight. Through the public announcement system Howard appeals to the citizens of Munroe for help, and the thugs and hooligans whom Hall has previously thrashed join forces with the sheriff, just as the alien leader executes the final stage of his plan to take over Munroe by sending the local state police force to the El Dorado festival and round up the townspeople. Hall and his helpers engage the officers in a massive fist-fight, though, and begin to win the upper hand until the alien chief decides to use his hypno-wave machine. The rioters are quickly subjugated, except for the sheriff, who wanders as if in trance to the military base which serves as the alien’s headquarters.
As Hall arrives there, the alien leader and his androids discover that their hypno-waves have no effect on the sheriff (due to an earlier treatment by Charlie’s wonder device). The androids are sent against Hall, but the sheriff’s fists prove to be tougher than they are, and the androids’ neural nets quickly end up thoroughly scrambled. The alien leader tries to activate a self-destruct device, but the sheriff takes a swing at him and he shatters like glass. Charlie is released from captivity and happily rejoins the sheriff.
However, as the town celebrates their rescuers, the military arrives to try and apprehend Charlie once more. Fed up with the constant pestering, Hall and Charlie take off into space with the old-timer automobile they were riding at the parade to join Charlie’s family. But as soon as they have left the atmosphere, a small inconvenience makes Hall grumble once more: “Why does everything happen to me!”

Eclipse of the Crescent Moon

Eclipse of the Crescent Moon ( lit. ""Stars of Eger"") is a historical novel by the Hungarian writer Géza Gárdonyi. It was first published in 1899 and is one of the most popular novels in Hungary.
Background.
The story is set in the first half of the 16th century and covers a period of roughly 25 years. The main historical events that are addressed are the bloodless occupation of Buda, the seat of the Hungarian kings, in 1541, and the 1552 Siege of Eger (now in Northern Hungary) by the Turks that forms the major topic of the novel. The story also addresses some other historical topics like the impact of the Reformation, the discord between Hungarians and the Holy Roman Emperor, as well as many themes of general import like mercy, filial and marital love, friendship, trust and truthfulness.
Most characters of the book are historical figures, notably the hero Gergely Bornemissza himself, though most of them have been strongly romanticized according to the author's intentions. Gergely's life story in the novel is almost fully invented, except for his role as an officer during the siege of Eger. Éva Cecey, Gergely's love and later wife, was a real person, but nothing other than her name is known; her portrayal in the novel is based on Gárdonyi's "ideal woman".
Plot summary.
The novel consists of five parts that tell the life of Gergely Bornemissza from the age of eight until the year 1552, when he is in his early thirties.
I. Gergely is a half-orphan and son of a poor woman, while Éva Cecey is the daughter of a landowner. They are nevertheless playmates. While playing in the woods, the two children are captured by a Turk named Jumurdzsák and have to join a trek of prisoners. Due to the cunning of little Gergely, the two children are able to escape and later also to free the other prisoners. Gergely's mother dies in a raid by the Turks, but the little boy is adopted as a foster son by the rich aristocrat Bálint Török, where he gets a good education.
II. Several years later, Gergely has to experience that Buda is captured by the Turks through deceit and his foster father Bálint Török is led away prisoner. Gergely meets Éva again, who has become a pretty young girl. 
III. Gergely learns that Éva who is an excellent rider and fighter is to be married to the cowardly Adam Fürjes at the request of the queen. They flee together and get married. Together with some friends they plan to free Bálint Török from his prison in Istanbul. They go to the Ottoman city, but despite many adventures, they finally fail in freeing the Hungarian aristocrat.
IV. It is 1552, a force about 200,000 Turks is approaching the little town of Eger, the citadel of which is only defended by 2000 soldiers. István Dobó, captain of the citadel, calls on the troops of the emperor for aid, but no-one arrives. Gergely joins the forces who are preparing to fight in Eger, while leaving Éva home with their little son. Shortly after he has left, a stranger arrives and kidnaps the little boy. Éva realizes that the stranger must have been the Turk Jumurdzsák. She understands that there must be a connection with the siege of Eger, so she masquerades as a man and tries to enter the besieged castle.
V. Even though the forces of the Turks are overwhelming, the Hungarians in Eger are able to defend themselves. Eger's strong walls and the high morale of its defenders allows the fortress to withstand five major assaults and continuous cannon fire - almost 12,000 cannonballs land inside the fortress before the siege ended. In a stroke of unparalleled ingenuity, Bornemissza devises primitive but lethal grenades and powder keg sized bombs to use against the attackers, as well as a water-mill wheel packed with gunpowder which he rolls into the Ottoman ranks. Éva finally arrives at Eger. Though the Ottomans attack again and again, the citadel stands firm, with also the women of Eger joining the battle. Finally, the Ottoman forces withdraw. Gergely's and Éva's little son is exchanged for a Turkish boy who has been captured, and the family is finally reunited.

The novel was adapted for film twice:

Trousseau sign of latent tetany

Trousseau sign of latent tetany is a medical sign observed in patients with low calcium. This sign may become positive before other gross manifestations of hypocalcemia such as hyperreflexia and tetany, as such it is generally believed to be more sensitive (94%) than the Chvostek sign (29%) for hypocalcemia.
To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 minutes. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct. The sign is also known as "main d'accoucheur" (French for ""hand of the obstetrician"") because it supposedly resembles the position of an obstetrician's hand in delivering a baby.
The sign is named after French physician Armand Trousseau who described the phenomenon in 1861. It is distinct from the Trousseau sign of malignancy.

Trousseau sign of malignancy

The Trousseau sign of malignancy is a medical sign found in certain cancers that is associated with venous thrombosis and hypercoagulability. It is characterized by successive crops of tender nodules in affected veins. It is also referred to as Trousseau syndrome and is distinct from the Trousseau sign of latent tetany. It is more commonly referred to as Trousseau's Syndrome within the research data.
History.
Armand Trousseau first described this finding in the 1860s; he later found the same sign in himself, was subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died soon thereafter.
Dr. Trousseau presciently attributed thromboembolism in malignancy to changes in blood composition rather than local inflammatory or mechanical forces. By correlating clinical observation with surgical and autopsy findings, Dr. Trousseau recognized that a localized cancer could induce a generalized hypercoagulable state in which thrombosis could occur elsewhere in the body, such as in extremities with visceral malignancy. Dr. Trousseau described several cases in which recurrent thrombosis was the presenting feature of visceral cancer, and his confidence in the utility of this connection led him to say, "So great, in my opinion, is the semiotic value of phlegmasia in the cancerous cachexia, that I regard this phlegmasia as a sign of the cancerous diathesis as certain as sanguinolent effusion into the serous cavities."
The discovery later allowed Dr. Trousseau to diagnose himself. At the age of 66, he noticed phlebitis in his left upper arm. He diagnosed a visceral malignancy, and died of pancreatic cancer only months later.
Pathophysiology.
Some malignancies, especially gliomas (25%), as well as adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and lung, are associated with hypercoagulability (the tendency to form blood clots) for reasons that are incompletely understood, but may be related to factors secreted by the tumors, in particular a circulating pool of cell-derived tissue factor-containing microvesicles. Some adenocarcinomas secrete mucin that can interact with selectin found on platelets, thereby causing small clots to form 
In patients with malignancy-associated hypercoagulable states, the blood may spontaneously form clots in the portal vessels, the deep veins of the extremities (such as the leg), or the superficial veins anywhere on the body. These clots present as visibly swollen blood vessels (vasculitis), especially the veins, or as intermittent pain in the affected areas. The pathological phenomenon of clots forming, resolving and then appearing again elsewhere in the body has been named thrombophlebitis migrans or migratory thrombophlebitis.

Federal Indian Policy

Federal Indian policy establishes the relationship between the United States Government and the Indian Tribes within its borders. The Constitution gives the federal government primary responsibility for dealing with tribes. Wrone periodizes federal policy toward Indians in six phases: coexistence (1789-1828), removal and reservations (1829-86), assimilation (1887-1932), reorganization (1932-45), termination (1946-60), and self-determination (1961-85). He argues that the failure of the treaty system was because of the inability of an individualistic, democratic society to recognize group rights or the value of an organic, corporatist culture represented by the tribes.
The Trade and Intercourse era.
The Indian Intercourse Act of 1790 marked the beginning of the Trade and Intercourse era. This act established that no sales of Indian lands were to be made between any persons or states unless the sale was authorized by the United States. The United States federal government was then granted management of trade and diplomatic relations that involved Indians and their lands. The main goal of establishing the Trade and Intercourse Act was to keep peace on the frontier and avoid war with the Natives.
During the Trade and Intercourse Era, the Natives were also included within the United States government, to some degree, by the establishment of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the War Department in 1824. However, land disputes and law jurisdiction cases began to appear frequently in the United States Supreme Court. It was concluded that, "discovery also gave the discoverer the exclusive right to extinguish Indian title either by 'purchase or by conquest'." Natives were recognized only as occupants of the land, and not owners.
Treaties.
The federal government was in charge of relations with the Indians, and the procedure was to use the treaty making power of the president and the Senate to make formal arrangements. Over 200 treaties were agreed upon by 1840. Gatlin argues that treaties established a procedure that benefited both parties. The federal government was primarily interested in guaranteeing that Indian lands did not fall into private hands, and that it handled all negotiations with the tribes. These negotiations, says Gatlin, strengthened the tribes sense of unity and leadership. The land sales gave the Indians a steady flow of income, and guarantees of federal financial, medical, and educational aid.
Many of the treaties remain in effect and are of special importance regarding federal recognition of tribal status, hunting and fishing rights, rights to protection of sacred properties, rights to water and minerals, and land claims. The federal courts have a long, continuous history of litigation on these issues. The Supreme Court endorsed the procedure, with over 300 decisions making reference to Indian treaties after 1799. 
Westward expansion and Indian relocation.
During the early 19th century, as the eastern settlers of the United States felt the desire to explore westward, the natives were caught in the middle of things. Eastern Indian tribes were forced out of their homelands to barren areas that contained fruitless soils, though they had a prosperous relationship beforehand. The reason given to justify the Indian removal stated by Thomas Jefferson was to, "give them a space to live undisturbed by white people as they gradually adjust to civilized ways". Though a problem occurred where westward expansion was on the rise and areas in the west were becoming full with settlers and the lands that Natives resided on (Nebraska and Kansas territories) ended up being taken from them by the government and given to settlers. Treaties were signed by the natives of the area, stating they accepted the downsized reservations or allotments, although their allotments were usually sold to the white settlers by force. The outcome of this removal devastated the Natives, and cost them their tribal identity and independence.
Allotment and assimilation era (1887–1943).
In 1887, the United States Congress passed the General Allotment Act, which is considered one of the earliest attempts aimed toward assimilation of Native tribes. This act intended to give Natives a sense of land ownership as well as integrate an agricultural lifestyle with the tribes, much like that of the Americans and Europeans. Under the General Allotment Act, tribal lands were no longer under the control of tribal governments; instead, the land was under the control of individual land owners.
This period of allotment over tribal lands became known as the, "Allotment and assimilation era", mainly because the main goal of alloting tribal land was to Americanize Native peoples into mainstream society. The notion that Native peoples could live their lives according to traditional practices and teachings on the reservation was forbidden, thus, assimilation became the epitome of federal Indian policy. 
The BIA was used during this time to keep a commanding hold of all aspects of Native life, thus upholding the goal of "civilizing" natives. 
The Allotment era resulted in the loss of over two-thirds of tribally entrusted lands from 138 million acres (558,000 km²) in 1871 to 48 million acres (190,000 km²) in 1934. This was mainly due to leasing, and eventually selling, tribal lands to white settlers. Allotment did not work, because it was not something Indians were used to. They did not view the land as something to own. Instead, they viewed it as their home.
Termination and relocation (1945–1960).
Between the end of the Franklin D. Roosevelt era and the beginning of the John F. Kennedy administration, less traditional Native Americans, congressional leaders, and government administrators, developed a policy that they hoped would integrate the Indian population with mainstream America. To this end, they enacted laws to terminate the government's trusteeship of Indian lands and relocate Indians to the nation's cities. They believed that once Indians left the reservation, they would have opportunities for education, employment and assimilation.
Tribal self determination era.
In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy wanted the Indian tribes to be recognized as independent nations governing themselves. He promised the Indian tribes that treaties made prior to 1960 would be recognized by the federal government and that their rights as Indian people would be protected. 
This was realized when the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was passed in 1971. The ANCSA allowed for the Alaskan Natives to be given 40 million acres (160,000 km²) of land, federal payments of 462.5 million dollars over eleven years, and another 500 million dollars to help with mineral development in Alaska. All this was in exchange for the Alaskans giving up their claim to the land. The act also allowed the Alaskan tribe to have freedom from the BIA.
In the 1960s, there were many acts passed, geared to helping the Indian tribes. Indian tribes benefited greatly from these because it gave them rights within both the tribal and federal government. In 1968, the Indian Civil Right Act was passed. It recognized the Indian tribes as sovereign nations with the federal government. 
In the 1970s, one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed through Congress. The Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975, allowed tribes to have more tribal control over federally subsidized programs for Indians. Another important act passed by Congress was the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, it granted tribal government jurisdiction over child custody and adoption on the reservation. 
As the years continued, the United States government continued to pass legislation that benefited Indian tribes and their sovereignty.

<doc id="9670158" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9670158" title="Maya moon goddess">
Maya moon goddess

The traditional Mayas generally assume the moon to be female, and the moon's phases are accordingly conceived as the stages of a woman's life. The Maya moon goddess wields great influence in many areas. Being in the image of a woman, she is associated with sexuality and procreation, fertility and growth, not only of human beings, but also of the vegetation and the crops. Since growth can also cause all sorts of ailments, the moon goddess is also a goddess of disease. Everywhere in Mesoamerica, including the Mayan area, she is specifically associated with water, be it wells, rainfall, or the rainy season. In the codices, she has a terrestrial counterpart in goddess I.
Lunar mythology.
The sources for Maya lunar mythology are almost entirely contemporaneous, with the exception of the Popol Vuh. A division can be made according to the moon's kinship roles. 
In the Popol Vuh (16th century), the Maya Hero Twins are finally transformed into sun and moon, implying the recognition of a male moon, in a departure from the main Maya tradition. However, the Popol Vuh hardly belongs to lunar mythology, and becoming sun and moon may well be a metonym for acquiring dominance over the sky and thus, metaphorically, political predominance.
True lunar mythology is first and foremost represented by the Q'eqchi' myth of Sun and Moon first studied by Eric Thompson. It makes the Moon Goddess (Po) the daughter of the Earth God, or 'Mountain-Valley'. She is wooed and finally captured by Sun. They sleep together. When this is discovered and the couple flees, the angry father reacts by having his daughter destroyed. In all likelihood, this patriarchal punishment of a basic infraction of the rules of alliance represents the origin of menstruation, the 'evil blood' of a disobedient daughter colouring the water of sea and lake red, or sinking into the earth. The menstrual blood is stored in thirteen jars. In the jars, it is first transformed into creatures such as snakes and insects, a transformation leading up to the origin of poison and the diseases caused by it. However, some jars also hold medicinal plants. The thirteenth jar is the lunar jar: When it is opened, the Moon is reborn from it. The creation of her vagina on instigation of, or directly by, her husband represents the origin of human procreation. Subsequent episodes make the Moon Goddess cohabit with Sun's elder brother, Cloud, and with the devil in the shape of a king vulture, thus connecting her to rainfall and black sorcery.
Among the Mayas of Chiapas and the Northwestern Highlands of Guatemala, Moon is not Sun's wife, but his mother or grandmother, while Sun is a young boy harassed by his elder brethren. Only in this mythology do we find the origin of the lunar rabbit, either as one of the elder brethren transformed into wild animals and caught by his mother, or as a creature responsible for the resurgence of the wild vegetation on Sun's maize field. In the latter case, the rabbit is caught by Sun, passed on to his mother, and again taken into the sky. In Northwestern Guatemala, the rabbit in the moon is sometimes replaced by a deer in the moon.
The moon goddess in the Post-Classic and Classic periods.
In the three Post-Classic codices, the Moon Goddess is underrepresented. Instead, one finds almanacs devoted to her terrestrial counterpart, the Goddess I ('White Woman'). In Classic Maya art, however, the Moon Goddess occurs frequently. She is shown as a young woman holding her rabbit, and framed by the crescent of the waxing moon, which is her most important, identifying attribute. The Moon Goddess may also be sitting on a throne, alone (as in the Dresden codex), or behind god D (Itzamna). Although, in oral tradition, the goddess is often treated as the consort of the Sun Deity, Classic iconography does not insist on this (see Kinich Ahau). The lunar rabbit (perhaps a Trickster character) has an important role to play in a poorly understood episode involving the Moon Goddess, the Twins, the Maya maize god, and the aged god L. In some cases, the Moon Goddess is fused with the main Maya maize god, making it uncertain whether what we see is a Moon Goddess with a maize aspect (that is, a maize-bringing moon), or a Maize God with a lunar aspect or function.
Calendrical functions.
The Moon Goddess is the patroness of the month of Ch'en 'Well'. ("Moon has gone to her well" is an expression referring to New Moon.) She is also the patroness of one of the Venus 'years'. Her importance is reflected by the eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex and by the Lunar Series of the Long Count. Glyph C of the Lunar Series (indicating sequences of six lunations for purposes of eclipse prediction) connects her to other deities, such as the death god (God A), the Jaguar God of the Underworld, and, perhaps, the Maize God.

Kinetic logic

Kinetic logic, developed by René Thomas, is a Qualitative Modeling approach feasible to model impact, feedback, and the temporal evolution of the variables. It uses symbolic descriptions and avoids continuous descriptions e.g. differential equations.The derivation of the dynamics from the interaction graphs of systems is not easy. A lot of parameters have to be inferred, for differential description, even if the type of each interaction is known in the graph. Even small modifications in parameters can lead to a strong change in the dynamics. Kinetic Logic is used to build discrete models, in which such details of the systems are not required. The information required can be derived directly from the graph of interactions or from a sufficiently explicit verbal description. It only considers the thresholds of the elements and uses logical equations to construct state tables. Through this procedure, it is a straightforward matter to determine the behavior of the system.
Formulism.
Following is René Thomas’s formulism for Kinetic Logic :
In a directed graph G = (V, A), we note G− (v) and G+ (v) the set of predecessors and successors of a node v ∈ V respectively.
Definition 1: A biological regulatory network (BRN) is a tuple G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) where 
(V, A) is a directed graph denoted by G,
l is a function from V to N,
s is a function from A to {+, −},
t is a function from A to N such that, for all u ∈ V , if G+(u) is not empty then {t(u, v) | v ∈ G+(u)} = { 1, . . . , l(u)}.
K = {Kv | v ∈ V} is a set of maps: for each v ∈ V, Kv is a function from 2G− (v) to {0, . . . , l(v)} such that Kv(ω) ≤ Kv(ω_) for all ω ⊆ ω_ ⊆ G−(v).
The map l describes the domain of each variable v: if l (v) = k, the abstract concentration on v holds its value in {0, 1, . . . , k}. Similarly, the map s represents the sign of the regulation (+ for an activation, − for an inhibition). t (u, v) is the threshold of the regulation from u to v: this regulation takes place iff the abstract concentration of u is above t(u, v), in such a case the regulation is said active. The condition on these thresholds states that each variation of the level of u induces a modification of the set of active regulations starting from u. For all x ∈ . . ., l(u) − 1, the set of active regulations of u, when the discrete expression level of u is x, differs from the set when the discrete expression level is x + 1. Finally, the map Kv allows us to define what is the effect of a set of regulators on the specific target v. If this set is ω ⊆ G− (v), then, the target v is subject to a set of regulations which makes it to evolve towards a particular level Kv(ω).
Definition 2 (States): 
A state μ of a BRN G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) is a function from V to N such that μ (v) ∈ {0 .., l (v)} for all variables v ∈ V. We denote EG the set of states of G.
When μ (u) ≥ t (u, v) and s (u, v) = +, we say that u is a resource of v since the activation takes place. Similarly when μ (u) < t (u, v) and s (u, v) = −, u is also a resource of v since the inhibition does not take place (the absence of the inhibition is treated as an activation).
Definition 3 (Resource function): 
Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN. For each v ∈ V we define the resource function ωv: EG → 2G− (v) by:
ωv (μ) = {u ∈ G−(v) | (μ(u) ≥ t(u, v) and s(u, v) = +) or (μ (u) < t (u, v) and s (u, v) = −)}.
As said before, at state μ, Kv (ωv(μ)) gives the level towards which the variable v tends to evolve. We consider three cases,
Definition 4 (Signs of derivatives): 
Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN and v ∈ V. 
We define αv: EG → {+1, 0, −1} by αv(μ) =
+1 if Kv (ωv(μ)) > μ(u)
0 if Kv (ωv(μ)) = μ(u)
−1 if Kv (ωv(μ)) < μ(u)
The signs of derivatives show the tendency of the solution trajectories. 
The state graph of BRN represents the set of the states that a BRN can adopt with transitions among them deduced from the previous rules:
Definition 5 (State graph): 
Let G = (V, A, b, s, t,K) be a BRN. The state graph of G is a directed graph G = (EG, T) with (μ, μ_) ∈ T if there exists v ∈ V such that:
αv (μ) ≠ 0 and μ’ (v) = μ (v) + αv (μ) and μ (u) = μ’ (u), ∀u ∈ V \ {v}.
Critical Assumptions.
The critical assumptions of Kinetic Logic are:
Steps of Application.
Following are the steps of Application of Kinetic Logic (Also shown in figure A).
Biological Regulatory Network (BRN).
Keeping the research problem in mind, the behavior of elements in the system and their interactions are studied. Elements of a system can interact positively or negatively, that is, the level of an element may activate or reduce the rate of production of other elements or of itself. These interactions are represented as positive (activation) or negative (inhibition). 
When elements are connected in a topologically circular way, they exert an influence on their own rate of synthesis and they form a feedback loop. A feedback loop is positive or negative according to whether it contains an even or odd number of negative interactions. In a positive loop, each element of the system exerts a positive effect on its own rate of synthesis, whereas in a simple negative loop, each element has a negative effect on its own rate of synthesis. A simple positive feedback loop results in epigenetic regulation and have multiple steady states and a simple negative feedback loop results in homeostatic regulation.
Abstraction: A chain of positive interactions is equivalent to a direct positive interaction between the two extreme elements, and any two negative interactions cancel out each other’s effect. In this way, any simple feedback loop can be abridged to a one-element loop, positive or negative according to the number of negative interactions (even or odd) in the original loop. Accordingly, through extensive literature survey and the application of the above mentioned rules, a BRN is abstracted.
Logical Variable and Functions.
Logical variables are associated with the elements of the system to describe the state of the system. They consist of the logical values. For example, a system whose state is appropriately described by the levels of substances a, b, and c, each of which can be absent, present at low level, or present at high level are represented by logical values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
If a product a acts to stimulate the production of b, it is a positive regulator. In this case, the rate of synthesis of b increases with increasing concentration of a, and makes a curve similar to that shown in figure B.
There is little effect of a, until it reaches a threshold concentration theta, and at higher concentrations a plateau is reached which shows the maximal rate of synthesis of b. Such a nonlinear, bounded curve is called a sigmoid. It can be suggested that a is "absent" for a < theta and "present" for a > theta. The sigmoid curve can be approximated by the step function, as in figure C. 
Not only logical variables (x, y, z ...) are associated to the elements, that represent their level (e.g., concentration), but also logical functions (X, Y, Z ...) whose value reflects the rate of synthesis of the element. Thus,
x = 0 means "gene product absent"
x = 1 means "gene product present"
X = 0 means "gene off"
X = 1 means "gene on"
Graph of Interactions and Logical Equations.
Kinetic Logic has two forms depending on the following two types of descriptions: 
Naïve Logical Description
Consider a simple two-element system in which product x activates gene Y and product y represses gene X as shown in figure D. Each variable takes only two values; 0 and 1. In other words,
X = 1 if y = 0 (X "on” if y absent)
Y = 1 if x = 1 (Y "on" if x present)
The logical relation of the system can be written: 
X =y
Y=x
Generalized Kinetic Logic
The naive logical description can be generalized and made to accommodate situations in which some variables take more than two values, without complicating the analysis. Any variable has a number of biologically relevant levels, determined by the number of elements regulated by the product x. There is a specific threshold for each regulatory interaction, so if x regulates n elements, it will have up to n different thresholds.
For the logical sum, there is a procedure that assigns a specific weight to each term in the logical relation. According to the scale of thresholds of the corresponding variable, the weighted algebraic sum is then discretized, so an n-valued variable is associated with an n-valued function. After discretization the integers of certain weights or sums of weights are called logical parameters. 
Generalized Kinetic Logic, although maintaining the analytic simplicity of the naive description, has certain features in common with the differential description. The generalized logical relations are completely independent of the differential description and can be directly derived from the graph of interactions or from an explicit verbal description. 
Consider an example of two elements in figure E. Using a software, this graph of interactions is drawn as shown in figure F. There are two thresholds assigned to element y: Ѳ12, concerning its interaction with x and Ѳ22, concerning its interaction with itself. The variable y and function Y have three possible values: 0, 1, and 2. Element x have a single threshold, Ѳ21, because of the interaction x to +y, so the variable x and function X will be two-valued.
State Table and State Graph.
The state table of graph of interactions in figure D is shown in figure G. This table states for each state of the variables (x, y) i.e. present or absent, which products are synthesized and which are not synthesized at a significant rate. Consider the state 00/10, in which both of the gene products are absent but gene X is on. As product x is absent but being synthesized so it can be expected that in near future it will be present and the logical value of x will change from 0 to 1. This can be described by the notation Ō, in which the dash above the digit is due to the fact that variable x is committed to change its value from 0 to 1. Generally, a dash over the figure representing the logical value of a variable each time this value is different from that of the corresponding function. The state just considered can thus be represented as ŌO.
Time Delays
The movement of a system from one state to another depends on the time delays. The time delays in systems are short time shifts of arbitrary duration. In view of the relation between a function (gene on or off) and its associated variable (gene product present or absent), the time delays become real entities whose values, far from being arbitrary, reflect specific physical processes (synthesis, degradation, dilution, etc.). The values of the different time delays play an important role in determining the pathway along which the system evolves.
The temporal relation between a logical variable x which is associated with the level of an element and a logical function X which is associated with its evolution can be explained as follows.
Consider a gene that is off (X = 0) for a considerable time, then is switched on (X = 1) by a signal, and then, after some time, it is switched off again (X= 0) by another signal and the product reappears but not immediately until a proper delay tx has elapsed. If a signal switches the gene off temporarily, the product is still present because it also requires a time delay tx’. This can be represented graphically as shown in figure H. Using the state table the temporal sequence of states of the system can be represented as shown in figure I.
Identifying Cycles and Stable Steady States.
Cycles
The state table in D can be used to identify the cyclic behavior of the system. We can see that state 01 changes to 00, and 00 changes to 10, 10 changes to 11 and 11 changes back to 01. This represents a cycle as the system starts from the state 01 and returns back to the same state. The system keeps oscillating between these states. 
Deadlocks
Consider another example in which:
X=y
Y=x
The state table for the system is shown in figure J. The states that are encircled are stable states, as they do not evolve towards any other state. The logical stable states are defined as those for which the vectors xy . .. and XY ... are equal. When we considered the time delays i.e. from ŌŌ the system will proceed to state 1 0 or to state 01, according to whether tx < ty or ty < tx, and from ĪĪ the system will proceed to state 10 or to state 0 1 according to whether ty < tx or tx < ty. The state graph representing delays is shown in figure K.
The sequence of states a system depends on the relative values of the time delays. It is assumed that two delays (or sums of delays) are never exactly equal, therefore that two variables will not change their values at the same instant. But do not exclude the possibility because if this rule is applied rigidly, it could occasionally lead to the loss of interesting pathways.
Analyzing the Results.
The cycles and the deadlock states identified by this process are then analyzed by comparing them with the invitro and invivo findings. These results can be used to make important predictions about the system. Cyclic behaviors correspond to homeostatic regulations that retain the level of a variable at or near a fixed or optimal value. Deadlocks represent epigenetic regulation in which the concentrations exist between extreme levels.

The first approach for qualitative modeling was based on extreme discretization since all genes could be either on (present) or off (absent). This Boolean approach was generalized into a multi-valued approach i.e. Kinetic Logic, in which logical identification of all steady states became possible.
Application.
Kinetic logic has been employed to study the factors that influence the selection of specific pathway from many different pathways that the system can follow and the factors that lead the system towards stable states and cyclic behaviors. It has been used to reveal the logic that lie behind the functional organization and kinetic behavior of molecules. Model checking techniques have also been applied to models built through kinetic logic, in order to infer their continuous behaviors.
Kinetic logic has been applied on many different types of systems in biology, Psychology and Psychiatry. Mostly Kinetic Logic has been used in modeling the biological networks especially the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Following are the examples in which Kinetic Logic was employed as the modeling formalism: 
Tool.
As theoretical analysis through Kinetic Logic is a time consuming process, a tool known as Genotech, for modeling and analysis of BRNs was developed on the basis of Kinetic Logic and has been used for a number of Kinetic Logic based studies. It analyzes behaviors like stable cycles, stable steady states and paths in the state graph (discrete model) of biological systems, accelerating the process of modeling. GenoTech is extremely useful as it allows repeated experimentation by automating the whole process. This tool is available on request.

Joanna of Bavaria

Joanna of Bavaria (c. 1362–1386) was the second child of Albert I, Duke of Bavaria, by his first wife Margaret of Brieg. Her siblings included William VI, Count of Holland, Johanna Sophia of Bavaria and Margaret of Bavaria. Her paternal grandparents were Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV and Margaret II, Countess of Hainault.
Marriage.
Joanna married on 29 September 1370 to Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV by his second wife, Anna of Swidnica. At the time of the wedding, Johanna was eight years' old, and Wenceslaus was nine.
Joanna was not the first choice of a bride for Wenceslaus; Charles IV had planned for him to marry Elisabeth of Nuremberg, but the marriage never took place, since Elisabeth married Rupert of Germany instead.
On Charles's death in 1378, Wenceslaus inherited the kingdom of Bohemia. With Wenceslaus' accession, Joanna became Queen of Bohemia, Germany, and Rome. and she also became Electress of Brandenburg as succeessor to Wenceslaus' half-sister Katharine of Bohemia.
Death.
The marriage lasted for sixteen years, however the couple had no children (it is said that Wenceslaus was infertile. Joanna died in 1386 at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four.
Wenceslaus gave Johanna a magnificent funeral, which took place at Žebrák castle. According to custom, Joanna's body was exposed for a few days in Prague churches and was later buried in Prague Castle.
Wenceslaus later married Joanna's cousin, Sofia of Bavaria, but this marriage also bore no issue. Wenceslaus was deposed from the throne of Germany and was succeeded by Elisabeth of Nuremberg's husband, Rupert.

Mabuhay

Mabuhay is a Tagalog greeting. It literally is the imperative form of "live", from the root word "buhay" (life).
Meaning.
The phrase is comparable in sentiment to the Romance language expression “Vive, Viva”, the Hindustani suffix Zindabad, and the Japanese exclamation "Banzai". It carries various meanings including "may you live", "cheers", "welcome", and "hurrah".
Usage.
The expression is mostly used for toasts during gatherings and parties, and is used as a cry of adulation towards individuals or concepts at rallies and political conferences.
A more modern appropriation of the greeting is its use in the local hospitality industry to welcome guests. Alternatively, the Spanish "¡Viva!" survives in mostly religious contexts, specifically in shouts of praise directed at a patron saint or to the Deity during fiestas and assemblies (e.g., ""¡Viva Señor Santo Niño!"")

The Blyth Academy

The Blyth Academy is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form with academy status, located in Blyth, Northumberland, England.
It was opened as Blyth Community College in 2000 following the amalgamation of Tynedale High School and Ridley High School. The school was built for 1450 students and has an estimated figure of around 1500 students, and is made up of years 7 through to 11; with two sixth form years. It employs roughly 160 teachers and teaching assistants.In 2008, the college changed its name to The Blyth School, Community College.
In September 2010 the school opened its doors to Year 7&8 pupils, adopting a two tier focus to fall in line with recent changes in the Northumberland's school system. Along with this new year group, additional staff were hired with many transferring from middle schools that subsequently closed.
The school converted to academy status in October 2013 and was renamed The Blyth Academy.
The school offers a range of subject choices, from history to childcare, to languages to electronics. The school has shown improved results in recent years, and was higher than some other schools in the Northumberland GCSE results league table for 2011 and 2012. It is expected to continue to improve as an academy.

<doc id="9670295" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9670295" title="Self-discharge">
Self-discharge

Self-discharge is a phenomenon in batteries in which internal chemical reactions reduce the stored charge of the battery without any connection between the electrodes. Self-discharge decreases the shelf-life of batteries and causes them to initially have less than a full charge when actually put to use.
How fast self-discharge in a battery occurs is dependent on the type of battery, state of charge, charging current, ambient temperature and other factors.
Typically, among rechargeable batteries, Li-ion suffer the least amount of self-discharge (around 2–3% discharge per month,) then lead-acid at 4-6%, while nickel-based batteries are more seriously affected by the phenomenon (NiCad, 15–20%; NiMH, 30%,) with the exception of Low self-discharge NiMH batteries (2-3%.) Primary batteries, which aren't designed for recharging between manufacturing and use, have much lower self-discharge rates, with shelf lives of 2-3 years for zinc–carbon batteries, 5 for alkaline, and over 10 for lithium.
Self-discharge is a chemical reaction, just as closed-circuit discharge is, and tends to occur more quickly at higher temperatures. Storing batteries at lower temperatures thus reduces the rate of self-discharge and preserves the initial energy stored in the battery. Self-discharge is also thought to be reduced over time as a passivation layer develops on the electrodes.
The detailed chemical causes of self-discharge depend on the particular battery and are not well understood.

Tetany

Tetany or tetany seizure is a medical sign consisting of the involuntary contraction of muscles, which may be caused by disease or other conditions that increase the action potential frequency of muscle cells or the nerves that innervate them. Muscle cramps that are caused by the disease tetanus are not classified as tetany; rather, they are due to a blocking of the inhibition to the neurons that supply muscles.
Causes.
An excess of potassium in grass hay or pasture can trigger winter tetany, or grass tetany, in ruminants.
Diagnosis.
French Professor Armand Trousseau (1801-1867) devised the trick (now known as the Trousseau sign of latent tetany) of occluding the brachial artery by squeezing, to trigger cramps in the fingers. Also, tetany can be demonstrated by tapping anterior to the ear, at the emergence of the facial nerve. A resultant twitch of the nose or lips suggests low calcium levels. This is now known as the Chvostek sign.
Tetany is characterized by contraction of distal muscles of the hands (carpal spasm with extension of interphalangeal joints and adduction and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints) and feet (pedal spasm) and is associated with tingling around the mouth and distally in the limbs.
EMG studies reveal single or often grouped motor unit discharges at low discharge frequency during tetany episodes.

Maiti Nepal

Maiti Nepal (माइती नेपाल) is a non-profit organization in Nepal dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking. Currently, it operates a rehabilitation home in Kathmandu, as well as transit homes at the Indo-Nepal border towns, preventive homes in the countryside and an academy in Kathmandu .
The word ‘Maiti’ has no literal interpretation in English but in the Nepali language the word ‘maiti’ means the home of the girl’s birth parents. The word itself holds sentimental value for the women population of Nepal “especially for a married Nepali woman who has no longer any right towards her parents or their property”. Once a girl is married to another man, she becomes a perpetual member of her husband’s family. She has all obligations to her husband and her new family. As this organization is a home to all the girls, women and children who are not accepted into their family and society, therefore this NGO has been named as ‘Maiti’ Nepal to symbolize the love and affection that a girl receives in her birth parents place.
History.
Maiti Nepal was established in 1993 by a group of socially committed professionals in order “to protect Nepali girls and women from crimes like domestic violence, trafficking for flesh trade, child prostitution, child labor and various other forms of exploitation and torture”. Since 1993, this organization has been working towards “preventing trafficking for forced prostitution, rescuing flesh trade victims and rehabilitating them”. After rescuing women and children, this organization also works vigorously towards finding “justice for the victimized girls and women by engaging in criminal investigation and waging legal battles against the criminals”. Due to continuous efforts, this organization has been able to raise awareness regarding this crucial issue of girl trafficking at international levels.
Objective.
The main objective of Maiti Nepal is to provide comprehensive prevention from sex trafficking, rescuing and rehabilitating the survivors, advocating for justice in the cases of the rescued women and girls and ensuring that effective immediate action is taken against their traffickers.
Founder/Director of Maiti Nepal.
Anuradha Koirala was born in 1949, to parents Colonel Pratap Singh Gurung and Laxmi Gurung. She completed her schooling at a convent school in Kalimpong, India. Her inspiration to establish an organization for the betterment of women population came from her bitter relationship with her husband, Dinesh Prasad Koirala. After several years of violence, abuse and three miscarriages, she separated from her husband. 
Anuradha Koirala established Maiti Nepal in 1993 with the aim of providing services for both children and women who have endured untold pain and suffering, often in silence. She not only established Maiti Nepal, she also set up transit homes, academic and medical centre to provide support to the women and children who had no other place to go.
Maiti Nepal’s Centers.
Maiti Nepal has three prevention homes, eleven transit homes, a hospices and Teresa Academy.
The data for the centres of Maiti Nepal has been taken from the website of South Asia Foundation.
Transit Homes.
The transit homes of Maiti Nepal are located in ten different places in Nepal. These are in...
Rehabilitation Centers.
The two rehabilitation centres of Maiti Nepal are located in Kathmandu and Ithari.
Facilities.
The transit homes, rehabilitation and medical centres of Maiti Nepal are well facilitated to provide support and assistance to the rescued women, children and girls.
The data for the facilities provided by Maiti Nepal has been extracted from the website of the Mother’s Home Nepal website.
Rehabilitation Centers.
These centres provide shelter, safety, education and vocational training and medical care to the rescued won population and children.
Prevention Programs.
This program provides information to vulnerable girls with information and education about human trafficking. This program also provides temporary shelter and residential training to these girls.
Hospices.
The hospices provide treatment to those suffering from psychological disorders, and anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.
Halfway Houses.
These types of houses provide shelter and protection to under age girls who are working in places like dance restaurants and massage parlors.
Medical Clinic.
The medical clinic was built to provide treatment to the diseased women and children. There is a full-time doctor with a team of girls to look after the suffering women and children.
Programmes/Activities.
Maiti Nepal organizes several activities including awareness campaigns regarding sex trafficking, rescue operations for the trafficked women and girls, apprehending traffickers, providing legal support to the needy, women empowerment programmes, and providing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to HIV infected children and women.
The organization provides halfway homes for the survivors of trafficking. It provides educational support to the children and women who have a desire for learning. 
It also provides psychological counseling, support, and life skills to girls/women who are at risk of being trafficked. The main activity includes rescuing other girls by setting up a team of survivors of trafficking. This team of girls talk to the girls who they suspect are being traded by the traffickers.
List of Awards.
As the founder and director of Maiti Nepal, Anuradha Koirala won the CNN Hero of the Year award in 2010. She had previously received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts on August 25, 2006.
The United States government has given a two-year grant of $500,000 to Maiti Nepal in April 2010.
Until now, Anuradha Koirala has received 30 national and international awards for her courageous acts and lifetime achievement furthering the cause of children’s and women’s rights.
Criticism.
Though Maiti Nepal has successfully rescued thousands of girls from trafficking, the “critics of Maiti Nepal were of the view that Maiti Nepal did not always respect the will of the women concerned and used drastic measures to deal with the problem”.
One of the major drawbacks of Maiti Nepal’s work has been in rehabilitating the former prostitutes. The other criticism raised against this organization’s work is with its affiliation with an Indian Organization named STOP. STOP has been accused of raiding brothels at midnight and then taking away the girls forcefully and later subjecting them to various kinds of threats. Since Maiti Nepal is affiliated with STOP so when this organization is accused of any issue then it ultimately becomes a concern for Maiti Nepal as STOP hands over all its rescued girls to Maiti Nepal.
In May 2013 the Nepalese Supreme Court ordered Maiti Nepal to release a woman the court determined was being held against her will for the purpose of counselling her for being a lesbian.
