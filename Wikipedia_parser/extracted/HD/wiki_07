Newton Abbey

St Paul's Abbey, Newton, New Jersey, is a Benedictine simple priory of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. Originally established as a mission procure following World War I, over time the size of the community drastically decreased. In 2002, monks from Waegwan Abbey, South Korea, took charge of the monastery (Newton II). On January 25, 2004, Newton II was elevated to the status of a simple priory. The community's superior is Fr Prior Samuel Kim.
History.
Early Years of Expansion.
The effects that World War I had on the Missionary Benedictines' missions in Asia and Africa contributed to the founding of houses outside of Germany. Monasteries in a variety of areas would ensure that the Congregation had a greater chance of continuing its work in spite of political and economic crises. Thus, by 1924, the Missionary Benedictines had begun foundations in Argentina, the Philippines, Switzerland, the United States, and Venezuela. 
Fr Michael Heinlein, OSB, having been expelled by the British from what had been the colony of German East Africa, was entrusted with establishing a monastery in the United States. Heinlein was encouraged by Bishop Thomas Spreiter of Zululand, who happened to be in the United States raising funds for his diocese. Spreiter was confident that the United States could contribute both money and manpower to the Missionary Benedictine cause. Eventually, the two purchased a farm near Newton, New Jersey, approximately 100 km northwest of New York. 
In 1924, a number of German Missionary Benedictines joined Heinlein at "Little Flower Mission Procure", dedicated to the recently beatified Therese of Lisieux. Despite initial setbacks, which included financial difficulties and opposition from the Ku Klux Klan, the monastery quickly grew. By 1932, a minor seminary with 15 students was operating. The community also kept busy spreading mission awareness in surrounding parishes, as well as fostering devotion to Therese of Lisieux. While some monks raised funds for the Congregation's missions, others looked after a garden, a 180 hectare farm, and a number of workshops. 
With the change in Germany's political atmosphere, it became important for the monastery not only to procure funds, but also to cultivate local vocations. Thus, in 1936, Archabbot Chrysostomus Schmid elevated the procure to the status of a conventual priory. By 1940, the priory included one local priest, 13 local clerics, and six novices, many of them from the seminary. Ten years after it became a priory, Newton began sending local vocations to the missions. 
On June 9, 1947, Newton was elevated to an abbey, and placed under the patronage of Paul the Apostle. Significantly, an American, Fr Charles Coriston, was chosen as the first Abbot of Newton. At this time, the community included 21 priests (12 of them Americans), three American clerics, and 14 brothers (all expatriate Germans). The community expanded so quickly that the seminary students were forced into temporary housing, as the monks occupied the seminary facilities. In 1961, construction began on a new monastery that would suffice to house approximately fifty monks.
Post-Conciliar Decline.
What had been a period of spectacular growth came to a halt following the Second Vatican Council. The following demonstrates the clear drop-off in vocations:
Such a crisis resulted in the closure of the seminary, as well as a decrease in the number of monks assigned to the mission. Closure of the monastery seemed inevitable. The community was assisted by monks of Waegwan Abbey, South Korea. In December 2001, a number of these monks arrived in Newton. The monastery was officially handed over on January 25, 2002, and was elevated to the status of a simple priory, known as Newton II, on January 25, 2004. The small number of American monks who remain at Newton are governed by a special statute.
Apostolate.
Because of the decrease in vocations, the work of the community is currently not as widespread as it was in times past. Agriculture, particularly the growing of Christmas trees, remains an important part of the monks' livelihood. Members of the community are also involved in retreat work, pastoral care of the sick, and the promotion of the mission apostolate.
The monastery has no dependencies.
Personnel.
As of May 18, 2011, the community of Newton II included fourteen monks, including six priests and one oblate. Of these fourteen, nine are Korean, four are American, and one is Tanzanian.
Among those who still reside at Newton are Abbot Fr Joel Macul and Abbot Fr Augustine Hinches, respectively the fourth and second Abbots of Newton.
The community of Newton II is under the leadership of Fr Prior Samuel Kim.

Out of My Mind (B.o.B song)

"Out of My Mind" is a song by an American hip-hop recording artist B.o.B from his second studio album "Strange Clouds" (2012). The song features fellow American rapper Nicki Minaj and was produced by Dr. Luke and Billboard. "Out of My Mind" was the fourth single released from the album. The song was primarily written by B.o.B, Nicki Minaj, DJ Frank E and Alex da Kid.
Reception.
"Out of My Mind" was met with generally positive reviews upon release, particularly due to Minaj's verse in the song. Some compared it to her verse on Kanye West's "Monster" where critics say Minaj 'stole the show'. Kyle Anderson of EW.com stated, "Out of My Mind is an impressive testament to [B.o.B's] infectious, unflappable cool. The guy knows how to hang in nearly every sonic situation, and master it — just like a real rock star." Anderson named "Out Of My Mind" as one of the best tracks on the album, along with "So Hard To Breathe". According to the Universal Music Group, the song was written in 2009.
Andrew Unterberger gave the song a '3 star' rating, criticizing B.o.B. by saying, "Really, it was never a fair fight. B.o.B. seems like a very nice young man, but intimidatingly deranged he is not, and his verses (featuring couplets like “I was doing fine / Until my brain left and it didn’t say bye” and “I am a rebel but yes I’m so militant / Still I’m eligible for disabilities”) are as convincing of his insanity as a 12-year-old telling an obviously fraudulent story of the action he got last summer at overnight camp." He also complimented Nicki Minaj's verse."
Music video.
The music video was filmed in Detroit the week of July 16, 2012. A behind-the-scenes video was released on August 13th. On August 10th, B.o.B himself confirmed via Twitter that he would release the music video on Wednesday, August 15. The video failed to meet its premiere date. The video was directed by Benny Boom and it is set in a mental hospital. In one scene B.o.B is handcuffed to a wheelchair. In another, he is struggling in a strait jacket and a Hannibal Lecter-type mask. Nicki Minaj is also seen rapping alongside B.o.B. Minaj is referenced as 'Dr. Minaj' for a brief moment in the video, just as her verse begins. The video made its full premiere on August 23, 2012 on BET's 106 & Park and shortly after, uploaded to B.o.B.'s official YouTube account.

Van's Aircraft RV-14

The Van's Aircraft RV-14 is an American aerobatic kit aircraft under development by Van's Aircraft, introduced at AirVenture in July 2012. The aircraft will be supplied as a kit for amateur construction.
Design and development.
Derived from the four-seat RV-10, RV-14 design work was commenced several years before its 2012 debut. It is intended as an aerobatic two-seater to accommodate large pilots and offer greater baggage space, to comply with the US experimental amateur-built aircraft rules. The design goals included improved visibility, a wider cabin, a low landing speed achieved by larger and more effective flaps, good rate-of-climb and glide ratio, landing gear that meets FAR Part 23 certification standards and an airframe designed to accommodate the Lycoming IO-390 powerplant. It features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.
The RV-14 is built from aluminum sheet. The prototype fitted a Lycoming IO-390 four-stroke powerplant. The kit is intended to be easier to assemble than earlier Van's designs through the use of pre-punched and pre-formed fuselage longerons, pre-installed wiring, plug-in avionics, a pre-trimmed and ready-to-install bubble canopy, pre-welded canopy frame, pre-fitted engine baffles as well as matched pre-punched holes. The RV-14 offers several instrument panel choices, including one designed to take modern EFIS systems, like the Dynon SkyView, without any additional cutting, as well as a blank panel that can be customized by the builder.
The manufacturer will also offer aircraft type transition training and has built an RV-14 for this purpose.

In 1895, George Bradford Bartlett, ”well-known in connection with the Manse boathouse”, wrote of the cliffs near Fairhaven Bay on the Sudbury River: "For more than a hundred years these cliffs have been a favorite resort for the nature lover, and the climax of many a Sunday walk or autumnal holiday trip, as no better view can be had of the waving tree-tops and gentle river".

Oskar Mobil a.s.

Oskar Mobil a.s. was a telecommunications company in the Czech Republic between 1999 and 2005. The company was purchased by Vodafone in 2005 and changed its name to Vodafone Czech Republic a.s.
After an extended and intense tendering process, a third GSM dual-band 900/1800 MHz license was awarded to a consortium led by TIW (operating in the Czech Republic under the name ClearWave, N.V.) in Prague on September 29, 1999.
Five months later on March 1, 2000, Oskar went live as Cesky Mobil a.s. The company was the third GSM network in the Czech Republic. Karla Stephens was its first official employee and served as Chief Commercial Officer. In the coming years, Oskar continued to grow at pace, settling at 17% market share with 1.83M customers by 2005. Stephens was promoted to COO ("Chief Oskar Officer") in 2002. Her tenure as COO did not go unnoticed by the Czech media and telecommunications industry analysts. Oskar was the recipient of numerous awards in its six years on the Czech market, including the Rhodos Image Award - Telecom for 2003–2005, the World Communication Award (2001–2002, 2003, 2005) and the League of American Communications Professionals' Vision Award (Best Annual Report) for (2001, 2003 and 2005). Stephens herself also earned a Stevie Award (2005) for Female Entrepreneurs in EMEA. 
Rumors of financial trouble at TIW forced Oskar to eventually undertake a massive corporate debt refinancing late in 2004. Fortunately for Stephens and Tolstoy, the debt refinancing was a tremendous success. There was speculation as to which telecommunications giant, Orange or Vodafone, would make their move into the Czech market. Oskar was bid on solely by Vodafone and a deal was struck on March 15, 2005 for an estimated $860M-$1.3B, a return of over 100% for the TIW investors and a giant victory for senior management.
Vodafone continues to perform well in the Czech market. In 2010, the company gained its three millionth customer and competition with T-Mobile and O2 remains as fierce as ever.

James Hosken

Vice-Admiral James Hosken (6 December 1798 – 2 January 1885) was a British naval officer and a pioneer of ocean steam navigation. He joined the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and after more than 20 years service left to join the merchant navy and serve as captain of the steamships and the . He returned to the Royal Navy to see service during the Crimean War.
Biography.
Early naval career.
Hosken was born on in Plymouth, the son of a navy warrant officer. He entered the Royal Navy on 23 February 1808, (two months after his 9th birthday). In 1810 he was appointed midshipman aboard , and later served in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea, until the end of the war in 1815. He passed the examination for lieutenant in 1816, but was unable to gain a commission. From 1816 to 1819 he served in the frigate in the West Indies, then spent three years in the Channel serving aboard the brig . From 1824 to 1828 he served as Mate of the revenue cutter "Scout", engaged in the suppression of smuggling. Finally, on 9 August 1828, he was appointed lieutenant of the bomb vessel , serving in the Mediterranean under Captain Stephen Lushington. "Aetna" was paid off in May 1830, and afterwards he commanded the packet ships "Princess Elizabeth" and , sailing to the West Indies and South America. He left the Navy in October 1832.
Merchant captain.
Between 1833 and 1836 he was the captain of a merchant ship sailing between Liverpool and South America. In 1837 he devoted himself to the study of the marine steam engine, and towards the end of the year was appointed to the command of the Great Western Steamship Company's paddle-wheel steamship . She sailed from Bristol on her maiden voyage on 8 April 1838, and arrived at New York fifteen days later on the 23rd. This represented a dramatic increase in speed, as the average duration of an Atlantic crossing from England to America in a sailing ship was 34 days. Side paddle steamers had brought this down to 17 days, but with experience Hosken brought his average down to 13 days in the sixty-six voyages he made between England and America. In 1844 he was appointed to command of Great Western's , the first iron-hulled screw steamship and at that time the largest ship afloat. She sailed from Liverpool for New York on her maiden voyage in August 1845. However on the night of 22 September 1846, during her fifth voyage, she ran aground in Dundrum Bay, Ireland. Weather conditions were poor, and an error on the chart led Hosken to believe that the lighthouse on St. John's Point, at the entrance of the bay, was the Calf of Man, which they had passed four hours before. After several months the ship was refloated, but Hosken had no further employment in the merchant service.
Later career.
From 1848 to 1849 Hosken served as master attendant and postmaster at Labuan, recently ceded to England. He then returned to the navy and in 1851 he was appointed to command of the despatch vessel in the Mediterranean, and later in the Channel. On 26 September 1853 he was promoted to commander, and during the Baltic campaigns of 1854–55 commanded the hospital ship . At the end of the Crimean War he was employed in bringing back troops from the Black Sea. In June 1857 he was promoted to captain, and in 1868 was placed on the retired list.
He was promoted to rear-admiral in April 1875, and vice-admiral in August 1879, and died at Ilfracombe, Devon, on 2 January 1885. He is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol.
In 1889 Elizabeth Ann, his second wife, published an "Autobiographical Sketch of the Public Career of Admiral James Hosken".
A portrait of his son Thomas Hosken (b.1831) can be seen in Merchant Hall, Bristol.

Tolib Ayombekov is a militant opposition politician and warlord in Tajikistan and alleged militia leader involved in the Gorno-Badakhshan clashes in 2012 against the government forces of ruling Tajik president Emomalii Rahmon.
Ayombekov had been a warlord during the 1992 to 1997 Tajik Civil War between the United Tajik Opposition and the government led by President Rahmon Nabiyev. As part of subsequent peace deal between the opposing sides, Ayombekov was given a government post. However, Ayombekov and many other Tajik warlords were gradually driven out. Emomalii Rahmon's government has also accused Ayombekov of tobacco smuggling.
After Major-General Abdullo Nazarov, the head of the Tajik intelligence agency "GKNB" in the local semi-autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan, was dragged out of his car, and was fatally stabbed in an incident in Ishkoshim, heavy fighting erupted on 24 July 2012 between government forces and militants loyal to Ayombekov in the streets of Khorog. The Western media described the fighting as the worst in Tajikistan since 2010 or the 1992–1997 civil war. Ayombekov denied any responsibility for Nazarov's death.

Schleswig horse

The Schleswig horse () is a breed of medium sized draught horse found primarily in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein; they are also found in smaller numbers in Lower Saxony. They are working horses, used today for agricultural work, pulling wagonettes and other recreational activities.
Characteristics.
The Schleswig stands between (61-64 in) and weighs about . Stallions are often taller than mares. It has a short and straight head with kind eyes and a broad forehead; short, cresty neck; powerful shoulders; a long body with good depth in the girth; powerful hindquarters; short and stocky limbs with some feather. It is predominantly chestnut in colour though occasionally bay or grey. The Schleswig is a good mover and has a placid nature. It is versatile and agile, with great endurance and very willing to learn.
History.
The Schleswig originates from Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and strongly resembles its close relative, the Jutland horse. It was developed in the latter half of the 19th century as a medium sized draught horse when the breeders' association of Schleswig Holstein decided in 1888 to separate the breeding of warmbloods and draughts. In 1891, the Schleswiger Horse Breeders Society was founded to nurture and preserve the breed. The brand V.S.P in an oval on the right hindleg was chosen to identify registered horses and is still used today. 
In the 19th century, lighter blood from the Yorkshire Coach Horse and Thoroughbred was introduced, though this did not have a lasting effect on the breed. This was then followed with the introduction of Oldenburg, Holstein and Suffolk Punch blood though these infusions also did not achieve the desired results. In 1862 Jutland stallions were imported and bred in further. The number of horses and breed quality both dropped significantly following World War I. However, Breton and Boulonnais blood was successfully added in order to increase the breed's quality. Virtually all Schleswig horses bred since 1930 trace their ancestry to a stallion named Munkedal, the son of the prolific Oppenheim LXII, who was a Suffolk Punch. 
Despite an increase of numbers between the wars, reaching its peak in 1949 when there were approximately 25,000 mares and 450 registered stallions in the studbook, mechanisation led to reduced demand, and numbers again fell. In 1976 the breed numbers reached a low of 35 mares and 5 stallions, and in that year the old society was dissolved and the Stud Book Schleswig Holstein/Hamburg took over registration. The society was reformed in 1991 and now has 200 members. The numbers have also risen to 200 mares and 30 stallions. Despite the increase, it is on the list of the endangered domestic animal breeds as recorded by the ("association for the conservation of old and endangered domestic animal breeds"), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, and the European Association for Animal Production (EAAP).
Uses.
The Schleswig horse was bred for use as a working horse. It was used on farms and for hauling timber from forests, to pull omnibuses and brewery wagons in cities and for heavy work in the military. Today, they are still seen as working horses in the agriculture and timber industries, as well as used for various forms of recreational use, including driving and pulling wagonettes.

The estate was established as Østrupgård in 1704 from land that used to belong to Kalundborg Castle. In 1742 it was acquired by general Christian Lerche (1692-1757). The large estate included 7 manors, 13 churches and extensive woodlands, taking in practically all of Kalundborg Amt. Lerche constructed a new seat on the estate, probably assisted by Nicolai Eigtved, Denmark's leading architect of the time.
Lerche received the Order of the Elephant in 1748 and was given status of count in 1752. He renamed his estate Lerchenborg in 1754 but did not establish it as a county ("grevskab") which, since he had no direct heirs, would fall back to the king. Instead he founded a "stamhus" which secured succession rights for other lines of the Lerche family.
19th century.
When Christian Cornelius Lerche, who had inherited Lerchenborg in 1804, was ennobled with rank of count, on 26 May 1818, Lerchenborg was combined with Aunsøgård, Mineslund, Asnæsgård, Lerchenfeld, Birkendegård, Vesterbygård, Astrup and Davrup to form the County of Lerchenborg ("Grevskabet Lerchenborg").
In 1862, Hans Christian Andersen stayed at Lerchenborg for a week as guest of Count C.A. Lerche.
20th century.
The county was dissolved in 1923 and the Lerchenborg estate passed out of the Lerche family's ownership in 1927. However, in 1952 it was reacquired by a member of the family, Christian Albrecht Frederik Lerche-Lerchenborg, and has been owned by the Lerchenborg counts ever since. Mineslund and Asnæsgården were sold off in connection with the reacquission..
Architecture.
Lerchenborg is a three-winged white-washed Rococo complex, consisting of a two-storey, seventeen bay main wing and two lower, detached lateral wings. The main wing has a three-bay median risilit with a triangular pediment and corner projections of two bays with rounded pediments, all with Rococo decorations. The rear side is basically of the same pattern. There is a central entrance on each side of the building.
Interior.
The house is also notable for its fine Rococo interiors. The hipped roofs on all three buildings are of slate, although originally they had red tiles.
Surroundings.
The whole complex of main building, farm buildings and park form a strictly symmetrical unity in accordance with the aestetic principles of the Baroque. On one side, the house is approached through a hierarchy of courtyards, formed by barns and stables, and on the other side the central axis of the complex continues through the park and into the countryside.
The original French-style Baroque garden was designed by the Belgian-Danish architect and engineering officer Jean Baptiste de Longueville but most of it was adapted into an English-style landscape garden in the 19th century. Today the park has an area of 20 hectares.

Jonathan Young (commodore)

Commodore Jonathan Young (27 November 1826 - 17 May 1885) was an officer in the United States Navy. He participated in anti-piracy actions and the African Slave Trade Patrol, fought in the Mexican War, Puget Sound War, and American Civil War, and served briefly as commander of the Asiatic Squadron.
Naval career.
Young was born in Ohio, on 27 November 1826. He was appointed as a midshipman from Illinois on 19 October 1841 and served in the Home Squadron from 1841 to 1844, attached first to the paddle steamer and then to the sloop-of-war . While in the Home Squadron, he was part of a boat expedition against pirates at the Isle of Pines south of Cuba in 1842 and participated in the capture of a slave ship carrying 500 African slaves.
From 1845 to 1848, Young was attached to the 74-gun ship-of-the-line , the flagship of Commodore James Biddle, commander of the East India Squadron. During his time aboard "Columbus", the ship sailed first to the East Indies and then continued around the world, stopping at Edo, Japan, in July 1846 to forcibly deliver a letter requesting the opening of trade between the United States and Japan from President of the United States James K. Polk to the Emperor of Japan, Kōmei, and receive a reply. Later in the voyage, she operated off California from 1847 to 1848 during the Mexican War before completing her circumnavigation of the globe in 1848. Young was promoted to passed midshipman on 10 August 1847.
Young served aboard the sailing frigate , flagship of Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, Sr., the commander of the Home Squadron, from 1849 to 1850, and then aboard the sloop-of-war in the Pacific Squadron from 1850 to 1852; he again sailed around the world while aboard "St. Marys". He then performed duty at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., during 1853. He served aboard the steamer from 1854 to 1857; while aboard "Massachusetts", he was promoted to master on 14 September 1855 and to lieutenant the following day, and in 1855 gained distinction for commanding landing forces in combat with Native Americans during the Puget Sound War in the Washington Territory. After duty at the Naval Observatory again in 1858, he was aboard the steamer from 1858 to 1859 to participate in the Paraguay Expedition before another tour at the Naval Observatory from 1859 to 1860.
In 1860, Young reported aboard the sidewheel steam frigate , which operated in the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Squadron, and along the United States East Coast. He was aboard "Susqehanna" when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, and participated in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. He also took part aboard "Susquehanna" in the seizure of Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, on 28 August 1861 and the Battle of Port Royal at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 7 November 1861. From November 1861 to June 1862, he was executive officer of the sloop-of-war , engaged in the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina, and from June 1862 to November 1862 he was executive officer of the sidewheel steam frigate on blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina, being promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1862.
Young was commanding officer of the steam gunboat in 1863. "Pembina", on blockade duty in the Gulf of Mexico off Mobile Bay, Alabama, fought an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery which had been emplaced with a goal of driving her farther offshore; she succeeded in silencing the battery and forcing it to withdraw inland. She also came under fire from Confederate troops on shore while she was destroying a blockade runner that had run aground. After contracting a fever while on duty in the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, later in 1863, Young was assigned to temporary ordnance duty until he could make a full recovery. Once recovered, he became commanding officer of the double-ended steam gunboat on blockade duty in the Atlantic Ocean off South Carolina and Georgia from March to July 1864, when he took command of the monitor in the blockade off Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in command of "Sangamon" until the fall of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, seeing action in all the attacks on the defenses of Charleston Harbor from July 1864 to February 1865, after which "Sangamon" served off Wilmington, North Carolina, and on Virginias James River. For the gallantry, zeal, and effectiveness of his Civil War service, Young received letters of commendation from Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter, Rear Admirals Theodorus Bailey, John A. Dahlgren, and Sylvanus William Godon, Commodore William H. Gardner, and many others under whom he had served, and the Board of Admirals recommended him for promotion.
Young detached from "Sangamon" in the final weeks of the Civil War, on 28 March 1865. He then was commanding officer of the receiving ship at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, until 1867, and was promoted to commander on 25 July 1866. He returned to sea as commanding officer of the sidewheel steamer in the North Atlantic Squadron from 1867 to 1868. He then served ashore at the Naval Observatory from 1869 to 1870 and the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1871 to 1872, and then as commanding officer of the receiving ship from 1872 to 1873. He was promoted to captain on 8 November 1873, performed duty at the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1873 to 1876, and commanded the screw frigate , flagship of the Asiatic Squadron, from 1876 to 1878, and temporarily was the commander of the Asiatic Squadron from 12 August to 14 October 1877. 
Young was at the Portsmouth Navy Yard again from 1879 to 1881, and was promoted to commodore on 19 June 1882. He became commandant of the New London Navy Yard in New London, Connecticut, in 1882, remaining in that position until his death.
Death.
Young died at Crocker House in New London on 17 May 1885 of a recurring fever he had contracted six weeks previously in Washington, D.C., while sitting as a member of the court martial of former Surgeon General of the United States Navy Philip S. Wales. He is buried with his wife and children at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

Patcham Pylon

The Patcham Pylon is a monumental gateway erected in 1928 near Patcham in East Sussex, England. Designed by local architect John Leopold Denman and paid for by public subscription, it commemorated the extension of the County Borough of Brighton on 1 April 1928, and stood close to the new northern boundary.
The gateway consists of two stone towers known locally as "the Pylons" , with built-in seats around their bases. They still stand and are clearly visible to travellers on either carriageway of the A23 road to London. They straddle the southbound carriageway of the A23 just outside the city of Brighton and Hove and are individually listed at Grade II.
History and symbolic role.
The Pylon was built as a symbolic gateway to Brighton and was intended to extend a welcome to travellers approaching from the north along the A23. They were commissioned by Sir Herbert Carden, a local councillor, and were unveiled on 30 May 1928. He paid £2,255 towards them, and the public raised a further £993. They stand either side of what was, at the time of construction, a single carriageway road. Because the road is now a dual carriageway, one pylon now "stands forlornly in the central reservation, although a third is planned".
In the spirit of welcome, the north face of the western tower bears the inscription:
HAIL GUEST• WE ASK NOT WHAT THOU ART.
IF FRIEND. WE GREET THEE. HAND & HEART:
IF STRANGER. SUCH NO LONGER BE:
IF FOE. OUR LOVE SHALL CONQUER THEE.
The pylons and seats were listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 26 August 1999. Such buildings are considered to be "of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them", and "nationally important" buildings of "special interest". As of February 2001, they were among 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.
Architecture.
The pylons are of limestone with slightly concave north and south faces. Small buttresses protrude at the corners. Carvings and inscriptions include the coat of arms of the Duke and Duchess of York, who laid the foundation stone, the emblems of Brighton and Sussex, a female figure and a galleon. Details of the date, architect, builders, founders and other descriptive information, and a short poem, are also carved on the flat panels which are mounted on the concave faces. Next to each pylon is a seat, also made of stone and wrapping around but not touching the base. They are about off the ground, supported on small columns, and have decorative moulding. They are separately listed at Grade II.

The End of the Party (short story)

"The End of the Party" is a short story by the English writer Graham Greene (1904–1991). It was first published in 1929, and has been reprinted many times in anthologies. It is viewed as a classical expression of the English tradition of horror fiction, as it elicits a well-founded and increasingly intense sense of impending doom without inserting any scenes of physical violence.
Plot summary.
The two principal protagonists of "The End of the Party" are nine-year-olds, Peter Morton and Francis Morton. The story makes clear that although they are identical twins, they possess profound psychological differences – Peter, the elder by several minutes, is presented as a healthy child with an intensively protective attitude towards his impaired brother, while Francis is depicted as being challenged by an intense anxiety disorder. The unnamed narrator speculates that Francis suffered psychological trauma during the birth process, when he was briefly separated from Peter.
Peter and Francis will be separated again during a game of hide-and-seek that is the scheduled climax of a birthday party for a family acquaintance, ten-year-old Colin Henne-Falcon. Descriptions of the home of the Mortons, where the story begins, and the Henne-Falcons, where it ends, make clear that the ambiance of the story is that of the English upper class between the two World Wars. The brief appearance of a child's nurse, and other servants, help establish the social setting. Cozy elements such as an egg-and-spoon race, a three-legged race, and a birthday cake do little to diminish the mounting horror of the story, as Francis is increasingly terrified by the prospect of being required to play hide-and-seek in the dark. It is made clear that the "birthday party" is merely a façade for a grim reality: the children, and their hostess, are all participating in a complicated and brutal ritual aimed at establishing a social hierarchy amongst the juvenile partygoers. 
As the climactic hide-and-seek game begins, the adults present turn out the lights and the children designated to hide, including Peter and Francis, are required to scatter. Peter senses his brother's terror and, aided by his instinctive grasp of his brother's psychological fears and needs, is able to guess where Francis has hidden himself. A gesture of Peters's hand in the dark, as he reaches out, tells him that his guess has been successful: he touches his younger brother and then grasps his hand and crouches close to him, attempting to provide a continuing presence of reassurance. Faint noises, described meticulously by Greene, show that the game is continuing, and darkness continues to enshroud the place of safety where the two brothers are hiding. 
Finally the game is over, a chandelier is lit, and the party's hostess begins to scream with horror. As light floods into the niche where the brothers have hidden themselves, the narrator reports that Francis Morton has lain sprawled and still since the terrified child was startled beyond endurance by the touch of a human hand in the dark. The story's ironic ending makes clear that the nine-year-old did not live long enough to realize that the fingers descending upon his face were those of his protective brother. Their separation would now be permanent.
Critical response.
Greene published "The End of the Party" near the start of a writing career that would extend over more than six decades; this short story helped to develop his reputation as a significant force in English letters. The favorable response to his story may be connected to ongoing concerns in Britain due to the significant headcount of World War I veterans afflicted with "shell shock". The story was anthologized in the Greene collection, "Twenty-One Stories", published in 1954. 
Greene himself considered this story to be among his best, and assisted in its selection among the texts reprinted in the Greene edition of the Viking Portable Library, originally published in 1973 and reprinted since in revised editions.
Later commentary on "The End of the Party" tends to look at protagonist Francis Morton's impairments from the standpoint of a society that tries to help children with disabilities. A review published in 1999 by New York University encourages readers to develop a sense of empathy for the doomed child.

The 4-Hour Chef

The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life is the third book by Tim Ferriss, published on November 20, 2012. The book continues Ferriss' "4-Hour" themes of self-improvement, self-actualization, and the skill of learning new things through the lens of cooking. The book is intended to be the cookbook for people who don't buy cookbooks and was a #1 "Wall Street Journal" bestseller.
Synopsis.
"The 4-Hour Chef" contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain methods for accelerated learning. Recipes based on Ferriss' Slow-Carb Diet are included, and the book is presented as a practical and unusual guide to mastering cooking and food. Alongside these cooking techniques, Ferriss shows readers how to learn any new skill or ability quickly. Ferriss calls this capacity for mastering new skills in the minimum amount of time possible "meta-learning."
The book is broken down into 5 sections:
Meta (Meta-Learning)
In meta-learning, Ferriss outlines techniques to accelerate learning, often by mimicking the world’s fastest learners to become world-class in a variety of fields in six months or less. Topics covered range from language learning to fire building. This section is further broken down using the acronym “DiSSS”
Dom (The Domestic)
The Domestic section covers the building blocks of cooking. Ferriss cites Pareto’s 80/20 principle to teach 14 core lessons which can be used to create thousands of dishes.
Wild (The Wild)
The Wild section is where Ferriss advocates readers connect directly with ingredients and step out of the kitchen. Examples from the section include “The anti-hunters first hunt”, “How to gut and cook tree rat” (squirrel), and “How to cook over fire.”
Sci (The Scientist)
In The Scientist, Ferriss uses recipes to explain 14 chemical reactions he hopes will give readers a better understanding of food. Examples include dehydration (How to make beef jerky), solvents (How to make bacon infused bourbon), and gels (How to make crunchy bloody marys).
Pro (The Professional)
The Professional section analyzes how the best in the world came to be and builds on the skills learned in previous recipes to create more complex dishes. The section starts by focusing on the success of two restaurants: Chicago's Alinea and New York City's Hearth.
Release and reception.
"The 4-Hour Chef" premiered on the "New York Times", "Publisher's Weekly" and "USA Today" bestseller lists, and was a #1 "Wall Street Journal" bestseller.
Prior to the release of "The 4-Hour Chef", the book was boycotted by a selection of brick and mortar bookstores, most notably Barnes & Noble, due to the book’s publisher, Amazon Publishing. This boycott led to Ferriss striking a handful of partnerships with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit. In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of "4-Hour Chef" content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content. The bundle was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.
In the week of release, Ferriss orchestrated an extensive media campaign, one that "USA Today" described as an "online media onslaught." The campaign included an "All-You-Can-Eat" promotion assembled by Ferriss, which offered incentives for book pre-orders ranging from supplemental materials to keynote speeches by Ferriss. During the first week, the book received coverage in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Forbes, CBS, Wired Magazine, Outside Magazine, Dr. Oz, and many other outlets. Kirkus Reviews called the book a "wildly inventive excursion through the creation of our daily bread."

Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association

The , abbreviated to Yokuseikai or IRAPA, was the political wing of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and a joint caucus of both the House of Representatives and the House of Peers that existed between 20 May 1942 to 30 March 1945.
In Japanese history, the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association established the “one country, one party” system.
History.
Although candidates who received the endorsement of the IRAA and its affiliated Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps won a commanding majority in the elections of 30 April 1942, 85 unendorsed candidates who were critical of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo’s cabinet were also elected. Tojo, who was concerned about this, invited 70 representatives from the political world, the business community, and the press to form the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Consolidation Preparation Committee on 7 May and he appointed as its chairman Masatsune Ogura, a former finance minister from the Sumitomo Group. Afterwards seven more members including five active cabinet members joined. Starting with these 77, a membership list, platform, and rules were announced on 14 May and notes requesting participation in a new proposed organization were sent to prominent men in Japanese society, all the while maintaining the facade of an organization by interested volunteers. However, in reality, the Imperial Rule Assistance Diet Members' League, the IRAA’s affiliate in the House of Representatives and parent body of the endorsed candidates in the last election, had simply disbanded and formed the core of the new group. The Home Ministry also revealed its plans to immediately certify the new group’s status as a political organization but by contrast to order the dissolution of all other parliamentary caucuses, such as Ichiro Hatoyama’s Fraternity Association and others, which had been formed by the unendorsed candidates after the previous election. No successor groups were recognized, and because of that unless the elected representatives affiliated with the new group, further political activity would be impossible.
And so, from the work of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Consolidation Preparation Committee, the new Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association was established on 20 May. Its first president was Former Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe, head of the IRAA’s council to endorse candidates in the last election. Out of the 466 members in the House of Representatives, 458 joined, all of them except two members who were being prosecuted for criminal offenses and six members of the Tohokai group who fought dissolution. Three days later, the Tohokai was also compelled to disband and all of its members ending up being forcibly integrated into the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association. Even in the House of Peers, where adherence was voluntary and de facto duel membership in pre-existing caucuses was permitted, 326 of the 411 members joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association. However, because the caucuses of the House of Peers were close knit and were not supposed to engage in political activities, and considering the House of Peers’ traditional role since its establishment of defending the interests of the government, Japan had more or less put in place the “one country, one party” system. 
The platform of the IRAPA called for the rallying of political forces across the country, close cooperation with the IRAA, and the setting up of the so-called “Imperial Rule Assistance Parliament” uniting all factions. Due to the fact that this platform was swiftly passed without amendment as part of government-sponsored legislation, members of the Imperial Diet were henceforth bound to cooperate in the prosecution of the war. An executive council consisting of 29 members was set up as the organization’s highest organ. Non-Diet members such as Aiichiro Fujiyama occupied a majority of the positions, but at the same time the permanent members who conducted proceedings in the Imperial Diet comprised seven members from each house of the legislature. From the House of Representatives Yonezo Maeda, Tadao Oasa, Ryūtarō Nagai, and Tatsunosuke Yamazaki were among those elected and those from the House of Peers included Fumio Gotō, Takuo Godo, Sotaro Ishiwata, and Nagakage Okabe.
Next, in order to accomplish the goal that was held up in the party’s platform of establishing an “Imperial Rule Assistance Parliament”, broad powers were given to the permanent members of the executive council and Diet members who were critical of the Tojo cabinet including those had just been absorbed from other groups were deprived of their right to speak both within the Diet and within the IRAPA. And yet at the same time, though it was said to preside over an “Imperial Rule Assistance Parliament”, the IRAPA also included elements of a “catch-all party”, and the Tojo cabinet and the militarists found that it was not always a pliant rubber stamp and would still provoke conflicts with them. Seeking to avoid such conflicts and maintain the facade of national unity, Tojo and the military had no choice but to let the permanent members of the executive council enter the cabinet and to ask for their cooperation while paying heed to their wishes in the decision-making process on domestic policies.
However, factional activity in the House of Representatives soon began to manifest itself mirroring that of old parties such as the Rikken Seiyukai and Rikken Minseito. Conflicts over policy ended up being provoked even by first-time assemblymen who won election in 1942, including members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps who were a product of the single-party system as well as the established far-right like Bin Akao and Ryoichi Sasakawa who were skeptical about the new system. Furthermore, to avoid promoting disunity the IRAPA did not have its own regional branches, which were instead left to the IRAA, but this meant that campaigning for the next election would not be possible. Although there was agitation for a merger with the local operations of the IRAA, this was quashed by the opposition of Prime Minister Tojo. Then in June 1943, six members of the House of Representatives including Ichiro Hatoyama and Seigo Nakano ended up breaking away from the IRAPA.
Even so, while the Tojo cabinet continued, the “Imperial Rule Assistance Parliament” and the Political Association that supported it kept the system solid for a time. However, in July 1944 Governor-General of Korea Kuniaki Koiso succeeded Tojo as prime minister and when Nobuyuki Abe in turn was appointed Governor-General in place of Koiso, the post of President of the IRAPA fell in August to former Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Seizo Kobayashi. After that, rents started to develop within the Association. While doubts were being harbored about his leadership skills, Kobayashi was appointed Minister of State by the Koiso cabinet in December 1944 and a restructuring of the IRAPA and IRAA was ordered by Koiso in preparation for the expected invasion of Japan. Koiso and Kobayashi laid out a policy to dissolve the IRAA, the IRAPA, and the Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps, and to replace them with a new party fully integrating the entire nation, including integration of the regional branches of the IRAA. Although this policy to form a new party was rapidly accepted by a meeting of IRAPA Diet members on 20 January 1945 and was formally announced by President Kobayashi on 12 February, it was opposed by the senior members of the IRAA and Diet members belonging to the Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps who as minority factions were excluded from the decision-making process.
It then became clear that Nobusuke Kishi, along with dissidents who were dissatisfied with President Kobayashi, was working out a scheme to promote Yosuke Matsuoka as the new president. Because of this, the IRAPA was thrown into turmoil from the inside, and the dissidents along with Diet members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps who opposed Kobayashi declared their secession one by one. In response, Kobayashi resigned as Minister of State on 1 March and made every effort to mollify his opponents and organize the new party, but at the time of the founding of the new party’s preparation committee on 8 March the plan was already in shambles. Diet members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Corps said that they would not participate in the IRAPA or it successor and instead formed the Association of Imperial Assistance Dietmen on 10 March and Kishi’s dissidents followed suit on 11 March and formed the Association for Defense of the Fatherland. Observing this situation, the House of Peers also decided to opt out of joining the new party and though the IRAPA finally dissolved on 30 March 1945 and was replaced with the Greater Japan Political Association under President Jiro Minami, the “one country, one party” system of the “Imperial Rule Assistance Parliament” had effectively collapsed and Japan would end up losing the war.

Select Conversations with an Uncle

Select Conversations with an Uncle, published in 1895, was H.G. Wells's first literary publication in book form. It consists of reports of twelve conversations between a fictional witty uncle who has returned to London from South Africa with "a certain affluence," as well as two other conversations (one on aestheticism that takes place in a train, entitled "A Misunderstood Artist," and another on physiognomy, entitled "The Man with a Nose").
Themes.
The principal themes of the conversations between a Wells-like character named "George" and his uncle are fashion, the inevitability of human "discomfort" due to passing social movements, the resemblance of ideals to interior decoration, the art of being photographed, the social basis of taste in art and music, the state of being engaged, the agony of having to listen to a near neighbor playing the piano, tricycles, social novels, and the effects of marriage.
Publication.
"Select Conversations with an Uncle" was published in a limited edition by John Lane in a series called "The Mayfair Set" and in New York by Merriam. The volume was dedicated to "To my dearest and best friend, R.A.C.," which is a misprint either for R.A. Gregory, Wells's friend who later became the editor of "Nature" between 1919 and 1939, or for Wells's wife, Amy Catherine Robbins (better known as "Jane"); it was published the day before The Time Machine. The pieces in the book were drawn from thirty or more articles by Wells published in the "Pall Mall Gazette" beginning in 1893.
Reception.
Wells's "uncle" character had been "very well received" in the "Pall Mall Gazette", but not all reviews of the volume were favorable. The "Athenaeum" panned it as "a dreary and foolish assemblage of commonplace ideas expressed in stilted phraseology."

Tom Souville

Tom Souville (24 February 1777, Calais – 31 December 1839, Calais), was a privateer and "rescue of Calais", causing the first "rescue boat" from Calais, lateen-rigged in 1819 with the support of society to Agriculture Calais. He was Freemason.
History.
Thomas Souville, the English called him "Cap'n Tom", was the son of a doctor. Yet nothing predestined to be privateer, it was to the spirit of adventure and risk appetite, he made this choice. Tom was educated at Dover, then he goes to sea as a ship's boy, he's only 11 years. Captivated by the sea, he will choose to serve on warships. Many envy his experience, and yet he's only 18. Several naval battles under his belt, three wounds, exchanged prisoner. Promoted ensign, Tom asks a letter of marque, we not given. His youth will be for many. It will therefore serve another master until the age of majority. Reached his majority, Thomas will prove incredibly effective.
Letter of Marque.
Tom Souville is one of the most illustrious of the race system, the financial stakes for the time. Between 1811 and 1815, it reported more than 5 million francs to city of Calais, and from 1793, active from the ports of the Channel and North Sea. Tom Souville as a privateer in the city of Calais, sported on his ship, "the flag of Calais". Indeed, Calais was one of five cities in France to be allowed to have its own flag, by "Royal Order", with Dunkirk, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Le Havre and St Malo. Calais is the flag which floated so «Le Vieux Beffroi», at the head of town bands and of course, the mast of the privateers of the City.

Muslim first became involved with the Kurdish movement during the 1970s when he was studying engineering at Istanbul Technical University after becoming influenced by Mustafa Barzani's ongoing fight against the Iraqi government, the failure of which spurred him into becoming more active. Following University he worked as an engineer in Saudi Arabia before returning to Syria in the 90s.
He joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria, the Syrian branch of the Kurdish Democratic Party, in 1998. He later left in 2003 after becoming disillusioned by the party's failure to accomplish its objectives and joined the newly formed Democratic Union Party, or PYD, becoming a member of its executive council, and was elected as party head in 2010. He fled to a PUK camp in Iraq in 2010 after he and his wife were imprisoned in Syria, however returned to Qamishli in March 2011 following the beginning of the Syrian civil war.
During an interview with BBC News reporter Orla Guerin in August 2012, Muslim denied "operational links" to the PKK. He also added that he had been in and out of prison annually since 2003 by Bashar Assad's government.
On 9 October 2013, Salih Muslim's son Shervan, a fighter in the People's Protection Units, was killed west of Tell Abyad during clashes with rebels linked to al-Qaida. He was buried in the family's hometown of Kobanê in a public funeral which thousands of people attended.

Ajit Manohar Pai

Ajit Manohar Pai (born 28 April 1945, Bombay) is a former Indian cricketer who played in one Test in 1969. 
An opening bowler and useful lower-order batsman, Pai made his debut for Bombay in the Ranji Trophy in the 1968-69 season. After taking 11 wickets in his first three first-class matches he was selected to represent West Zone in the Duleep Trophy. He helped each team to the championship and finished the season with 129 runs at an average of 25.80 and 23 wickets at 23.21.
In September 1969 he took 7 for 42 for West Zone against Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy and was selected to open the bowling for India in the First Test against New Zealand later that month. He took two wickets and India won, but for the Second Test the selectors decided to use the all-rounders Rusi Surti and Syed Abid Ali to open the bowling and strengthened the spin attack with Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan. Again he helped West Zone and Bombay win their respective championships in 1969-70.
He did not play any further matches in the Duleep Trophy, but in 1970-71 he had an outstanding match for Bombay against Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy. Batting at number seven, he made 91 out of a Bombay total of 265, then took 5 for 22 and 6 for 30 to take Bombay to victory by an innings and 82 runs. Once again he played in the Bombay side that won the Ranji Trophy.
His bowling form fell away after 1970-71, but he played in two more Ranji Trophy-winning Bombay sides, in 1974-75 and 1975-76, seasons in which his batting (310 runs at 28.11) and catching (18 catches in 10 matches) were more prominent. The 1975-76 victory in the final over Bihar was his last first-class match.

<doc id="36545943" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36545943" title="Slope number">
Slope number

In graph drawing and geometric graph theory, the slope number of a graph is the minimum possible number of distinct slopes of edges in a drawing of the graph in which vertices are represented as points in the Euclidean plane and edges are represented as line segments that do not pass through any non-incident vertex.
Complete graphs.
Although closely related problems in discrete geometry had been studied earlier, e.g. by and ,
the problem of determining the slope number of a graph was introduced by , who showed that the slope number of an "n"-vertex complete graph "K""n" is exactly "n". A drawing with this slope number may be formed by placing the vertices of the graph on a regular polygon.
Relation to degree.
The slope number of a graph of maximum degree "d" is clearly at least formula_1, because at most two of the incident edges at a degree-"d" vertex can share a slope. More precisely, the slope number is at least equal to the linear arboricity of the graph, since the edges of a single slope must form a linear forest, and the linear arboricity in turn is at least formula_1.
There exist graphs with maximum degree five that have arbitrarily large slope number. However, every graph of maximum degree three has slope number at most four; the result of for the complete graph "K"4 shows that this is tight. Not every set of four slopes is suitable for drawing all degree-3 graphs: a set of slopes is suitable for this purpose if and only it forms the slopes of the sides and diagonals of a parallelogram. In particular, any degree 3 graph can be drawn so that its edges are either axis-parallel or parallel to the main diagonals of the integer lattice. It is not known whether graphs of maximum degree four have bounded or unbounded slope number.
Planar graphs.
As showed, every planar graph has a planar straight-line drawing in which the number of distinct slopes is a function of the degree of the graph. Their proof follows a construction of for bounding the angular resolution of planar graphs as a function of degree, by completing the graph to a maximal planar graph without increasing its degree by more than a constant factor, and applying the circle packing theorem to represent this augmented graph as a collection of tangent circles. If the degree of the initial graph is bounded, the ratio between the radii of adjacent circles in the packing will also be bounded, which in turn implies that using a quadtree to place each graph vertex on a point within its circle will produce slopes that are ratios of small integers. The number of distinct slopes produced by this construction is exponential in the degree of the graph.
Complexity.
It is NP-complete to determine whether a graph has slope number two. From this, it follows that it is NP-hard to determine the slope number of an arbitrary graph, or to approximate it with an approximation ratio better than 3/2.
It is also NP-complete to determine whether a planar graph has a planar drawing with slope number two.

Giandomenico Spinola (1580 – 11 August 1646) was an Italian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.
Early life.
Spinola was born in 1580 in Genoa. Though few records exist detailing his family background or education, he is listed as "Questore" (commissioner) of the Pontifical Office of the Treasury in his home town during the reign of Pope Paul V.
Ecclesiastic career.
Later Spinola moved to Rome where, under the guidance of Archbishop of Genoa, Antonmaria Sauli, he was appointed to a number of administrative church positions.
Spinola was sent to the Archdiocese of Messina to act as administrator in 1625 and upon his return to Rome in 1626 he was elevated to the office of cardinal, with the Basilica of San Clemente as his titular church. He was also named as Protector of his homeland, the Republic of Genoa, becoming its official representative to the Holy See.
In 1629 Spinola was also given the title of Cardinal Priest of the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, holding both until he gave up that of San Clemente on 17 August 1637. In November 1630 he was named the Archbishop of Acerenza and Matera. He was transferred to the episcopal see of Luni-Sarzana on 26 April 1632, retaining the personal rank of archbishop. He was again transferred, this time to the Diocese of Mazara del Vallo in Sicily as of 1 December 1636, still retaining the rank of archbishop.
Between 1642 and 1643 Spinola also served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He participated in the papal conclave of 1644 that elected Pope Innocent X.
Spinola died in Mazara in 1646, and was buried in the Chapel of San Gaetano in the Cathedral of Mazara.

James Lick Baths

The James Lick Baths (also known as the People's Laundry Building and 165 Tenth Street) is a San Francisco city landmark. In 1890 working class residents of San Francisco did not have indoor plumbing. Built in 1890 by the James Lick estate as a free public bath house, it housed a men’s bath with forty bathtubs in changing rooms in the large north wing, and a women’s bath with twenty tubs in changing rooms in the smaller south wing. The James Lick Baths were originally lavish in conception and finish. Water was pumped from the facility’s own wells, heated in boilers in the sunken boiler room, and hot and cold water was pumped into 10,000 gallon tanks in the tower. Bathers could open the taps at each tub in the bathing halls for a customized mix of hot and cold water. After extensive damage in the 1906 earthquake and fire the building was repaired and continued as a bath until 1919. From 1919 until 1973 it was The People’s Laundry, an industrial laundry, followed by a variety of offices, workshops, and stores. The two main bath spaces were divided and circulation in the building became convoluted. A wall at the base of the tower was demolished, leaving one side unsupported. 
The building was designated as a city landmark in 2004. In 2008 Gelfand Partners Architects acquired the building and renovated the ground floor to be its office.

Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante

The Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) is a Quebecer students' union founded in February 2001 in Sherbrooke, which contains about 50,000 CEGEP and university-level students in 25 member student unions throughout Quebec. By its values and positions, the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante positions itself differently from the other province-wide student unions, the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) and the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ).
The ASSÉ forms the core of the Coalition large de l’ASSÉ (CLASSE), a temporary coalition created to counter the tuition hike and coordinate 2012 Quebec student protests.
Philosophy.
The Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante clamors for free education at all levels and for all, abolition of student debt, conservation of quality post-secondary education and the democratization of schools while opposing education commodification.
It considers mass mobilization as a catalyst of social change. It favours local general assemblies as decision-making structures as opposed to referendums, considered less democratic.
It also fights for responsible taxation, minority rights defense, promotes alter-globalization, demilitarization, implementation of public housing policy and the irrevocable right to dissidence.
The basic principles of the ASSÉ lies on the foundations of student unionism as established in Article 1 of the Charter of Grenoble, in 1946. The Charter stipulates that the student is a young intellectual worker. Thus students must be associated on a union basis. The ASSÉ believes in the necessity of fighting to save the gains made by past student movements, as well as to make new gains, through permanent protest. Considering education as a right, rather than as a privilege, the ASSÉ is based on the following principles:
1. For quality, free, accessible, secular, non-discriminatory public education;
2. For adequate financial aid whose aim is to eliminate student debt and to ensure that fundamental needs are met;
3. For a public education network free from private-sector intrusion, including contract manufacturing;
4. For democratization of educational institutions from a perspective of self-management;
5. For union solidarity with all international progressive fights whose aim is society's well-being;
6. Against any and all forms of globalization that support the predominance of profit over the population's well-being 
2005 student strike.
On January 29, 2005, confronted to the refusal from then-Education Minister Pierre Reid to negotiate about financial aid reform, the ASSÉ holds a congress at Cégep de Saint-Laurent where it invites non-member associations to create the CASSÉÉ, the Coalition de l'Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante Élargie. In February, the CASSÉÉ launches a series of referendums and general assemblies over the start of an unlimited general strike around three main demands:
On February 24, 2005, the first associations start the strike movement. On March 16, 2005, 70,000 students are CASSÉE members, out of the 230,000 students on strike at that moment, the others being FEUQ or FECQ members.
The CASSÉÉ is excluded from the negotiation table by the new Education Minister Jean-Marc Fournier because of its refusal to condemn violent acts posed during the strike. The CASSÉÉ, however, claims that it is to divide the student movement that the minister excluded it, since, shortly after the strike began, on February 16, 2005 at Montebello, students assembled by the FEUQ and the FECQ forced Château Montebello's door with a battering ram to disturb a Parti libéral du Québec caucus, leading to a Sûreté du Québec intervention.
The strike ends after the signature of an accord by the student unions and Minister Fournier, that the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante qualifies of a "bargain accord" and is rejected by a majority of general assemblies, who still vote to return to class after 7 weeks of strike.
2012 student strike.
Since summer 2011, the ASSÉ threatened the Quebec government to start an unlimited general strike.
Organizational chart.
Congress.
The congress is the supreme decision-making instance. it is made up of delegates of all member associations and works according to the one member, one vote principle. It normally convenes two or three times a year. In the annual congress, elections to fill the executive positions are held.
Coordination council.
The coordination council aims to coordinate the work of the following instances:
Executive council.
The executive council of the ASSÉ implements the mandates from the congress and the coordination council.
Work committees.
The task of the work committees is to help the executive council and the member associations in their mandates.

Royal-class cruise ship

The "Royal" class cruise ships will be a class of cruise ships operated by Princess Cruises. The lead vessel of the class, "Royal Princess", was delivered in June 2013 for Princess Cruises. A ship similar to the Royal class ships will be operated by P&O Cruises.
History.
In early 2010, Fincantieri and Carnival Corporation & plc reached an agreement to build two ships for Princess Cruises. The agreement is subject to the execution of a definitive contract, financing and other customary conditions.
The contract was then finalized on May 4, 2010. While in the midst of Economic downturn, Princess managed to finalize the contract with the help of Italian Export Credit Companies, particularly SACE S.p.A.
The two ships are designed to have a tonnage of 141,000-GT, with a passenger capacity of 3,600. The new ships are predicted to enter service in Summer 2013 and 2014 and will be the largest newbuilds to date for Princess Cruises. The ships design will be evolutionary, from the current Princess fleet and will offer new innovations in the fleet. 100% of its outside staterooms will have balconies, which will comprise the 80% of all staterooms. The signature Piazza atrium will have an expansion. Other innovations is yet to be unveiled in the upcoming months.
The first of the two ships will become the new "Royal Princess"; the former "Royal Princess" left the Princess fleet in May 2011 when it joined P&O Cruises as MV "Adonia".
In mid-March 2011, Princess released a video of their new "Royal Princess", planned to debut in spring 2013. New features include a cantilevered walkway and bar on the top deck, an enlarged Sanctuary bar, an adult-only pool and the largest Movies Under The Stars screen Princess has built so far.
It was announced on August 29, 2012 that the sister ship to the new "Royal Princess" will be named the "Regal Princess".
On April 9, 2013, Princess announced that Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, would be godmother to "Royal Princess" and would attend its naming ceremony in Southampton, UK, on June 13, 2013.
On 22 September 2013, "Royal Princess" suffered a power outage while sailing between Mykonos and Naples in the Mediterranean. The power failure occurred at 1:30 pm local time and emergency generators kicked in to provide hotel services to the passengers. Prior to the power loss, the anchor motor failed and left 90 feet of anchor hanging for over four hours until a new motor could be installed. It delayed the ship on its trip from Mykonos to Naples. The second half of the cruise was cancelled and all of the passengers were flown home early with flights out of Rome and Naples. The Royal Princess cancelled her visits to Rome, Livorno, Toulon, and sailed directly to Barcelona effecting repairs on the way and embarked her next cruise in Barcelona as planned.
Similar ships.
On 1 June 2011, Carnival Corporation & plc announced an order from Fincantieri for a new 145,000 ton cruise ship for P&O Cruises. The ship, unnamed at the time of the announcement, is to have a capacity of 3,611 people, and will enter service in 2015. According to the P&O Peninsular club magazine, the new ship will have 14 passenger decks and 1,819 cabins. P&O Cruises have also teamed up with British Hotel designers, Richmond International to design the interior of the new ship. On 15 May 2013, the keel of the new ship was laid at the Monfalcone shipyard of Fincantieri near Trieste, in Italy. The keel laying involved the placement in the dry dock of the first section of the ship’s hull. The ceremonial float out took place on the afternoon of the 14 February 2014, with the traditional champagne bottle smashed against the vessels hull.
On 24 September 2013 it was reported that the ship would be named "Britannia".

Jack &amp; Diane (film)

Jack & Diane is a 2012 American romantic horror film written and directed by Bradley Rust Gray, and starring Riley Keough and Juno Temple. Olivia Thirlby and Ellen Page were originally cast for the lead roles in 2008 before the project was postponed.
Plot.
Diane suffers from chronic nosebleeds. She checks herself in a mirror and transforms into a monster before falling unconscious. Earlier, she walks in the streets trying to borrow a cellphone in order to call her twin sister Karen. Having no luck, she enters a clothing store and asks to use a phone. There, she meets a lesbian of her age, Jack, who is clearly smitten by Diane. Diane's nose starts bleeding again and Jack gives her a hand. Jack then takes Diane to a night club. When they get there, Diane seems nauseous, having lost a lot of blood from her nose, and she goes to the restroom. This scene is parallel to the beginning of the film because of the mirror. She gains consciousness, meets up with Jack and the girls ferociously kiss.
By morning, the girls part ways and Jack is uncritically hit by a car. Back at Diane's home, she is reprimanded by her aunt Linda and tells her she is grounded. Diane strikes back by telling her she's not her mother. Both of the girls feel misunderstood back in their homes. Diane visits Jack in her home. Jack confides in Diane about her sentimental cassette tape from her late brother. One day, Jack visits Diane in her home where the girls get into an argument when Linda intentionally tells Jack about Diane leaving for school in France.
After Jack leaves her, Diane suffers from desolation and she starts to unravel. Meanwhile, Jack hangs out with a lesbian, Tara, with whom she works. They have an intimate moment but Jack rebuffs her shortly thereafter. The next day, Diane hangs out with one of Jack's friend, Chris, and Jack is startled. The girls play a game where whoever wins would get to stay. Jack wins and Diane is forced to go home. Jack gets back to Chris where he finds a video of Diane's sister Karen getting raped on an adult website. Feeling sorry for her sister, Jack finally reconciles with Diane in her home.
Over the next few days, the girls finally spend a lot of romantic time with one another. One night, Jack has a dream of Diane transforming into a monster and devouring her heart. She wakes up only to find Diane on her side with blood gushing out of her nose. As the days narrow down before Diane leaves for school, the bond between the two girls starts to turn debilitated. The girls go to a locker room where the lights suddenly go off. Afraid of the dark, Jack seeks help from Diane whom she had given a polaroid camera before the lights went off. The couple are separated and Diane searches for Jack by flashing through her camera. Diane encounters the same monster from earlier, and she is found sobbing by Jack. The two girls console each other, finally letting go of their fears. Jack goes to see Diane on her last day before she departs for school and the girls' relationship is compromised.
After a few weeks, Diane receives a gift from Jack which is revealed to be the sentimental cassette tape from Jack's late brother. She turns the song on and listens to it profoundly, reminiscing about her encounter with Jack.
Relation to the song.
The John Mellencamp song "Jack & Diane" is not used as a soundtrack for the film. The only known similarity between the song and the film is that they both happen to be about teenagers in love (although the song is about a teenage boy named Jack and a teenage girl named Diane, whereas in the film, they are both girls).
Reception.
"Jack & Diane" received mixed to negative reviews; it currently holds a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 45/100 rating on Metacritic, signifying "mixed or average reviews".

Life Is Beautiful (2012 film)

Life Is Beautiful is a 2012 Telugu film written, produced and directed by Sekhar Kammula. The film stars six newcomers with Shriya Saran, Anjala Zaveri and Amala Akkineni in key roles. The movie was jointly produced by Sekhar Kammula and Chandrasekhar Kammula under Amigos Creations banner. Soundtrack of the film was composed by Mickey J Meyer and the cinematography was handled by Vijay C. Kumar.

The official synopsis for "Life Is Beautiful" says, "It is a coming of age story of six youngsters, set in the beautiful nostalgic world of a working-middle class neighborhood. The film tracks their journey through the different seasons, festivals, romances, street cricket, colony fights, and family gatherings. With the beginning of responsibilities, and adulthood looming around the corner, their dreams and aspirations bring them all together, to make the whole experience magical. Life is Beautiful is a story about new beginnings. It is a celebration of life and its smaller joys." 
Production.
In August 2010, reports emerged that Sekhar Kammula registered the title "Life Is Beautiful" at the film chamber and would make the movie with Varun Sandesh. Seven months after his movie Leader was released, Sekhar officially announced that his next project was titled "Life Is Beautiful" and would star newcomers. On 3 September 2010, he announced a star hunt in association with Vodafone India and Radio Mirchi that would help him find the lead actors for the movie. In April 2011, it was announced that after almost 8 months of auditions and casting, the lead cast was finalized. After multiple delays, filming finally began in June 2011. In February 2012, it was reported that one of the film’s lead actress walked out of the project after shooting for almost six months.

On 6 July 2012, a press meet was held in Hyderabad where the cast was introduced and the first look of the film was launched.
Release.
Although initial reports suggested that the film would release in early 2012, delays in filming and production pushed back the film release. In July 2012, it was announced that the film would release in August. The film was released worldwide on 14 September 2012 with premiers shows in USA on 13 September.
Pre-release revenues.
In October 2011, it was announced that Ficus Inc had acquired the overseas theatrical distribution rights of the film. It was reported that the satellite rights of the film were sold to MAA TV for 3.5 crores.
Critical reception.
The film received mixed reviews, many critics compared the film to Sekhar's previous film "Happy Days". DNA India wrote:"Sekhar Kammula has delivered again with Life is Beautiful. Yes, the film is a bit too long and there are many scenes that could have been edited out or even shot better — but all said and done... the three-hour long tale leaves you smiling, gushing and crying at several intervals. You leave the theatre feeling better about the world and thankful for the smallest joys in life — which we think is more than what Sekhar Kammula could have asked for". CNN-IBN wrote:"The plot lacked continuity and was heading in different directions before finally arriving at a cliched climax". Oneindia wrote:"It has a good story and performances but suffers from dragging narration". 123telugu wrote:"A brilliant performance from Amala in the climax and a few good scenes are the film’s assets. Bad screenplay, excessive length and lack of entertainment will work against the film". Idlebrain wrote:"The plus points are Sekhar’s trade mark beautiful moments, casting, dialogues, direction and a strong mother sentiment. On the flip side, a better background music and shorter runtime would have helped the film further. On a whole, Life is Beautiful is a good movie".
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film was composed by Mickey J Meyer. Mickey previously worked with Sekhar for Happy Days and Leader. The audio of the film was released on 27 July 2012 at Marriott Hotel in Hyderabad through Aditya Music label. Lyrics for the songs were penned by Anantha Sreeram and Vanamali. The music premier of the album was held at Radio Mirchi where the songs were played for the first time for public hearing.

Canabalt

Canabalt is a side-scrolling endless runner video game developed by Adam Saltsman for the Experimental Gameplay Project. It has been released on iOS, Commodore 64, PlayStation Portable, Android, Ouya and various Flash based online gaming websites, such as Kongregate.
"Canabalt" has been credited with inventing the endless runner sub-genre, although others have argued the genre originated with the 1983 game "B.C.'s Quest for Tires".
Gameplay.
The player controls an unnamed man fleeing from an unknown threat. As the game begins, the player character jumps from the window of an office building onto the roof of a neighbouring building. He then proceeds to run forward automatically, continually accelerating as he moves. The only control the player has over the character is through a single button, which makes him jump; either from building to building or over obstacles. Missing a jump to another building will cause him to fall to his death, while colliding with a crate or an office chair will reduce his speed. Bombs are also occasionally dropped into the player's path, causing death if not avoided. 
Unlike many other platform games which have predesigned stages and can be played to completion, the landscape of "Canabalt" is procedurally generated and endless. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score, measured in meters per run. Some version of the game feature online leaderboards, allowing players to compete for ranking.
Development.
In a 2013 interview with "The New Yorker", developer Adam Saltsman said he had initially aimed for the game to be "fast, like a racing game." He also explained that the player character wears a black suit so that he would stand out from the greyscale background art. The name ""Canabalt"" was derived from a combination of phrases used by Saltsman's young nephew.
Originally released in Flash on Saltsman's own web site, the game has since been ported to many platforms including iOS, PlayStation Portable, Android, Ouya and the Chrome Web Store, and is also featured on online gaming sites such as Kongregate and Newgrounds. The official Android/Ouya port is published by Kittehface Software, primarily a publisher of live wallpapers, under license from Saltsman. The PlayStation Portable version is published by Beatshapers.
History.
The source code of "Canabalt" was released by Saltsman in 2010. The engine specific code was released under an MIT License and the game code under a proprietary license. One year later, Saltsman concluded that commercially, this had proved a non-harmful step.
In 2011, "Canabalt" was ported to the Commodore 64 home computer by Paul Koller. This official conversion became available as a cartridge in January 2012. In March 2012, "Canabalt" was included in the "Humble Bundle for Android 2".
Reception and impact.
"Canabalt" has met with positive reviews. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on eight reviews, and 85.62% on GameRankings, also based on eight reviews. The PSP version holds a score of 72.14% on GameRankings, based on seven reviews
Bonnie Eisenman of 148Apps scored the iOS version 4 out of 5, writing ""Canabalt" is a gem that daringly mixes simple gameplay with an incredibly complex world, proving that minimalism doesn't have to equal minimal entertainment. If you're looking for a simple, quick-play game, this is one to buy." TouchGen's Torbjorn Kamblad also scored it 4 out of 5, arguing that the iOS version improved on the original Flash version; "Tighter controls, and a better overview of your surroundings make the portable version a classic." TouchArcade's Eli Hodapp scored it 5 out of 5, comparing the game to "Doodle Jump"; "I've probably sunk more combined hours in to "Doodle Jump" than any other game on my iPhone, and "Canabalt" has the exact same appeal. The pixel art graphics are great, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and [...] it's hard to find anything not to like about the game."
IGN's Levi Buchanan scored the game 8 out of 10; ""Canabalt" is a wonderful twitch game that strikes the right balance between skill and luck [...] There is something really compelling in here -- a real desire to play again and again...and again." Pocket Gamer's Keith Andrew scored it 7 out of 10, calling it "a fun little ditty, beautifully presented, but one where success is as much down to luck as it is any skill. That's no doubt all the developers intended, but the sheer addictiveness of play suggests any follow-up that adds a more structure could give it a serious run for its money." Slide to Play's Andrew Podolsky scored it 3 out of 4, praising the game, but criticizing the $2.99 price; "The nearly-flawless execution of one simple idea makes the lack of a story or any other depth inconsequential, but we [...] think this game would be better priced at a dollar, especially since the original Flash game is still free to play as well."
Pocket Gamer's Peter Willington scored the PSP version 7 out of 10. He criticized the lack on online leaderboards, but concluded that ""Canabalt" for PSP deserves a place on your memory stick. It has a hidden depth that the hardcore will appreciate immensely, and it's built in such a way that more casual gamers can dip into it quickly between games of more substance."
The game was listed among the best of 2009 by numerous video game websites, including Rock, Paper, Shotgun and Eurogamer. It went on to spawn a genre of "endless running" games; "The New Yorker" described "Canabalt" as "a video game that has sparked an entirely new genre of play for mobile phones," going on to discuss how it resurrected a style of game not seen since 1983's "B.C.'s Quest for Tires". Derivative titles include "Robot Unicorn Attack", which Kieron Gillen described in his "2010 Game of the Year" piece for Eurogamer, as a "shameless "Canabalt" clone." Similarly, in Joystiq's review of Halfbrick Studios' "Jetpack Joyride", Ben Gilbert argued that ""Doom" is to "Halo", as "Canabalt" is to "Jetpack Joyride"."
In May 2011, Lewis Denby of "PC Gamer" placed it at #13 in his list of "20 free PC games you must play." In November 2012, "Canabalt" was included in an exhibit on video games at the Museum of Modern Art.

Solar power in Delaware

Solar power in Delaware is supported by a 30% federal tax credit, available through 2016. In a 2012 study, a typical 5 kW system will pay for itself in 5 years, and go on to provide a savings of $37,837 over the balance of its 25 year life. It is estimated that 19% of all electricity use in Delaware can be provided by rooftop solar panels. The state's renewable portfolio standard requires 0.4% from solar in 2012, 0.6% in 2013, 3.5% from solar by 2025, and 25% from renewable sources. 
Net metering is available for residential customers up to 25 kW and others from 100 kW to 2 MW depending on type of customer and the utility. Excess generation is credited at retail rate to next months bill and optionally paid once a year at energy supply rate (normally referred to as "avoided cost"). Best practices recommend no limits, either individual or aggregate, and perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits, and not converting to a monetary value. Allowing optional payment once a year, either at avoided cost or retail, allows a mechanism of providing for the case where the system installed is larger than needed.

<doc id="36546653" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36546653" title="CFL on NBC">
CFL on NBC

CFL on NBC is a "de facto" branding for the Canadian Football League games that have been carried on American broadcaster NBC or its sports network, NBCSN.
Background.
NBC's first run broadcasting Canadian football involved coverage of a collection of Big Four/IRFU (the predecessor to the CFL's East Division) games and the Grey Cup in 1954. NBC's coverage during this period (simulcasting the Canadian national broadcaster) provided far more coverage than the NFL's existing contract with DuMont. NBC aired games on Saturday afternoons, competing against college football broadcasts on CBS and ABC (at the time, college football telecasts were far more restricted than they would be in later decades). The revenue from the contract allowed the IRFU to directly compete against the NFL for players during the 1950s; the American viewership arguably prompted the league to finally raise the point value of touchdowns from 5 points to 6, as it has been in the American game since 1912, in 1956, and to play some exhibition and regular season games in the United States beginning in 1957. Interest in the CFL in the United States faded dramatically after the debut of the American Football League in 1960.
Between 1955 and 1980, only one game was televised on U.S. television, the 1962 Grey Cup (which was broadcast by ABC).
NBC (with the exception of its northernmost affiliates) broadcast games in the CFL for three weeks during the 1982 NFL players' strike The first week of broadcasts featured the "NFL on NBC" broadcast teams, before a series of blowout games on the network and the resulting low ratings resulted in NBC cutting back and eventually cancelling its CFL coverage. (At the time, ESPN held the U.S. broadcast rights, who sublicensed them to NBC during the strike; rights reverted to ESPN after the experiment failed.)
In 2008, when NBCSN was known as Versus and not yet under the same corporate umbrella as NBC, it aired the 96th Grey Cup.
The Canadian Football League entered into a much more generous contract with the America One television network that had run from 2001 through 2009. That contract allowed for the majority of CFL games to be televised in the United States, with America One syndicating the Canadian coverage (from TSN or, prior to 2008, CBC) primarily to regional sports networks. A number of factors led to America One not renewing their contract after the 2009 season. On July 1, 2010, NFL Network began airing live Canadian Football League games, again simulcasting TSN. This much more limited package did not include any games in August (during the NFL preseason), any playoff games, the Labour Day Classic (one of the Labour Day games was carried in 2011 but not the other), Thanksgiving Day Classic, or the Grey Cup. NFL Network aired Thursday games, three Saturday games in July, and then Friday night games beginning again in September (after ArenaBowl XXIII; NFL Network also held rights to the Arena Football League and aired a weekly game on Friday nights). NFL Network announced it would not renew its deal with the CFL on May 25, 2012.
The package was picked up by NBCSN starting on Monday August 27, 2012 with 14 games total broadcast on NBC Sports Network including 9 regular season games (including both Labour Day Classic games) and all of the playoffs and Grey Cup. NBC renewed its deal with the CFL shortly before the 2013 regular season, but the deal scales back the network's playoff coverage (the network will not air the first round games and will only air the conference finals on tape delay). The 2013 U.S. TV schedule will feature 11 regular season games live (including the lone Labour Day Classic contest), three tape-delayed contests in October (including the displaced Toronto-Hamilton Thanksgiving Day Classic, which will air at midnight the Wednesday after), and the Grey Cup live.
In an oddity, NBCSN only owned the traditional television rights to the league, while another network owned the Internet rights; ESPN3 has carried CFL games on the Internet since 2008. (ESPN Inc., ESPN3's parent company, holds a minority stake in TSN.) The CFL granted exclusive broadcast and Internet rights to ESPN in a multinational, five-year deal prior to the 2014 season, ending NBCSN's involvement with the league until at least 2019.

Three Husbands

Three Husbands is a 1951 American film directed by Irving Reis.
Plot summary.
When a recently deceased playboy, Max, gets to heaven, he is granted a wish. His request: to watch his three best friends, with whom he regularly played poker, for the next 24 hours. That day, each man would receive a letter; tomorrow, Max's will is to be read. Each letter states that he had an affair with that man's wife, all of with whom he was close. With one, Max attended Friday symphony matinees and had tea afterwards; with another, he went to night clubs and taught French; the last, he repeatedly hired as his nurse through his long battle with heart disease.
Each husband reacts differently, as does each wife when she discovers that something has happened to make her husband distrust her. At the end of the 24 hours, each couple declares their intention to divorce, mistrust and disbelief having split each relationship. The lawyer reads the will, stating that Max's great fortune has been left to the three wives, as he believes that marriage is stronger when a wife is not dependent on her husband. It states in his will that Max wrote the letters to show each of his friends how much his wife was worth, as each had begun to take her for granted; he believed that jealousy was the perfect motivator to make someone re-appreciate something/someone.
Each wife reiterates her intention to divorce; each husband apologizes and begs her to reconsider. The three couples all reconcile, everyone grateful for having had Max and for his final gift to them - each other.

Gameplay.
Players control a young member of a cave-dwelling faction of humans as they try to harness energy back into the dying planet that the surface-dwelling humans take for granted. Explorers and adventures want to raid these mystic rooms inside the "dungeons" that the cave-dwellers refer to their homes.
As players freely explore their surroundings, they can manipulate the walls to make the necessary mystic rooms that are important to winning the game. Monsters can be summoned and upgraded by simply channelling pure energy into the Earth. Magical spells from creatures who can use magic in addition to weapons from the warrior-caste monsters are used to defeat the greedy explorers and adventurers from the overworld. After creating a certain amount of energy, the player simply moves on to the next level. Spirit rooms play a role in being able to summon more advanced creatures and acquiring the other resources necessary to playing this game. Bonuses and upgrades are granted to player upon accomplishing certain feng shui-related tasks.
Certain non-player characters may help or hinder players depending on their actions throughout the game.

Pavel Sevyarynets

Pavel Sevyarynets is a Belarusian activist and dissident. He served as the leader of the pro-democracy organization Young Front. 
On 1 June 2005, he was sentenced to three years of correctional labor after protesting the controversial referendum amending Belarus's constitution to allow President Alexander Lukashenko a third term in office. The U.S. protested the sentence, calling it a "parody of justice", and the European Union stated that "even by the standards of Belarus, this is an excessive penalty". A later amnesty reduced his sentence to one year.
Sevyarynets faced a new series of charges in 2007. In May, he was released from a prison sentence for "organizing an unsanctioned rally". In July, a court found him and fellow activist Aleksey Shein guilty of "distributing illegal literature" after they were found leaflets for a political meeting. On 19 August, Sevyarynets was arrested with other youth activists during a Brest book reading at which he discussed his three books. The group were detained for "participating in an unsanctioned meeting" and were also accused of possessing counterfeit money and Ukrainian liquor. 
Sevyarynets later became a co-leader of the Belarusian Christian Democracy party. In December 2010, he was arrested again on charges related to protests against Lukashenko's disputed re-election. On 16 May 2011, he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience.

Pinto Dam

Pinto Dam is a dam in Grant County, Washington.
The dam was a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, completed from 1946 through 1948 as one element of the vast Columbia Basin Project for irrigation water storage, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. Pinto Dam is an earthen structure, 130 feet high and 1900 feet long at its crest, that provides offstream storage of water. 
The six-mile-long crescent-shaped reservoir it creates, Billy Clapp Lake, was originally called Long Lake Reservoir, but was renamed for one of the sponsors of the project, a lawyer from Ephrata, Washington. The lake offers year-round fishing for yellow perch, crappie, rainbow trout, and walleye. The Stratford Wildlife Recreation Area borders Billy Clapp Lake on its eastern shore and hosts migrating waterfowl. Another sizable lake, Brook Lake, also stands below the dam.

Misicuni Dam

The Misicuni Multiple Project, better known as the Misicuni Dam, is a project under construction on the Misicuni River northwest of the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia. 
Characteristics and costs.
The project has three components:
The dam will be the highest and largest dam in Bolivia. Misicuni project director Ramiro Saniz said in 2009 that the water from the Misicuni river is not sufficient to fill the reservoir and that other sources are needed.
Background and construction progress.
The public company in charge of developing the project is Proyecto Misicuni, an entity created by law in 1987. The contractor for the US$ 90 million dam component is the "Consorcio Hidroelectrico Misicuni" (CHM). The Misicuni consortium, led with 51 percent ownership by Grandi Lavori Fincosit S.p.A. of Italy, was the sole bidder for the project. Bidding was limited to Italian companies and CHM was the only company to submit a bid. The consortium also includes Bolivian, Colombian and Venezuelan firms. 
The dam component was expected to be completed in 2014. However, in November 2013 the contract was canceled amid delays because CHM "failed to pay for pension funds, health insurances and other labour benefits and to contract key technical personnel." 
Benefits.
The tunnel provides 4.5-7.5 million cubic meters of water per year to Cochabamba since 2005, depending on whether the flow of the river is low or high and supplying about 10 percent of the city's drinking water. Once the dam will be completed, the amount of drinking water available will increase tenfold to 63 million cubic meters per year.
Environmental and social impact.
1365 people live in the reservoir area that will be flooded and will be relocated. The Tunari National Park will also be affected.
Financing.
The dam is partially financed by the Italian government through a 25 million Euro loan and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF). Total funding from Italy for Phased II and III is USD 93 million. Bolivia will have to pay back the loan over in 20 years with a 0.10% interest rate.
The construction of the penstock, hydropower plant and power transmission line is funded by a US$ 101 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank approved in 2009. These works were expected to be completed by 2015, but were only 30 percent completed as of April 2013.

Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language for the Use of Children

Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language for the Use of Children (also known as "Divine and Moral Songs for Children" and other similar titles) is a collection of didactic, moralistic poetry for children by Isaac Watts, first published in 1715. Though Watts's hymns are now better known than these poems, "Divine Songs" was a ubiquitous children's book for nearly two hundred years, serving as a standard textbook in schools. By the mid-1800s there were more than one thousand editions.
Three of the best-known poems in the collection are "Praise for Creation and Providence", "Against Idleness and Mischief", and "The Sluggard". 
"Praise for Creation and Providence" (better known as "I sing the mighty power of God") is now a hymn sung by all ages. "Against Idleness and Mischief" and "The Sluggard" (better known as "How doth the little busy bee" and "'Tis the voice of the sluggard") were both meant to teach children the importance of hard work, and were extremely well known in the nineteenth century. Walter de la Mare wrote that "a childhood without the busy bee and the sluggard would resemble a hymnal without ‘O God, our help in ages past’." Charles Dickens's novels occasionally quote "Against Idleness and Mischief"; for instance, in his 1850 novel "David Copperfield", the school master Dr. Strong quotes lines 11-12: "Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do." In his 1865 fantasy "Alice in Wonderland", Lewis Carroll parodies both "Against Idleness and Mischief" as "How Doth the Little Crocodile" and "The Sluggard" as "'Tis the voice of the Lobster".

Charles M. Gurganus

Major General Charles Mark M. Gurganus was a U.S. Marine major general who commanded Regional Command Southwest and I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward) in Afghanistan. Prior to that, he was commander of the I Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, California.
Education.
Gurganus graduated from the University of North Carolina, and was commissioned in May 1976. After The Basic School, he served as a Rifle Platoon Commander and Company Executive Officer in 2d Battalion, 1st Marines (1977–1979).
Military career.
Gurganus commanded both Special Purpose MAGTF-8 in Haiti and Regimental Combat Team 8 in Anbar Province, Iraq in various capacities from 2005–2008.
From 2010–2011, he was Commander, US Marine Corps Forces Korea and U/C/J-5 (Strategy) of United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea (2009–2011) at Yongsan Garrison in Seoul.
His medals include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legions of Merit with V device, and a gold star (in lieu of a second award).
Following the September 2012 Camp Bastion Raid, General Gurganus and other members of the base's military leadership have come under investigation for negligence. Some guard towers at the base were manned by dummies. Two US service members, Lt. Col. Christopher Raible and Sgt. Bradley Atwell, were killed by enemy rocket fire in the attack. Raible was the commander of the Harrier squadron attached to the base. The entire Harrier squadron was destroyed or rendered combat ineffective as a result of the raid, making the attack the largest hit on US airpower since the Vietnam War.
On September 30, 2013, Major General Gurganus was asked to retire, along with the Marine Major General who commanded the aviation arm at Camp Bastion, Gregg A. Sturdevant (who was censured by the Secretary of the Navy), and both complied. They will both be honorably discharged and will receive full pay, pension, and benefits. Before the investigation, Major General Gurganus had been nominated for a third star as Marine Corps Chief of Staff at the Pentagon; the appointment and the possibility of promotion to lieutenant general have now been rescinded.
Other assignments.
Other operational assignments included assistant Operations Officer, Rifle Company Commander, and Weapons Company Commander with 3d Battalion, 6th Marines (1984–1987); Commanding Officer, 3d Battalion, 6th Marines and G-7, 2d Marine Division (1995–1997); G-3 Current Operations Officer, III Marine Expeditionary Force (2001–2002); Deputy Commander, 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (2002–2003); Commanding Officer, 8th Marine Regiment (2003–2005); Commanding Officer, Regimental Combat Team 8 (March 2005 – August 2005) in Al Anbar Province, Iraq; Operations Officer, 2d Marine Division; Assistant Division Commander, 2d Marine Division (2006–2008).

Solar power in Pennsylvania

Solar power in Pennsylvania is estimated to be capable of providing 12% of electricity used in Pennsylvania, using 20,000 MW of solar panels. A renewable portfolio standard requires 0.0325% from photovoltaics in 2012, 
0.051% in 2013, and 0.5% by 2020.
Net metering is available to all residential customers up to 50 kW and others up to at least 3 MW. Excess generation is credited at retail rate to customers next bill, and paid annually at "price-to-compare" (normally referred to as "avoided cost"). Best practices call for no limits (other than to customer's service entrance rating), and perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits, instead of converting to a monetary credit. Annual reconciliation can create problems as annual generation for wind and solar inherently varies from year to year, and during the year large credit surpluses can accrue that would be later consumed, which is why perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits is recommended. Converting to a monetary credit is not recommended because electric rates change over time. In the event that the generation installed is larger than needed to meet local demand, an optional compensation is more practical than a mandatory method, even if the compensation is at retail.
The Pennsylvania Sunshine Solar Program is a program to provide $100 million in funding for solar projects. Projects must be completed by June 1, 2013.

Under first-year head coach Mike Cavan and ten years after the NCAA's 1987 "death penalty" on SMU football, SMU finished the 1997 season with a 6–5 record and completed their first winning season since the football program resumed operations in 1989.
Personnel.
Mike Cavan succeeded Tom Rossley as SMU head coach. Rossley coached SMU from 1991 to 1996 and left with a 15–48–3 record. Cavan became SMU's third head coach in the post-"death penalty" era for SMU.

Head coach Mike Cavan returned for his second season leading SMU, following a 6–5 season in 1997, SMU's first winning season since the NCAA's "death penalty" that shut down SMU football for two years starting in 1987. SMU finished the season 5–7 (4–4 WAC), but SMU vacated 10 games after a player was found to have been ineligible due to academic fraud.

NFL Draft.
Two members of the 1998 SMU squad were selected in the 1999 NFL Draft. Defensive back Donald Mitchell was selected in the fourth round and 117th overall by the Tennessee Titans. Defensive back Coby Rhinehart was selected in the sixth round and 190th overall by the Arizona Cardinals.
Steve Malin controversy.
Twelve years after the NCAA "death penalty" that caused the SMU football program to shut down for two years, SMU encountered another scandal. SMU notified the NCAA of possible recruiting violations in early August 1999 and subsequently suspended defensive line coach Steve Malin. On November 7, 1999, "The Dallas Morning News" reported that former SMU football player Corlin Donaldson alleged that Malin paid another person $100 to take Donaldson's ACT exam in 1998 so that Donaldson would be eligible to attend SMU. Although Donaldson described this account to NCAA investigators, Donaldson recanted this story under pressure from Malin to save Malin's job. Following an internal investigation, SMU fired Malin on December 8, 1999; Malin had been suspended that year since August 3 without a replacement at his position. Additionally, SMU removed one assistant coach from recruiting roles for the 2000 season, reduced a total of 8 scholarships for the 2000 and 2001 seasons, and reduced a total of 16 official campus visits for high school recruits for those seasons as well. SMU also submitted a report to the NCAA.
On December 13, 2000, the NCAA placed SMU on two years' probation and vacated ten games from SMU's 1998 season in which Donaldson played, which reduced SMU's record to 1-1 for 1998. SMU's 2005 media guide indicates that the NCAA vacated the first ten games of the 1998 season. The NCAA reported that its infractions committee "concluded that the assistant football coach initially suggested that the prospective student-athlete [Donaldson should participate in academic fraud, actively assisted in the initial fraudulent ACT, had actual knowledge of the fraud in the second ACT and finally, had reason to know that the prospect, after enrolling at the university and becoming a student-athlete, was ineligible to compete by reason of the academic fraud." Additionally, the NCAA also discovered rules violations regarding recruiting and tryouts dating back to 1995. The NCAA also extended SMU's self-imposed restrictions on coaches' off-campus recruiting to the 2001 season and limited official visits for high school recruits to 38 for the 2001–02 school year. Malin also was assessed a seven-year show-cause penalty.

Edith Anne Robertson

Edith Anne Robertson (1883–1973) was a Scottish poet who wrote in both the English and Scots tongues.
Biography.
Edith Anne Stewart was the daughter of a United Free Church of Scotland minister, born in Glasgow in 1883. Her family lived in Germany and in Surrey, England, during her childhood.
In 1919 she married James Alexander Robertson of Aberdeen, also the child of a Free Church Minister. They moved to Aberdeen, where James obtained a position as Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at the United Free Church College in Aberdeen. He wrote a number of well-received works on the New Testament, and was said to have been an effective preacher.
In 1938 James was appointed Professor of Biblical Criticism at the University of Aberdeen. He remained there until he was forced to retire in 1945 due to poor health.
James Alexander Robertson died in 1955. Edith lived on for almost twenty years.
Work.
Edith Anne Robertson's work reflects her strong belief in Christianity and her interest in the culture and language of the north east of Scotland.
In 1930 she published "Carmen Jesu Nazereni", a verse version of the gospels. She also published a life of Francis Xavier. 
Later she published two collections of poems by Walter de la Mare and Gerard Manley Hopkins that she had translated into the Scots language.
She corresponded with many literary figures including Marion Angus, David Daiches, Flora Garry, Nan Shepherd, Douglas Young and Samuel Beckett.
Her poem "The Scots Tongue" (1955) gives her thoughts on the language that she loved:
In 1953 Douglas Young wrote to Edith Anne Robertson of her "Voices" that it was "a truly astonishing challenge to those who think the Lallans incapable of conveying thought (as E. Muir incautiously maintained in 'Scott and Scotland') and incapable of expressing subtleties of feeling (as MacCraig too often assents). Moreover it does fill the gap I emphasised (in my Nelson anthology), when I remarked on the comparative lack of mystical verse in Scots."
A critic wrote in the "Scottish international Review" that "in verse, Edith Anne Robertson used a supple and graceful Scots, carrying a large vocabulary with apparent ease in well-varied metres."

What Do You See? (就在这里 in Mandarin) is a song by Singaporean band Electrico. It was commissioned as the official theme song for the 2009 National Day Parade. The song is one of the few National Day parade theme songs that does not mentions the word ""Singapore"" in its lyrics.
Music video.
Directed by Bertrand Lee, the music video opens with a bokeh and later sharpens to reveal band member David Tan. The camera then traces him around the downtown core of Singapore at dawn as he walk past activities of daily life. He ends up at Marina Barrage by morning, performing with the band for the song's finale.

Aksha, Sudan

Aksha is an ancient Egyptian temple, rebuilt in part at the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum. The temple was built around 1250 BC by Ramses II. It is situated in the far north of present-day Sudan, a few kilometers south of Faras, on the west side of the Nile. On the temple walls, several sacrifices are depicted. The location of the temple was not well chosen, as it is only a few inches above the high tide of the Nile. This resulted in penetration of the lower wall layers, salt crystallization on the wall surfaces, and stones being worn down over the centuries. In addition, the temple was preyed upon by the local population. Other finds at the site include cemeteries, parts of Qubanstele, and the stele with the "blessings of Ptah".
The1963 excavations of Aksha were initiated because of the construction of the Aswan Dam. One of the discoveries included a relatively well-preserved temple wall, the western wall of the courtyard. Along its entire length, it contains a carved list of the foreign nations which Ramses II. After the temple was deemed worthy of preservation, archaeologists from the University of Ghana sawed the wall into individual blocks. It was rebuilt in the garden of the National Museum, protected by a pavilion.

Troy Carter (music industry)

Troy Carter is an American music manager who is the founder, chairman and CEO of Coalition Media Group, a talent management and full-service film and television production company. Born and raised in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Carter began his career in the music industry working for companies such as Overbrook Entertainment and Bad Boy Records, eventually co-founding his own management company, Erving Wonder. In 2007, he founded Coalition Media Group, and in 2010, founded its management division Atom Factory. Since then, Carter has established the careers of numerous recording artists, mostly notably that of multi-platinum Grammy Award-winning artist Lady Gaga.
Life and career.
1972–1998: Early life and career beginnings.
Troy Carter was born on November 14, 1972 and was raised in West Philadelphia, attending Huey Elementary and Sayre Middle School. At the age of two, Carter's parents divorced. At the age of 7, his father, who had remarried, shot and killed his new wife's brother after an argument, serving a prison sentence of 12 years. Despite this, his father and step-mother stayed together, and after prison his father rebuilt his life, with Carter calling him "one of my real heroes."
Due to his mother frequently working at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Carter would spend much of his time at his grandmother's house. Down the block from his grandmother lived Lawrence Goodman, who had started a label named Pop Art Records, which had signed artists such as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince as well as Salt-N-Pepa, who he would see Goodman bringing around the neighborhood frequently. Carter cites this as his first inspiration for wanting to join the music business, stating, "That was my first real experience of 'Wow, this is really cool what he's doing, whatever he's doing.'"
In 1990, at the age of 17, Carter dropped out of West Philadelphia High School in pursuit of a career in the music industry with his high school rap group 2 Too Many, eventually being signed by Will Smith and James Lassiter to their label WilJam Records. After the group lost their contract after a year, 2 Too Many disbanded and Carter then went on to work both for DJ Jazzy Jeff in the studio and for Lassiter as a personal assistant. 5 years later, at age 23, Carter was promoting rap concerts around Philadelphia for artists such as The Notorious B.I.G. It was through this that he met record producer Sean Combs, who hired Carter as an intern for Bad Boy Records in New York City for a year and a half.
After Carter's internship at Bad Boy had ended, he then moved to Los Angeles in order to work with James Lassiter again, only to be fired and sent back to Philadelphia. According to Lassiter, his decision was largely influenced by his beliefs that Carter had started to exhibit an entitled attitude, saying, "I would constantly talk to him about it, about work ethic and starting at the bottom and working his way up. When he rejected it, I told him to go back to West Philly. He had to go back and experience this for himself, and come out on the other side." For the next several years, Carter struggled trying to find success in Philadelphia, citing it as one of his "darkest times."
1999–present: career.
After several years of working in Philadelphia, it was in 1999 that Carter met then-emerging rap artist Eve in Germantown, being asked by the performer to be her manager. In addition, Carter began managing other rap acts such as Nelly and Floetry. The same year, Carter teamed up with Jay Erving, son of retired basketball player Julius Erving, and co-founded the talent management company Erving Wonder.
In 2003, Carter moved back to Los Angeles and helped Eve get her own show on UPN. The following year, Carter and Erving sold Erving Wonder to British-based firm Sanctuary, with Carter serving as the company's executive vice president. Over the next two years, Erving Wonder's deal with Sanctuary fell apart, Eve fired him, and by 2006, Carter not only lost all the money from the Sanctuary deal, but he was severely in debt, with his house being foreclosed on and his car being repossessed. 
As Carter was facing eviction from his home, record producer Vincent Herbert, who had just left Universal Records, introduced Carter to a new client, then-unknown Lady Gaga, who had just been dropped from Def Jam Records. For the next year, Carter, Herbert, and Gaga went around California, performing at multiple clubs each night with both little money and little support. It was also in 2007 that Carter founded Coalition Media Group, and its management division Atom Factory in 2010. In 2011, he co-founded The Backplane, a Silicon Valley-based startup that attempts to "redefine social media" by allowing celebrities and brands to "connect with fans, foster community, and cultivate brand loyalty". It was also in 2011 that Carter received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special for his work on the HBO special , sharing the nomination with Lady Gaga, Vincent Herbert, Jimmy Iovine, and Mo Morrison. The following year, he created A \ IDEA, a product development and branding agency, as well as AF Square, an angel fund and technology consultancy with investments in over 40 startups including Spotify, Warby Parker, Songza, Dropbox, Fab, Uber, etc.
Since signing Lady Gaga in 2007, Carter has gone on to manage numerous other artists such as John Legend, Greyson Chance, Mindless Behavior, Priyanka Chopra, Lindsey Stirling, and The Ceremonies.
He is a member of the 2012 Class of Henry Crown Fellows at The Aspen Institute.
He is on the board of advisors of 'opinion-network' start-up State (website).
Personal life.
Carter is currently married to Rebecca. In 2012, The two reportedly raised millions of dollars for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

Blackberry Hill

Blackberry Hill is a series of quarries and outcrops in Central Wisconsin that is notable for its large concentration of trace fossils in Cambrian rocks. One quarry in particular, located in Marathon County, also has the distinction of preserving some of the first land animals. The site is a prolific Cambrian Konservat-Lagerstätte. It includes three-dimensional casts of soft bodied and lightly scleritized invertebrates and a variety of exceptionally preserved types of trace fossils.
Age and stratigraphic placement.
The strata at Blackberry Hill are known to belong to the Elk Mound Group; however, the lack of good stratigraphic markers (i.e., index fossils) in some Blackberry Hill localities, coupled with uncertainties about the age range of the Elk Mound Group itself, make it difficult to assign a precise age to these strata. Many researchers consider these rocks to be Late Cambrian, which is the age to which the Elk Mound Group was originally assigned;however, some recent authors now believe the Elk Mound Group and the fossils of Blackberry Hill could date back to the Middle Cambrian, based on certain fossils obtained from other areas.
Geological and environmental setting.
Most of the strata are composed of well bedded quartz sandstone and orthoquartzite. They were deposited mainly on intertidal and supratidal sand flats along the southern shoreline of the supercontinent Laurentia. Ripple marks and numerous other sedimentary structures identical to those found on modern beaches abound on the strata surfaces. One of the most conspicuous features is extensive areas of specific structures not unlike those associated with modern biofilms and microbial mats. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the feeding potential of this presumed microbial material was one of the forces that lured the first animals out of the sea. It is also believed that the same material aided in the exceptional preservation of many of Blackberry Hill’s trace fossils.
Significance.
Among the many paleontological discoveries thus far made at Blackberry Hill are the following:
The largest, most productive quarry is still in operation, thereby revealing fresh surfaces and the potential for new discoveries on a continuing basis.
Biota.
Sedimentary structures associated with biofilms and microbial mats are the only evidence of non-animal life at Blackberry Hill, as is the case elsewhere in this pre-embryophyte period in the history of Earth’s life on land. The animal life of Blackberry Hill was, however, represented by several kinds of macrofossils, all preserved as three-dimensional casts or impressions, including:

Tennessee State Route 380

State Route 380 is a short east–west highway in McMinnville, Tennessee. The current length is .
Route description.
The highway begins at an intersection with SR-55, U.S. Route 70S, and SR-1 in northwestern McMinnville. U.S. 70S/SR-1 moves east from Woodbury and turns north at this intersection. SR-55 begins at the south fork of the intersection and SR-380 begins at the east fork. 
SR-380 moves southeast into downtown McMinnville as West Main Street and becomes two separate one-way streets in downtown. Eastbound SR-380 retains the name West Main Street (which becomes East Main Street after an intersection with SR-56) and westbound SR-380 is called West Morford Street (which becomes East Morford Street after an intersection with SR-56). This goes for approximately until both streets come back together to form Sparta Street just east of downtown. SR-380 (Sparta Street) continues northeast before terminating at U.S. 70S/SR-1.

Elm Creek (Guadalupe County)

Elm Creek is the name of two separate streams that rise in Guadalupe County southwest of Seguin in South Central Texas, United States. The western Elm Creek runs approximately 14 miles from its source about 8.6 miles southwest of Seguin in southwestern Guadalupe County (in the Texas Prairielands), to its confluence with Cibolo Creek, two miles east of La Vernia in Wilson County. The eastern Elm Creek originates 9.4 miles southwest of Seguin, and proceeds southeast through Guadalupe County, where it discharges into Cottonwood Creek, which itself flows into the Guadalupe River.
Elm Creek (West).
The western Elm Creek runs approximately 14 miles from its source about 8.6 miles southwest of Seguin in southwestern Guadalupe County (in the Texas Prairielands), to its confluence with the Cibolo Creek, two miles east of La Vernia in Wilson County. The creek serves as a tributary of the Cibolo Creek and forms its watershed southwest of Seguin, Texas, within the larger mid Guadalupe River Basin and proceeds southwest through New Berlin, Texas and onward to La Vernia.
Recreation.
Today, this beautiful watershed offers unlimited opportunities for primitive recreation, angling, and hunting.
Fauna.
A wide variety of fish and other wildlife are known to occupy the region. The creek passes through flat to rolling terrain with local shallow depressions, that are surfaced by clay and sandy loams that support water-tolerant hardwoods, honey mesquite, conifers and natural grasses including "Texas spur".
Elm Creek (East).
The eastern Elm Creek also forms an eastward flow. Originating 9.4 miles southwest of Seguin, the creek forms within the larger mid Guadalupe River Basin and proceeds southeast through Guadalupe County. It discharges into the Cottonwood Creek near the Thomas Springs, which forms it mouth at the Guadalupe River near Seguin.

Franz Liszt's treatments of the works of other composers

The following shows details of the various treatments given by Franz Liszt to the works of almost 100 other composers. 
These treatments included transcriptions for other instruments (predominantly solo piano), arrangements, orchestrations, "fantaisies", "reminiscences", "paraphrases", "illustrations", variations, editions, etc. 
Liszt also extensively treated his own works in similar ways, but these are not shown here. Neither are his treatments of national/folk melodies whose composers are not known, or other anonymous works.
In most cases, Liszt arranged just one or two pieces by a composer, but he went somewhat further with the works of Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Donizetti, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer, Mozart, Rossini, Schubert, Verdi, Wagner and Weber.
The earliest-born composer whose works Liszt dealt with was Orlande de Lassus (born c. 1532). Jacques Arcadelt was born earlier (c. 1507), but Liszt's treatment was not of Arcadelt's original work, rather of a setting by Pierre-Louis Dietsch loosely based on Arcadelt.
The last composer to die whose works Liszt dealt with was Géza Zichy, who died in 1924.
Alexander Alyabyev.
Note: The "Mazurka pour piano composée par un amateur de St. Pétersbourg, paraphrasée par F. L." (S.384) was based on a mazurka that has often been misattributed to Alyabyev, but was in fact written by Mikhail Vielgorski.

Hillat al-Arab

Hillat al-Arab (also Hillat el-Arab) is a former village and now an archaeological site in Sudan. It is located about south of Jebel Barkal. An Italian expedition discovered a graveyard at this site, which dates to the period of ca. 1200 to 750 BC. This locality is of particular importance because there are very few Nubian remains from that era. it dates to the period just before the beginning of the Kingdom of Kush. Hillat al-Arab contains about twenty tombs carved into rock, each consisting of several rooms, and meant for different people. As the ceiling of the main chamber collapsed in antiquity, there was no grave robbing. The grave chamber was painted in a rather primitive style. Artifacts in the tombs include vessels and jewelry. The ceramics from the oldest grave is largely Egyptian; at that time, the area was under Egyptian rule. Many vessels and jewelry were directly imported from Egypt, although the area was still hardly under its dominion. Grave 19 is of particular interest because it was used for centuries. The lowest layers are from the New Kingdom of Egypt, the top, later burials contained objects, and especially ceramics, very similar to the Cushitic.

Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus

Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus was a political figure in the Roman Republic, serving as consular tribune in 438 BCE and dictator three times in 437, 434, and 426 BCE.
His first and third dictatorships involved wars against the Veintines and Fidenates. He was victorious both times, capturing Fidenae in 426 BCE.
His second dictatorship in 434 BCE was occasioned by fear of an impending war with Etruria, but that war never materialized. Aemilius Mamercinus instead used his office to propose cutting the term of the censors from five years to eighteen months. This change was vigorously opposed by the senate but loved by the people, so he submitted the "lex Aemilia de censura minuenda" to the Tribal Assembly, which approved it. In retaliation, the censors used the power of their office to strike him from his tribe, increase his tax burden eight-fold, and brand him an aerarian.

Mae Fah Luang Foundation

The Mae Fah Luang Foundation (MFLF) is a Thai non‐profit organization that manages numerous projects within Thailand as well as other countries in Asia. The Foundation’s mission focuses on three main areas: “improving social and economic development, preserving the environment, and supporting local art and culture.” 
In 1972, the late Her Royal Highness Princess Srinagarindra (Princess Mother), mother of the present King of Thailand, founded the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation to offer market access for craft-making villages in the Northern highlands. It was later renamed the Mae Fah Luang Foundation in 1985, after the name given to the Princess Mother by the ethnic minorities, meaning “royal mother from the sky.” The new name indicates the growing scope of social development efforts the Foundation was assuming based on the ideas and philosophy of the Princess Mother.
In 1988, the MFLF initiated its flagship project in Doi Tung, Chiang Rai, with the goal of providing people with sustainable livelihoods. The MFLF developed the Sustainable Alternative Livelihood Development (SALD) model, which emphasizes thorough understanding of the needs of the local people and their socio-geographical realities, as well as integration and involvement of all levels. This model has been replicated in its projects in Thailand, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Indonesia.
History.
Founding.
The Mae Fah Luang Foundation (MFLF) was founded in 1972 by the late Princess Srinagarindra as the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation under the Royal Patronage of Her Royal Highness. The Thai Hill Crafts Foundation addressed the problem of poverty and poor living conditions faced by the ethnic minority groups in Northern Thailand by promoting and marketing their handicrafts to supplement their income, as well as teaching them skills and disciplines such as Thai language, basic math, and health education at Rai Mae Fah Luang. In 1985, the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation was renamed the Mae Fah Luang Foundation under the Royal Patronage of Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother, as it initiated more extensive rural development projects.
The MFLF undertook its first comprehensive development project, the Doi Tung Development Project, in 1988 at Doi Tung, Chiang Rai, to tackle opium cultivation at its root cause—poverty and lack of opportunity. The project aimed to create self-sufficient communities that would become independent of external support and well equipped to adapt to the changing environment. Today, this work has become the recognized SALD model.
In addition, the Hall of Opium, an exhibition hall, was established in 2003 to educate people about illicit drugs, especially opiates, in order to reduce drug abuse. With the development of the Doi Tung area and easier access to schooling opportunities, the Rai Mae Fah Luang, which previously offered boarding and education facilities to ethnic children, was transformed into the Mae Fah Luang Art and Cultural Park in 2008, in line with its mission to preserve and support local art and culture.
The MFLF has continued to expand its efforts in supporting vulnerable communities in Thailand and internationally, playing an important role as an intermediary between state and private organizations. The subsequent projects target the root cause of poverty by addressing areas of health, livelihood, and education based on the identified best practices from the Doi Tung Development Project, as well as the development philosophy of the Princess Mother.
Flagship Projects.
Doi Tung Development Project (1988-2017).
The Doi Tung Development Project (DTDP) started in 1988, covering approximately 15,000 hectares of the Doi Tung area, located at the heart of the Golden Triangle, a major region of opium production, impacting 11,000 people in 29 villages. This mountainous watershed area had been subject to slash-and-burn cultivation, opium cultivation, and trafficking of both human and arms. The project aimed to resolve problems faced by locals, from lack of health care, education, and governmental support, over a span of 30 years (1988–2017), in three phases:
Phase I – Survival: Bridging the Gap between Doi Tung and the Outside World (1988–1993)
This phase ensured the basic necessities of life, providing basic health care, including drug-rehabilitation, developing infrastructures such as roads and reservoirs, and reforesting the area. Schools, health care centers, and a cottage industry-training center were built. New crops, such as coffee trees and macadamia trees, were introduced to replace opium.
Phase II – Sufficiency: Giving people the tools to sustain their own livelihoods (1994–2002)
The second phase focused on creating a sustainable model through which the locals could generate income and become self-sufficient by establishing occupational development centers for agriculture, agro-processing, handicrafts, and tourism.
The “DoiTung” brand was also created to serve as the main channel of income to finance social activities of the DTDP. It comprises four business units: food, handicrafts, horticulture, and tourism.
The DTDP became financially self-sustainable by 2001 through the DoiTung Brand. It has now established over 20 cafes and stores throughout Thailand. Its products range from coffee grounds and macadamia to clothes, home wares, and stationary.
Phase III – Sustainability and Exit (2003–2017)
The phase is about strengthening the business units and to make sure that income-generating entities are stabilized This final phase prepares to transfer the management of the DTDP from the MFLF to the local people by emphasizing the training of human resources
In 2003, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recognized the DTDP as one of the world’s best examples of Alternative Development.
In 2009, the Secretary General of the MFLF received the Schwab Foundation’s “Social Entrepreneur of the Year for the Region of East Asia” for the MFLF’s efforts in combating social problems and improving people’s quality of life while restoring the natural environment.
In 2012, the DTDP partnered up with IKEA to create the Allvarlig tableware collection.
Mae Fah Luang Art and Cultural Park.
In 1979, the Thai Hill Crafts Foundation, with cooperation from various international organizations including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), established a youth leadership program to equip ethnic minority children with basic education and social skills, training them in agriculture, craftsmanship, and leadership. The training program was conducted at Rai Mae Fah Luang, which is now the Mae Fah Luang Art and Culture Park.
The Rai Mae Fah Luang became a home to hundreds of youths from rural areas with no access to education so that they could attend schools in the city. The role of the Rai Mae Fah Luang as an educational institution came to an end when the DTDP established schools located in the vicinity of their villages.
Today, the area has been transformed into the Mae Fah Luang Art and Culture Park, housing the region's largest collection of Lanna arts, including the teakwood exhibition, a botanical collection, and the Golden Pavilion that the people of Chiang Rai built and presented to the Princess Mother in honor of her 84th birthday. The Park honors the Princess Mother while preserving Lanna heritage.
Hall of Opium.
Located near the Golden Triangle, the Hall of Opium was created to reduce the demands of drug abuse through knowledge and education. While the DTDP tackles the drug problems from the supply side, this centre tries to solve drug problems from the demand side. A result of almost 10 years of research, the exhibition at the Hall of Opium conveys the history of opium and its trade across the globe, as well as provides a comprehensive source of knowledge on opium, opiates, and other narcotics. The exhibition also presents current issues regarding the efforts to control drugs and the impacts of drug abuse, with the belief that education would deter drug abuse.
The SALD Model.
The Sustainable Alternative Livelihood Development (SALD) model of MFLF emerged from the experience of the Doi Tung Development Project. It places the local community at the center of their own development, promoting economic, environmental, and social growth by building a strong community driven by local wisdom. The people-centric model uses a holistic approach that addresses health, livelihood, and education needs. It emphasizes local ownership and leadership to nurture independence to prepare the locals to continue on their own development regardless of external assistance.
The model follows 4 general stages:
Domestic Outreach.
Pang Mahan Reforestation Project (2005-2008).
Key Partners: Siam Commercial Bank PLC
The Chaipattana Foundation
The Pang Mahan Reforestation Project covers 2,250 hectares and is home to six ethnic minority groups in 18 villages, constituting a total of about 7,600 people. This CSR initiative centers on reforestation as a means to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, becoming the first domestic outreach project that utilized and adapted the Foundation’s SALD approach.
At Pang Mahan, the MFLF planted multiple variants of plants native to the area, a method known as Assisted Tree Regeneration, improving on the lessons learned at Doi Tung where the method of monoculture reforestation involving cutting down all the remaining trees before replanting was practiced. The MFLF implemented other mechanisms to support the preservation of forest like building an understanding, establishing community regulations among locals to prevent the forest fires, as well as creating a gas fund to promote gas cooking, instead of using firewood.
Additionally, an extensive irrigation system was constructed. An economic forest, designated for long-term plantation of crops for profit i.e. tea oil trees, and a sustenance forest, intended for everyday use i.e. bamboo for food and construction, were delegated as the area for the main source of their food and income. In addition, a seed bank and a livestock bank were set up to reduce daily expenses and provide the community with supplementary income.
The average income per family in the 18 villages increased from 18,611 baht/family/year in 2004 to 97,882 baht in 2008. Forestland was restored and biodiversity in the area was revived. Most importantly, the locals developed to become leaders in various areas of development.
Puna Reforestation Project (2006-present).
Key Partner: the Chaipattana Foundation
At Puna, the earlier reforestation models at Doi Tung and Pang Mahan were refined to become the Natural Tree Regeneration method or “reforestation without planting.” This method can be used when the soil has not been completely destroyed or demineralized over an extended period of time from chemical use, and there are still trees in the area.
In the project area of 3900 hectares, no new trees were planted. The project focused on land zoning and land management. Instead, the forest is left alone so it could regenerate itself. The reserve forest was protected from grazing, forest fires, and any kind of human interference. Like in Pang Mahan, sustenance and economic forestry zones promoting bamboo, banana, and tea oil were implemented to provide livelihood.
The average income per family increased from about 750 USD to 2400USD (1 USD = 31.7 Baht) per family per year within 3 years.
Integrated Rural Livelihood Development Model in Nan (2009-2011).
Key Partner: the Royal Initiative Discovery Institute
The development in Nan province spanned across three districts of Ta Wang Pa, Song Kwae, and Chalermphrakiet, covering a total of 21 villages. The watershed in the Nan province contributes to as much as 45 percent of the water that flows into the Chao Phraya River, yet the villages face problems of drought in the summer and severe flooding and landslides during the rainy season that affect other provinces in central Thailand. The local community relied on slash-and-burn cultivation and high levels of chemical pesticides and fertilizers to cope with land shortage on the steep mountains. The communities had problems of poverty and one village was 17 million baht deep in debt at the start of the project as the villagers often had to borrow money to buy food or take out loans for their agricultural production.
With the help and labor from the locals, the MFLF worked to maximize the use of the existing irrigation system, doing repair works as well as building new check dams, weirs, and reservoirs to direct water from the source to agricultural plots. The locals took ownership of construction works and were later equipped with the knowledge to carry out subsequent maintenance necessary. This improved system of weirs and canals has allowed farmers to grow rice at least twice a year as well as post-harvest crops.
The project also introduced terrace rice paddy fields to deal with the problem of demineralized soil and land shortage, increasing productivity and reducing the use of forestland. A bank of economic plants was founded to provide the local people with seedlings such as sugar palm, rattan, and eaglewood. This not only reforested the area, helping to prevent further soil erosion, but also created long-term income.
In addition, a livestock bank providing comprehensive services, from husbandry knowledge to feed and medicine and livestock management, was set up, helping to build capacity for local youths. This livestock bank has reduced economic vulnerability since the villagers raise these livestock as food, and earn extra income from selling extra meat.
The ownership of the project was handed to the local community in 2011 and village committees were established to manage each different area.
Huay Klai Sustainable Water Management Project in Udon Thani (2011-Present).
Key Partners: The Chaipattana Foundation
The Royal Initiative Discovery Institute
The Model Farm Project at Her Majesty the Queen’s Initiative of the Northeast Region
The Ministry of Interior
Udon Thani Provincial Administration
The project in Nong Wua Sor district of Udon Thani focuses on the underutilized Huay Klai reservoir as the main subject. Huay Klai reservoir was one of many examples of the rural development that lack integration amongst responsible governmental sectors. The primary survey showed that the reservoir was in perfect condition, yet communities in the vicinity could not fully benefit from it since there was no proper water distribution system—a problem common throughout Thailand.
Working with the local administration and local people, the MFLF created a new water distribution system, while the Model Farm piloted 2 model cultivation plots in the village, whose practice is now used in over 150 more plots. The locals were given vegetable seeds, taught about soil utility, multi-storey cropping, and tending to livestock. They have become self-reliant, consuming and earning income from their own agricultural products instead of having to buy them from markets. With the increase in income and work opportunity, the locals are able to remain in the area to earn a living instead of having to find work in other areas and overseas.
International Outreach.
Yong Kha, Shan State, Myanmar (2002-2004).
Key Partners: The Government of Thailand
The Government of Myanmar
Like the people in Doi Tung, the locals in Yong Kha had also been dependent on opium cultivation as a source of income. Many of the 6,022 locals were facing health problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, scabies, malnutrition, and other common diseases.
Here, the first outreach project replicating the SALD model was carried out, first by providing health care by Thai mobile medical units to address their immediate needs. Fourteen young locals were trained to diagnose and treat malaria, TB, and common diseases to expand the local health care capacity. Within a year, there was zero mortality from malaria and the infection rate reduced from 20% to 2% in 3 years.
As identified by the local people as significant priorities, a 16-bed hospital and a school for 500 students were built by local workers. A small-scale irrigation system was built by the community to aid growing sustenance and cash crops all year round. A seed bank and a pig bank were also set up. Children were taught a formal curriculum as well as practical agricultural skills in the school’s vegetable plot, chicken coop, and fishpond.
After three years, the total investment in this project amounted to USD$640,000 (or $106 / person / year). It generated benefits to the community in cash and in kind equivalent to USD$704,574 (or $117 / person / year).
The project ended in 2004 due to changes in the government of Myanmar but development activities continued under local staffing.
Balkh, Afghanistan (2006-present).
Key Partners: The Government of Afghanistan
The Afghan Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD)
The Afghan Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL)
The Provincial Government of Balkh Province
Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA)
The Government of Belgium
Ministry of Development Cooperation
The Royal Danish Government
The A4 Sheep Bank Project (A4SB) is a six-year project carried out by the MFLF in cooperation with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development of Afghanistan (MRRD) and the Provincial Government of Balkh, together with the local community. The A4 Sheep Bank (A4SB) project reaches out to almost 500 households in 15 villages in Dehdadi and Nahr-e-shahe districts, Balkh Province. The goal of the project is to revive the Afghan Karakul sheep industry in order to strengthen rural livelihood, improve income and pave the way towards the creation of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) adding value to sheep by-products. The A4SB received initial funding from the Belgian Government, followed by the Royal Thai Government and MRRD’s National Area Based Development Program (NABDP), and most recently, from the Danish Embassy in Afghanistan through MRRD’s Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program (AREDP).
The project trained local Afghan youths as para-veterinarians to operate a subscription-based Mobile Veterinary Unit. The subscribing sheep owners provide payment for the veterinary services in the form of livestock, which is then used in a sheep-loan system, or A4 Sheep Bank. The Sheep Bank lends sheep to economically vulnerable farmers, with the goal of reducing poverty and deterring them from illicit activities like opium poppy cultivation. The farmers repay the loans with the sheep’s offspring, which can then be loaned to other farmers, creating a revolving fund.
Over the past five years, the A4 Sheep Bank Project has achieved significant results- reducing economic vulnerability and promoting community-based economic participation, allowing Afghan sheep owners themselves to assist poorer fellow Afghans. The accumulated economic impact for 464 beneficiary households in 15 villages - from the reduced livestock mortality rates, increased sheep offspring for the 287 registered sheep owners, and sheep loans provided to 177 economically vulnerable households - approximates over USD 1,890,000 in 2012. In addition, the improved quantity and quality of sheep provide a larger raw material pool to capture further downstream value-adding opportunities and lead towards the development of related community-based enterprises.
The A4 Sheep Bank Project is currently in its last phase. The project is working to support the transition of the mobile veterinary unit into a privatized business as well as assist sheep owners to form enterprise groups involved in trading live sheep, pelts, skins and wool. In addition, a wool-processing and yarn-spinning project will be established in order to create immediate employment opportunities and income for Afghan women to work from their homes. The production of high-quality handspun yarn would be able to add value to sheared sheep wool and link into other downstream industries such as textile, carpets and handicrafts, generating further income and job prospects.
Aceh, Indonesia (2006-2012).
Key Partners: The Government of Thailand
Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA)
The Government of Indonesia
National Narcotics Board of Indonesia (BNN)
Office of the Governor of Aceh
Provincial Health Office of Aceh
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
Sambinoe Foundation
The MFLF was approached by the UNODC and the Government of Indonesia to help solve the problem of cannabis cultivation by creating other possible livelihood activities to alleviate poverty using the SALD approach. The project sought to double the income per capita from less than 1USD to more than 2USD per day for the target population who have endured 30 years of civil conflict and the 2004 tsunami.
In 2007, the MFLF piloted the Malaria Management Program in Lamteuba Village Cluster, with a population of approximately 4,700, training the local health team to carry out malaria treatment, from diagnosis to treatment and prevention. The program successfully reduced the infection rate to less than 0.05% in an area where malaria had been endemic. The program has since extended assistance to other areas in Indonesia, including capacity building for over 1,000 midwives and health technicians. Lamteuba is now a model of malaria management, providing knowledge to people from government organizations and academic institutions. In 2012, the MFLF local malaria team started a malaria management program in Aceh Jaya District, another area in Aceh where malaria is endemic, in cooperation with the Provincial Health of Office of Aceh, local health authorities and community representatives.
The MFLF, in cooperation with the Prostheses Foundation of Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother in Chiang Mai, Thailand trained four Acehnese amputees on low-cost and effective prostheses production in 2007. The Foundation then aided in establishing an Achenese operated Prostheses Center at the Zainoel Abidin Hospital in Banda Aceh, where artificial limbs are produced for those who have lost their limbs, mainly from the political conflict or tsunami disaster.
In December 2008, with Sambinoe Foundation and the local Government of Aceh, the MFLF established the ‘Sustainable Rural Development Centre’ in Maheng-Lamcot Village, Aceh Besar District as a one-stop learning and demonstration centre on irrigation, agriculture, livestock, and basic value adding initiatives. Over 3 years, the various development activities- including the goat farm, seed banks, vegetable cultivation plots, and rice mill have brought about an increase in income for the community of Maheng-Lamcot from an average of 83 US cents to 2.7 USD per person per day.
Yenan Chaung Township, Magwe Region, Myanmar (2010-Present).
Key Partners: Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries of Myanmar
Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency (TICA)
Office of the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand (ONCB)
Yenan Chaung Township is one of the least developed townships in Magwe Region, which has a population of about 150,000. The people in the region suffer from insufficient water both for household consumption and agricultural cultivation- having limited sources of ground water and relying almost solely on rain for growing crops. They mostly plant beans and sesame since there is not enough water to grow rice. They utilize their livestock for work, transportation and to sell for cash. For additional income, the locals cut down trees to sell as logs and coals, as well as leave the area to find work.
During 2011-2012, the MFLF worked in 16 villages in 4 village tracts covering approximately 2,000 household beneficiaries or 9,370 people, with the possibility to extend to a wider area. The project first started by setting up an anti-venom serum bank, since there was a serious problem with snake bites and lack of serum access, resulting in preventable deaths. Secondly, the Foundation worked with the community on developing water resources- including installing hand pumps, digging new wells, and repairing and building reservoirs and weirs. In the process, the locals learned how to care for these water systems.
A goat bank, as well as para-veterinary training and services, complemented by livestock medicine funds, were set up to increase assets and income for the people. In addition, the MFLF established a seed bank to allow the villagers easier access to cultivation inputs. The MFLF is also helping to develop alternative energy sources - including biogas from cattle manure as well as solar power for lighting in order to help reduce expenses and promote a healthier lifestyle for the villagers.
Basic value addition to local agriculture produce is also being introduced in order to educate villagers on basic entrepreneurial skills and lead to more long-term and sustainable income for the community.

Aaron Burr (advertisement)

Aaron Burr is a television advertisement created in 1993. It was the first commercial in the Got Milk? advertising campaign.
Sypnosis.
The advert takes place in a private museum filled with many artifacts revolving around the Burr-Hamilton duel. It is owned by a hapless history buff (portrayed by Sean Whalen), who is first shown spreading peanut butter over a piece of bread. He is listening to a classical radio station, which then halts to a radio announcer (voiced by Rob Paulsen) who then announces they will make a "random call" to a person to see if they can answer the question, "Who shot Hamilton in that famous duel?", making the man, whilst eating a curled bread slice, nervously look around in his museum. His phone then rings, and he interrupts the radio announcer mid-sentence, answering the question correctly by saying "Aaron Burr". However, because of the peanut butter sandwich in his mouth, the announcer cannot hear him correctly. The man then tries to pour some milk into a glass, but is mortified to discover he only has a drop left. He only has a few seconds left and tries to say the answer again and again, but because the announcer cannot hear him, he hangs up. The advert ends with the history buff staring sadly at his phone, whispering "Aaron Burr...", as we fade out and the words "got milk?" appear.
Reception.
The ad helped increase sales of fluid milk, totaling 23.3 billion pounds from 1994 to 1995. In 2002, the ad was named one of the ten best commercials of all time by a "USA Today" poll, and ran again nationwide the same year. It also appeared on the Reader's Digest VHS compilation "Laugh? I Thought I'd Die!".

Engelsholm Castle

Engelsholm Castle, overlooking Engelsholm Lake, is located 14 km west of Vejle in south-western Denmark. Originally a manor house which traces its history back to the 15th century, it now houses a folk high school. 
History.
Little is known about Engelsholm's earliest history. The estate was acquired from the crown by Timme Nielsen Rosenkrantz in 1452. It was owned by the Brahe family between 1590 and 1725. Knud Brahe, the brother of famous astronomer Tycho Brahe, constructed a new main building, in two storeys and with four corner towers, in 1592-93. The identity of the architect remains unclear but it may have been Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder or Hercules von Oberberg.
This Renaissance castle was adapted to the Baroque style for Gerhard de Lichtenberg with the assistance of Nicolaus Hinrich Rieman. By 1740 it was a white-washed building with a black-glazed tile roof and onion domes topping the four towers.
Engelsholm's most famous former owner is Admiral Niels Juel who owned the estate from 1784 until 1786. Most of the land was sold off in lots in 1931 and the adjacent farm buildings were demolished.
The folk high school.
Engelsholm was purchased and turned into a folk high school in 1939, from 1952 run as a self-owning institution.
Housing for students and faculty has later been built next to the castle to a design by Jens Malling Pedersen (b. 1920). The school specializes in artistic courses, combomg both music and visual arts.

Solar power in Tennessee

Solar power in Tennessee installed on rooftops is estimated to be capable of producing 23% of all electricity used in Tennessee, with 16,000 MW of solar panels. TVA has a Generation Partners Program that pays $1000 on sign up and $0.12/kWh above retail for photovoltaic systems of from 0.5 kW to 50 kW. Payments are for 10 years and are credited to customers monthly bill and paid either monthly or annually.
Federal law requires net metering upon request, but Tennessee is one of only four states without established policy, meaning that it needs to be negotiated with the utility. A more practical approach is to assume net metering by each utility. Net metering is simply an accounting procedure, and the only requirement is a bi-directional electric meter. Most meters are bi-directional. It is more practical for utilities to discover net metering instead of requiring registration and reporting, just as there is no registration or reporting requirement in connecting an air conditioner, which is instead discovered by utilities. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits instead of converting to a monetary value.
A 2012 estimate suggests that a typical 5 kW system will pay for itself in about 14 years, and thereafter generate a net savings of $16,622 over the 25 year life of the system.
In 2012, Tennessee's largest solar installation is the 5 MW West Tennessee Solar Farm.

Texas Chute Out

Texas Chute Out was a Intamin "parachute drop" ride that operated at Six Flags Over Texas. It closed on September 3, 2012.
History.
When Texas Chute Out opened in 1976, the ride was a masterpiece of engineering at the park dominating the entrance to the parking lot. The ride was derived from the famed Parachute Jump ride at the legendary Coney Island in New York. Ride engineers from Intamin developed the ride, and then Six Flags purchased three "Parachute Drop" rides with two built at Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Over Mid-America (now "Six Flags St. Louis").
Texas Chute Out was the world’s first and known as a “modern” parachute drop ride when it opened in 1976.
During Holiday in the Park, Texas Chute Out was decorated as a giant Christmas tree.
On August 2, 2012, "Six Flags Over Texas" announced the last chance to ride "Texas Chute Out" would be on September 3, 2012, before it closed along with the neighboring ride Flashback. Texas Chute Out was replaced by Texas SkyScreamer, a Funtime "StarFlyer". Texas Chute Out was imploded on October 10, 2012 to make room for construction on the "Texas SkyScreamer".
Ride.
"Texas Chute Out" was located in Goodtimes Square, where riders of one to three, strap themselves onto to the bench where it then lifted riders to the top . Once up top, the ride pauses to give riders a Bird's-eye view of the park and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. After a couple of seconds the parachute then releases from the top and floats back down toward the ground.
Each seat held two riders, and was equipped with a seat belt and restraint bar. Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute. During the years, the ride allowed riders to stand during the ride, but this later stopped.

Mesoniscus

Mesoniscus is a genus of woodlice, placed in its own family, Mesoniscidae, and section, Microcheta. It contains two species – Mesoniscus alpicolus and Mesoniscus graniger – that live in Central and Eastern Europe, mostly in and around caves.
Distribution.
"Mesoniscus" is restricted to Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula; the ranges of its two species do not overlap.
"M. alpicolus" is found in Lombardy and the Northern Calcareous Alps. In Austria, its range extends from the near Innsbruck to the eastern edge of the , although it is also found in isolated pockets of Triassic and Silurian–Devonian limestone in Styria.
"M. graniger" has a wider distribution than its congener; it is found in much of the Carpathians, including the Bihor and Banat mountains, and in the Dinaric Alps and Julian Alps. It is also found in the Caves of Aggtelek Karst in Hungary.
Taxonomy.
The first description of a woodlouse now in the genus "Mesoniscus" was in 1858, when Joseph Heller described ""Titanethes alpicolus"" in 1858. This was followed in 1865 by the description by János Frivaldszky (Ján Frivaldský) of the subspecies ""Titanethes alpicolus graniger"".
"Mesoniscus" is the only genus in the family Mesoniscidae, and is considered so distinct from other woodlice that the family is placed in a separate section, named Microcheta.
Ecology.
"Mesoniscus" species lack the pleopodal lungs found in many other woodlice, and are restricted to damp environments.

The Haunted Man (album)

The Haunted Man is the third studio album by English recording artist Bat for Lashes. It was released on 11 October 2012 by Parlophone. The album was preceded by the lead single "Laura", which was released on 24 July 2012.
Background.
Bat for Lashes, otherwise known as Natasha Khan, stated that, after she returned from touring in March 2010, she tried to rehabilitate herself to rebuild a sense of who she was without the music. In May 2010, Khan stated that although she had enough songs to put out as an album, she wanted to take more time working on new material as she had been on tour for so long and found it boring to write songs about being on tour. She experienced a "profound writer's block", which led her to call Thom Yorke, lead singer of Radiohead, to ask, "What do you do when you feel like you're going to die because you can't write anything?" He advised her to draw, and subsequently Khan took life-drawing classes and a children's illustration course. Combined with intensive dance classes to boost her confidence, Khan began to feel inspiration enough to begin writing again, penning the album's opening song, "Lilies", which she said was inspired by a scene in the 1970 film "Ryan's Daughter".
The album's artwork was photographed by American photographer Ryan McGinley, and features a nude Khan carrying an equally naked man on her back. Khan told the "NME": "I really wanted to strip things back in honour of women like Patti Smith; just these raw, honest women. I had no make-up on, it's just me and my haunted man!"
Singles.
"Laura" was released as the album's lead single on 24 July 2012. The song reached number 144 on the UK Singles Chart. The track "Marilyn" debuted online on 13 September 2012. "All Your Gold" was released as the second single from the album on 19 September 2012, and was serviced to US triple-A radio stations on 22 October.
Reception.
Critical response.
"The Haunted Man" received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on 35 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan named "The Haunted Man" "one of the year's most beguiling albums", writing that it "sounds like effort magnificently realized. The rawness of feeling is achieved through equally raw ambition." "Under the Radar"s Austin Trunick opined, "Stripped down of any excessive ornamentation, it's the most raw incarnation of Bat For Lashes we've heard yet [...] From the beginning, it's the passion in her vocals that drives the record, seemingly less concerned this time around with crafting the atmospheric dreamworlds of her past work and more in finding some emotional truth in the simple compositions." Anupa Mistry of "Now" described the album as "yearning, elegant pop music in line with the past year's best: patterned and dreamy like Jessie Ware's "Devotion", unrepentant like Fiona Apple's "The Idler Wheel" and as beguilingly honest as St. Vincent's "Strange Mercy"." Ben Hewitt of the "NME" commented that "while "The Haunted Man" deals in less trinkets than its predecessor, it's not scant in splendour. Instead, for large swathes, it's like being plunged into a fairytale soundtracked by skin-prickling electro and populated by downtrodden sods hunting for breadcrumbs of comfort." "Rolling Stone"s Will Hermes praised the album as Khan's "sexiest, spookiest LP", stating that "the visions here seem all her own. And they're pretty awesome."
"The Guardian" critic Alexis Petridis wrote that "The Haunted Man" "sounds like a bold, confident album that strips away a lot of the sonic embellishments from Khan's sound", adding that "it's the sound of someone who's worked out that less can sometimes be more, that not trying too hard isn't the same as not trying." Heather Phares of Allmusic stated, "Focus and restraint might not sound exciting in and of themselves, but "The Haunted Man" is more direct than any of Bat for Lashes' previous work, and manages to keep the air of mystique around Khan that has made her one to watch and listen to since her early days." Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel viewed that "while the album's comparatively restrained arrangements occasionally wilt in the face of Khan's fierce melodrama, "The Haunted Man" is still a worthy, often gorgeous entry in the Bat for Lashes canon." In a mixed review, Annie Zaleski of "The A.V. Club" critiqued that Khan's "moody charisma and piercing vocals ensure the album is still an enjoyable listen. All the same, it's disappointing that "The Haunted Man"s beauty is too often only skin deep." Despite citing "The Haunted Man" as "Khan's strongest yet", "The Observer"s Kitty Empire felt that the album "does not [... deal the killer blow of originality that by now Khan should have in her power", concluding that ""The Haunted Man" is an assured and sonically seductive record—if only it didn't echo a little too often the sound of other women's work." Andy Gill of "The Independent" argued that "are moments on "The Haunted Man" when Natasha Khan's marshalled musical forces evoke exactly the right ambience for songs pivoting on the notion of renewal. But sometimes the recurrent mood of ecstatic affirmation of life that's evident in her singing can be short-changed by arrangements that fuss to no great purpose, dissipating their impact in brittle beats and pointless detail." Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" expressed that although the album "occasionally draw[s blood", it "doesn't live up to its stripped and dangerous cover", adding, "For every song that opens up and invites you in to experience the startling wonders of [Khan's] private world, there's another that just hangs like a gauzy veil of unusual sounds and vague lyrics, not so much impenetrable as too insubstantial to be worth the effort of investigation."
Commercial performance.
"The Haunted Man" debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, selling 13,334 copies. The following week, it fell to number thirty-six on sales of 3,991 copies. The album entered the "Billboard" 200 at number sixty-four, becoming Khan's highest-charting album so far in the United States.
Accolades.
The album was listed at number six on "Spin"s 50 Best Albums of 2012, and the magazine wrote, "the often-fantastical, mythology-loving [... Bat for Lashes dropped a testament to her strength—an open, plaintive meditation on courage, self-esteem, and coming into one's own that also pushed her opulent, operatic sound forward—it was cultural reinforcement that self-sacrifice needn't be a part of the female pop-star narrative." This Is Fake DIY named "The Haunted Man" the tenth best album of 2012, stating it "shines as an exemplary beacon of what can be achieved within the mainstream, given great ambition and artistic integrity." Pitchfork Media placed the album at number seventeen on its list of The Top 50 Albums of 2012, calling it "empathetic, bold, and outlandish". "The Haunted Man" was ranked the twenty-first and thirty-second best album of 2012 by "The Guardian" and the "NME", respectively.
PopMatters included the album at number thirty-three on its list of The 75 Best Albums of 2012 and noted that it "lays off the thick orchestration to reveal even more rhythmic complexity than usual", while citing it as Khan's "richest release". It was named the fortieth best album of 2012 by "Fact" magazine, which opined that Khan's "mimicry of Kate Bush outpaces her contemporaries (ahem, Florence) and sonically, the influence of austere, icy post-punk is a welcome development. "The Haunted Man" is not perfect, but with standouts like 'Laura' and 'Lilies', it's a well-composed pop album." Allmusic ranked "The Haunted Man" as the forty-fourth best album of 2012 and commented it contains "some of [Khan's] most striking and vital-sounding songs yet", concluding, "Balancing the primal beauty of her first album and the elaborate character studies of her second, she moved between sparkling synth pop and spare piano balladry with a dreamlike ease that reaffirmed her as one of pop's most captivating figures since Kate Bush's heyday."

Blue-fronted fig parrot

The Blue-fronted Fig Parrot, also referred to as the Blue-browed Fig Parrot, is a putative undescribed fig parrot said to inhabit the rugged rainforest-covered border ranges of subtropical south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. It was announced in November 2006 as the discovery of a new species or subspecies. However, the existence of the parrot has not been confirmed and the claimed discovery has been questioned.
Background.
Australia holds three fig parrot taxa, all of which are subspecies of the Double-eyed Fig Parrot ("Cyclopsitta diophthalma"), which is also found in New Guinea. Inhabiting the rainforest canopy, they are tiny (14 cm in length), mostly green in colour, with various red and blue markings on and around the face. The three distinct and geographically discrete Australian subspecies are:
Description.
Examination of the only photograph of the new parrot that was made available shows that it closely resembles a Macleay's Fig Parrot, with the main difference being that the forehead is blue rather than red. The authenticity of the photograph is in doubt.
History.
Announcement.
On 8 November 2006 it was reported prominently in the Brisbane "Courier Mail" that naturalist and cinematographer John Young had discovered a new fig parrot species in rugged forest country in southern Queensland after an exhaustive search. The exact site of the discovery was not disclosed, though Young claimed that he had known of the bird’s existence for ten years. The range of the new parrot was said to overlap with that of Coxen's Fig Parrot. The Queensland Environment Minister Lindy Nelson-Carr said that the new fig parrot represented a fourth Australian fig parrot species or subspecies.
The first public announcement had been made by Young the previous evening, 7 November 2006, at O'Reilly's Guesthouse in the Lamington National Park to an audience of birdwatchers, as well as to Minister Nelson-Carr and to Dr Ian Gynther, a Senior Conservation Officer with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The audience was shown a photograph by Young of the new parrot and informed that it was the subject of a scientific paper being written by Young and Gynther for the journal "Emu" that would examine the relationship between the Blue-fronted Fig Parrot and the three hitherto known Australian fig parrot taxa. However, even Gynther had not been informed of the precise discovery location.
Doubts.
Subsequently questions were raised concerning Young’s claim and the photograph of the new parrot that had been made available to the media. Ornithologists Penny Olsen and Richard Schodde expressed doubts, with Olsen finding the photograph unconvincing, and with Schodde saying that, until there was proper documentation and the claim confirmed by more than one independent qualified observer, the report should be disregarded. Schodde later said that the existence of two very closely related parrots living side by side in remnant patches of rainforest around the Queensland - New South Wales border was highly unlikely, concluding that, without further evidence such as DNA material, Young's claim should be treated with "utmost scepticism".
The photograph was examined by Gale Spring, an associate professor in scientific photography at Melbourne's RMIT University, and expert in forensic photography, who expressed strong doubts about it, saying that the surface imaging was typical of pictures that had been altered. An offer by Spring to examine other claimed photographs at the offices of Young’s company, John Young Wildlife Enterprises (JYWE), was not taken up. After senior departmental officers saw a presentation by Spring on the only photographic evidence, the Queensland Government began to distance itself from Young, with its Environmental Protection Agency issuing a statement saying that, following the failure of JYWE to fulfil an undertaking to provide further photographs to Spring, it would "not be undertaking further investigations into Mr Young's claim" without further evidence. An undertaking by Young to provide pin feathers, said to have been plucked from fig parrot chicks, for DNA analysis was also not fulfilled.
In a 19 February 2007 media release by JYWE, it was stated that the parrot was difficult to find because its habitat lay above the high-altitude rainforest canopy. It also said that Young had collected a body of evidence, including recordings, photographs of several different birds, biological material and a nest site, which would, in due course, be made available to the scientific community. The release also expressed disappointment that “armchair experts” were prepared to question Young’s integrity before he had had the chance to complete his fieldwork and have the evidence independently analysed prior to releasing all his information about the parrot to the community at large. The release ended with the statement that "It may take some considerable time for John to complete his work, but we have no doubt that when this happens it will prove a significant addition to our knowledge of Fig-Parrots".

El Aserradero

El Aserradero (meaning The Sawmill) is a log flume located in the "Spain" section at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas, since 1963.
History.
'El Aserradero' was the first ever log flume attraction in the world and the fourth oldest ride currently operating at the park, built by the former Arrow Dynamics. The log flume replaced the 'Burro Ride', which operated from 1961 to 1962. From 1963 to 1968, El Aserradero only operated one flume. Then in 1968, due to the ride's popularity, Six Flags added a second flume to next to the original doubling the capacity of the attraction. The park billed the ride as "the most popular and exciting ride ever devised."
During the 1970s, Six Flags Over Texas added themed animations along the ride in which Lumberjacks could be seen sawing logs. Also added was a cover to the drop on flume 2, which later was removed along with the animations.
El Aserradero's success inspired many amusement parks around the world to add a log flume of some type.
Ride Experience.
El Aserradero's entrance is located in the Texas theme section of the park, but the ride is in the Spain section along with the exit. Once guests load into one of the fiberglass logs, the log then travels to the first lift hill. The log is carried up the lift hill on a conveyor belt, then drops down a slide into the flume, which is the highest part of the ride. The log then floats around the curving flume, carried forward by the water and traveling slightly downhill. The log then reaches a second lift hill, then drops down a much longer slide and splashes down at the end of the ride.
El Aserradero operates from spring to the end of Fright Fest in October.

Abdul Haq (Islamic scholar)

Maulana Abdul Haq (Pashto/, "‘Abdu’l-Ḥaq"; 1912/1914 – 7 September 1988) was an Islamic scholar from the city of Akora Khattak in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, and the founder of the Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak. He was involved in politics as a member of the political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. He served three times in the National Assembly of Pakistan and was an active proponent of the Khatm-i Nabuwwat movement.
Abdul Haq completed his religious education in India at Darul Uloom Deoband. He taught hadith at Deoband for four years until difficulties arose due to the the independence of Pakistan. In 1947, he founded Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak, one of the first Islamic seminaries to be established in Pakistan. He taught hadith at the madrasah for the rest of his life and was well known by the title "Shaykh al-Hadith".
His son, Sami ul Haq, succeeded him as chancellor of Darul Uloom Haqqania. Abdul Haq's sermons have been published by his son in two volumes containing over 1,300 pages, entitled "Da`wat-i Haq".
Education.
Abdul Haq was born in 1912 or 1914 in the city of Akora Khattak in the North-West Frontier Province of British India. He was the son of Haji Maruf Gul (also known as Gul Dada), a well-known local landlord, businessman, and religious scholar.
As is common in many countries, he was given only a single name, "Abdul Haq", meaning "servant of the Truth" in Arabic.
Abdul Haq received his early education from his parents, who then sent him for religious studies to nearby places in Peshawar, Mardan, and Chhachh. He then went to Amroha, Meerut, Gulavati, and Calcutta for further studies.
On 12 Shawwal 1347 AH (March 1929), he enrolled in Darul Uloom Deoband, where he studied under islamic scholars including Husain Ahmad Madani. Of his admission to the school, Abdul Haq said, "I arrived at Deoband at such a time when the Bengali and Swati students had quarreled and there was no flexibility in admission policy for Pathan students. I also had to face the problem of admission." Abdul Haq graduated upon completion of his studies in 1352 AH (1933/1934).
Teaching career.
Abdul Haq returned to Akora Khattak and, on the instruction of his father, opened a small madrasah in a mosque adjacent to his house in order to provide a basic and religious education to the children in the area. In 1937 he began a primary school which was inaugurated by Husain Ahmad Madani. Soon, the number of students increased and other teachers were appointed.
Abdul Haq was later offered a teaching post at Darul Uloom Deoband by Madani. After consulting with his father, he joined Darul Uloom Deoband in Shawwal 1362 AH (October 1943) and later became a permanent staff member, teaching hadith. 
In 1947, during the Ramadan vacation, Abdul Haq was in Akora Khattak. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, his father did not agree to him returning to Deoband, despite Madani's attempts to persuade him. Consequently, Abdul Haq founded Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak on 23 September 1947. At first he was the sole teacher and had to teach all the books of the Dars-i Nizami curriculum himself, but, over time, the number of students grew and other teachers joined. Abdul Haq continued to teach hadith at the school until his death in 1988.
Abdul Haq also served as the convener of Wifaq al-Madaris al-Arabiya.
Politics.
Abdul Haq joined other islamic graduates in forming the Pakistani political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), which endeavored for the implementation of Islamic law in the country.
Abdul Haq was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in three consecutive elections, his election campaigns being led by his son, Sami ul Haq. In 1970, running on the JUI ticket, Abdul Haq was elected to the 5th National Assembly, defeating Ajmal Khattak of the National Awami Party and Nasrullah Khan Khattak of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). In the 1977 general election, he was elected to the 6th National Assembly, running on the ticket of the Pakistan National Alliance, a nine-party alliance including JUI. He again defeated Nasrullah Khan Khattak, then Chief Minister of NWFP and provincial president of the PPP. He was elected to the 7th National Assembly in the 1985 general election, which was held on a non-party basis.
Khatme Nabuwwat movement.
Abdul Haq was active in the Khatme Nabuwwat movement. In his lectures he stressed the importance of the concept of finality of prophethood and argued against the interpretations of Quranic verses and hadiths used by Qadianis to support their beliefs. He was one of the signatories of the resolution moved on 30 June 1974 in the National Assembly in support of declaring Qadianis as non-Muslims in Pakistan.
Soviet imposedwar in Afghanistan.
When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Abdul Haq declared the Afghan resistance to be a "jihad" and an ideological struggle between Islam and communism. The "fatwa" stating this was issued by Darul Uloom Haqqania. Abdul Haq made monetary contributions in support of the Afghan Mujahideen and prayed for their success. On many occasions he expressed his desire to fight, but he was unable to due to his old age and failing health.
Sufism.
Abdul Haq was a disciple of Haji Sahib Turangzai. He gave "bay'ah" at the hands of other eminent Sufis including Husain Ahmad Madani, Khawaja Abdul Malik Siddiqi, and the Faqir of Ipi.
Awards and achievements.
In October 1978, Abdul Haq was awarded an honorary PhD in Divinity from the University of Peshawar for services rendered in the cause of Islam. In August 1981, he received the Sitara-i-Imtiaz from the President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq, for his religious, educational, and scholarly achievements.
Death.
Abdul Haq died on 7 September 1988, at the age of 74 or 76, in Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar, NWFP, Pakistan.

Mesa Central High School

Mesa Central High School, known as Mesa Vo-Tech High School after 1984, was a high school in Mesa, Arizona. It originally served as the district's alternative high school before conversion into a vocational education school in 1980. It closed in 1991 as a consequence of consolidation into the East Valley Institute of Technology joint technological education district.
History.
The school's location at 260 South Center Avenue was the original location of Mesa High School. After the fire that burned down the school's Old Main in 1967, the Mesa Union High School District (high school predecessor to Mesa Public Schools) eventually built a new Mesa High School at 1630 East Southern Avenue.
Mesa Central opened in 1972 as the alternative high school for the district, though as the 1970s wore on it was shifted to serving as the vocational and industrial school in the district. The renamed Mesa Central Vocational-Technical Center, along with some renovations to the campus, opened in 1980. In 1984, the name was shortened to Mesa Vo-Tech High School.
In 1990, the state of Arizona created the concept of joint technological education districts which allowed school districts to pool resources and support a combined vocational-technical infrastructure. The East Valley Institute of Technology started up in the fall of 1991 with its main campus at 1601 West Main Street.

The Sparrow's Lost Bean (folk tale)

The Sparrow's Lost Bean (Nepal Bhasa: चखुंचायागु तंगु कयगू, Chakhunchāyāgu Tangu Kaygu) is a Nepalese folk tale that ranks among the most popular children's stories told among the Newars of Nepal Mandala.
The story.
Once upon a time, there was a sparrow who was very neat and clean. Its nest was spotless and it always washed up before eating. One morning, the sparrow found a bean and was overjoyed that it didn't have to search the neighborhood for food. As was its habit, it went down to the river to wash up after putting the bean away safely on the bridge.
When the sparrow returned expecting to eat a fine breakfast, alas, the bean was nowhere to be found. As it was looking everywhere for its food, it saw a carpenter walking up the bridge. The sparrow went up to the carpenter and said, "I have lost my bean. Please help me find it." "Who's going to listen to you?" said the carpenter and continued on his way. 
Just then the sparrow saw a soldier walking up the bridge. It pleaded with him to help find the bean, but the soldier too was uncooperative. "Who's going to help a sparrow?" he said and walked away. Then a captain came up the bridge, but he wouldn't help the sparrow either. And then a minister, but no help from him too. He just laughed and kept walking.
The hungry sparrow became desperate. Then the king came riding on an elephant. The sparrow was certain that it would get justice from the most powerful person in the country. But the king pretended not to hear the sparrow's pleas and said nothing. As the sparrow sat there dejected, an ant came up and asked, "What's the matter? Didn't you see the king pass by?" The sparrow then told the ant how everybody from the carpenter to the king had ignored its appeals to help it find the lost bean.
"Don't worry," said the ant. "We will find the bean somehow." The ant then crawled up to the elephant's ear and said, "Tell the king to find the sparrow's bean or I will go inside your ear and bite you." The terrified elephant turned to the king and said, "You better help the sparrow, oh king, or I will throw you off my back." 
The king was startled. He immediately summoned the minister and ordered, "Help the sparrow or you are fired." The minister called the captain right away and said, "Do whatever the sparrow says or you are in trouble." The captain then called the soldier and gave him explicit orders. The soldier, in turn, found the carpenter and told him, "Find the sparrow's bean or I will hang you from this bridge itself." The carpenter searched for half a day and finally found the lost bean, and the sparrow had a satisfying breakfast that day.
Publications.
"The Sparrow's Lost Bean" was featured in an anthology of folk tales in Nepal Bhasa published in 1966. A comic book was published by Rajman in 1991.

Balopi Commission

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Sections 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution of Botswana, also known as the Balopi Commission after the chairman of the commission Patrick Balopi, is a Botswana commission of inquiry set up on 28 July 2000 in response to perceived tribal inequality between the dominant Batswana and the smaller minority tribes such as the Wayeyi.
Background.
In 1995, Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo, a professor at the University of Botswana, founded the Kamanakao Association, an organization that aims "to develop and maintain the Shiyeyi language and culture." The Wayeyi are a Bantu minority group under the Batawana umbrella. Due to feelings of oppression under the Batawana, the Wayeyi, with the help of the Kamanakao Association, installed their own paramount chief, Shikati Calvin Kamanakao, on 24 April 1999, which was in disagreement with the Chieftanship Act, the Tribal Land Territory Act, and sections 77-79 of the Constitution of Botswana. The Deputy Attorney General Ian Kirby responded by letter to the Wayeyi on 15 July 1999, writing that since the Wayeyi are not a recognized tribe, they could not have their own chief.
Because of the Wayeyi conflict and a parliamentary motion by Olifant Mfa on 17 February 1995 to rewrite sections 77-79 of the Constitution to be "tribally neutral", President Festus Mogae appointed twenty-one people to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Section 77, 78 and 79 of the Constitution of Botswana, otherwise known as the Balopi Commission after the chairman of the commission Patrick Balopi. The commission was charged with three tasks: "(a) To review sections 77, 78, and 79 of the constitution of Botswana and to seek a construction that would eliminate any interpretation that renders the sections discriminatory; (b) To review and propose the most effective method of selecting members of the House of Chiefs; and (c) To propose and recommend measures to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the House of Chiefs."
Methodology.
In order to collect public opinions, the members of the commission visited 41 villages and towns, held 43 public meetings, listened to 38 oral submissions, and received 10 group and 40 individual written submissions. The meetings were held in the traditional dikgotla of the tribes.
Recommendations.
The commission made the following recommendations in the "White Paper No.1 of 2001":
Reactions.
The president was praised for his efforts by the minority Batswapong in eastern Botswana but was heavily criticised by the Bamangwato because they felt it would "place their paramount chief then Vice President of Botswana Ian Khama on the same level as chiefs from inferior tribes." The Bogosi Act was passed in 2008, replacing the Chieftainship Act. This act removed references of the word "chief" and changed them to kgosi.
Revision.
A revision of the recommendations was made in April 2002 titled the "White Paper No.2 of 2002" which opted to let the selection process for the House remain the same: the eight dikgosi of the main tribes would retain their posts, a move that the House of Chiefs itself approved. President Mogae went on further visits around the country in May 2002 to hold debates about future changes to the constitution, but the consensus among the citizens remains dissatisfied. Minister of Health Joy Phumaphi said that the revision "is a compromise and it does not remove discrimination." Other ministers felt that they did not have enough time to provide feedback to the revision process. A 2007 study by the University of Botswana found that "a significant number of respondents suggest that the Constitution should be reviewed so that it equally recognizes all cultures found in Botswana".

<doc id="36548173" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36548173" title="Bogosi Act">
Bogosi Act

The Bogosi Act is a piece of legislation in Botswana that defines the office of "" or "chieftanship" among Botswana's various tribes. The act was written in response to the Balopi Commission recommendation that the Constitution of Botswana replace all references of the word "chief" to the Setswana word "kgosi". The Bogosi Act replaces the earlier Chieftainship Act of 1987.
History.
Outcry from minority tribes in Botswana such as the Wayeyi pushed President Festus Mogae to create the Balopi Commission on 28 July 2000 to investigate tribal discrimination. The commission found that the structure of the House of Chiefs of Botswana, later renamed "Ntlo ya Dikgosi", "tended to be discriminatory". In response, the Bogosi Bill was passed, creating the Bogosi Act.
Content.
The Bogosi Act defines the institution of "bogosi" or tribal chieftainship. A "kgosi" (plural: dikgosi) is the tribal leader and has the following functions:
The dikgosi of the eight main Batswana tribes automatically become members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, an advisory body to the Parliament of Botswana.
Reaction.
The act has been criticised by tribal leaders because of the limitations on the powers of a kgosi. In 2010, Kgosi Kgafela II of the Kgatla tribe was accused of flogging, but he argued that dikgosi have immunity to the state's jurisdiction. The Botswana High Court dismissed the case on 11 May 2011, claiming that "dikgosi cannot act outside the constitution and laws prescribed by Parliament when all other functionaries of the state act within the statutory limitations." To avoid the legal costs of the case, Kgafela moved to Moruleng, South Africa.

Lake Winterset

Lake Winterset is a large natural freshwater lake on the south side of Winter Haven, Florida. This lake has a surface area and is round with an oval-shaped cove on its south end. The cove is connected to the main part of the lake by a short, wide channel. This lake is almost entirely surrounded by private residences, most of them in subdivisions, the majority of them gated subdivisions. Just to the north of Lake Winterset is Cypress Gardens Boulevard. About to the west is Lake Eloise; Dollar Lake and Round Lake are just to the southeast.
Although this is a large lake there is no public access to the lake shore, since it is totally surrounded by private property. Therefore, Lake Winterset has no public swimming areas or boat ramps. However, the Chain of Lakes canal system links Lake Winterset to many area lakes. A canal on the west side directly links the lake to Lake Eloise. Boats can use Lake Winterset and the public may fish from private boats entering the lake. "The Hook and Bullet" website says this lake contains flathead catfish, bluegill and largemouth bass.

Hundreds of professionals applied for the five directing spots available annually. In the eight years of Sanger's involvement, over forty five films were made; ten were nominated for an Academy Award, and three won.

Palomar Distant Solar System Survey

The Palomar Distant Solar System Survey (PDSSS) was a wide-field survey aimed at finding distant trans-Neptunian objects that used the robotic 1.2 m Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the QUEST large-area CCD camera.
The survey was specifically designed to identify putative members of a Sedna-like population with perihelia greater than 45 AU. The limiting magnitude of this study was 21.3 in the R-band, it was sensitive out to distances of 1000 AU, and 12,000 square degrees of sky were searched. This observing program was responsible for the discovery of 25 asteroids including trans-Neptunian objects and centaurs. (309239) 2007 RW10 and (229762) 2007 UK126 were among the objects discovered by this survey. It also redetected Sedna but no other objects in Sedna-like orbits were identified.

Community Energy Saving Programme

The Community Energy Saving Programme was an obligation on large UK energy companies to deliver energy saving measures to low income households. The obligation came into force on 1 September 2009 and ran until 31 December 2012. CESP was designed as a pilot for an area based obligation, and the subsequent Energy Company Obligation includes a more flexible area-based component, the Carbon Saving Communities Obligation.
Over 290,000 measures were delivered under CESP. Around half of these were forms of home insulation, and almost 40% were replacement boilers or heating controls provided with a new heating system. 
The programme delivered carbon savings of 16.31 million tons of CO2, 84.7% of the target. Progress was slow at first, and the majority of the savings were only achieved in the final six months of the three-year programme. 
Three energy suppliers complied with their obligations under CESP: EDF Energy, E.ON and RWE npower. Meanwhile British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power fell short, leaving Ofgem considering whether to impose a financial penalty. Four independent generators were also set targets, with which only Eggborough Power complied.

Hexshogi

Hexshogi is a shogi variant for two players created by George R. Dekle, Sr. in 1986. The gameboard comprises 85 hexagonal cells. The game is in all respects the same as shogi, except that piece moves have been transfigured for the hexagonal board-cell geometry.
Hexshogi was included in "World Game Review" No. 10 edited by Michael Keller.
Game rules.
Hexshogi has the same types and numbers of pieces as shogi, and all normal shogi rules apply, including a similar initial setup (see diagram), drops, promotion, check, checkmate, and impasse. As in shogi, pieces capture the same as they move. But the hexagonal geometry implies special move patterns for the pieces.
Piece moves.
The diagrams show how the unpromoted pieces move. As in shogi, a "dragon king" (promoted rook) moves as a rook, or as a king. A "dragon horse" (promoted bishop) moves as a bishop or a king.

Dertogada

Dertogada(ዴርቶጋዳ) is a novel written by Ethiopian author Yismake Worku. The book has three sequels: "Dertogada", "Ramatohara" and "Xantoxara". "Xantoxara" was released in 2012.
"Dertogada" ("We Never Hesitate") has thirty chapters within 272 pages. The book contains a poem of Lauriat Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin "The passion of Peter".
"Dertogada" was first published in Ethiopia’s national language, Amharic in 2009 by a young person called Yismake Worku, 22 years old at the time of publication.
The main characters are Shagiz Ejigu (Kitaw the real world Ethiopian scientist), Miraje, Zipporah, Meroda and Gera.
Yismake integrated local stories with international flavours making it a book suitable for readers of the globalised world. Apparently, it is now translated into English by Zelalem Nigussie making it available for international readership.
The story begins with a flashback. Amazingly constructed with arithmetic poem around Laurite Tsegaye Gebremedhin’s famous poem called the Passion of Peter, Dertogada requires the reader’s watchfulness, fusion and attention to detail. The plot of the book is an imbroglio in that it revolves around continents, various sequences and many causes and effects. You can also find many points of climax while reading the narrative thus keeping the reader intact to the action. 
Speaking about the theme of his book, Yismake in one of his recent interviews said,

Mendelssohn is on the Roof

Mendelssohn Is on the Roof is a book by Jiří Weil written in 1960 and first translated into English by Marie Winn in 1991. The book took 15 years to write. It is an exploration of the many forms of corruption in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia and embeds historical events, such as the assassination of Heydrich, among fictional stories concerning the holocaust, Nazi careerism and the rise of Nazism. 
It is set in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II. The book starts with a story about some SS officers who are tasked to remove a statue of the Jewish composer Mendelssohn from the roof of the Prague Academy of Music.

Dieudonné LaMothe

Dieudonné LaMothe (born 29 July 1954) is a Haitian long-distance runner, the first sportsperson from his country to take part in four Olympic Games.
Olympic Games.
LaMothe competed in the 5000 metres at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the marathon at the 1984, 1988 and 1992 Games. He finished last in the 5000 metres in 1976 and last again in the 1984 marathon, although in that case he nevertheless beat the 29 athletes who did not complete the course.
LaMothe was one of a number of Haitian runners sent to the Olympic Games by the "Baby Doc" Duvalier regime during the 1970s and 1980s - mostly picked from among Duvalier's personal friends - who gained notoriety by setting record worst times, many of which are still held. Other such athletes include Anilus Joseph, who started his 1972 10,000 metres qualifying heat too fast, leading the pack for two laps but dropping out with a mile still to run; Wilnor Joseph, whose 800 metres in 1976 took 2:15.26; and Olmeus Charles, who ran for over 42 minutes to complete the 1976 10,000 metres race.
In 1986, after the overthrow of Duvalier's government, LaMothe gave an interview in which he claimed to have feared for his life at the hands of the dictator's regime if he did not complete the 1984 marathon. According to LaMothe, he was told that he would take part in the Games only a fortnight before the team left for Los Angeles and received only $250 for his participation. He borrowed his running kit from two Americans and eventually completed the race in 2:52:18, in 78th and last place.
Although he hoped to achieve a top ten placing, LaMothe's best result in the Summer Olympics was 20th place in the marathon at the 1988 Games in Seoul, in a time of 2h 16m 15s. He was 38 years and 15 days old when he competed in the 1992 Games in Barcelona, making him Haiti's oldest ever participant in the Olympics.
Other competitions.
With funding from friends, LaMothe was able to take part in the 1985 New York City marathon, which he completed in 60th place. He won the bronze medal in the marathon at the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games and came sixth in the marathon at the 1987 Pan American Games. LaMothe still holds the Haitian record for the men's marathon of 2:14:22, achieved in France in April 1988. He won the 1996 Long Island Marathon by seven seconds.
LaMothe again represented Haiti in the 5000 metres at the 1991 World Athletics Championship but failed to finish his qualifying heat.

Kanhaiya is a 1959 Bollywood film produced by Sant Singh Pachhi and directed by Om Prakash. The film stars Raj Kapoor, Nutan and Lalita Pawar. The music was by Shankar Jaikishan.
Plot.
Shanno (Nutan) is devoted to Lord Krishna alias Kanhaiya, and often wanders off alone in the woods dancing and singing to the flute notes of her Kanhaiya. She accidentally meets Kanhaiya (Raj Kapoor), the village drunk and falls in his arms assuming him to be her ‘Kanhaiya’ – Lord Krishna. The gossip spreads that Kanhaiya and Shanno are having an affair, and in order to stay in the same village, they must get married. Shanno, still under the misconception regarding Kanhaiya is thrilled and gives her consent. During the marriage Shanno is shocked when she realises who "Kanhaiya" really is - the town drunk and idler who has taken advantage of her love for Lord Krishna, and now insists on marrying her. What the Village Panchayat does when Shanno refuses to marry Kanhaiya and is even ready to light herself on the funeral pyre to prove her piety, and how they cope when the village is swamped with plague, forms the basis for the rest of the story.

German submarine U-220

German submarine "U-220" was a Type XB submarine of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The U-boat was laid down on 16 June 1941 at the Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 626, launched on 16 January 1943 and commissioned on 27 March 1943 under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Bruno Barber.
The boat's service career began with training in the 4th U-boat Flotilla followed by reassignment to the 12th flotilla for operations.
In one patrol, the submarine sank two ships.
The boat was sunk in October 1943 by US aircraft in mid-Atlantic.
Service history.
Patrol and loss.
Following a short journey from Kiel to Bergen in Norway, the submarine set out on patrol on 8 September 1943 through the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, heading for the North American coast. Off St. Johns in Canada, she laid 66 magnetic mines on 9 October, one of which sank "Delisle" on the 19th. Also lost on the same day was "Penolver". The master of "Delisle" was trapped on the sinking ship by his wooden leg. He was freed, rescued and taken to a hospital, minus his leg. He could not be released due to the wartime shortage of artificial limbs, but his original leg was found, washed up on a beach and recovered.
In between these events, two men were lost overboard on the 16th.
"U-220" was sunk by depth charges dropped by Avenger and Wildcat aircraft from the carrier on 28 October 1943. Fifty-six men died; there were no survivors.

He returned to Stanford to earn an MBA, and worked briefly at Bain & Company before moving to Asia in 1983.
Yang spent sixteen years at Shell Electric (蜆殼電器) in Hong Kong and mainland China, where he served as executive director and deputy group managing director, and guided the company through its initial public offering and the sale of its fibre-optic business to JDSU. He moved to JDSU in 1999. Afterwards he became involved in venture capital and private equity. In 2003 he was appointed CEO of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company.
In academia and government.
Yang became Executive Vice President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2010.

As the Hong Kong Basic Law requires that principal government officials have no right of abode in any foreign country, Yang visited the U.S. consulate to renounce his U.S. citizenship in May that year.
In July 2012 Yang became the target of an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption regarding a government contract which a foundation he directed, the eInclusion Foundation, had obtained in 2010.

Jacques Leschassier (or Lechassier) (1550 – 1625) was a French jurist and magistrate, known for his erudition and Gallican views.
Life.
He was an "avocat" of the Parlement of Paris, and then "procureur-général" of the Parlement. He supported the Salic Law and in 1606 argued the case for Gallican ecclesiastical independence.
Leschassier put forward proposals around 1597, intended to help Henry IV of France get better control of royal officeholders, by designating the posts as fiefs.
At the time of the Venetian Interdict, the Venetian diplomat Pietro Priuli recruited Leschassier and Louis Servin to write in Venice's defence. These works argued that the position of the Church of Venice should be equated with that of the Gallican view of the situation of the Church of France. Leschassier then became an intimate correspondent of Paolo Sarpi.

Generations Lost

Generations Lost is a cinematic platform action game similar to "Flashback". It was created for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and was released to little or no acclaim.
Premise.
The player takes on the role of a young adventurous man named Monobe who is searching for the past of his people. He is only equipped with an arm-mounted device called an "e-rad" and what is believed to be magic armor. These devices allow Monobe to project energy bolts and create energy ropes to swing on in addition to his basic fighting skills delivering strikes with hands and feet and running jumping and rolling. The player will have to use his skills and his devices to traverse the many strange lands of the game in order to solve the mystery of his people.
Plot.
Monobe has always wanted to know the origins and destiny of his people. He is told by his tribal elder of the stories of old and given a set of technologically sophisticated armor and an arm-ounted gauntlet that projects a strange energy. Set for his journey, he leaves his people behind as he wanders through jungles and temple areas. His devices allow him to create energy ropes to swing across hazards too wide to jump and o project energy beams to stop dangerous foes. Along the way he must use the gauntlet device to open doors and to access different areas of the landscape which become increasingly futuristic and industrial. As he pursues his ultimate goal, Monobe finds out that he must collect pieces of the "captain's key" or "Cap Key" to access more areas and learn even more from unknown areas and peoples. Monobe soon discovers that this "world" he and his people live on is not a planet but a Generation Ship "Heritage" sent from Earth (via Luna Colony) in May 2037. Its purpose was to colonize a far flung world named "Hope", in an interstellar voyage that would put them in orbit around Hope in the year 2385. The "Heritage" was designed to support 20 generations of colonists. Monobe's discovery is made in August 2671; fortunately his ancestors built the ship to sustain life for at least 700 years. The unfortunate breakdown of protocol on board the vessel throughout the many generations meant that key systems were not maintained and the automatic descent systems that would have brought the "Heritage" down safely on Hope were not engaged so that the ship stayed in orbit for more than 200 years after arrival with its occupants unaware that they needed to disembark on shuttles to the planet below.

Both operations can be performed in time in the average case; when a self-balancing tree is used as the base data structure, this bound also applies in the worst case.
To turn a regular search tree into an order statistic tree, the nodes of the tree need to store one additional value, which is the size of the subtree rooted at that node (i.e., the number of nodes below it).

<doc id="36549053" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36549053" title="Star Sonata">
Star Sonata

Star Sonata is a space-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMO) released in 2004 that combines elements of action games and real-time strategy games such as real-time ship-to-ship combat and galactic conquest.
The game offers complex and involved commerce, construction and team systems. The goal for players in "Star Sonata" is to bring their team to domination and claim the seat of Emperor. "Star Sonata" belongs to the space opera genre established in computer gaming by "Galactic Empire" and "Elite".
The game is free to download and play for an unlimited period of time with level and game-play restrictions.
Gameplay.
"Star Sonata" is a space trading game, where players explore space and trade goods from one space station to another for economic gain. Players also control automated ships through programmed command sequences in order to patrol areas, assist in combat or engage in trade of commodities even while a player is offline. At higher levels, players build custom space stations on planets and moons to extract resources. Items can be manufactured on player-controlled space stations and bought from colonies on planets with ancient ruins.
Unlike many MMORPGs, combat in "Star Sonata" is in real-time and requires manual aiming. This results in a wide variety of combat tactics, such as dodging to evade enemy fire, using combat aids to deploy drones, boost shields or overload weapons, and maneuvering around terrain elements such as planets and asteroids which block attacks. "Star Sonata" also has an open PvP system in which players can attack other players near their skill level.
Conquest.
Teams of players may claim ownership of galaxies by building space stations on planets in order to control territory, exploit planetary resources and build colonies for trade and population expansion. By expanding their empires, teams compete to achieve a score in the top five with a sufficient percentage of the population of the universe, which enables them to make a claim for the Emperor's throne. If successful, their team leader will be crowned the Emperor of the Universe.
Universe resets.
A unique feature of "Star Sonata" is that the game's universe is randomized every few months in a Universe reset. This allows for the game to remain fresh for long-time players and for new players to have a chance to claim a star system for themselves. A reset triggers economic changes as supply and demand shifts for different items and resources in the new procedurally-generated universe of star systems.
Character advancement.
Character development is based on gaining levels through meeting fixed experience point requirements. Experience is earned by killing computer-controlled enemies and completing in-game missions. Players also earn skill points which can be spent on a variety of skills. Some skill sets are mutually exclusive, requiring the player to choose a particular focus for the character, such as a fighting style, space station management, or freight transport.
Development.
Developer Adam Miller said he designed "Star Sonata" "out of a nostalgic childhood dream of space adventure." After three years in development and a public beta, "Star Sonata" was released in October 2004. Development continued from 2004 to 2011, with features and content zones being added every few months.
In a January 2008 interview, Owner Jeff Landauer stated that 12,132 unique characters had logged in to play in the last 2 days and 11 hours. Landauer has also reported that the number of paying players increased from 300 in August 2005 to 854 in July 2008.
After beta sign-ups in August 2011, "Star Sonata 2" was released on November 12, 2011 with an upgraded client supporting 3D graphics and user interface improvements. In January 2012, the release of "Star Sonata 2" was publicized on Reddit, resulting in over a thousand new free-to-play players entering the game in one day. In July 2012, Landauer Games announced a major increase in paid staff for continued development and additions to "Star Sonata".
Reception.
In 2004, "Star Sonata" was reviewed by GameZone which gave the game an overall rating of 7.7/10, noting that the game offered "interesting options for controlling your own AI fleets and space stations." In 2005, the independent video game site Game Tunnel recommended the game for those who "enjoy exploring, conflict, and building a name for yourself" while noting that the game's PvP conflict "can badly affect new players" who are too weak to fight back. The updated "Star Sonata 2", released in 2011, was one of 3 role-playing games listed on "Gamespy’s 101 Free PC Games of 2012".

Arthur Lutze

Arthur Lutze (June 1, 1813 – April 11, 1870), was a major figure in medicine and regimen in Germany due to his establishment of a major homeopathic clinic and spa in Köthen, Germany in the mid-1800s. He was also known for his advancement of a particular approach in the use of homeopathic medicines, known as dual remedy prescribing, after it was ostensibly dropped (though only publicly, not in private practice) by others, including Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of the homeopathic approach. His decision in 1865 to release a version of the much awaited, but long delayed publication of the last, 6th edition of Hahnemann's "Organon der Heilkunst", which included a disputed paragraph created by Hahnemann for the 5th edition, but subsequently withdrawn for political reasons within the homeopathic medical community in Germany, resulted in a strong protest from more conventional homeopaths.
Early life.
Born in Unter den Linden, he was raised on the family estate at Arthursberg near Stettin. Losing both parents early in his life, he then started work as a postal clerk in 1830. It was during this time that he became interested in homeopathy and decided after many years of private study to dedicate himself to this profession, and left the postal service in 1843. Lutze gave an impassioned eulogy in Mühlhausen on the occasion of the death of Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, that very same year.
He started practicing homeopathic medicine in Potsdam, treating thousands of patients, mostly free of charge. In 1845 he moved to Köthen, where Hahnemann had earlier practiced, before moving to Paris in his final years, and became quite successful in healing, even attracting comments about being a "miracle healer." The famous portrait artist for Goethe, William of Kügelgen, commented on his appearance "a short, stocky figure with a large yet beautiful and intelligent head…and a tremendous prophet's beard" [„eine kurze gedrungene Gestalt mit einem großen aber schönen und intelligenten Kopf … und ein ungeheurer Prophetenbart … (aus: Jugenderinnerungen , Berlin 1870).]
Lutze studied medicine more formally and received his doctorate in 1848 in Jena, based on a dissertation concerning cataract surgery, "De cataractae extractione". In 1854 he decided to construct a homeopathic clinic, the largest ever at the time in the world, raising the money personally in a such a short time that it was able to open its doors in 1855. The clinic, built in Renaissance style, is still standing. It contained several large wards and 72 private rooms for well-to-do patients, a park, various spas, library, art gallery and observatory. The poor were treated, as was Lutze's custom, for free. By 1864, some 26,690 patients had been handled, and the hospital received over 162,000 inquiries from around the world. The clinic remained in operation until 1914. It was recently restored.
Part of Lutze's approach also involved dietary and regimenal aspects and he published a popular pamphlet called "Lebensregeln der neuen, naturgemäßen Heilkunde" (which went through 64 printings). Many of his ideas reflected ideas that Hahnemann had also developed early in his career, such as he published in Friend of Health in 1791. In his often innovative combining of regimen and medicine, his clinic was one of the first "wellness" clinics in the West.
However, it is the use of homeopathic approach to medicine that was the most dominant in his clinic and which also became the most controversial, not so much from non-homeopathic medical circles, but from within the homeopathic ranks themselves. The success of his methods are on record, and his clinic was a widely recognized success, but he aroused opposition from contemporary homeopathic doctors. The main reason for the controversy had less to do with his success, and more to do with Lutze's development of an approach to prescribing that had been developed by Hahnemann and a few others, but which met fierce opposition initially when it was revealed, in the 1830s. Lutze's revival of the method of using two remedies at a time and also his restoration of a deleted section from the 5th edition of Hahnemann's "Organon der Heilkunst" on the method, created what is known as the "Dual Remedy Affair."
The Dual Remedy Affair.
Background.
To understand the important role played by Lutze in homeopathy, it is important to understand the background of his decision to use a dual remedy approach in prescribing, seemingly counter to the principle laid down by Hahnemann regarding 'one remedy at a time.' In the Spring of 1833, Samuel Hahnemann received a letter (dated 15 May) from a Dr. Karl Julius Aegidi (1795–1874), one of his closest followers, setting out the positive clinical results (233 cured cases) using a new approach to the use of remedies, using two remedies at the same time., which was seemingly contrary to the advice Hahnemann had been giving in the past 4 editions of his "Organon der Heilkunst", the main work on homeopathic medicine. Hahnemann replied on 15 June 1833 and stated that he was "delighted that such a happy idea has occurred to you" and based on the proviso that each remedy must be "homeopathically suitable, but each from a different side," Hahnemann further stated that "the procedure is so consonant with the requirements of our art that nothing can be urged against it." (Haehl, Vol II, p. 85).
Here Hahnemann was referring to basic principles that he had laid down in his foundational work, "On A New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs", 1796 concerning two 'sides' of disease, namely those of a fixed nature and those of a variable nature. Further, Hahnemann also had identified two sides to the life force ("Lebenskraft") and two phases to the disease process: the initial ("Erstwirkung") action of the disease agent impinging on the generative side ("Lebens-Erzeugungskraft") of the life force, and the counter or after action ("Gegenwirkung" or "Nachwirkung") of the sustentive side ("Lebens-Erhaltungskraft") of that same life force (see Romantic Medicine: Details of Heilkunst). Thus, the concept of 'at a time' ("auf einmal") meant for Hahnemann that one could not give a second remedy normally within the initial action of the first remedy. With crude doses, this initial action could be hours or minutes, but with higher potencies Hahnemann had discovered that the initial action was very short and almost instantaneous and thus could accept Aegidi's approach to the extent it also used remedies 'in smallest dose or by olfaction'. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85) Later, when Hahnemann continued use of the dual remedy approach, he decided to be more cautious and used one remedy in the morning and another in the afternoon as related in his case books from the last years of his life in Paris.
Hahnemann also mentioned that von Bönninghausen (or Boenninghausen as he was Dutch), another very close follower, "is entirely of our opinion and acts accordingly." Indeed, Hahnemann went so far in his enthusiasm and praise, that he offered to present this discovery by adding a special section in the about to be published 5th edition of the "Organon". In the 15 June letter, Hahnemann also notes that Jahr, editor of the homeopathic medical journal, "Archiv", in which Aegidi would also publish about the dual remedy approach, was in on the matter. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85) Two days later Hahnemann wrote to von Boenninghausen confirming that he had started to use the dual remedy approach and would add something on it to the 5th Edition. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253) Hahnemann had already been made aware of the use of dual remedies and wrote to Aegidi on 28 April 1833, to be cautious in their use. (Haehl, Vol I, p. 393) Further, in the paragraph Hahnemann wrote for the 5th Edition and had already sent to the printer, he notes that the use of dual remedies is similar in concept to his previous use of two remedies in quick alternation. (O.A. Julian1984, p. 42 quoted in an article by De Ruyter, Dr. Eddy, Homeopathic Drainage Treatment According to Vannier, Homeopathy Online, Vol. 6) 
Another homeopathic historian writes "Another extremely interesting feature of Hahnemann's practice at this time is his use of two remedies at once."
Boenninghausen later wrote of the origin of the idea, a certain Dr. Stoll in Cologne around 1832-33, who thought that "two kinds of medicine should be combined in a prescription in order to supplement each other.".
However, around this time, Hahnemann was engaged in a dispute, often acrimonious, with most of the homeopaths in Leipzig, over the mixing of homeopathic and allopathic methods ("venesection, leeches, emetics, laxatives, etc."). Hahnemann was concerned to fight any kind of co-option by the prevailing medical system. Indeed, one of his major opponents in German medicine more generally was Hufeland, a very influential figure at the time.
Another point of dispute was his publication regarding the nature and origin of chronic diseases, which was seen by many as misguided and unfounded, though they praised the actual remedies for treatment. (Haehl, Vol II, p. 163) Hahnemann and the Leipzig homeopaths had agreed to meet on 10 August 1833 to try to resolve their differences. At this "peace" conference, Hahnemann decided, in light of its success, to raise Aegidi's proposal for dual remedy prescribing, but as the British Journal of Homoeopathy of July 1865 explains, "Hahnemann was persuaded that this would probably lead to the polypharmacy of the old school, and he decided to exclude this doctrine from the new edition of the 'Organon'". However, the matter itself was not seen as contravening any homeopathic principle laid down by Hahnemann, as it was not mentioned at all in the "peace agreement" of 11 August 1833. (Haehl, Vol. I, p. 200) On 19 August, Hahnemann wrote to Aegidi and repeated his approval of the use of dual remedies and confirmed that he had indeed written a new paragraph for insertion in the 5th edition as "my only wish is that the world should gain the best, the most useful truth." (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 85)
However, scarcely a month later, concerns about the misunderstandings that his new paragraph might cause, as pressed on him by the 10 August meeting with the Leipzig homeopaths, led him to decide to withdraw the disputed paragraph (as stated in a letter of 15 September 1833 to von Boenninghausen). He was mainly concerned that his main opponent, Hufeland, would use it against him, to discredit homeopathy. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253) While Hahnemann, in his correspondence with von Boenninghausen, still accepted "the possibility that two well-chosen remedies may be given together with advantage in some cases" he felt he had not had enough experience himself to yet endorse it publicly, particularly given its controversial nature. (Haehl, Vol. II, p. 253-4)
Thus, instead of the new paragraph, Hahnemann withdrew it and altered the existing aphorism 272 of the 4th edition by adding a footnote to it. Far from being a condemnation of the double remedy approach, Hahnemann here repeats essentially what he had written to Boenninghausen. While for many, this was the end of the affair, the case book evidence shows that Hahnemann continued to experiment with dual remedies, though in a slightly different form. In writing to Aegidi on 9 January 1834, Hahnemann was at pains to ensure that only those who really under­stood the new insights continue the use of dual remedies in mixture, and then not in the full public glare. (Haehl, Vol. I, p. 393-4)
It should not be surprising then that Lutze, when he heard of the use of dual remedies from Aegidi, and then knowing that this had been supported, publicly at first, then privately, by Hahnemann himself, as well as Boenninghausen, and learning of its efficacy, decided to apply the method as well in his large clinic. When his results were as successful as the others, the silence on this matter and the delay in the releasing of the final, 6th edition of Hahnemann's "Organon", caused him to decide finally to make public the deleted portions regarding dual remedy prescribing in 1865.
Suppression of the historical record.
Hahnemann died in Paris in July 1843, survived by his second wife, Melanie. He had been working on another revi­sion of the "Organon" in his last two years, and had notified his German publisher of a new edition in February 1842. However, Hahnemann died before the new, 6th edition could be completed for publication. There was a great deal of anticipation around this new edition, but for various reasons, including a need for some editing of the annotations in Hahnemann’s handwriting and a reluctance by his widow to release the new edition unless it could be published in a form completely faithful to Hahnemann’s wishes, the 6th edition was held back.
Negotiations were underway in 1865 between Melanie Hahnemann and prominent American homeopaths for the publication of the much awaited 6th edition, when Dr. Arthur Lutze of Köthen, concerned that the true story might not emerge, published what he claimed was the intended 6th edition of the "Organon". This edition contained, most importantly, the disputed paragraph on dual remedies intended for the 5th edition, which had been taken out of that edition for political reasons, as we have seen. Dr. Lutze, a key figure in the history of homeopathy, is the one about whom the least is known, or about whom the least has been written.
Lutze informs us that in 1853 he first learned about the use of dual remedies in mixture from Aegidi himself. Sometime during the period 1854-7, Boenninghausen reported his successful use of dual remedies to Lutze. Whatever concerns there were about the negative political effects of publication (in terms of the fight against allopathy) must have been out­weighed, in his mind, by the tremendous benefits for suffering humanity that Lutze experienced personally in his practice. The resultant publication by Lutze in 1865 of the miss­ing chapter from the 5th edition of the Organon unleashed a storm of protest and a concerted effort to deny the facts of the historical record, or at least to bend them to the prevail­ing orthodoxy of the single remedy. Lutze had already published a book in 1857 on his experiences involving dual remedy prescribing in "many thousands" of cases.
In 1897, a unique monument was erected in Köthen by sculptor Henry Pohlmann (1839–1917) to honor Hahnemann and Lutze. This is a monument that Haehl mentions as being particularly notable for its beauty and provides a picture for us to admire (Vol. 1, p. 368). It is located in the park opposite the clinic Lutze, corner of Spring Street / Theatre Street in Köthen. A photo taken by Ralph Lotys shows the monument today.

Bloom.fm was a London-based mobile-focussed music service which combined free streaming genre and artist based radios, music discovery tools, a local library player and a catalogue of over 22 million tracks. The service allowed users to 'borrow' songs, making them available for offline playback. The maximum number of stored tracks was determined by the subscription level.
Bloom was only available in the United Kingdom on iOS and Android. A Web version was supposedly in development and was originally set for release at some point in 2013 – as of April 2014, however, it has not been made available. On the 30th of April 2014, The owners of Bloom.fm, Digital Distribution Networks, announced that they were to shut down, due to lack of funding.
History.
Bloom.fm was officially launched in January 2013 on iOS, previously being available to several thousand beta testers. The service reached 250,000 registered users in August 2013.
The Android app was released in September 2013.
Features.
Catalogue.
As of September 2013, approximately 22 million tracks were available on the service, including content from EMI, Sony, Universal, and Merlin (representing over 120,000 independent labels) and various independent labels through aggregators such as TuneCore, IODA, The Orchard, PIAS, AWAL, Ditto, and CD Baby.
Warner Music was the only major label not to have licensed its content to the service.
Radio.
The free tier of the service offered over 150 genre-based radios. Additionally, users were able to start a new radio based on most artists on the service.
Borrowing.
Bloom.fm referred to the process of caching the track on a device as ‘borrowing’. This allowed offline playback. The tracks were available to a user for the duration of the subscription.
Discovery.
The artist discovery interface allowed the user to explore related artists by tapping the icon in the bottom left of the player.
Playlists.
Playlists of two types were available to all paying consumers. Normal playlists were created by manually adding borrowed tracks to them and smart playlists were created automatically by borrowing tracks from the predefined radio channels.
Local content.
The application supported integration and playback of local music libraries. This feature was available for free on all tiers. The company expressed a desire for the app to become the default music player for all users.
Pricing.
The service offered a free tier (Bloom Zero) that gave the user access to streaming genre radio channels as well as artist-based radios.
The service was noted for a low entry price point. The subscription tiers determine the number of tracks the users could store on their devices simultaneously. The entry-level £1 subscription allowed the user to borrow and store 20 tracks, the £5 tier had an allowance of 200 tracks and the £10 subscription allowed unlimited streaming and borrowing.
Notably, the subscription prices were different on the website of the service and Apple’s App Store. The company explained the higher prices in the App Store by stating that Apple took a 30% cut of in-app purchases.

Definition.
The definition of schizophrenic numbers is given in The Universal Book of Mathematics as:
The sequence of numbers generated by the recurrence relation formula_1 described above is
The integer parts of their square roots,
alternate between numbers with irregular digits and numbers with repeating digits, in a similar way to the alternations appearing within the fractional part of each square root.
History.
Clifford A. Pickover has said that the schizophrenic numbers were discovered by Kevin Brown.

Plot.
When the team takes on the case of Emily, a six-year-old girl who has numerous preexisting health problems, they must work with her mother Elizabeth, who is a doctor who specializes in her daughter's condition. The team must also deal with the battles raging between Emily's mother and father who have conflicting views on how to handle her health issues. When searching the family's home for clues to Emily's illness, the team realizes that Elizabeth's determination to cure her daughter could be the very thing that is killing her. Meanwhile, House and Wilson deal with Wilson's stage two cancer at House's apartment. Wilson feels that going forward with the more radical treatments first would be the best way to deal with it instead of dying a slow death, and this puts his life in jeopardy.

Shackled (film)

Shackle () is a 2012 Indonesian horror film directed by Upi Avianto. The film is set in Jakarta and involves Elang (Abimana Aryasatya) who has nightmares about an unknown woman in a car with a man in a rabbit suit and dead bodies in the back. Elang later sees this woman in a bar and explains that she's been evicted from her apartment. Elang's nightmares grow worse after he is told by the woman that men had raped and tortured her. Elang agrees to accompany her to face them.
"Shackle" had its premiere at the Puchon International Fantastic Festival where it was shown in competition on July 20, 2012.
Reception.
"Shackle" received a mixed review from Film Business Asia, who stated that "on a psycho-horror level there's nothing new or inventive here. "Shackle" isn't bad, it's merely routine". Twitch gave the film a mixed review, opining that "With a tighter, more adventurous script, there is no doubt that Upi Avianto has the talents behind the camera to deliver an effective thriller of great beauty and dramatic substance. While Belenggu is not that film, it nevertheless makes a confident positive stride towards accomplishing that in the future." "Variety" gave the film a generally positive review, noting that "Though Elang's backstory is a little too sketchy for a little too long, Avianto's imaginative storytelling and the pic's unsettling visual and aural atmosphere should keep most auds absorbed until the triple-reverse finale."

In 1965 he became Chief Architect and Planning Officer for Runcorn new town, developing the master plan and where he hired James Stirling to develop designs for new housing.
In 1970 he moved to Milton Keynes in north Buckinghamshire, at that stage little more than a line on a map, to be General Manager of Milton Keynes Development Corporation at the young age of 39. He oversaw the through to 1981. Thereafter, he joined up with Terence Conran (of Habitat fame) to establish the new architecture and planning consultancy Conran Roche. The company developed a number of successful projects during the 1980s including Butler's Wharf and Michelin House in London. Ill health forced him to retire as managing director in 1988.
