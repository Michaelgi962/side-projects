Judicial Conference of the United States

The Judicial Conference of the United States, formerly known as Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, was created by the United States Congress in 1922 with the principal objective of framing policy guidelines for administration of judicial courts in the United States. The Conference derives its authority from , which states it is headed by the Chief Justice of the United States and consists of the Chief Justice, the chief judge of each court of appeals, a district court judge from each regional judicial circuit, and the chief judge of the United States Court of International Trade.
History.
Responding to a backlog of cases in the federal courts, Congress enacted in 1922 a new form of court administration that advanced the institutionalization of an independent judiciary. The establishment of an annual Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, later to be known as the Judicial Conference of the United States, culminated more than a decade of public debate on the reform of judicial administration. The Conference of Senior Circuit Judges provided the first formal mechanism by which members of the federal judiciary might develop national administrative policies, reassign judges temporarily, and recommend legislation.
Chief Justice William Howard Taft, appointed to the Supreme Court in 1921, had led a public campaign for federal judicial reform since leaving the White House in 1913. Taft proposed the appointment of at-large judges, what he called a "flying squadron," that could be assigned temporarily to congested courts. In Taft's plan, a conference of judges would serve primarily to assess the caseload of the lower courts and assign the at-large judges to courts in need. Taft, supported by a group of federal judges and legal scholars, hoped that the establishment of a more efficient federal judiciary would deflect the efforts of Senator George W. Norris and others who advocated an end to life tenure on the federal bench and the restriction of the lower federal courts' jurisdiction.
By the time Taft became Chief Justice, the increased caseload resulting from World War I and the enforcement of Prohibition had contributed to broad support for reform of the federal judiciary. Assuming a role as leader of the judiciary as well as the Supreme Court, Taft joined with Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to urge legislation. A large majority in Congress agreed with the need for reform, but both the Senate and the House of Representatives insisted on revising Taft's proposals so that they conformed more closely to the traditions of the federal judiciary.
Congress established an annual conference of the Chief Justice of the United States (or the senior associate justice if the Chief is unable), and the senior circuit judge (now called the chief judge) from each judicial circuit and charged the conference with a general mandate to advise on the administrative needs of the federal courts. The act required the senior judge in each district to prepare an annual report of the business of the district's court. The conference would use these reports to prepare suggestions for the temporary transfer of judges, pending the approval of all courts involved. This expansion of the authority to transfer judges fell far short of Taft's concept of a permanent corps of at-large judges. Congress established 24 temporary judgeships, but adhered to the principle of fixed residency for district judges. Congress also declined to make the attorney general a member of the conference, although the act permitted the Chief Justice to request the attorney general to report on the business of the courts. Even without a formal relationship with Congress or the Department of Justice (which then administered the federal courts), the conference offered the judiciary a means of communicating its administrative needs.
The conference was renamed the Judicial Conference of the United States in 1948. In 1956, Congress provided for the inclusion of the chief judge of the Court of Claims. At that time, the judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA) declined to include a representative on the conference. The size of the conference nearly doubled following an act of 1957 that provided for the appellate and district judges in each circuit to elect a district judge to represent the circuit on the conference for a term of three years. In 1961 the chief judge of the CCPA began serving on the conference. The chief judges of these Court of Claims and the CCPA served on the conference until 1982 when their courts merged to become the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In 1990, Congress provided for the inclusion of the chief judge of the United States Court of International Trade. In 1996, Congress expanded the district judge term up to five years and allowed senior district judges to serve.
Present tasks.
Five standing Advisory Committees of the Judicial Conference have been established, and are charged, respectively, with drafting proposed amendments to the:
Members of the Advisory Committees include judges, representatives from the Department of Justice, law professors, and practicing attorneys. The Advisory Committees propose rules, subject them to public comment, and then submit them to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, which in turn submits them to the Judicial Conference, which recommends them to the Supreme Court for approval. Explanatory notes of the drafting Advisory Committee are published along with the final adopted rules, and are frequently used as an authority on the interpretation of the rules.
Other active policy areas concern the operation of CM/ECF, the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, and PACER, the electronic public access service for United States federal court documents.
Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
The Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) is the administrative agency of the United States federal court system. The AO is the central support entity for the federal judicial branch. It provides a wide range of administrative, legal, financial, management, program, and information technology services to the federal courts. It was established in 1939.
The AO is directly supervised by the Judicial Conference, and implements and executes Judicial Conference policies, as well as applicable federal statutes and regulations. The AO facilitates communications within the judiciary and with Congress, the executive branch, and the public on behalf of the judiciary.

Sulaiman Khan Karrani

Sulaiman Khan Karrani (reigned: 1566–1572) was a ruler of Bengal since the death of his elder brother Taj Khan Karrani. According to the "Riyaz-us-Salatin", he shifted the seat of government from Gaur to Tanda.
Sulaiman, his brother Taj and Sulaiman's sons Bayazid and Daud Khan Karrani ran a short-lived Afghan vassal state of Mughal emperor Akbar in Bengal. They dominated the area while Sulaiman paid homage to the Akbar. The Afghans defeated by Akbar began to flock under his flag. The Afghans were not technically the rulers of Bengal, the post was primarily nominal.
Relation with Akbar.
Sulaiman Khan Karrani did not establish his own coinage during his reign, an act that would have been tantamount to declaring statehood to the ruling Mughals. He also honored Akbar as the supreme ruler of Bengal by requiring that mosques read Akbar's name in the Khutbah, the sermon at the Friday congregational prayers in Bengal. Historians cite these acts as keeping the diplomatic peace between Bengal and Mughal Empire during Akbar's lifetime.
Conquest of Orissa.
Though northern India and parts of southern India were ruled by the Muslim rulers, they had not yet been able to conquer Orissa. In 1568 Sulaiman Khan sent his son Bayazid Khan Karrani and the famous general "Kala Pahar" against the last Orissan Gajapati king Mukunda Deva. After a few major battles against the Orissans, and aided by civil war elsewhere in Orissa, Sulaiman was able to bring the entire area under his rule. Kalapahar sacked the Jagannath temple and took Puri under control. Sulaiman Karrani appointed Lodi Khan and Qutlu Khan Lohani governors of Orissa and Puri respectively.
Conquest of Koch Bihar.
Sulaiman Khan Karrani then sent general Kala Pahar against the Kamata (later Koch Bihar under the Mughals) king Vishwa Singha. Kala Pahar crossed the Brahmaputra River and advanced as far as Tejpur (modern-day Dinajpur District, Bangladesh). Kala Pahar defeated and captured the Kamata general Shukladhwaja, third son of Bishwa Singha.
Death and succession.
After a tranquil and peaceful ruling for seven years Sulaiman Karrani died in 11 October 1572, leaving his empire to his son, Bayazid Khan Karrani.
Religion.
Sulaiman was a pious Muslim living a life observing all religious rituals. He built the Sona mosque in old Maldah.
The historian `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni mentions that every morning Sulaiman would hold a devotional meeting with 150 Shaikhs and Ulama and only thereafter would go about transaction of state business

Therapeutic garden

A Therapeutic Garden is an outdoor garden space that has been specifically designed to meet the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of the people using the garden as well as their caregivers, family members and friends.
Therapeutic Gardens can be found in a variety of settings, including but not limited to hospitals, skilled nursing homes, assisted living residences, continuing care retirement communities, out-patient cancer centers, hospice residences, and other related healthcare and residential environments. The focus of the gardens is primarily on incorporating plants and friendly wildlife into the space. The settings can be designed to include active uses such as raised planters for horticultural therapy activities or programmed for passive uses such as quiet private sitting areas next to a small pond with a trickling waterfall.
Design.
The design of a Therapeutic Garden is ideally a collaborative effort involving the people using and caring for the garden. The development of the garden is typically accomplished by a design team of landscape architects, garden designers, horticultural therapists, healthcare professionals, such as doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, gerontologists and other staff members. Additional stakeholders involved may include, if appropriate, the patients or residents themselves and their respective family members and other caregivers. The design team is often led by a landscape architect or garden designer, specifically trained in the design and development of Therapeutic Gardens. It is strongly recommended horticultural therapists presence in the design process, since they are professionals specialized in the use of the gardens as a therapeutic tool, who know all the potentialities of a garden for this purpose, since it is their working tool with people with disabilities or illness.
The majority of elements in a Therapeutic Garden should be plant related, such as perennials that attract hummingbirds, shrubs that attract butterflies and water features for gold fish and Koi. Plants familiar to those using the Therapeutic Garden need to be non-toxic and non-injurious. Issues related to sustainability of the garden, such as using native plants and rain water harvesting, should also be considered in the overall design. Attracting nature, such as butterflies, gold finch and hummingbirds into the Therapeutic Garden, is important. Nature is referred to as a ‘positive distraction’ by Roger Ulrich, Ph.D. at Texas A&M University. Other considerations include providing ample shade, movable furniture, water features, smooth and level walking surfaces, and year round interest. Consideration should also be given to the maintenance and upkeep of the Therapeutic Garden as safety is an important consideration. An endowment fund can be set up for the perpetual maintenance of the Therapeutic Garden.
Elements.
The elements of a Therapeutic Garden consist of the following:
Natural elements: 
Constructed garden elements:
Nature.
Spending time outside in a garden has been shown to positively affect a person’s emotions and improve their sense of well-being. Access to nature balances circadian rhythms, lowers blood pressure, reduces stress and increases absorption of Vitamin D. Nature has been shown to be beneficial for our overall health and well-being. We are all connected to nature and it is important to maintain this vital connection for our health and well-being, which is described in the work ‘The Biophilia Hypothesis’ by Edward O. Wilson.
Garden Programs.
Healing gardens for hospitals have put a new emphasis on creating garden programs where patients can go. The programs are usually based on the discipline of Horticultural Therapy.
This model takes the form of the Swedish Covenant Hospital system. Landscape artist David Kemp has a business on the East Coast of the United States designing healing gardens for hospitals.

The Garden Company Limited

The Garden Company Limited () is a Hong Kong-based bakery and confectionery manufacturer. The company was one the first Chinese owned businesses created to sell Western-style food products in the territory. They also made bread and confectionery more affordable for lower-income earners.
History.
Founded in 1926 by cousins Tse Fong Cheung and Wah O. Wong in Kowloon with a single bakery. The company's name is named for the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.
Unlike most firms in Hong Kong, Garden was a pro-China company and supplied bread to the Chinese army during World War II. The firm closed operations during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945. The company expanded with the growth of Hong Kong before and after World War II and benefited from the influx of immigrants.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Garden products were shipped overseas to Chinese communities around the world.
Today, the company remains family (Cheung family) owned with several joint ventures with mainland Chinese firms. Its is one of few Hong Kong firms with operations still in Hong Kong.

John Leng Sturrock

John Leng Sturrock (1878 – 22 July 1943) was a Scottish newspaper publisher and Liberal politician.
Family and education.
John Leng Sturrock was born in Newport-on-Tay, Fife. He was educated at the High School of Dundee and at University College, Dundee. In 1925 he married Winifred, the daughter of William Anning JP of Torquay. They had one son and a daughter. Sturrock’s grandfather was Sir John Leng, a journalist and newspaper proprietor, who was Member of Parliament for Dundee from 1899-1906. His great-uncle was Sir William Christopher Leng, who was also a newspaperman and active in Conservative politics in Sheffield.) He owed his middle name to the Leng family connection and sometimes hyphenated his surname to Leng-Sturrock.
Career.
Sturrock followed the family trade and was himself originally a journalist but later entered the newspaper publishing business and became managing director of John Leng & Co. Ltd, newspaper publishers.
Politics.
Coalition MP.
Sturrock was selected as Coalition Liberal candidate - that is as a supporter of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George - for Montrose Burghs for the 1918 general election. He faced no Independent Asquithian Liberal candidate and the Unionists did not oppose him, so he presumably received the Coalition coupon. He won the seat in a straight fight with another journalist, Labour candidate H.N. Brailsford by 9,309 votes to 2,940 a majority of 6,369.
1922-1924.
Sturrock held his seat at the 1922 general election, this time standing as a National Liberal i.e. a supporter of the Lloyd George wing of the Liberal Party. However he was unable to take part in the campaign due a serious illness. He again faced no challenge from the Conservatives or the Independent Liberals but this was a much tighter contest against a new Labour candidate Mr. J Carnegie. Sturrock received 8,407 votes to Carnegie’s 7,044 a majority of 1,363. He again defeated Carnegie in a straight fight in the 1923 general election, this time gaining 8,717 votes to Carnegie’s 7,032 a majority of 1,685. 
From 1920-1922 he was secretary to the Coalition Liberals in the House of Commons.
Constitutionalist.
Sturrock stood down from Montrose Burghs at the 1924 general election and contested Tottenham North as a Constitutionalist. He lost narrowly to Labour Co-operative candidate Robert Morrison by 557 votes. Although there was never a Constitutionalist Party with a central organisation, a number of candidates stood under this label in 1924 in constituencies where local Conservative and Liberal parties collaborated and where individual Liberals received Tory support against socialism. The best known of these candidates was Winston Churchill who had fought a by-election at Abbey Division of Westminster in March 1924 as a Constitutionalist and who then contested Epping in Essex at the general election in October 1924 under the same banner.
Death.
Sturrock died on 22 July 1943 aged 65 years in a Dundee nursing home.

Fine rolls

The fine rolls record offers of money to the Monarchs of England for concessions and favours from the 12th to the 17th centuries. 
In general, a fine is an agreement made with the king, or one of his chief ministers, to pay a certain sum of money for a specified benefit. In some cases the sum of money was paid immediately. However, in the vast majority of cases this did not happen. More often than not, the sums recorded on the fine roll, whether given or fined for, were monies that had been promised to the king, and which had yet to be collected. Moreover, the king did not receive this money directly. Rather, it was collected by, and paid into, the Exchequer at Westminster.
The rolls on which the fines were recorded provide the earliest systematic evidence of what people and institutions wanted from the king and what he was prepared to give.
Overview.
Those working within Exchequer knew what money to collect because copies of the fine roll were sent to them in installments throughout the year. This is why in the rolls there are intermittent notes (sometimes in the margin, sometimes in the body of the text) ""hinc mittendum est ad scaccarium"", "from here it is to be sent to the Exchequer". The note identifies the point at which the last installment of the fine roll had been dispatched to the Exchequer, and where a new one had to be prepared. A typical note from October 1219 reads: 
From here it is to be sent to the Exchequer and what is above has been delivered to the Treasurer the Exchequer by the hand of R de Neville.
Ralph de Neville here is the keeper of the seal and the man in day-to-day charge of the Chancery, the king’s writing office. The copy of the fine roll sent to the Exchequer was known as the "originalia roll". On receipt of the originalia roll, the Exchequer transferred the debts to the "summonses", that is, the list of debts which it sent twice annually to the sheriff for him to collect and pay into the treasury. Simultaneously, the Exchequer copied the debts onto the Pipe roll (the annual record of the audit of all money owed to the crown) where they were placed, county by county, under the heading ""nova oblata"", "new offerings". On the rare occasions when fines was paid direct to the king (usually into his personal department, the Chamber, or as it became known later, the Wardrobe) a note was added to the fine roll stating that the fine in question should not be sent to the Exchequer. This meant that the debt would not be placed on the originalia roll.
The fine rolls also include a lot of material that was unrelated to fines but of importance to the Exchequer. For example, they contain various letters relating to the rates of debt repayment, the taking of land into the king’s hands on the death of a tenant-in-chief, the seizure of land in cases of rebellion, the taxation levied on the royal demesne (including the Jews), and the terms of appointment to sheriffdoms and the custody of manors. Sometimes, when the relevant letters were addressed to the sheriff or another official, the intention, it may be supposed, was to keep the Exchequer informed of them through a copy on the originalia rolls. In other cases, where the letter was addressed to the Exchequer in the first place, it was probably entered on the fine roll rather than the close roll because of a growing belief that the former was the more appropriate roll for that type of Exchequer business. The rolls are now kept at The National Archives (TNA), Kew.
Creation and composition.
The earliest fine rolls.
The origins of the fine rolls can be traced to the late-twelfth century. The earliest rolls that survive come from the reign of Henry III’s father, King John of England (r. 1199–1216). Six rolls survive from John’s reign, covering the king’s first, third, sixth and ninth regnal years. After 1208 the rolls are lost until that for year regnal year fifteen (1213–14). Another roll survives for regnal year seventeen. The nomenclature of John’s rolls is not fixed. The headings of the surviving rolls vary from ""oblata recepta"", "offers received" to ""rotulus finium receptorum"". The rolls that survive for John’s fifteenth and seventeenth years are titled ""rotulus finium"" "roll of fines". This heading is used exclusively on the rolls of Henry III’s reign (r. 1216–1272). 
The fine rolls in the reign of Henry III (1216–1272).
In form, the fine rolls of Henry III are much like those of King John’s last years. As with all the Chancery rolls, a new set was opened each regnal year. The Henrician fine rolls therefore run from 28 October (the date of Henry’s first coronation) to 27 October. The rolls were written on membranes of parchment in a heavily abbreviated Latin cursive, the membranes being sewn end to end. In the roll for John’s first year, the membranes are only 195 mm to 225 mm wide. Thereafter, they expand, with those for 1213–14 and 1215–16 varying in width between 320 mm and 370 mm, roughly their size under Henry III. The membranes could also vary in length, although usually within comparatively narrow limits. For example, the thirteen membranes of the roll for 1228–29 are between 460 mm and 560 mm long, with a fairly uniform width of 340–350 mm. The total length of the roll is 6,480 mm or 21 and a quarter feet. The rolls down to 1234 typically contain between nine and thirteen membranes and include roughly 300 to 500 separate items of business. In contrast, the fine rolls from 1234–1248 are longer, containing 400–800 items of business. In certain years, often when the king spends time on the Continent, more than one roll is employed during a single regnal year, one being kept in Chancery and the other (or others) itinerating with the king. In its English translation, the roll for 1229–30 includes some 35,000 words. Some later rolls have 10,000 words more.
Like other Chancery rolls in the minority of Henry III, and the last years of King John, the fine rolls were written in duplicate, though only down to 1227. It is clear that the duplication was accomplished by one roll being copied from the other. Thus the second roll omits cancelled entries found on the first roll, yet incorporates many of its amendments. Many but not all, for it is equally clear that it was the first roll which was the main working copy. Thus changes made after the second roll had been drawn up were often included on the first roll but not the second. As a result of these differences, the second roll, although sometimes written more carelessly, has a neater appearance than the first one, lacking the alterations and having smaller gaps between entries and fewer changes of ink and hand. The impression is that the first roll was entered up at much shorter intervals than the second roll. The purpose of the second roll was doubtless to provide back up in case of loss or damage, but there may have been more to it than that. Another possibility is that the rolls were associated with different ministers. At the Exchequer there were two copies of the pipe roll, one belonging to the treasurer, the other, to the chancellor. Likewise there were two memoranda rolls (largely though not entirely with the same business), one drawn up by the king’s remembrancer and one by the treasurer’s. In respect of the fine rolls, it may be that the first roll was the king’s roll and the second the chancellor’s. 
Historical value.
The fine rolls of King Henry III are central to the study of politics, government and society in a reign – the third longest in English history – which saw the implantation of Magna Carta into English political life and the beginnings of the parliamentary state. The rolls reveal what the king was prepared to give his subjects and what his subjects wanted from the king. The social range of those involved in making fines expanded during the reign, as did the type of the concessions for which they paid. Earls, barons, knights, freemen, peasants, women (particularly widows), Jews, ecclesiastics and ecclesiastical institutions, towns and townsmen are all found in the rolls. The fines made by magnates and ministers for major favours (for example, the concession of marriages and wardships) are a vital source for the workings of royal patronage. The fines made for exemption from knighthood and local office cast important light on the aspirations and changing structures of the gentry. The gigantic expansion in payments for writs to initiate and further legal actions is key evidence for the widening scope of the common law. The fines to set up new markets and fairs reveal the commercialisation of the economy, as those for permission to create new private parks and warrens show rising social aspirations. The new material which enters the rolls (and some of the old) makes them a major source for the death of tenants-in-chief, the running of local government, the exploitation of the royal demesne, the taxation of towns, the position of the Jews, and (through orders for the seizure of land), the course of politics in periods of crisis. Throughout, the rolls are full of evidence of family relationships and social networks, the last through the long lists of backers which those making fines had sometimes to supply. 
All this material is on the rolls without them losing their intimate relationship with the king. On the roll for 1207–08 there is the extraordinary offer of 200 chickens made by the wife of Hugh de Neville to be allowed "to lie one night with her lord, Hugh de Neville." Was she John’s mistress and were the two of them joking about what a night back with Hugh would be worth, the answer a ridiculous 200 chickens? On the roll of 1242–43 we have an example of Henry III’s rather more benign sense of humour. In the ship sailing home from Gascony, "having a joke" ("ludendo") at the expense of his clerk, Peter the Poitevin, he invented and recorded on the fine roll a whole series of risible debts which Peter supposedly owed: "five dozen capons for a trespass in the ship; 28 casks of wine from the arrears of the wine which he bought for the use of the king at Mussak where he dreamed he saw the emperor Otto" and so on. Henry was careful, however, not to let the joke go too far. Doubtless after Peter had been baffled and perhaps alarmed by the sight of his obligations, Henry ordered them, "Peter not looking", to be crossed out with the result that they never reached the originalia roll and the Exchequer.
Publication of the fine rolls.
Despite their compelling interest, the fine rolls of King Henry III have never been properly published. Whereas those of King John appeared in full Latin text, edited by Thomas Duffus Hardy, under the auspices of the Record Commission, in 1835, those of King Henry were only afforded a series of excerpts, selected exclusively on the basis of genealogical interest, which ran to some 10–15% of the content of the rolls. These were edited by Charles Roberts and published in two volumes by the Record Commission in 1835–36, under the title "Excerpta e Rotulis Finium in Turri Londinensi asservatis Henrico Tertio Rege A.D. 1216–1272". There was no subject index and the indices for people and places were completely inadequate. Consequently, the use made of the fine rolls by such historians of the reign of Henry III as E. F. Jacob, R. F. Treharne and Sir Maurice Powicke, writing between the 1920s and 1950s, was limited to the printed "Excerpta". The briefing paper that circulated at the first meeting of the Public Record Office Consultative Committee on Publications, which met on 27 November 1947, observed that "Among Chancery Records a full text of the Fine Rolls, Henry III is still needed to supersede the Record Commission’s "Excerpta"". This was considered amongst "the most outstanding needs."
After an abortive attempt in the mid-1970s, by Dr. David Crook at the then Public Record Office, to make a calendar of the rolls, it was Dr. Louise Wilkinson who conceived the project which has at last led to their publication. A committee was formed consisting of Wilkinson, David Carpenter of King's College London’s History Department, Harold Short, Director of King’s College’s Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH), and David Crook and Aidan Lawes of The National Archives. This group put together a bid to the Arts and Humanities Research Board (now Council) seeking funding for a three-year project which would publish the rolls down to 1248, a second (ultimately successful) bid being envisaged for another round of funding which would carry publication down to the end of the reign in 1272. The bid was successful and work began in April 2005.
The Henry III Fine Rolls Project.
Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and combining King's College London’s Department of History and Centre for Computing in the Humanities, along with The National Archives and Canterbury Christ Church University, The Henry III Fine Rolls Project is a unique and pioneering enterprise which aims to democratize the rolls by making them freely available in English translation through its website http://www.finerollshenry3.org.uk/. The fine rolls are the first medieval source to be treated in this way.
From the start, the project has endeavoured to make the fine rolls as usable and available as possible to as wide an audience as possible. To that end, the Latin text has been turned into English. Although this has been done in a way comparable to that found in the great series of Chancery roll calendars published by HMSO in the last century (hence the title Calendar of Fine Rolls for the Reign of Henry III for the new series), the English rendering is in fact much fuller than that found in many PRO calendars, and amounts almost to a full translation. Within the translation, another departure from old PRO practice, all place names, and toponymic surnames, where identifiable, have been modernised, with a record of original forms being kept in the index. There are also full indexes of persons, places and subjects. Publication in book form (published by Boydell and Brewer) is complemented by publication of the translation and indexes on the Project’s website where the text, encoded electronically, is linked to a sophisticated search engine and digitised images of the original rolls. The form of reference is the same whichever version is used. 
Since December 2005, members of the fine rolls project team, as well as members of the general public, have been contributing "fines of the month". These short articles focus on a single, or group, of fines and show how material from the rolls can be used to shed new light on the politics and society of thirteenth-century England. Anyone can contribute a "fine of the month". A prize is awarded for the best "fine of the month" at the end of the year. Previous fines of the month can be accessed from the project’s website.

Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila

The Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila is a lost palace in the Borgo of Rome (between Castel Sant'Angelo and the Vatican), designed by Raphael for Giovanbattista Branconio dell'Aquila, a papal advisor and goldsmith.
It was designed by the Italian artist in his last years of life, around 1520. The palace was demolished around 1660 together with the adjoining block, named "Isola del Priorato" after the nearby Priory of the Knights of Malta, to open a square in front of Saint Peter's Square colonnade, the Piazza Rusticucci.

Carleton F. Burke Handicap

The Carleton F. Burke Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. Raced in late October as part of the Oak Tree Racing Association series, it is open to horses age three and older and is contested on turf at a distance of one-and-one-half miles (twelve furlongs). The race is named in honor of Carleton F. Burke, the first chairman of the California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) who later served as the Director of Racing at Santa Anita Park.
From inception in 1969 through 1994, the Carleton F. Burke Handicap was raced at 1 miles. It was run in two divisions in 1975 and 1978. 
A Grade I event as recently as 1989, the Carleton F. Burke Handicap held a Grade III classification until 2011. The race was not run in 2008 and 2009 in order to accommodate the Breeders' Cup races. When the Santa Anita fall meet was moved to Hollywood Park in 2010, the race was not run again. As a result, the American Graded Stakes Committee announced that the race was not eligible for grading in 2011. If a race is not run for two consecutive years, it is not eligible for grading.
On October 9, 1977, Double Discount won this race in a world record time of 1:57 for 1 miles on turf.

Nelson J. Beach

Nelson John Beach (September 21, 1800 Hebron, Tolland County, Connecticut - February 22, 1876 Watson, Lewis County, New York) was an American surveyor, businessman and politician from New York.
Life.
He was the son of John Beach (1770–1845). The family removed from Litchfield, Connecticut, to Watson, NY, in 1814. He married Emily Porter, and their children were George Byron Beach (d. 1870) and Anna Lydia Beach.
Beach became a land surveyor, and was engaged on the survey of a highway through the wilderness, projected to run from Crown Point on Lake Champlain to Carthage, Jefferson County, New York.
An Act, passed on March 29, 1828, by the New York State Legislature, allowed Nelson J. Beach to erect and exploit a toll bridge over the Black River between Lowville, NY, and Watson, NY.
He was Supervisor of the Town of Watson from 1831 to 1834, from 1837 to 1838, and in 1845. He was a Whig member of the New York State Assembly (Lewis Co.) in 1846, and of the New York State Senate (5th D.) in 1847. Here he advocated the construction of the Black River Canal.
He was one of the first three Canal Commissioners elected in 1847 under the New York State Constitution of 1846, and drew the two-year term, being in office from 1848 to 1849. In 1849, he ran for re-election on the Whig ticket, but was defeated by Frederick Follett. From January 1850 to November 1852, he was a Canal Appraiser. In 1854, he became Vice-President and Superintendent of Construction of the Hudson River Railroad. In 1855, he resigned this post, and accepted the appointment as Resident Engineer on the Eastern Division of the New York State Canals, remaining on the canal work for two years. Afterwards he took charge of the abandoned Ogdensburg, Clayton and Rome Railroad and closed up its affairs.
In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him Assessor of Internal Revenue for the counties of Jefferson, Lewis and Herkimer.

Balto (character)

Balto is a title character and the protagonist of the film "Balto" and its related sequels. However, the character is based on the real dog of the same name.
Development.
The character of Balto was based on a real dog that lived in Nome in 1925. Similarly to the film character, the real Balto gained fame as the lead dog of a sled team that was the last team on a mission to relay antitoxin to Nome, where an outbreak of diphtheria was occurring. While the real Balto was a Siberian Husky, the film instead portrays Balto as a wolf/husky hybrid.
Character Background.
In the film series, Balto is said to be the offspring of a female wolf and a male husky. According to Balto, he was separated from his mother while he was young, and was raised by Boris, a snow goose. As a result of his wolf heritage, Balto was disdained by most of the citizens and relentlessly teased by the dogs of Nome.
Personality.
The first film revealed that, possibly as a result of his treatment, Balto was insecure regarding his wolf heritage. Citizens of Nome generally feared him due to misconceptions about his wolf-like appearance. Despite this, Balto is very wise, patient and cares deeply for others, and is very courageous. He is also very humble and selfless, willing to give up his own life to make sure that others were safe. He usually tries to avoid using force, in favor of intelligence. He also appears to possess leadership traits. By the time of the second film, Balto has apparently come to terms with what he is but does not tell his pups about their lineage until his daughter Aleu is threatened by a hunter. Balto is shown to have a love for dog-sled racing and later develops a love for flying in the third film.
Physical Traits.
Balto is mostly grey-brown, with a lighter underbelly. He is described as having large paws, which he attributes to his wolf heritage. He is shown to be one of the swiftest dogs in town as well as the fastest, after winning a race in the first film. As an additional result of his wolf-heritage, he has keen senses, and is fairly strong. Balto is shown to be capable to climbing a cliff, as well as holding his own in a fight with a bear.
Film Appearances.
Balto.
Balto is first seen watching a dog sled race, when he notices a young girl named Rosy lose her hat. Balto outruns the incoming team to retrieve the hat, partly to impress Jenna, Rosy's husky. However, Rosy's father warns Rosy away out of fear of Balto's wolf heritage, hurting Balto's feelings. Later, he runs into Steele, the lead dog of the winning team, who taunts Balto regarding his hybrid status.
That night, Balto attempts to romantically flirt with Jenna, but she is distracted. Her owner, Rosy, has become quite sick, worrying Jenna. Balto leads Jenna underneath the doctor's office, where the two overhear the doctor give the diagnosis. Rosy, along with several other children, has contracted diphtheria. While antitoxin could cure her, the doctor is out and must wait for an incoming shipment.
When other methods of transporting the antitoxin fail, the medicine is shipped by rail. Because the rail line ends at the town on Nenana, a sled team will transport the medicine from Nenana to Nome. Out of a desire to help the children, Balto decides to enter a race which would choose the fastest dogs for the sled team. Balto wins easily, but is barred from the team when Steele reveals Balto's wolf heritage, by stomping on Balto's foot (the musher assumed that Balto was aggressive). When the team is later reported lost, Balto makes the decision to track them down. Though Boris and Jenna, along with Polar Bears Muk and Luk, follow Balto, Balto is forced to go on alone when Jenna is injured in a fight with a grizzly bear.
Balto soon finds the team in dire straits. The musher has been injured, stranding the team. Balto offers to lead the team back, but Steele, the lead dog who have lost his mind and gone insane, refuses. Steele attempts to attack Balto, but falls off a cliff. Balto takes over as lead dog, but becomes lost because Steele deliberately changed the marks Balto used to mark the trail. Balto, and the medicine fall off a cliff. Balto is uninjured, but presumes that he has failed. A wolf soon appears and attempts to communicate. Balto turns away, but then notices the unharmed crate of medicine. Balto realizes that his wolf heritage can be a strength and howls with the wolf as a sign. Balto is able to drag the crate up the cliff, and reunite with the team.
After facing several other perils, Balto is able to safely lead the team home by relying on his sense of smell. Balto and the team eventually return home to a grateful Nome. The other dogs who are in the boiler room realizes they been lied by Steele and Dixie smacks Steele in the face for his lies and they angrily leaves him behind ignoring his pleads. He is invited into the Doctor's office, where a recovering Rosy thanks Balto for his actions.
Balto was voiced by Kevin Bacon in this movie.
Balto II: Wolf Quest.
The film shows that Balto has fathered a litter of puppies with Jenna. All of the puppies look like Jenna except for the final puppy, Aleu, who is said to look and act more like a wolf even than Balto does. As a result, Aleu is not adopted like her siblings and lives with Balto until she is one year old. For a time, Balto is troubled by reoccurring dreams involving a raven and a pack of wolves. Aleu is kept ignorant of her wolf heritage until she is threatened by a hunter for her wolf-like appearance. Balto reveals that he knew little of his mother, except that she had white fur, because they had been separated when he was young. However, Aleu chooses to run away. Balto tracks Aleu, following the raven from his dreams. Eventually he finds her, but Aleu wishes to learn who she is and refuses to return home.
The two eventually encounter a pack of wolves led by the elderly, but wise Nava. Balto learns that the pack is starving because their main food source, caribou, disappeared the year before. One wolf, Niju, wants to steal food from other creatures to survive. Nava tells of visions that he has been given by the white wolf, Aniu, that a new leader will take over and lead the pack. Nava believes Balto to be the destined leader of the pack. Aleu is somehow able to discover, through a mysterious ability, that the caribou had crossed an ice bridge to another area the year before. Balto decides to lead the pack across when the bridge reforms. When the time comes, Nava is separated and Aleu goes back to assist him. The two are nearly attacked by Niju, but Balto intervenes. Balto soon realizes that the pack is leaderless. Nava is too old to make the swim, and so Aleu decides to remain and lead the pack, fulfilling Nava's visions. Balto decides to return home, but before he can, he sees Aniu, the white wolf, and realizes that "she" was his wolf mother.
Maurice LaMarche took over Balto's voice after Bacon left the project.
Balto III: Wings of Change.
In the third film, Balto becomes fascinated with flying. He befriends a plane pilot named Duke (voiced by Keith Carradine) and helps his son, Kodi (played by Sean Astin) win a sled race. Later on in the race, Duke crashes along with Boris in it. Balto, arriving back at Nome, thinks that something has gone amiss.Balto asks Kodi if he would help him find Duke. Kodi refuses and Balto sets alone to find Duke and Boris. Later on Jenna scolds Kodi for not following Balto. Kodi persuades his team to go and help his father. Balto along with Stella and Muk and Luk find Boris And Duke until a moose attacks them. After the moose is occupied by another moose, then Luk finds Boris and they head home except Balto. Balto hauls Duke over a sheet of metal and heads back to Nome. When Balto wasn't far from Nome he almost plunges off a cliff leaving Balto and Duke almost falling off. Soon, Kodi and his team come to the rescue and help Balto the rest of the way to Nome. At the end of the film, Duke rebuilds his plane and names it the 'Balto Flyer' and Balto's dream is fulfilled when Duke gives him a ride.

Psalter of Saint Louis

The Psalter of Saint Louis (Bibliothèque nationale de France MS Latin 10525) is an illuminated psalter created for the saint King Louis IX of France sometime between the death of his mother Blanche of Castile in 1253 and his death in 1270. There are 78 miniatures of Old Testament scenes starting at the story of Cain and Abel and ending with the coronation of Saul, a calendar of feast days, prayers and the 150 psalms. The psalter is in excellent condition and considered a relic of Louis IX, who was canonized in 1297. 
It is not to be confused with the "Leiden St Louis Psalter", (Latin, Parchment, 185 folios, 24,5 x 17,7 cm. 23 miniatures. Historiated initials. Northern England, 1190-1200. Leiden, University Library: BPL 76A) originally produced for Geoffrey Plantagenet, Archbishop of York, probably in northern England in the 1190s. The manuscript passed into the hands of Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX how to read as a child, as a 14th-century inscription records. After the king's death it passed through a number of royal owners, including the Valois Dukes of Burgundy, being regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.

<doc id="21479579" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21479579" title="German heraldry">
German heraldry

German heraldry refers to the cultural tradition and style of heraldic achievements in modern and historic Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, including national and civic arms, noble and burgher arms, ecclesiastical heraldry, heraldic displays and heraldic descriptions. German heraldic style stands in contrast to Gallo-British, Latin and Eastern heraldry, and strongly influenced the styles and customs of heraldry in the Nordic countries, which developed comparatively late. The German heraldic tradition is noted for its scant use of heraldic furs, multiple crests, inseparability of the crest, and repetition of charges in the shield and the crest. Mullets have six points (rather than five as in Gallo-British heraldry), and beasts may be colored with patterns, (barry, bendy, paly, chequy, "etc."). As in other European heraldic traditions, the most prominent among the birds and beasts are the eagle and lion. These two charges in particular had a special significance in Germany, where the eagle became symbolic of the Holy Roman Empire, and the lion came to represent certain feudal lords. As the political divide between these groups grew in the late Middle Ages, the heraldic eagle and lion came to represent two of the foremost political powers in Germany, the house of Hohenzollern and the house of Welf, respectively.
Terminology.
The heraldic tinctures are the same in Imperial heraldry as in other European countries. Black charges occur on red fields and vice versa more often than in other countries, as in the arms of Stadler, Roder and Homberg. Tinctures are described using the German words for each (i.e. "schwarz" for sable, "rot" for gules, "gold" for Or, etc.), and argent is usually called "silber" (silver) though "weiß" (white) also occurs. The furs are referred to as follows:
Ermine is "Hermelin", Ermines (or counter-ermine) is "Gegenhermelin", Erminois is "Goldhermelin", Pean is "Gegengoldhermelin", Vair is "Feh" or "Grauwerk", Countervair is "Gegenfeh", and Vairy of (tincture) and (tincture) is "Buntfeh ob (tinktur) und (tinktur)".
Furs known to German heraldry include "Hermelin" (ermine), "Gegenhermelin" (counter-ermine, which is rare), "Feh", also sometimes termed "Grauwerk" (vair), "Buntfeh" (which the English call "vairy"), "Krückenfeh" (potent) and "Kürsch" (natural fur, which is unknown in English heraldry). Kürsch is typically shown as dags of fur overlapping like roof tiles, and even ermine and vair are sometimes shown in this fashion, called "Schuppenfeh". While each of these variations and some others exist in German heraldry, it is worth noting that even ermine is uncommon, vair is seldom found, and the others are rarer still.
As in English heraldry, the names for the lines of division and variation are closely related with those of the corresponding ordinaries. The apparent exceptions to this rule, however, are that a shield divided "per fess" is simply termed "geteilt" (divided) and a shield divided "per pale" is termed "gespalten" (split). German heraldry (and with it, Nordic heraldry) does take a distinct approach to divisions of the field, however, in dividing by the scheme of ""im (Gemeine Figur)-schnitt (X:Y) (Richtung des Schnitts),"" or, "by (common charge)-section (X:Y) (direction of the cut)," where "X" signifies the number of charges issuant above the cut, and "Y" signifies the number issuant below. Thus, "Im Lindenblattschnitt (1:1) schrägrechtsgeteilt", or, "by linden leaf section (1:1) party per bend," yields a line that starts at the dexter chief corner, slanting down per bend, then makes the form of two conjoined linden leaves (the first inverted) in pale, and then continues to the sinister base. This also works with many other charges, and may divide the shield per pale, per fess, or other ways.
History.
One of the earliest examples of heraldry originated with the emperor Charlemagne, who erected an imperial eagle at his palace after his coronation in the year 800, establishing the eagle as the enduring symbol of the empire for subsequent centuries. The seal (German: "Siegel") was used extensively in the late Middle Ages, and was instrumental in spreading heraldry to the various institutions. According to Volborth, "the custom of the warrior-caste of using their arms on seals made this kind of pictorial identification fashionable and led to the adoption of arms by anybody using a seal." Noble women began using armorial seals in the 12th century. Heraldry spread to the burgher class in the 13th century, and even some peasants used arms in the 14th century. German burgher arms may have played a key role in the development of Swedish heraldry, especially in Stockholm, which had a large German population in the late Middle Ages.
Heraldic elements.
Charges.
In heraldry, a charge is any object or figure placed on the shield, whether placed on the field, on an ordinary, or even on another charge. In German heraldry, as in other European heraldic traditions, the most commonly used charges include the cross, the eagle, and the lion. Unlike other traditions, however, German heraldry features charges, especially lions, colored with patterns such as barry, paly, chequy, "etc." For instance, the coats of arms of Hesse and Thuringia each depict a lion barry argent and gules. The Manesse Codex (10r) displays Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's eagle chequy sable and gules, and (262v) shows a backgammon player bearing a lion chequy argent and sable. Lions and other charges colored with furs, such as ermine, and semés, but not barry or chequy, are found in French heraldry.
Due to the early practice of marshalling by dividing the marshalled arms through the middle of the charge (called "dimidiation"), some charges took on the appearance of being themselves divided, such as the arms of Hochtaunuskreis. Even as marshalling "per pale" (charges remain intact and are shifted to accommodate the division of the shield) supplanted dimidiation, some marshalled arms retained some aspects of dimidiation, yielding a half eagle on one side and a whole lion on the other in some cases, such as the arms of Goslar. Similarly, when the crosier was incorporated into the arms of Biberach, the result was the dexter half of an imperial eagle and, in the sinister half of the shield, a (whole) crosier.
Eagles and lions.
The two most commonly occurring animals in heraldry, the lion and the eagle, bore special political significance in medieval Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. Neubecker asserts that this "heraldic antagonism... makes the eagle the symbol of imperial power and the lion the symbol of royal sovereignty." According to Neubecker:
In the heroic poem by Heinrich von Veldeke based on the story of Aeneas, the bearer of the arms of a lion is set against the bearer of the arms of an eagle. If one takes the latter to be the historical and geographical forerunner of the Holy Roman emperor, then the bearer of the lion represents the unruly feudal lords, to whom the emperor had to make more and more concessions, particularly to the powerful Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, Henry the Lion (1129–1195) of the house of Guelph. Duke Henry did not bear arms in the technical sense, but he used a naturalistic picture of a lion as a seal and erected a monumental and lifelike bronze lion outside his castle of Dankwarderode in Brunswick. It was left to his descendants to adopt a formal coat of arms, with two lions passant, which was derived from the arms of England, which had three such lions. Henry referred to himself in Latin as "Henricus Leo"... in German, "Heinrich der Löwe" and "Heinrich Welf" (Guelph).
According to Neubecker, the German imperial eagle goes back to the ancient Romans, and the newly crowned emperor Charlemagne erected an imperial eagle – a symbol that would carry over all the way to modern Germany – at his palace at Aachen. From the 13th century, Neubecker continues, the view was generally held that the eagle of the emperor should have two heads, while that of the future emperor should have one, a policy that was codified by the emperor Sigismund in 1401. The imperial double eagle was again resurrected by the emperor Francis II and became the symbol of the Austrian Empire.
In medieval Germany, the eagle also represented the house of Hohenzollern. Even while the double eagle became the symbol of the Holy Roman Empire and the emperor, the single-headed eagle became the symbol of the German king. The emperor even granted certain princes and free cities in the empire the right to use the imperial eagle as supporter. Notably, the minnesinger Reinmar von Zweter formed the wing bones of his heraldic eagle into a second and third head.
Helmets, Crests and Mantling.
German coats of arms are frequently depicted in period sources with a helmet and crest over the shield, often surrounded by mantling. Helmets, which were almost always included in period rolls of arms, were indicative of the bearer's social status. Open helmets, for example, were reserved for the nobility, while burgher arms were allowed a closed helmet. The Prince-Bishops used a mitre in place of a helmet, and other princes of the empire used a coronet. Typical of the German/Nordic style, the primary charge and the colors/patterns of the shield are usually repeated in the crest. Two or more helmets and crests are sometimes found in period armorial rolls of noble arms. Mantling is issuant from a torse (wreath) on the helmet, and is almost always colored with the primary metal and lined with the primary paint of the head shield.
In German heraldry, where multiple crests appear frequently after the 16th century, each crest is always treated as inseparable from its own helmet and turned in agreement with the helmet. Multiple helmets were usually turned inward, with the center helm (if an odd number) turned affrontê, while in Scandinavian heraldry the helmets were usually turned outward. The arms of the last margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach consist of a shield with twenty-one quarterings topped with a record thirteen helmets and crests.
Supporters.
[[File:Die deutschen Kaiser Adler.jpg|thumb|right|The Kaiser Eagle]]
As in other heraldic traditions, a coat of arms may be depicted with or without supporters, and many achievements of arms do not include supporters. When supporters are present, they may include human, animal, or mythical creature supporters, which typically flank the head shield, although this was not always the case. According to Volborth, "as a sign of favor, the emperor granted certain princes of the empire the right to use the imperial eagle as supporter," in which cases the imperial eagle was depicted singly, circumscribing the head shield.
Mottoes.
Mottoes were seldom used in medieval German heraldry, although they became popular in the late 19th century. Some notable German mottoes include, "Gott mit uns" ("God with us"), "In deinem Licht sehen wir das Licht" ("In Thy light, we see the light"), "Meine Zeit in Unruhe, meine Hoffnung in Gott" ("My time in trouble, my hope in God"), "In Gott ist meine Zuversicht" ("In God is my confidence"), and "Gott allein die Ehr" ("To God alone the glory"), while other notable German mottoes have been rendered in Latin rather than German, however, such as ""Pro gloria et patria"".
National heraldry.
The German eagle is one of the oldest state symbols in Europe, tracing its roots to the reign of Charlemagne. The black eagle, with red beak and claws, displayed on a gold shield, is also displayed on the German government flag. The imperial eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, similarly, was a black eagle displayed on a gold shield, but it usually had two heads, whereas modern German state heraldic displays feature a single-headed eagle.
Municipal heraldry.
All the German states have coats of arms, as do the city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen). Most were composed when the states joined the Federation, but draw on previous influences. These cities typically bear a large open crown over the shield, a privilege granted under German town law. While the origins of these arms vary, including inherited noble arms, arms depicting local landmarks, and canting arms (a visual pun on the city's name), most of these coats of arms are based on an earlier sigil or city seal used to authenticate documents in the Middle Ages.
The coat of arms of Berlin depicts a black bear upon a white shield, crowned overall in the fashion of German/Nordic city-states. have prominently featured a bear since the 14th century, and bears were used as supporters even earlier. An eagle appeared on the first seal of Berlin in the 1250s, and was soon supported by bears. The eagle and the bear changed their positions and attitudes but remained together in the seals and arms of Berlin until around 1600 when the eagle went on hiatus, returning by 1700 and remaining into the 20th century.
Modern arms either represent the history of the state, or their parts, or both. For example, the arms of Baden-Württemberg specify that they represent Baden, Württemberg, Hohenzollern, Palatinate, Franconia and Further Austria.
The Red Eagle of Brandenburg is said to have been adopted as early as the 10th century and endures today.
A 14th-century seal of Bremen featured a key, symbolizing Saint Peter, and this symbol endures to the present coat of arms of Bremen.
The coat of arms of Hamburg, since a city seal dating from 1245, have featured two stars over a white castle upon a red shield. Note that the stars have six points rather than five, in the custom of German/Nordic heraldry.
Trier, the oldest city in Germany, is represented by a haloed Saint Peter, the patron saint of the city, holding the key to the city in his right hand and the Bible in his left. Older city seals show Saint Peter holding up his key and surrounded by the city wall, often with the inscription "Sancta Treveris" ("Sacred Trier"). From the 13th century, the Archbishop of Trier was one of the three ecclesiastical Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.
The arms of Weimar, since the 14th century, has depicted a black lion rampant upon a semy of red hearts on a gold shield.
Ecclesiastical heraldry.
There was no structured Church heraldry until the 17th century, when a formalized system for ecclesiastical hats attributed to Pierre Palliot came into use. The full system of emblems around the shield was regulated in the Catholic Church by the letter of Pope Pius X "Inter multiplices curas" of February 21, 1905. The composition of the shield itself was regulated and registered with the Heraldry Commission of the Roman Curia, but since this office was abolished by Pope John XXIII in 1960, shield design has had no official guidance. The Collegio Araldico (College of Heraldry) in Rome is recognized by the Holy See but has no enforcement powers, and the "Annuario Pontificio" ceased publishing the arms of Cardinals and previous Popes after 1969. International custom and national law govern limited aspects of heraldry, but since 1960, shield composition has depended on expert advice.
Marshalling.
If a bishop is a diocesan bishop, it is customary for him to combine his arms with the arms of the diocese following normal heraldic rules. This combining is termed marshalling, and is normally accomplished by impalement, placing the arms of the diocese to the viewer's left ("dexter" in heraldry) and the personal arms to the viewer's right. In Germany and Switzerland though, quartering is the norm rather than impalement.
Personal heraldry.
Noble arms.
The Armorial Wijnbergen contains 168 arms of German nobles (vassals of Philip III of France) dating from c. 1270 - c. 1285, including Henry of Petersheim (blazon: "Gules billetty a lion rampant argent") and Ferry II of Daun, lord of Oberstein (blazon: "Argent fretty sable").
Burgher arms.
Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire since Charles IV began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court” (), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.
The tilting helmet was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. this privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city patricians. Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, e.g. in Swedish heraldry.
After the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the Kingdom of Saxony, where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918. Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms are protected by law.

Epidendrum flexuosum

Epidendrum flexuosum, a reed-stemmed "Epidendrum" common at mid-altitudes in Central America, is a species of orchid commonly called "Epidendrum imatophyllum". It grows exposed to intense sunlight in the forest canopy, particularly on "Guava" species. "E. flexuosum" bears non-resupinate lavender flowers on a congested raceme at the end of a long peduncle.
In the wild, "Epidendrum flexuosum" grows naturally together with a nest of ants, and sometimes bees, wasps, or hornets, which protect it from predators. This species is very difficult to grow without the ants, a phenomenon found in other genera such as "Caularthron", "Coryanthes", and "Sievekingia".
Description.
"Epidendrum flexuosum" has been placed in the subgenus "E". subg. Amphiglottium and shares the characteristics of that subgenus: it exhibits a sympodial growth habit with slender, unswollen stems covered by close distichous sheathes which are foliaceous on the upper sections of the stem; the inflorescence is terminal and covered from its base by distichous sheathes; and the lip is adnate to the column to its apex. The ligulate leaves have a small notch in the obtuse end. The stem, including the peduncle, is flattened. As is typical of the section "E". sect. "Schistochila", the inflorescence is a raceme, and the lip is lacerate. The lilac flowers are non-resupinate. The dorsal sepal is lanceolate and recurved, the lateral sepals are falcate, and the petals are rhombic with lightly fringed to irregular margins. As is typical of the subsection "E". subsect. "Carinata", the lip is trilobate and has a keel, or carina, running down the center. In the case of "E. flexuosum" the lip is almost oval-shaped: Dodson & Bennett 1989 use the phrase "lip obscurely 3-lobed." The column is slightly s-shaped.
The chromosome number of an individual collected in Mamirauá, Brazil has been determined as 2n = 28

Sant'Eligio degli Orefici is a church in Rome, Italy. It is located in the rione Regola, near via Giulia, on a corner of the via of the same name that ends below the Lungotevere dei Tebaldi, a few blocks northwest of the Palazzo Farnese.
Initially designed by Raphael for the Guild of Goldsmiths when they split off from the Guild of Ironworkers in 1509 and dedicated to their patron saint Eligius, it was completed by Baldassarre Peruzzi and Bastiano da Sangallo. Besides his work on St Peter's Basilica, this is the only church in Rome that, although partially, can definitely be attributed to Raphael. Its cupola is attributed to Baldassare Peruzzi and the interior is also by Raphael, in a Bramante-like style, though the present façade is early 17th century and by Flaminio Ponzio.

<doc id="21479645" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21479645" title="Exercise trends">
Exercise trends

Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work. This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor saving technology in the home, and less active recreational pursuits. At least 31% of the world's population does not get sufficient exercise. This is true in almost all developed and developing countries, and among children. Some experts refer to sitting as "the new smoking" because of its negative effects on overall health.
These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: obesity, heart disease, stroke and high cholesterol. Active transport (walking, bicycling, etc.) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia. Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality.
Causes of lack of exercise.
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization. As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.
Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people, women, and the elderly.
A number of factors has been associated with physical inactivity at a population level including: female gender, older age, living with a partner, smoking, little schooling and poverty.
Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the prevalence of obesity. A 2008 meta analysis found that 63 of 73 studies (86%) showed an increased rate of childhood obesity with increased media exposure, and rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television.
Another cause in the case of children is that physical activity in activities from self-propelled transport, to school physical education, and organized sports is declining in many countries.
Symptoms.
Noncommunicable diseases, partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest public health problem in most countries around the world. Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity, which makes inactivity one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide.
Countries.
Australia.
Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness.
Canada.
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts. In Canada, 27.0% of sedentary men are obese as opposed to 19.6% of active men. Lean people are more fidgety than their obese counterparts; this relationship is maintained even if normal weight people eat more or the obese person loses weight.
National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day. As well, although 2/3 of families live close enough for their children to bike or walk to school, only 1/3 report actually walking to school and 80% report never having cycled to school.
Asia and China.
A study from China found urbanization reduces daily energy expenditure by about 300–400 kcal and going to work by car or bus reduced it by a further 200 kcal.
A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s. The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities. In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor. This decreased to 51% in the year 2000.
Among Asian children between 1917 and 2003 little change has been seen in power and speed however endurance has decreased substantially in the last 10–15 years.
Finland.
In Finland leisure-time physical activity has increased, while occupational and commuting physical activity has decreased from 1972 to 2002. Leisure-time physical activity increased from 66% (1972) to 77% (2002) in men and from 49% (1972)to 76% (2002) in women. Physically demanding work decreased from 60% (1972) to 38% (2002) in men and from 47% (1972) to 25% (2002) in women. Daily commuting activity decreased from 30% (1972) to 10% (2002) in men and from 34% (1972) to 22% (2002) in women.
Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, walking and cycling as a means of transport is stable since 1994. The average Dutch citizen in the year 2007 walks and cycles per year.
South America.
Over 60% of the population of Brazil, Chile, and Peru do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity needed to maintain health. A study of a southern Brazilian population found that >80% of the population was physically inactive.
Sweden.
A study of Swedish males found a significant decrease in total physical exercise even though recreational exercise has increased. This was due to a decrease in work place exercise and physical exercise in transportation.
United States.
Americans have become less physically active overall between 1955 and 2005. While the rate of leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly there has been a decrease in work-related activity, human powered transportation, activity in the home, and increasing sedentary activity. During 2000 and 2005 the number of adults who were never physically active increased from 9.4% to 10.3% while the number who were engaged in the highest level of physical activity decreased from 18.7% to 16.7%. Pertaining to leisure-time physical activity, people involved in no activity increased from 38.5% to 40.0% while those who spent most of their day sitting increased from 36.8% to 39.9%.
In 2000 the CDC estimated that more than 40% of the US population was sedentary, another 30% was active but not sufficiently and less than 30% had an adequate level of physical activity. There has been a trend toward decreased physical activity in part due to increasingly mechanized forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization. Obesity rates have increased in relation to expanding suburbs. This has been attributed to increased time spent commuting, leading to less exercise and less meal preparation at home. Driving one's children to school has become increasingly popular. In the USA the proportion of children who walk or bike to school declined between 1969 (42%) and 2001 (16%) resulting in less exercise.
UK.
In England both walking and cycling have declined since 1975 being replaced by motorized transport. The average British citizen in the year 2005 walks per year, a fall of since 1975. Similar trends are seen in the United States. In 1983 9% of all trips were on foot. This decreased to 7% in 1990.
Solutions to address the lack of exercise.
Many measures have been attempted to address low levels of physical activity. Some of these include: Walking bus, Riding school bus, Mall walking, and Girls on the Run.
Going to a gym is another measure that can be taken. However, according to a controversial suggestion by Michael Mosley and doctor James Levine, it is not neecessary to go to a gym to increase one's physical activity level. Rather, an alternative solution may be to just take on a more active lifestyle, including increases in Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT), and perhaps include a small amount of rigorous exercise (about 3 minutes per week). The latter technique is called HIT

The Permanent Peoples' Tribunal is an international opinion tribunal independent from State authorities. It examines and provides judgements relatives to violations of human rights and rights of peoples. The Tribunal was founded in Bologna (Italy), June 24, 1979, by law experts, writers and other intellectuals. It succeeded the Russell Tribunal (or International War Crimes Tribunal), which, in 1967, exposed the war crimes committed against the Vietnamese people.
The Permanent Peoples' Tribunal was created out of the Lelio Basso International Foundation for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples (FILB), established in 1976 and inspired by the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Peoples at Algiers (also named the Algiers Declaration). The Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal may use International human rights law, or the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted by the United Nations 
The Permanent Peoples' Tribunal examined the cases of Tibet, Western Sahara, Argentina, Eritrea, Philippine, El Salvador, Afghanistan, East Timor, Zaïre, Guatemala, the Armenian Genocide or recently the Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka, the intervention of the United States in Nicaragua, Brazilian Amazon, etc. In certain cases (Central America, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhopal disaster …), commissions of investigation went on the spot.
In 1996, after the session of Permanent Peoples' Tribunal on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights in Bhopal, 1992, the "Charter on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights" was adopted.

Ochoco Creek

Ochoco Creek is a tributary of the Crooked River in the U.S. state of Oregon. Part of the drainage basin of the Columbia River, it arises in the Ochoco National Forest in Wheeler County and flows generally southwest and west for most of its length through Crook County to slightly northwest of Prineville.
Course.
Ochoco Creek begins in the extreme southwestern corner of Wheeler County near its border with Crook County in the Ochoco National Forest. Entering Crook County, it flows southwest for about two-thirds of its course, roughly parallel to Forest Road 22 and U.S. Route 26 to the Crooked River near Prineville.
In its first , Ochoco Creek receives Camp Creek from the left then Aholt and McAllister creeks, both from the right, then Judy, Fisher, and Canyon creeks, all from the left. At about river mile (RM) 25 or river kilometer (RK 40), Coyle Creek and then Metal Creek enter from the right. Between there and the Ochoco Reservoir and Ochoco Lake State Park, the creek receives Garden Creek from the right, Douthit, Duncan, and Wolf creeks and Camp Branch, all from the left, and Salmon Creek from the right. Leaving the national forest, it receives Veasle and Lawson creeks from the left and Polly Creek from the right before entering the reservoir. As part of the lake, it receives Mill Creek from the right at about RM 12 (RK 19).
Flowing west from the lower end of the lake at about RM 9 (RK 14), the creek runs through the Prineville Golf and Country Club, passes under Highway 26 and enters Prineville and Ochoco Creek Park north of the highway at about RM 4 (RK 6). Turning northwest out of Prineville, the stream soon passes under Highway 26 again and enters the Crooked River roughly from its confluence with the Deschutes River, a tributary of the Columbia River.

Daud Khan Karrani

Daud Khan Karrani (reigned 1572–12 July 1576) was the youngest son of Sulaiman Khan Karrani. During his father's reign, he commanded a massive army of 40,000 cavalry, 3,600 elephants, 1,140,000 infantry and 20,000 cannons. He invaded the southwestern regions of present-day India.
Mughal-Afghan war.
Daud was not content with the sultanate of Bengal. He dreamt of being a second Sher Shah Suri and to conquer the entire Indian subcontinent. But he had a formidable foe, Akbar the Great .
Invasion of Jamania.
When Akbar was busy with his warfare in Gujarat, Daud Khan invaded Jamania near Ghazipur. The Afghan army razed the Jamania city to the ground and captured the Jamania fort. Akbar ordered the governor of Jaunpur, Munim Khan, to proceed against Daud. Munim Khan met his friend Ludi Khan, the Prime Minister of Daud, in Patna and settled in peace. The agreement pleased neither Akbar nor Daud. Ludi Khan was later punished to death by Daud.
Battle of Patna.
In 1573 Munim Khan attacked Bihar which forced Daud to retreat and take shelter in Patna. Daud sent Katlu Lohani, Gujar Khan Karrani and Sri Hari against the Mughal army. Munim Khan along with Todar Mal and Mansingh made the first attack in Hajipur. After a fierce battle the Afghans became at the verge of victory. Akbar then captured the neighboring fort of Hajipur which was the source of rations for the Afghan army. The Afghans fell in a distress and retreated to Bengal. Akbar returned to the capital after appointing Munim Khan as the governor of Bihar and Bengal. Todar Mal was also left to assist him.
Battle of Tukaroi.
On 3 March 1575 a fierce battle was fought between the Mughals and the Afghans in Tukaroi. The result was a draw and the Afghans retreated to Katak, Orissa. The Mughals captured Tanda, the Afghan capital of Bengal. Munim Khan transferred the capital of Bengal from Tanda to Gaur. In the treaty of Katak, Daud ceded Bengal and Bihar to the Mughals. But he retained only Orissa as his possession. Six months later there broke out a plague and Munim Khan suddenly died in October 1575. The Mughal army was repulsed from Eastern Bengal by Kalapahar and Isa Khan. Daud marched from Orissa to successfully recapture Gaur.
Battle of Rajmahal.
Akbar sent a new army under the command of Khan Jahan Quli. He captured Teliagarhi and advanced towards Rajmahal. The two armies met in the battlefield of Rajmahal. The battle went on for many days. Akbar ordered the governor of Bihar, Muzaffar Khan Turbati and other generals to join. On the other side Daud was accompanied by other principal Afghan leaders like Junaid, Qutlu Khan and Kalapahar. After a fierce battle on 12 July 1576 Daud was finally defeated and executed.
After his death, Bengal went under direct Mughal rule as Subah with Subahdars being installed.

Kenhardt

Kenhardt (founded 1868) is a small town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. This little town is about 120 km from Upington, the largest town in the area.
History.
On 27 December 1868, special magistrate Maximillian Jackson with a police contingent, was sent to act against the Griquas in the area. The Griqua's anti-colonial resistance had erupted into an open conflict. Jackson arrived in Kenhardt and set up camp under a giant camelthorn tree.
This has been for a long time the most remote settlement in the North-Western Cape. With time the town developed from under this tree, becoming a municipality in 1909. The Hartbees River, with its many sweet thorn trees, provides a green belt irrigated by the Rooiberg Dam. Kenhardt is famous for being at the heart of the Dorper sheep-farming area.
Geography.
This region contains very little vegetation, primarily very low shrubs and yellow grass among a rocky desert kind of landscape. If you travel south from Kenhardt towards Brandvlei, you will pass through a huge landscape of nothingness for the next 200 km and more. During the seasons many birds flock to the pans, when they contain water, after some rainfall. Temperature above 40°C is not uncommon.
Places of interest.
This tree is about 500–600 years old. It is under this tree which Magistrate Jackson set up his camp in 1868.
The old library was built in 1897, and it was used until 1977. In 1978 it was declared a national monument, currently it is used by Sanlam as their office.

James Griffith (academic)

Dr James Griffith (1761–1821) was an Oxford academic and administrator. He was elected as a Fellow of University College, Oxford in 1784. From 22 January 1808, he was Master of the College until his death in 1821.
James Griffith was Master of Univ when Percy Bysshe Shelley was expelled as an undergraduate after writing a provocative pamphlet on "The Necessity of Atheism" in 1811. Shelley was called in to see Griffith and a number of college fellows on 25 March 1811. When Griffith asked Shelley if the pamphlet was his, Shelley remained silent. Shelley's friend, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, also appeared to support him, claiming equal culpability. Later that day, a notice appeared on the Hall door, signed by Griffith and the Dean, George Rowley (who succeeded Griffith as Master of the college), stating that Shelley and Hogg were expelled from the college.
Griffith was interested in art and architecture. He was responsible for the south side of the main quadrangle at University College when it was refaced in 1802, including the dining hall and chapel. In 1811, he designed the vestry for the church in Melsonby. In 1819, he was a member of a Delegacy advising on the development of the site Hertford College as a replacement for Magdalen Hall. There is a watercolour by him of the Vale of Conway in the Victoria & Albert Museum, London.
He was a prebendary at Gloucester from 1816. At Gloucester Cathedral, he designed the Gothic choir screen, erected in 1820.
Griffith married his cousin, Mary Ironside, on his election to Master of University College. They lived together in the Master's Lodgings.

List of Chalk episodes

"Chalk" is a BBC Television sitcom. The show was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for the independent production company Pola Jones and screened on BBC2. All twelve episodes from the two series were written by Steven Moffat and directed by Juliet May. The first episode of the series was transmitted on 20 February 1997, and the final transmitted on 15 October 1997.
The series focuses upon deputy headteacher Eric Slatt (David Bamber), permanently stressed over the chaos he creates both by himself and some of his eccentric staff. His wife Janet (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and new English teacher Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) attempts to help him solve the problems.
Due to the positive reaction of the studio audience during recordings, a second series was commissioned before the first had aired. However, the first series attracted criticism, inflamed by the BBC's decision to compare the show to the highly respected "Fawlty Towers" in its publicity materials. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.
Series.
The first three episodes were released on VHS in the United Kingdom on 7 September 1998 by BBC Video. The complete first series was released on Region 2 PAL DVD by ReplayDVD, the independent label that was established to release Moffat's "Joking Apart", on 15 December 2008. The second series has never been released in any format.

As John Wells was too ill to film the second series, Duncan Preston played Galfast High's new headmaster, Mr Kennedy, who appeared almost identical in character to Wells' Mr Nixon.

Charlie Mason (lyricist)

Charlie Mason is an American lyricist whose credits include Top 40 singles by Monrose ("Hit 'N' Run"/Germany), Billiam ("Beautiful Ones"/UK), What's Up ("If I Told You Once"/Sweden), DCX ("Poor Romeo"/Finland) and Birgit Õigemeel ("Homme"/Estonia).
Mason got his start as a lyricist working with German vocalist-musician Dirk Homuth on songs for an alt-pop group which Homuth named Almost Charlie so that, although his friend is "unable to play any instrument more complicated than a toaster," he could still be represented in some way. Almost Charlie's debut album, Loving Counterclockwise, was released to positive reviews in 2006 by Phonector; their follow-up, tentatively titled The Plural of Yes, will be released in 2009 by the American indie label Words on Music.
Since then, Mason has written lyrics in nearly every genre, for popular artists including BoA ("Scream"/US), Queensberry (band) ("Stiletto Heels"/Germany), Jonathan Fagerlund ("Dance in the Shadows"/Sweden), Sarah Burgess ("Dangerouz"/US), Sergey Lazarev ("He Said, She Said"/Russia), Danny Saucedo ("Do or Die"/Sweden), Sweetbox ("You Don't Know What You're Sorry For"/US), Sanna Nielsen ("But I Know What I Want"/Sweden), Girls' Generation ("Boomerang"/Japan) and Gigi Radics ("Catch Me"/Hungary).
In 2008, former Streetwize boy band member Donal Skehan competed in Ireland's Eurovision Song Contest finals with "Double-Cross My Heart," a song Mason co-wrote. That same year, Mason completed work on the demos for his first movie musical, a horror-comedy-romance called "The Dead Don't Date."
Upcoming releases featuring Mason's lyrics include UK electropop artist Luigi Masi's debut single, "Strangers Again," Aussie dance act Katrina's debut single, "Off the Rails," Swedish triplets Three's debut single, "Lucky Number," Miss Coco Peru "Show Me Your Pride," as well as new albums by Tommy Reeves (Germany), Lucas Prata (US), Jonathan Fagerlund (Sweden), Adam Tyler (US) and Livingston (Germany).
Mason has said that "his goal in life is to have the option of spending all day, every day, locked in a room with a view of his platinum records writing one lyric after another, occasionally taking breaks to play with the pets he looks forward to rescuing from animal shelters."
In 2014 his song "Rise Like a Phoenix" won the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 − sung by Austrian artist Conchita Wurst. In it, he proclaimed the necessity to stand up and fight against societal and structural injustice.

Buell to develop training materials for the railroad. Buell was later appointed the Director of Union Pacific's Educational Bureau of Information. Within a few years Buell and the Union Pacific realized other railroads could benefit by the training programs it developed. The division was spun off as The Railway Educational Bureau and Buell later became the owner. The Railway Educational Bureau was purchased from the Buell estate by Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation in 1968.

Seattle mayoral election, 2009

The 2009 Seattle mayoral election took place November 3, 2009.
Incumbent Mayor Greg Nickels sought reelection but finished third in the August 18, 2009 primary election. The general election was instead between Joe Mallahan and Michael McGinn. After a very close initial count, McGinn beat Mallahan in the election, becoming Seattle's next mayor.
Background.
In a November 2008 poll of likely Seattle voters, 31% approved of Nickels's performance as mayor while 57% disapproved. A January 2009 poll found a net job approval of minus 33.
Nickels' administration was faulted for not doing enough to prevent the Seattle SuperSonics NBA franchise from relocating to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Nickels was also heavily criticized for the city's policy of not using salt for snow removal due to potential environmental concerns, which contributed to the city's congested traffic in December 2008 after one of the greatest snowfalls in the city since 1996. The Proposed replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and a tax on plastic bags at grocery stores were two key issues of the campaign.
Primaries.
Early polling.
A poll conducted on August 12 showed incumbent Greg Nickels in the lead with 24 percent voter backing. While a significant lead over all other candidates, the undecided voter percentage of 26 percent indicated room for any candidate to take the lead in the primary held on August 18. In second place after Greg Nickels was Mike McGinn with 16 percent. And in third place, Joe Mallahan with 14 percent. The survey polled 500 people with a margin of error of + or - 4.3 percent.
Primary results.
The primary elections were held on August 18. The final results were posted on September 2, and show Mike McGinn in first place with 27.7 percent of the popular vote, narrowly leading Joe Mallahan standing at 26.9 percent. Incumbent Greg Nickels showed with 25.4 percent. Due to Washington's top-two primary system, this eliminated Nickels from the running. Nickels gave his concession speech on August 21 at Seattle City Hall. Mallahan and McGinn advanced to the general election in November.
General election.
An October 20 poll commissioned by KING-TV and conducted by SurveyUSA showed Joe Mallahan ahead with 43% to Michael McGinn's 36% with a margin of error of 4.1%. Mallahan held a lead among college graduates, Democrats, Republicans, Independents and those describing themselves as moderates and conservatives. McGinn was shown to hold a lead among Asian-Americans, younger voters and those that describe themselves as liberals. McGinn changed his position on the Deep Bore Tunnel that same day with following statement, ""If I'm elected mayor, though I disagree with this decision, it will be my job to uphold and execute this agreement," McGinn said. "It is not the mayor's job to withhold the cooperation of city government in executing this agreement."" It was enough to push McGinn ahead of Mallahan by election day. 
As of November 9, 2009, the vote totals were
Mallahan conceded on November 9 after his deficit grew to nearly 5,000 votes.

Alberta Bible College

Alberta Bible College is a Canadian Bible college associated especially, but not exclusively, with the Christian churches and churches of Christ.
The founders.
Helen McGilvary’s motion at a July, 1932, congregational meeting of Central Church of Christ, Lethbridge, Alberta, created Alberta Bible College (ABC). Charles Henry (“C. H.”) Phillips convened classes October 3rd 1932 with Roscoe E. Hollister and, later that school year, eight other students in an unfinished church basement in a classroom sectioned off by a curtain.
From the outset, ABC’s founding was a collaborative effort of several Alberta congregations. But E. E. Breakenridge, a Calgary businessman and an elder at Tuxedo Park Church of Christ, Calgary, was full partner in this effort with C. H. Phillips. Phillips came from an Anglo-Caribbean plantation family, born in London, England, according to one account, who immigrated to Saskatchewan as a 24-year-old. As that young man, he came to Canada "utterly disgruntled" with the brand of Christianity that perpetuated unbearable inequalities between the clergy and the poor.
“C. H.” was exposed to the Restoration Movement by the pioneer Disciples of Christ preacher R. J. Westaway, and he went to study at Eugene Bible University (now, Northwest Christian College) in Oregon. From his studies, C. H. brought a vision of church growth by way of educating men and women for the leadership ministry of the church. In a special 1932 edition of "The Alberta Christian," a newsletter of the Alberta Christian Missionary Society, Phillips noted that "There is no question as to the need of such a college in this Northwestern (sic) division of our Dominion. We have the young people in our churches. We know of several who would avail themselves of intensive preparation of the various trained ministries of the churches were it possible."
E. E. Breakenridge was a former Baptist who became a member of Tuxedo Park Church of Christ in 1934. With A. G. Spaeth who donated a building and land in Calgary at 2720 Centre Street North, J. W. Jenkins, the Hovises, J. H. Dean, and several others, Phillips and Breakenridge laid ABC’s institutional foundations. Phillips’s vision was of “a program in classical English Bible.” As implemented, study of the Bible was allied to such as classical logic and rhetoric. Breakenridge marshalled the resources of Disciples in southern and central Alberta to create the new school’s financial and physical infrastructure. In 1936, ABC was incorporated with a self-perpetuating board of trustees in continuity with its founding, provisional board, and in 1937 the school moved to the Centre Street property.
The College was a child of hope for the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement in the context of its growth concurrent with the settlement of the Canadian West, and the challenge of developing an indigenous Canadian leadership. 
The pioneers.
In 1936, J. Merlin Hill of Oregon came to assist C. H. Phillips with teaching responsibilities. When Phillips moved to Toronto to begin a ministry with Keele Street Church of Christ just prior to the 1937-1938 year, Hill assumed the principalship while serving as minister with Tuxedo Park Church of Christ. In 1939, ABC’s first graduates, Roscoe E. Hollister and Lawrence E. Horney, received the Bachelor of Theology degree. E. G. Hansell, M.P. and several others assisted with teaching responsibilities. When the Hills returned to Oregon in 1941, Melvin Breakenridge, a recent graduate, was called to be ABC’s principal. Breakenridge was supported in teaching responsibilities by other recent ABC graduates and senior students until he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in spring, 1943. C. H. Phillips returned as principal, and served until he suffered a severe heart attack in April 1949. Roscoe Hollister acted as principal for the next year. Because of concerns about Phillips’s health, the trustees declined his returning. Instead, they called Melvin Breakenridge from his ministry in Summerside, P.E.I., now with a Master of Divinity from Butler School of Religion. Breakenridge served as principal for the next twelve years, reshaping the curriculum along the lines of liberal arts programs of the time. In January 1962, the college moved into its new campus at 599 Northmount Drive N.W. from temporary digs at Cambrian Heights Church of Christ, next door. Also in 1962, an administrative reorganization saw Breakenridge appointed academic dean, and E. G. Hansell (Member of Parliament, 1935-1958) was appointed ABC’s first “president.”
The “wranglers”.
Accounts of the years from 1962 to 1967 differ somewhat on the gravity of ABC’s situation, but they don’t differ on the broad challenges that characterized this period: the financial strain due to a capital building project and differences among trustees as to ABC’s relationship with the All Canada Committee of the Disciples of Christ. The situation was not helped by President Hansell’s sudden decease from a heart attack in autumn, 1965. By the 1966-1967 school year, enrolment fell to ten students. But ABC’s constituency rose to the challenges. The college was technically in receivership except for the patience of its main creditor, the Church of Christ Development Company led by John Bergman, an ABC alumnus. In 1964, James Chapman took on responsibilities for fund-raising and the financial viability of the school. At least one supporter extended a long-term, interest-free loan. Robert Gonyea served as president from 1965. In late 1965 or early 1966 after an especially difficult trustees’ meeting, one expressed serious doubts about ABC’s future. Another trustee replied, “When you’re in a mud-hole, you don’t say ‘whoa,’ you shout ‘giddap!’” Subsequently, the trustees recruited Boyd Lammiman to be president of ABC.
The builders.
Boyd and Julia Lammiman resettled their family in Calgary during Canada’s centennial summer, 1967. Over the next seventeen years, Lammiman (“Mr. L”) and the faculty and staff upgraded academic standards and created the “Christian Service Lab” and internship practicum. With Miss Aileen Case, Lammiman instituted predictable administrative process for the school’s academic year. With James Chapman, Lammiman improved ABC’s relations with its constituency, both donors and congregations. Alice Fraser (now, Mitchell), M.Div. (Cincinnati) was made full-time dean and instructor in 1967 till her departure in 1973. Gary Hatt, M.Div. (Emmanuel) was recruited in her place in 1974. In 1975, Ron Fraser, a recent graduate, came on-stream as a full-time instructor. By ABC’s 50th academic year 1981-1982, ABC was financially solvent, its faculty and staff were paid on time, relations with its constituency were warm, and a record number of students was enrolled. When a visiting college president was introduced to an ABC student in 1981, the student exclaimed, “This is the best Bible college in the world!”
Mr. Lammiman guaranteed that what had been built under his leadership would serve as a foundation for more things to come when he collaborated with the trustees to recruit a successor and to plan for an orderly transition. With the completion of Mr. L’s ministry in summer, 1984, Ron Fraser was simultaneously installed as the new president.
Among his first acts, Fraser recruited John Wilson to return to Alberta from a new church ministry in P.E.I. to be a full-time instructor. This was only the beginning. Fraser as president and Doug Dietz as chairman of the academic committee led the school in enrolment expansion, faculty and staff development, creation of a degree-completion program, and in a capital building campaign. ABC moved from “599” to the former YMCA facility at 635 Northmount Drive N.W. after a significant renovation. In 2008, ABC achieved accreditation with the Association for Biblical Higher Education.\
A vicarious ministry.
By 1940, ABC students and alumni had served in sixteen pulpits in four provinces and three states. This was just the beginning.
ABC students organized new churches beginning in 1939 in Calgary, and alumni have since organized churches in Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Early ABC graduates – Tom and Leota Rash, Bill and David Howell Rees, Edna Hunt, and Frank and Marie Rempel – were pioneers in the direct-support missions movement. ABC alumni served cross-culturally on every continent, planting churches, translating the Bible, educating local leadership, publishing Christian literature, smuggling Bibles behind the iron curtain, and teaching English as a second language. ABC alumni pursued advanced theological education, coming back to ABC to teach as well as at other Bible colleges, seminaries, and universities. They also pursued the professions of teaching, engineering, nursing, medicine, and law. ABC alumni sought to transform and contribute to culture as musicians and composers; in the academy (university) in various disciplines; in politics and public policy; in journalism, radio, and television; in business and entrepreneurship; and as public servants. ABC alumni include “tentmakers,” preachers and multiple staff ministers, elders, deacons, church development entrepreneurs, church planters, trustees, teachers and professors, youth group leaders, and camp deans and staff. Graduates have also served in thirty-one foreign countries.
Church ties.
From its inception Alberta Bible College sought to be a catalyst for unity in the Stone-Campbell tradition in Canada. In the 1960s the College hosted an annual, week-long "Minister's Institute" for leadership of all three streams of the Movement, "to promote fellowship and understanding" transcending the Movement's divisions. Conciliatory speakers such as W. Carl Ketcherside were introduced to the Canadian West through this and other special events. A consensus of openness and goodwill has continued to evolve, with the College providing much of the leadership. In 1990, the College initiated the Western Canadian Christian Convention, a convention that included all three streams of the Stone-Campbell Movement. This led to a growing interface with the a capella Churches of Christ. A number from the latter churches have graduated from Alberta Bible College and either serve in or minister to Christian churches and churches of Christ or a capella Churches of Christ. The school hired its first instructor from the a capella Churches of Christ in 1997.
Academic emphasis.
Alberta Bible College has been accredited with the Association of Biblical Higher Education but is not currently. The "classical English Bible curriculum" remains the core of the College's ministerial training program, but as resources have allowed, other majors have been added. A unique emphasis of the academic program has been a heavy concentration on "practical experience."
Programs.
Alberta Bible College currently offers the following:
Alumni.
The College continues to influence churches in Canada by educating indigenous Canadian leadership. Today its alumni and alumnae account for two-thirds of the leadership in congregations of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Christian churches and churches of Christ in Canada. Many other graduates provide the mainstay of leadership in churches and parachurch ministries both in and beyond the Stone-Campbell tradition. By virtue of this influence, Alberta Bible College serves as a focal point of identity and mission for the Stone-Campbell Movement in Canada.

Center for Justice and Accountability

The Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) is a non-profit international human rights organization based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1998, CJA represents survivors of torture and other grave human rights abuses in cases against individual rights violators before U.S. and Spanish courts. CJA has pioneered the use of civil litigation in the United States as a means of redress for survivors from around the world.
Mission.
The Center for Justice & Accountability is dedicated to ending torture and other human rights abuses while vindicating the rights of survivors to seek truth, justice and redress. Through criminal and civil litigation, CJA works to create a record of truth and refine human rights jurisprudence, while promoting the principles of universal jurisdiction and the rule of law. Often, the impact of CJA's casework extends beyond redress for the immediate plaintiffs and can serve as a catalyst for transitional justice movements abroad. While CJA works to close off the United States as a safe haven for violators of human rights, the organization also supports efforts to prosecute violators in national courts around the world.
History.
In August 1998, The Center for Justice & Accountability filed its first case, Mehinovic v. Vuckovic, on behalf of a Bosnian torture and detention camp survivor. Since then, CJA has pursued an extensive docket of human rights cases, winning favorable verdicts in all cases that have gone to trial. As of early 2009, CJA has filed high profile cases against the following former military or political leaders who were responsible for systematic human rights abuses: 
In recognition of its accomplishments, CJA was awarded the Third Thomas J. Dodd Prize in International Justice and Human Rights on October 1, 2007. The Dodd Prize is awarded biannually by the University of Connecticut to an individual or group who has made a significant effort to advance the cause of international justice and global human rights.
Legal framework for human rights litigation.
Civil litigation for human rights.
CJA is part of a movement of legal non-governmental organizations who use civil litigation to enforce international human rights law in the U.S. CJA's litigation draws on two principal statutes: the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) (also known as the Alien Tort Claims Act) and the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA). These statutes grant U.S. courts jurisdiction to hear civil actions filed against perpetrators of gross human rights violations, even when those violations took place overseas.
Since the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeal's landmark 1980 decision in Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, this class of civil action has opened up U.S. federal courts to the implementation of international law and human rights safeguards: 
In the twentieth century the international community has come to recognize the common danger posed by the flagrant disregard of basic human rights. . .Among the rights universally proclaimed by all nations . . .is the right to be free of physical torture. Indeed, for purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become—like the pirate and slave trader before him—"hostis humani generis", an enemy of all mankind. Our holding today…is a small but important step in the fulfillment of the ageless dream to free all people from brutal violence. 
The authors of "International Human Rights Litigation in U.S. Courts"—the authoritative manual for ATS and TVPA litigation—echo the Filartiga ruling:
Although not a substitute for other means of holding perpetrators accountable, human rights litigation contributes to an important long-term objective: working toward a world in which those who commit gross violations of human rights are brought to justice swiftly, in whatever country they try to hide. 
Legal scholar Beth van Schaack has argued that these broader objectives place human rights litigation in line with the public impact litigation model pioneered by the American civil rights movement. Both strategies aim to effect systemic social change through the legal process. In the majority of CJA's cases however, the primary focus remains on direct client advocacy: the needs of a client take first priority, while a case's broader impact remains a second order effect. (cf. "With All Deliberate Speed: Civil Human Rights Litigation as Tool for Social Change")
Universal jurisdiction.
Underpinning CJA's mission is the principle of universal jurisdiction. With roots in the ancient body of law related to piracy and slave-traders, this doctrine of international law holds that certain crimes are so egregious that the perpetrators may be held accountable wherever they are found. Since the Nuremberg Trials of 1945-49, modern jurisprudence has extended the doctrine to encompass the following crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture.
In 2001, the Princeton Principles on Universal Jurisdiction, defined universal jurisdiction as:
riminal jurisdiction based solely on the nature of the crime, without regard to where the crime was committed, the nationality of the alleged or convicted perpetrator, the nationality of the victim, or any other connection to the state exercising such jurisdiction.
CJA has drawn on the principle of universal jurisdiction to try cases in U.S courts and before the Spanish National Court. Since the 1998 prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Spain has adopted universal jurisdiction over cases of severe violations of international human rights law. CJA has initiated criminal investigations with the Spanish court to prosecute human rights abuses in Guatemala and El Salvador.
In a July 18, 2006 interview, CJA executive director, Pamela Merchant, made clear the connection between ATS litigation and broader universal jurisdiction efforts:
jurisdiction is the endgame…Here we're using the Alien Tort Statute, [elsewhere we’re using other vehicles, but there are crimes so outrageous that they should be prosecuted anywhere if the appropriate governments aren't doing it.
Command responsibility.
Proponents of universal jurisdiction assert that real deterrence cannot be achieved until military and government officials are aware that they can be held individually accountable, not just for committing abuses, but for their failure to take reasonable action to stop others under their command from committing abuses. This claim is derived from the principle of command responsibility, the doctrine of complicity which provided the legal foundation for the Nuremberg Trials against senior Nazi war criminals. The command responsibility doctrine was enshrined in U.S. law by the U.S. Supreme Court decision "In Re Yamashita" (1946). Command responsibility is now an established theory of liability, thanks in part to the body of case law that has developed around CJA's litigation and the casework of other organizations pursuing similar strategies, notably the Center for Constitutional Rights and EarthRights International.
Transitional justice.
Much of CJA's litigation and advocacy work is performed with survivors from countries still struggling to transition from an authoritarian past to a stable democratic present. Uncovering and seeking redress for human rights crimes is often a necessary component of a nation's emergence from civil strife and repression. Transitional justice denotes the process by which societies address the crimes of prior regimes as they move from a period of violent conflict or oppression toward peace, democracy and the rule of law. Drawing on a broad palette of mechanisms—from truth commissions, civil actions and criminal tribunals to works of public art devoted to historical memory--transitional justice has become an important means to build civil society in post-conflict situations.
Case docket.
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mehinovic v. Vuckovic (War crimes and ethnic cleansing)
This case was filed on behalf of Bosnian Muslims tortured by a Bosnian Serb soldier at a detention camp in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The charges included torture; crimes against humanity; arbitrary detention; cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; war crimes; and genocide.
In 2002, the U.S District Court for the Northern District of Georgia held Vuckovic liable and awarded each plaintiff $10 million in compensatory damages and $25 million each in punitive damages.
Chile.
Cabello v. Fernández Larios (Augusto Pinochet's "Caravan of Death")
In 2001, CJ filed a case against Armando Fernández Larios, an operative of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and officer in the notorious "Caravan of Death", a Chilean military delegation believed to have killed more than 70 civilians during a journey by helicopter 1973. 
In 2003, a Florida jury found Fernández Larios responsible for torture and murder and awarded the plaintiffs four million dollars in damages. The trial marks the first time that any Pinochet operative has been tried in the United States for their role in human rights abuses committed in Chile, as well as the first jury verdict for crimes against humanity in the United States.
China.
Doe v. Liu Qi (Torture and religious persecution)
In February 2002, CJA filed a civil action against the Liu Qi — Mayor of Beijing and head of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Committee. The suit alleged that Qi had authority over police forces in Beijing who had carried out brutal repressive measures against Falun Gong practitioners. 
In 2004, Judge Claudia Wilken issued a default judgment against Liu Qi for his role in the torture of Falun Gong practitioners.
El Salvador.
Romagoza Arce v. García (Command responsibility for atrocities)
Filed in 1999, the case charged Generals José Guillermo García and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova with liability for torture. The generals both served as former Ministers of Defense.
In 2002, a West Palm Beach, Florida jury found the generals responsible for the torture of the three plaintiffs. In January 2006, the 11th Circuit court upheld the $54.6 million jury verdict on appeal and in July 2006, Defendant Vides Casanova was forced to relinquish over $300,000 of his own assets.
Doe v. Saravia (Assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero ) 
The March 24, 1980 assassination of Salvadoran Archbishop Óscar Romero — a revered human rights defender — was arguably the most infamous political murder in 20th-century Latin America. Yet for years, one of the perpetrators of this crime, Alvaro Saravia, lived freely in Modesto, California.
In 2003, CJA filed a suit against Saravia alleging that he procured weapons and vehicles to assist in the assassination, provided his personal driver to transport the assassin to and from the chapel where Romero was shot and paid the assassin for his deed.
In September 2004, Judge Oliver Wanger declared that the assassination was a crime against humanity and ordered Saravia to pay $10 million to the plaintiff, a relative of the Archbishop. 
Chavez v. Carranza (Salvadoran Civil War crimes) 
Filed on December 10, 2003, the suit aimed to hold Colonel Carranza responsible for human rights abuses committed in El Salvador.
In 2005, a Memphis federal jury found Colonel Nicolás Carranza, the former Vice-Minister of Defense of El Salvador, liable for overseeing torture and extrajudicial killings and ordered him to pay $6 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
Jesuits Massacre case 
In 2008, CJA filed a criminal case in Spain against senior former Salvadoran military officials for their role in the 1989 Jesuits Massacre, in which six Jesuit Priests, their housekeeper and her daughter, were killed at the Universidad Centroamericana ¨José Simeon Cañas¨ (UCA) in El Salvador. On January 13, 2009, the 14 officers and soldiers named in the case were formally charged with crimes against humanity and state terrorism.
Guatemala.
The Guatemala Genocide Case (The Mayan Genocide)
In 2004, CJA joined a criminal complaint filed in 1999 by Nobel Laureate Rigoberta Menchú Tum and others charging former President Efraín Ríos Montt and other senior Guatemalan officials with state terrorism, genocide and systematic torture during a campaign against the Mayan community which claimed over 200,000 lives. In 2006, a new legal team led by CJA began working with attorneys from Guatemala, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.S. to develop evidence on the Mayan genocide. As of 2009, CJA international staff attorney, Almudena Bernabeu is lead counsel for the plaintiffs.
Haiti.
Jean v. Dorélien (The High Command and the Raboteau Massacre) 
In 2003, CJA filed U.S. state and federal cases against Colonel Carl Dorélien—a Haitian officer who held command responsibility for the April 22, 1994 massacre in a pro-democracy neighborhood in Gonaïves and for the torture of the union activist Lexius Cajuste
Dorélien's presence in the United States became widely known when he won $3.2 million in the Florida lottery in 1997.
In 2007, a Miami federal jury found Colonel Carl Dorélien liable for abuses and ordered him to pay $4.3 million. In a separate state court action, a landmark $580,000 was recovered for Haitian massacre survivors. In May 2008, over $400,000 was distributed to the Raboteau victims. 
Doe v. Constant (Death squads and violence against women)
CJA represents three Haitian women in a lawsuit against Emmanuel "Toto" Constant for his participation in a range of human rights abuses committed in 1993–1994. On October 25, 2006, U.S. District Court Judge Sidney H. Stein of the Southern District of New York ordered Constant to pay $19 million in damages to CJA's clients.
In a separate criminal trial, Constant was sentenced on October 28, 2008 to 12 to 37 years in prison for his role in a criminal mortgage fraud scheme in New York. CJA's investigation of Constant contributed to this conviction.
Honduras.
Reyes v. López Grijalba (Forced disappearance) 
In July, 2002 CJA filed a lawsuit against former military intelligence chief Lt. Col. Juan López Grijalba, who had command responsibility for the abduction, torture, and extrajudicial killing of the plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ family-members. Having settled in the United States, López Grijalba was deported back to Honduras in 2004.
On March 31, 2006, a Florida judge held Colonel Grijalba responsible for abuses and ordered him to pay $47 million to six survivors and relatives of the disappeared. 
Later in 2006, the Attorney General of Honduras approached CJA to assist in a criminal prosecution of López Grijalba based on evidence produced in the U.S. civil case. To initiate the prosecution, CJA trained 80 Honduran prosecutors on bringing successful human rights cases in national courts in December 2007.
Indonesia.
Doe v. Lumintang (Atrocities during the East Timor Independence Referendum)
CJA and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit against General Johny Lumintang for abuses committed by the Indonesian military during the violent aftermath of the September 1999 independence referendum. Lumintang was served with the complaint while in transit at Dulles International Airport. In September 2001, he failed to appear in the case and District Judge Gladys Kessler found in favor of the survivors, awarding them $66 million in damages.
On November 9, 2004, District Judge Gladys Kessler granted Lumintang's motion to vacate the default judgment, holding that service of the complaint and summons at Dulles Airport in Fairfax, Virginia did not give the District of Columbia district court jurisdiction over Lumintang.
Peru.
Ochoa Lizarbe v. Hurtado (The Accomarca Massacre I) 
In 2007, CJA filed suit against Major Telmo Hurtado Hurtado and Juan Rivera Rondón, who planned and executed a massacre of 69 civilians in the village of Accomarca, in the Ayacucho department of Peru on August 14, 1985. 
On March 4, 2008 a federal court judge in Miami ordered Major Hurtado to pay $37 million in damages. 
Ochoa Lizarbe v. Rivera Rondón (The Accomarca Massacre II)
In a related case, CJA and pro bono co-counsel Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP filed a lawsuit on July 11, 2007 in a Maryland federal district court against Rivera Rondón, a Peruvian former army lieutenant, for his role in the Accomarca Massacre.
Rivera Rondón immigrated to the U.S. in the early 1990s. Following a criminal conviction on a separate offence, Rondón was deported from the U.S. on August 15, 2008, whereupon he was immediately detained by Peruvian authorities. CJA was instrumental in ensuring that he will be prosecuted for the crimes he committed in Accomarca in 1985.
Somalia.
Yousuf v. Samantar (Somali Civil War and Widespread Repression) 
In 2004, CJA filed suit against General Mohamed Ali Samantar, the former Somali Minister of Defense (1980 to 1986) and Prime Minister (1987 to 1990) under the regime of Siad Barré. The suit alleges that Samantar bore command responsibility for a host of abuses carried out by his subordinates, including torture, extrajudicial killing and war crimes.
On April 27, 2007, Judge Brinkema of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the human rights lawsuit, ruling that the defendant enjoyed immunity from civil actions under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).
CJA and pro bono co-counsel from Cooley Godward Kronish LLP, appealed to the 4th Circuit Court. On January 8, 2009, the 4th Circuit reversed and remanded the district court's decision. 
Doe v. Ali (Clan Violence and Torture)
On November 10, 2004 CJA filed a case against Colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali (a.k.a. Tokeh), a former officer in the Somali National Army during the military dictatorship of Siad Barré. Plaintiffs in the case are members of the Isaaq clan who suffered human rights abuses committed personally by Tokeh or by soldiers under his direct command.
The trial judge has referred the case to the State Department for its opinion.
Ahmed v. Magan 
On April 21, 2010, CJA filed suit against Colonel Abdi Aden Magan, former Chief of the Somali National Security Service Department of Investigations during the military dictatorship of Siad Barré, on behalf of former law professor and human rights attorney Abukar Hassan Ahmed, who suffered brutal torture under Colonel Magan's orders.
The trial judge has referred the case to the State Department for its opinion.
United States.
Reisner v. Leso 
On July 7, 2010, CJA filed a complaint with the New York Office of the Professions on behalf of psychologist Dr. Steven Reisner against psychologist Dr. John Leso for his role in designing and implementing a system of abusive interrogations at United States Naval Station at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
Venezuela.
Luis Posada Carriles Extradition 
CJA represents the family of Raymond Persaud, a 19-year-old medical student killed aboard Cubana Flight 455, in the extradition request against Luis Posada Carriles. A Cuban-born former Venezuelan intelligence agent and paid CIA operative in the covert during the 1960s, Carriles is implicated in several anti-Castro terrorist attacks including the 1976 bombing that killed Persuad along with 73 other people.
In 2005, U.S. immigration authorities detained Carriles after he illegally entered the country. Carriles received an order for deportation on September 27, 2005. However, on May 8, 2007, the seven counts of immigration fraud were dismissed by U.S. district judge Kathleen Cardone. 
Eventually, a federal appeals court reversed Judge Cardone's decision on 14 August 2008. As of January 2009, the U.S. government has refused to extradite Carriles on the grounds that the immigration proceedings are still ongoing.
Transitional justice support.
At the invitation of the Honduran Attorney General, CJA conducted a training session, Prosecuting Human Rights Crimes in National Courts, on December 4–6, 2007 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The training brought together 80 Honduran prosecutors with a faculty of legal practitioners from Latin America, Spain and the U.S.
The groundbreaking human rights trial against former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori began in December 2007 in Lima. During Fujimori's tenure (1992–2000), Peru suffered a dramatic increase in human rights violations. CJA has entered into a co-counsel agreement with the Peruvian prosecution team and has provided assistance in litigation strategy and witness preparation.
CJA was appointed senior advisor to the Peruvian Institute of Forensic Anthropology (EPAF). EPAF conducts exhumations and investigations of massacres, forced disappearances and other human rights abuses. EPAF's findings have been crucial to the criminal investigations ongoing in Peru and the cases before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. EPAF has also provided important evidence on the Accomarca Massacre to CJA for our Peru litigation.
U.S. human rights policy, legislation & enforcement.
In 2007 and 2008, CJA presented testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law.

Poundstone Amendment

The Poundstone Amendment was an amendment to the Colorado Constitution enacted in 1974 concerning county annexations. The ballot iniative was drafted by Freda Poundstone, a Colorado politician and lobbyist who opposed the efforts of Denver to absorb surrounding municipalities.

Observatorielunden

Observatorielunden is a park in Stockholm's Vasastaden district. It stretches over the steep hill "Observatoriekullen", one of the last remnants of Brunkebergsåsen, the esker that once reached across much of Norrmalm but was mostly levelled during the development of that district. Observatorielunden is bordered by the streets Odengatan to the north, Sveavägen to the east, Kungstensgatan to the south, Drottninggatan to the southwest, and Norrtullsgatan, Sandåsgatan and Gyldéngatan to the west. The Old Stockholm Observatory sits on top of the hill, and Stockholm Public Library and the Stockholm School of Economics' main building lie at its edges.
At the Old Stockholm Observatory there's also a meteorological station which has measured temperature daily since 1756. This is the oldest continuous record of temperature in the world. The temperature is still measured daily there.

Conjecture (textual criticism)

Conjecture (conjectural emendation) is a critical reconstruction of the original reading of a clearly corrupt, contaminated, nonsensical or illegible textual fragment. Conjecture is one of the techniques of textual criticism used by philologists while commenting on or preparing editions of manuscripts (e.g. biblical or other ancient texts usually transmitted in medieval copies). Conjecture is far from being just an educated guess and it takes an experienced expert with a broad knowledge of the author of the text, period, language and style of the time. Conjecture requires a close study of the text in its cultural and historical context and must be preceded with a thorough analysis of all extant versions and readings of the given fragment. The knowledge of writing styles used by the scribes throughout the transmission stages is also essential. Conjectural emendation should be seen as a solution of the last resort and must be clearly indicated in the critical apparatus or in the text itself.

F.L.Æ. Kunzen

Friedrich Ludwig Æmilius Kunzen (24 September 1761 – 28 January 1817) was a German composer and conductor who lived and worked for much of his life in Denmark.
Life.
He was born in Lübeck, where his father, Adolph Carl Kunzen, was an organist and his grandfather, Johann Paul Kunzen (1696-1757), had composed for the Hamburg Opera in the 1720s. In 1781 he began studying law in Kiel, but his true love was music, and in 1784, encouraged by composer Johann Abraham Peter Schulz, he moved to Copenhagen to pursue a musical career.
He performed as a pianist at court and in clubs, and in the next few years had successes with a memorial cantata for Count Otto Thott and music for the marriage of Crown Princess Louise Auguste to Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg, as well as theatre music. In 1788 he met the young author Jens Baggesen, and the two collaborated on the opera "Holger Danske", which premiered the following year, causing the "Holger Feud," as a result of which Kunzen temporarily left the country. For the next two years he lived in Berlin.
From 1792 until 1794 he worked as musical director of the new Frankfurter National-Theater, where he put on Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and "The Magic Flute". During his stay in Frankfurt he married one of the foremost singers of the era, Johanna Margaretha Antonetta Zuccarini (1766-1842). 
In 1794 he and his wife moved to Prague, where he worked as an opera director; the following year he was offered the position of musical director of the Royal Orchestra in Copenhagen; he immediately accepted and returned with his wife to his beloved city in 1795. His obligations were numerous, his salary poor, and his enthusiasm about Mozart was met with indigenous scepticism. As a consequence, "Cosi fan tutte" failed spectacularly in 1798." However, he had successes with "Don Giovanni" (1807) and "Die Entführung aus dem Serail" (1813). 
Aside from an occasional composition for the court and city, he composed the oratorio "Opstandelsen" (The Resurrection, 1796), the grand opera "Erik Ejegod" (1798), and various hymns and Singspiele. In 1809, he was appointed professor, and in 1811 he was honoured as a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog and appointed a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. On 28 January 1817, he suffered a stroke and died after an argument with Jens Baggesen over a plagiarism controversy concerning the opera "Trylleharpen" (The Magic Harp), which had been performed in 1806 in Vienna and Hamburg in German as "Ossians Harfe", but without success.

Task system

The task system is a system of labor under slavery characteristic of the colonial period in the United States, before the ante-bellum period. It is usually regarded as a less brutal regime than the alternative labor regime adopted afterwards in most places in the South. The other form, known as the gang system, was harsher. The difference between the task labor system and the gang labor system was characterized by the amount of work time required by the slave and also the amount of freedom given to the slave. Under this system, each slave is assigned a specific task to complete for the day. After that task is finished, the slave is then free to do as heor she wishes with the remaining time. Some plantation owners allowed their slaves to produce goods for sale in their free time under the task systems. The gang systems forced the slaves to work until the owner said they were finished and allowed them almost no freedom. 
Early rice task system.
Evidence suggests that the task system, in some places, included a gender dimension. The women laborers played a major role in the work force for rice cultivation in South Carolina. This was a division of labor that transferred directly from West African cultures. Women were responsible for the planting, weeding, harvesting, threshing, and polishing of the rice crop. Men were responsible for building canals and rice fields, flooding and draining fields, and protecting the crops from animals. 
This gendered division of labor that was already in place in the African tribal systems of rice cultivation before the Atlantic slave trade brought the slaves over to the American colonies. It was an aspect of the constellation of skills and technologies used in traditional African rice cultivation. The slaves used this knowledge to bargain with the plantation owners to gain more control over their work. It gave the plantation owners a greater knowledge of this new and non-indigenous form of farming.
"Planters knew that slaves grew rice; they also know which ethnic groups specialized in its cultivation. This knowledge came from their sustained contact with slaves in shaping the Carolina frontier and growing food staples for mutual survival."
The highly developed and knowledgeable skills concerning rice planting possessed by slaves led to their successful ability to use these skills as a bargaining chip in determining the length and conditions of their bondage in the Americas.

<doc id="21480112" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21480112" title="User profiles in Microsoft Windows">
User profiles in Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows profile refers to the user profile that is used by the Microsoft Windows operating system to represent the characteristics of the user.
Windows XP.
Profile creation.
Establishing a user account on the computer (or on its parent domain) "does not" create a profile for that user. The profile is created the first time the user interactively logs on at the computer. Logging on across a network to access shared folders does not create a profile. 
At first logon, a folder will typically be created under "Documents and Settings" (standard folder on English version of Windows 2000, XP and Windows Server 2003) matching the logon name of the user. Should a folder of that name already exist, the profile-creation process will create a new one, typically named username.computername, on workgroup computers, or username.domainname on Active Directory member computers.
Once a profile folder has been created, Windows will never automatically rename that folder. Thus if the username itself is subsequently changed, the profile folder will remain as is, and the profile will no longer match the username, which could lead to confusion. For this reason, the administrator might want to avoid renaming user accounts if at all possible, or rename the folder manually and edit the registry to reflect the changes.
The new profile is created by making a copy of a special profile named Default User. It is permissible to modify this Default User profile (within certain guidelines) so as to provide a customized working environment for each new user. Modification of the Default User profile should ideally be done prior to any users logging-on to the computer. If a user has already logged on once or more, the Default Profile has no effect whatsoever for that user.
Profile contents.
Note Some of these subfolders are hidden from the users view in Windows Explorer. To see them you must uncheck "Hide System Folders" in the folder options.
Special profiles.
"Default User" - Plays a role in the profile-creation process, see above. 
"All Users" - This profile is present mainly to answer an issue related to software installation. It provides a way for setup programs to create desktop or start-menu shortcuts which will be visible to all users of the computer, not just the user running the setup program. The Application Data section may also contain program-data common to all users. "All Users" acts purely as an information-store, it is never loaded as an active profile. 
"Administrator" - All versions of NT-based Windows have an administrator account and corresponding profile, although on XP this account may only be visible on the logon screen if the computer is started in safe mode. In Windows Vista, it is disabled by default.
History and origin.
Historically, the Windows 95/98 product line did not employ user-profiling as standard, with all users sharing the same settings, although that feature could be activated in Control Panel. 
The user-profiling scheme in force today owes its origins to Windows NT, which stored its profiles within the system folder itself, typically under C:\WINNT\Profiles\. Windows 2000 saw the change to a separate "Documents and Settings" folder for profiles, and in this respect is virtually identical to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
Recent developments.
Windows Vista's profiles are functionally similar to those of Windows XP, but with some differences. Perhaps the key difference is that they are stored in a "C:\Users" folder, instead of "C:\Documents and Settings." Therefore, to cater for programs which are not Vista-ready, a symbolic link is also provided under the name of "Documents and Settings" which invisibly redirects any attempted access of the latter to "C:\Users." The fact that the profile root folder appears twice in any folder listing has adverse implications for any backup program. Backup software needs to be aware of this Vista idiosyncrasy, or else it is possible to double the size of the backup by copying what appear to be two separate folders, both potentially containing the bulk of the data on the computer. 
A second change in Vista is that the media-specific "My Pictures" and "My Music" folders are now outside of the "My Documents" folder, instead of being subfolders (as well as removing the "My" Prefix - so My Documents becomes Documents, for example).

Lactarius quietus

Lactarius quietus (commonly known as the oak milkcap, oakbug milkcap or southern milkcap) is a mushroom of the genus "Lactarius". It is easily identified by its oily scent and the concentric bands on its cap. It is brown in colour, and is probably named after its matt, "quiet" surface and colouration. It is found exclusively under oak trees in Europe, where it grows solitarily or in scattered groups in autumn months. In North America, the variety "L. quietus" var. "incanus" is fairly common in the same habitat. The mushroom's edibility is disputed.
Taxonomy and naming.
"L. quietus" was first described and named by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries, who named it "Agaricus quietus" in the first volume of his "Systema Mycologicum", published in 1821. In his later "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", published in 1838, Fries transferred the species to "Lactarius". Subsequent attempts to reclassify the species were unsuccessful; in 1871, Paul Kummer described the species as a member of "Galorrheus", and in 1891 Otto Kuntze classified it as "Lactifluus", but today Fries's placement of the species in "Lactarius" is accepted. The specific epithet "quietus" means "quiet" or "calm", and is possibly used to refer to the unintrusive colours of the cap.
The variety "Lactarius quietus" var. "unicolor" was described by Fries in the second volume of his "Monographia Hymenomycetum Sueciae", published in 1863. The variety "Lactarius quietus" var. "incanus" was described by Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1979 "North American species of Lactarius". The name "incanus" translates as "hoary", referring to the white-coloured bloom which can sometimes be seen on the mushrooms.
"Lactarius quietus" is known by the common names Oak Milkcap, Oakbug Milkcap and the Southern Milkcap. "Lactarius quietus" var. "incanus" is commonly known as the Burnt Sugar Lactarius.
Description.
"L. quietus" typically has a convex cap of across, which later flattens or develops a small depression in the centre. In colour, the cap is a dull reddish-brown with a tint of cinnamon, sometimes with darker concentric bands or spots. This zoning is one of most distinctive features of the species. The cap is dry and matt, and not sticky when moist. It features a thick layer of firm, whitish-buff flesh. The stem measures from in height, and is typically thick. It is cylindrical in shape, but is sometimes furrowed lengthways, and it lacks a ring. It is concolourous with the cap, or a little darker, and is sometimes hollow. The brownish-white gills are slightly decurrent, and change colour with age to a pale reddish-brown with mauve hints. The milk is white or cream in colour. The mushroom has a distinctive, strong oily smell, which has also been likened to bedbugs and wet laundry. The spores are oval, with plentiful warts joined by numerous ridges, forming a well-developed network. The spores typically measure 7.5 to 9 by 6.5 to 7.5 µm, and leave a cream print.
var. "incanus".
"L. quietus" var. "incanus" is typically slightly larger than the nominate variety, and younger specimens feature a whitish bloom, after which the variant is named. It has a sweet smell reminiscent of maple syrup, and can be commonly found under oak trees. It can be confused with "L. aquifluus" and "L. mutabilis", but both of these species are found in coniferous woodland.
Edibility.
"Lactarius quietus" has been variously described as edible and inedible. The milk has a mild or slightly bitter taste. "L. quietus" var. "incanus" also has conflicting reports concerning its edibility, and so is not recommended.
Habitat, ecology and distribution.
"L. quietus" is found growing exclusively at the base of oak trees, solitarily or in scattered groups, in soil. It can be found very commonly throughout autumn months. It is ectomycorrhizal, feeding symbiotically exclusively with oak, though studies have suggested it is also able to feed saprotrophically, growing from organic soil matter. "L. quietus" can be found only in Europe; in the United Kingdom, it is one of the one hundred most commonly encountered mushroom species. "L. quietus" var. "incanus" is found commonly in eastern North America.

Paddy Hennessey

Richard Christopher “Paddy” Hennessy (born 6 October 1929) is an Irish-born former baseball (British/Welsh) player, famed for his high-speed bowling.
Life and playing career.
Born in County Cork, Ireland, his early sports were hurling and Gaelic football, but having immigrated to Wales, he used to watch his factory co-workers in Cardiff playing the game played in their breaks.
At 21, he played his first competitive game for the works team he removed St Mary’s of Canton for no runs and 13 extras. After a couple of seasons in the lower levels of the league, he was signed by Splott US (University Settlement), and he was an instant success at the top level.
In 1957 he made his debut for Wales in the annual international against England, in Liverpool. He opened the bowling and had the English at 33 for 7, but was removed after a protest over his bowling style and a series of no-balls was called.
He was again selected for the 1958 international match at Maindy Stadium, Cardiff, and he bowled England out for just 17 in their second innings, taking Wales to a comfortable win. He was also named Welsh Baseball Union player of the year.
By 1962, he had joined Grange Albion, and in that year’s international he dismissed England for just 11 in their first innings and 14 in the second, with only four batsmen hitting the ball.
Two years later, his performance in the international was even more impressive, removing England for just 6 runs in their first innings, a feat which again helped him to the WBU player of the year award, becoming the first man to achieve the honour twice.
His devastating form came to the attention of Wales’ first-class cricket team, Glamorgan County Cricket Club, who considered that a super-fast underarm bowler could give them an advantage in the new limited overs version of their game. As the first round of the new Gillette Cup loomed, captain Ossie Wheatley invited Hennessy for a trial in the nets at Cardiff Arms Park, with the thought of recruiting him as a ‘secret weapon’.
However, the laws of cricket at that time required the ball to bounce before it reached the batsman, and the trajectory of the baseball delivery made that almost impossible to achieve.
Trivia.
Paddy Hennessey is mentioned in The Baseball Song, a song by The Hennessys on their album Cardiff After Dark.

Special Armored Brigade

The Special Armored Brigade (Brigata Corazzata Speciale), also known as "Babini Group", or "Raggruppamento Babini") was an "ad hoc" armored unit formed by the Italian Royal Army ("Regio Esercito Italia") in Italian North Africa during the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign of World War II. 
The group was formed in late 1940 and was destroyed at the Battle of Beda Fomm in February 1941.
History.
In late 1940, the Italian Supreme Command moved quickly to organize the "Brigata Corazzata Speciale" (BCS). In hardly more than a month, the Italians dispatched this volunteer force to North Africa under the command of General Valentino Babini. The BCS included Italy's most up-to-date medium tanks, the M13/40. 
The M13s were a vast improvement over the M11/39s used as part of the Maletti Group ("Raggruppamento Maletti"). As opposed to the M11s, the M13s had a superior turret-mounted 47 mm tank gun. This gun was more than able to pierce the armor of the British light and cruiser tanks. 
The BCS included M13 tanks supported by three Bersaglieri battalions, one motorcycle battalion, one artillery regiment, two anti-tank gun companies, one engineering company, and several logistics units. Unfortunately, other than command vehicles, the M13s of the BCS were not equipped with radios. Communicating for most Italian tankers required the use of signal flags.
At Derna and Mechili, the BCS included fifty-five M13/40 tanks of the 3rd Battalion and the 5th Battalion from the 131 Armoured Division Centauro. This should have amounted to at least one-hundred-and-twenty M13s. But eighty-two tanks had just arrived at Benghazi and required ten days of "acclimazation" prior to operation.
At Benghazi and Beda Fomm, the BCS included almost one-hundred M13/40s.
The Italians tried to evacuate Cyrenecia in the face of the British advance, but a flying column had gotten behind them and blocked the road. In the course of an attempted breakthrough, the BCS along with the rest of the Italian 10th Army was destroyed or captured.

Cabinet of Albania

The Cabinet of Albania, also known as Council of Ministers () is the executive branch of Albania. The Chairman of the Council (Prime Minister) is appointed by the President; ministers are nominated by the President on the basis of the Prime Minister's recommendation. The Assembly of Albania must give final approval of the composition of the Council. The Council is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies. It directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.
Role.
The Council is responsible to the Parliament of Albania. The Parliament may choose to pass a motion of censure forcing the Council of Ministers to resign. This has the effect of forcing the Government to be composed of members from the majority political party in the Assembly or to be allied to the majority in a coalition. Ministers are required to answer written or oral questions put to them by members of Parliament, known as Government questions. In addition, ministers attend sessions of the Parliament when laws concerning their assigned sectors and departmental portfolios are under consideration.
Cabinet ministers cannot propose legislation without parliamentary approval. Ministers can however propose bills to Parliament and any such legislation is generally very likely to pass. On occasion, the majority opinion in Parliament may differ significantly from those of the executive, resulting in a large number of riders.
The Cabinet plays a major role in determining the agenda of the Parliament. It can propose laws and amendments during parliamentary sessions. It also has a number of procedures at its disposal to expedite parliamentary deliberations.
Rank.
Council members are subdivided into three substantial ranks, along with one honorary rank:

The Ballas Hough Band was an American pop rock band fronted by Mark Ballas and Derek Hough, both of whom play lead guitar and sing lead vocals, respectively. The band's other members are Sam Marder (bass guitar), Harry Sullivan (drums) and Emily Grace (keyboards, background vocals). Both Ballas and Hough are "Dancing with the Stars" champions.
They released their debut album, "BHB", on March 10, 2009, via Hollywood Records. The album debuted and peaked at No. 98 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200. On November 3, 2009, the group performed for the first time on "Dancing with the Stars". They performed their single, "Move", the lead-off single to their upcoming untitled second studio album.
History.
Before the band's foundation, Derek Hough and sister Julianne performed as professional dancers. They and Mark Ballas competed on the ABC television series "Dancing with the Stars". Before joining the roster of professional dancers of "Dancing With The Stars," Derek Hough and Mark Ballas were living in Great Britain, as was Derek's sister Julianne. The three had previously been members of the musical team 2B1G, whose name stood for "Two Boys, One Girl." After Julianne left this team, Mark and Derek formed another band, which they called Almost Amy, and which also included Sam Marder, Harry Sullivan and Emily Grace. This band was renamed Ballas Hough Band a short while after its members relocated to Los Angeles, California. Although they did not disclose it to their fans, Ballas Hough Band broke up. Mark Ballas has been focusing on his solo career, Emily Grace has been touring with Demi Lovato, Sam Marder has joined Dublin based band Keywest. Harry Sullivan had been drumming for Westar but in 2012 he joined Marder in Dublin to play for Keywest. They both play in this band today and are gathering fame and recognition throughout Ireland and Europe. 
Debut album: "BHB" (2008-2009).
Ballas Hough Band was signed to Hollywood Records in 2008 and released its debut album, "BHB", on March 10, 2009. The album spent one week on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, peaking at No. 98 on that chart. But its two singles, "Do It for You" and "Do You Love Me," both failed to chart. On June 21, 2009, the band announced on their MySpace page that they are now currently signed with Morey Management.
Departure from Hollywood: (2009).
The band appeared on the November 3, 2009 episode of "Dancing With The Stars" results show, on which they performed their new single, "Move." The song was intended to be the lead-off single to a second studio album. However, after the single failed to chart, they parted ways with Hollywood Records in March 2010, and the planned new album was never released. No news of any plans for another new album were available as of late June 2012.

In their youth, Henry and her sister were active socialists, joining the International Socialists and later the International-Communist League. In 1972, she was given an absolute discharge after being accused of attempting to throw a carton of milk at Edward Heath when he visited Salford.

She then became serialisation editor of "The Sun", followed by a stint as woman's editor, then assistant editor (features). According to Roy Greenslade, during the Falklands War, when she heard that the General Belgrano had been sunk, she joked "Gotcha", which was used by editor Kelvin MacKenzie as a the "Sun" headline. In 1983, she was suspended for two weeks after fabricating an interview with Falklands veteran Simon Weston. She was the first journalist to report that Princess Margaret was having a relationship with Roddy Llewellyn.
Newspaper editor.
Henry was then promoted to editor of the "News of the World"'s Sunday magazine, before being appointed editor of the newspaper in 1987. Although often described as the first female Fleet Street editor, she was preceded by Delarivier Manley, Rachel Beer and Mary Howarth.
In 1988, Henry moved to become editor of the "Sunday People", where she was able to have more input into the leading articles. While there, she became known for publishing controversial pictures, including victims of the Sioux City air crash, an ailing Sammy Davis Jr and a seven-year-old Prince William urinating in public. Following the publication of the last two photographs, particularly the one involving the Prince William, she was sacked. In 1990 she moved to the United States to become editor of "The Globe".
Later career.
In the mid-1990s, she produced "A Current Affair" on Fox. She then edited the "Spotlight" supplement of the "New York Daily News" from its launch, then edited "Successful Slimming" before returning to London to launch a British edition. She next worked for Parkhill Publishing alongside Eve Pollard, and spent a year editing "Real Homes".
Henry became Press Officer for Battersea Dogs Home in 1997, and was later secretary to several committees at the centre. In 2002, she began working for them as a full-time dog re-socialiser. In 2004, she joined noSWeat journalism training as a "Professor of Anecdotes".

Orchard Bay

Orchard Bay is a small bay on the south east coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It lies to the south west of the Ventnor Botanic Garden and just along the coast west from Steephill Cove. It faces south towards the English Channel, its shoreline is 50m in length.
The bay can be accessed by a small footpath at the western end of the bay. The beach is dominated by a house built just above the high water mark. 
Smuggling.
Andrew Turner the M.P. for the Isle of Wight, made the following statement to the house of Commons on 22 July 2002
"On 8 March, a drug smuggler was jailed for 26 years for leading an operation to bring a record £90 million consignment of cocaine into Britain by yacht. He and five of his accomplices were caught by 150 Customs officers on the Isle of Wight after the smugglers' landing was hampered by storms at the end of a 3,000-mile voyage across the Atlantic from the Caribbean. They had planned to unload 879 lb of cocaine on a private beach at Orchard Bay house near Ventnor, but the weather and the failure of their outboard motor forced them to deposit their cargo on another beach at Windy bay, about a mile away. They were trapped and arrested after members of the gang had spent hours carrying large bales of cocaine along a treacherous cliff-top path to their destination. Officials knew about the smuggling because the men had been kept under surveillance by excise men from the Cowes Customs house, among others. I understand that the smuggler had paid £657,000 for the Orchard Bay property. Customs officers on the island had been tipped off that something big was about to happen, and Operation Eyeful, which was a joint investigation with the National Crime Squad, began. It resulted in the successful apprehension of five smugglers.” 
Orchard bay House was originally built in 1828 as three coastguard cottages in order to prevent smuggling but was in 1840 acquired for use in smuggling. It is currently let as holiday accommodation.

Asperges Me

"Asperges Me" is a Latin antiphon said or sung at a Roman Catholic Solemn Mass in all seasons except the Easter (Paschal) season and Palm Sunday. It traditionally accompanies the Asperges, the ritual sprinkling of the congregation by the celebrant with holy water, as part of an entrance ritual, symbolising the cleansing of the people. Its words are taken from Psalm 51 (50):
It is followed by the conventional doxology (except on the first Sunday of Passiontide):
The antiphon is then recited a second time.
From Easter until Pentecost, "Asperges me" is replaced by the more lengthy and florid antiphon, "Vidi aquam".
Although usually sung to plainchant, "Asperges Me" has been set to music; two well-known examples are those by Gilles Binchois (Bologna, International museum and library of music, Ms Q15) and Tomás Luis de Victoria.

Parrish Art Museum

The Parrish Art Museum is an art museum designed by Herzog & de Meuron Architects and located in Water Mill, New York, whereto it moved in 2012 from Southampton Village. The museum focuses extensively on work by artists from the artist colony of the South Shore (Long Island) and North Shore (Long Island).
The Parrish Art Museum was founded in 1897. It has grown into a major art museum with a permanent collection of more than 2,600 works of art from the nineteenth century to the present, including works by such contemporary painters and sculptors such as John Chamberlain, Chuck Close, Eric Fischl, April Gornik, Donald Sultan, Elizabeth Peyton, as well as by masters Dan Flavin, Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and Willem de Kooning. The Parrish houses among the world’s most important collections of works by the preeminent American Impressionist William Merritt Chase and by the groundbreaking post-war American realist painter Fairfield Porter. 
The museum's current director is Terrie Sultan, who has written several publications related to noted artists such as Chuck Close, Kerry James Marshall, artist and musician Terry Allen, and Louise Bourgeois.
History.
Southampton village location (1897-2012).
The Museum was founded in 1897 by Samuel Longstreth Parrish, a successful attorney and Quaker who began collecting art in the early 1880s and who established the museum to house his collection of Italian Renaissance painting and copies of classical and Renaissance sculpture. Designed by noted architect Grosvenor Atterbury and constructed in 1897 in downtown Southampton at 25 Jobs Lane, the Museum was incorporated the following year as the Art Museum of Southampton. One of the impetus for founding the museum in an artist colony where William Merritt Chase founded the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art. 
The original building was expanded twice, in 1902 and 1913. After his death in 1932, the collection and building were bequeathed to the Village of Southampton but, without Parrish’s guiding vision, the Museum ceased to thrive. It wasn’t until the 1950s, under the direction of the newly elected president of the board of trustees, Rebecca Bolling Littlejohn, that the Museum enjoyed its own renaissance. Recognizing the importance of this country’s contribution to the arts, Mrs. Littlejohn launched a campaign to strengthen the Museum’s holdings of American art, with special attention to artists associated with eastern Long Island such as Thomas Moran, Childe Hassam, and Thomas Doughty. Upon her death, the Museum became the beneficiary of more than 300 paintings, drawings, and watercolors from her personal collection, which included work by Martin Johnson Heade, Asher B. Durand, John H. Twachtman, John Sloan, and a remarkable collection of thirty-one paintings by American Impressionist William Merritt Chase. 
In 1981, further depth was added to the collection when nearly 200 works of art by the prominent American painter, critic, and longtime Southampton resident Fairfield Porter (1907–1975) were donated by his wife Anne and by the artist’s estate. Building from the strength of these collections, the Museum now traces the evolution of American art from its roots in an emerging landscape tradition through the liberating influences of European modernism and the development of the New York School to the stylistic diversity of contemporary art, focusing its exhibitions and acquisitions on American painting of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with special attention to artists who have lived and worked on Long Island’s East End and their influence on the national and international art world. Once home to Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Roy Lichtenstein, among many others, today’s residents, full-time or seasonal, include Chuck Close, Ross Bleckner, April Gornik, Eric Fischl, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, and Donald Sultan.
The museum had long had a significant amount of its collection in storage. It 2000 it acquired the neighboring Rogers Memorial Library for an annex after the library moved to a new building on the edge of town. The library was acquired for $1.1 million from more than $3 million donated by Carroll Petrie for the acquisition and renovations.
The buildings were still considered too small for the collection. In 2012 as part of the move to Water Mill the library was sold for $2.875 to Ajax Holding LLC., which has plans to convert the building commercial space and to also restore it. The original Parrish structure is to undergo renovations designed by architect David Rockwell to become the new Southampton Center.
In 2011, the Parrish Art Museum was rated 0/4 by Charity Navigator, entering the list of "10 Highly Paid CEOs at Low-Rated Charities".
Water Mill location (2012-present).
The museum encountered opposition to its plans to modernize and enlarge its historic Jobs Lane complex. In 2005 the Museum purchased a site in Water Mill, New York for $3.8 million on the site of a former tree nusery immediately adjacent to the Duck Walk Vineyards winery from the original location on Jobs Lane, Southampton, for $3.8 million. The museum board’s decision was the new Parrish Museum was not to take the form of an extension of the existing building of 1897, but was to be designed as a new complex on a new and undeveloped site. Chosen from a list of 65 architect candidates, Pritzker Prize winners Herzog & de Meuron were engaged to develop a new building for the site. 
The original plan Herzog plan called for an $80 million village 62,974 square foot museum consisting of 30 modest, low-slung buildings, The buildings were to resemble the studios of area painters.
However financing fell apart in the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the museum dramatically downsized to be less than a third ($26.2 million) of the original budget. The new structure is designed as a gigantic barn 615 feet long and 95 feet wide. It has poured concete walls. The building's footprint is 34,000 square feet. It has a 6,000 square foot porch as well as educational and multi-purpose spaces. Inside, the single-floor museum is structured in a very simple way, with public functions (such as reception, store, and café) to the west, administrative offices and art handling to the east, and the galleries, arrayed in two parallel bars, on either side of a central hall with moveable walls. There are seven galleries, totaling 7,600 square feet, for the permanent collection, and three for temporary exhibitions. All of the galleries are illuminated by daylight that shifts gradually throughout the day and changes with the seasons. The building which parallels the Montauk Highway to the south and the Long Island Rail Road tracks to the north is said to have been situated so it can catch the "Hamptons light" which is said to be a reason for the area's popularity as an artist colony (its location about a mile from the Atlantic Ocean to the south and two miles from the Little Peconic Bay to the north) It officially opened on November 10, 2012. The first temporary exhibit was by Malcolm Morley who has a home in Bellport, New York.
Notable collections.
William Merritt Chase.
The Parrish holds the largest public collection of William Merritt Chase (over 40 paintings and works on paper) and an extensive archive, including over 1000 photographs relating to the life and work of the artist, in particular, family photographs of summers spent here on the East End. 
As portraitist and landscape painter, and as a teacher of art, Chase was unequalled in his day and it was not surprising that when a group of Southampton boosters had the idea of improving the summer resort by establishing an art school, the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art, they chose the prominent Mr. Chase to be the first teacher. 
The Museum’s collection features paintings from all periods of his work, including the early "Still Life with Fruit" (1871); works from the famous New York park scenes series, notably "Park in Brooklyn" (ca. 1887); major studio paintings from the 1880s, such as "The Blue Kimono" (ca. 1888); and of course, the paintings made during those summers in the Shinnecock Hills, including "The Bayberry Bush" (ca. 1895).
Fairfield Porter.
Fairfield Porter was one of the most important American realist painters from 1949 until his death in 1975. Not coincidentally, these were the years when Porter lived in Southampton, New York, and in 1979 his estate recognized the bond between the artist and the Museum by donating some 250 works to the Parrish collection.
Porter was both a gifted painter and an accomplished writer who produced some of the most lucid art criticism and commentary of the time, notably his reviews for the magazine Art News. He insisted that he painted what he saw rather than what he might assume to be there. Porter painted what he was familiar with—his family and friends and the places he lived and visited, including Southampton, New York and a family-owned island off the coast of Maine where he had summered since childhood. 
Writing about the intimate interior paintings of the French artists Vuillard and Bonnard, Porter found that in their work that recorded the ordinary "…the extraordinary is everywhere." An artist who steadfastly maintained a figurative vision, he knew and admired many Abstract Expressionist artists on the East End, especially Willem de Kooning. Porter once wrote: "The realist thinks he knows ahead of time what reality is, and the abstract artist what art is, but it is in its formality that realist art excels, and the best abstract art communicates an overwhelming sense of reality."
Other collections.
While the Chase and Porter collections are cornerstones of the Museum’s holdings, the permanent collection is wide-ranging. In 1958, Alfred Corning Clark donated to the Parrish more than two dozen paintings and watercolors, among them works by Ralph Blakelock, James A. M. Whistler, William Glackens, and Arthur B. Davies. Works by William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Ernest Lawson, and Charles Burchfield were given to the Museum by 
Clark a year later. In 1961, in addition to artists mentioned previously, Mrs. Littlejohn bequeathed to the Parrish works by John Frederick Kensett, Otis Bullard, E. L. Henry, George Luks, and Everett Shinn, among others. 
Since the Porter bequest of 1975, the Parrish has increasingly focused on American painting of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with a special emphasis on artists who have maintained studios on the East End of Long Island since the 1950s. Among those represented in the collection are Jane Freilicher, Larry Rivers, James Brooks, Alfonso Ossorio, Esteban Vicente, Jane Wilson, and Robert Dash, to name just a few. More recent East End arrivals whose work the Museum holds are Chuck Close, Joan Snyder, Joe Zucker, Alice Aycock, Lynda Benglis, April Gornik, Keith Sonnier, Mary Heilmann, Malcolm Morley, and many more. At the same time the Museum continues to strengthen its earlier twentieth-century holdings.
The collection also includes a substantial number of prints and drawings, among them works by George Bellows, Marsden Hartley, Larry Rivers, Helen Frankenthaler, and Robert Rauschenberg. In 1982 Paul F. Walter donated drawings by many Minimalist painters and sculptors, including Barry Le Va, Dorothea Rockburne, Mel Bochner, and Jennifer Bartlett. Robert Dunnigan gave the Museum more than 500 etchings in 1976, with prints by many of the American artists who participated in the “painter-etcher” movement of the late nineteenth century. Also in the Museum’s print collection are nearly 200 Japanese woodblock prints presented as part of the Littlejohn bequest. Dating from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they provide a contrast to their American counterparts from the same period.
Exhibitions.
The Museum schedules four or five exhibitions per year. While some recent shows, such as "Fairfield Porter: Raw—The Creative Process of an American Master" and "American Landscapes: Treasures from the Parrish Art Museum", are drawn from the permanent collection, the majority are exhibitions organized by Parrish curators exploring themes and concepts in art. Recent solo shows have included "Alex Katz: Seeing, Drawing, Making"; "Rackstraw Downes: Onsite Paintings, 1972-2008"; "Jean Luc Mylayne"; "Alan Shields: Stirring the Waters"; "Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters"; and "Jack Youngerman: Folding Screen Paintings." Notable among recent group exhibitions are Encouraging "American Genius: Master Paintings from the Corcoran Gallery of Art"; "All the More Real"; "Sand: Memory, Meaning, and Metaphor"; "Modern Photographs: The Machine, the Body, and the City"; and "Damaged Romanticism: A Mirror of Modern Emotion".
The Parrish also has a long tradition of juried exhibitions. For most of the Museum’s history, these exhibitions were open to all artists, who were selected by a panel of three judges. In 2008, in recognition of the Museum’s important mission of celebrating the art of the East End, the format changed. Submissions were limited to artists from eastern Long Island, whose digital entries were reviewed by nine established artists from the region. Each juror gradually narrowed his or her choices until a single selection was made. The nine chosen artists exhibited their work in tandem with the artists who selected them. This format not only focused on the artists of the region but also encouraged interaction among artists at different points in their careers. "Artists Choose Artists of the East End" will be a recurring program.
After the Parrish moved to its Water Mill location in November 2012, it has of exhibition space dedicated to temporary exhibitions and for display of the permanent collection. Future shows will focus on Alice Aycock, Josephine Meckseper, Michelle Stuart,and Jennifer Bartlett.
In an interview for Hamptons Magazine in July, 2012, Sultan said that for the opening in November, 2012, the Parrish will show its first-ever installation featuring art from all periods in the museum’s 2,600-work permanent collection, addng that many works will be completely new to visitors. During the building campaign, the article by Judith H. Dobrzynski said, the museum acquired many more painting and sculptures that will be shown, including a large Louise Nevelson sculpture, Dorothea Rockburne’s "Touchstone" and Rainer Fetting’s "Two Sunsets in East Hampton." Sultan added, "We covet a major Jackson Pollock, and some more great Abstract Expressionism pieces,” she says. “We have some, but it would be nice to have more works by Fischl, Salle, Bleckner, Close, Alice Aycock….”

Matilda of Chester, Countess of Huntingdon

Matilda of Chester, Countess of Huntingdon (1171 – 6 January 1233) was an Anglo-Norman noblewoman, sometimes known as Maud and sometimes known with the surname de Kevelioc. She was a daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester, and the wife of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. Through her daughter, Isobel, she was an ancestress of Robert the Bruce.
Family.
Lady Maude was born in 1171, the eldest child of Hugh de Kevelioc (aka Hugh De Meschines), 5th Earl of Chester and Bertrade de Montfort, a cousin of King Henry II of England. Her paternal grandparents were Ranulf de Gernon and Maud (Matilda) of Gloucester, the granddaughter of King Henry I of England, and her maternal grandparents were Simon III de Montfort, Count of Évreux and Mahaut.
Lady Matilda's five siblings were:
She also had a sister, Amice (or Amicia) of Chester, who may have been illegitimate.
Matilda's father died in 1181 when she was ten years of age. He had served in King Henry's Irish campaigns after his estates had been restored to him in 1177. They had been confiscated by the King as a result of his taking part in the baronial Revolt of 1173–1174. His son Ranulf succeeded him as Earl of Chester, and Matilda became a co-heiress of her brother.
Marriage and issue.
On 26 August 1190, she married David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon, a Scottish prince, son of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, and a younger brother of Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I of Scotland. He was almost thirty years Matilda's senior. The marriage was recorded by Benedict of Peterborough.
David and Matilda had seven children:
Her husband David had four illegitimate children by various mistresses.
On her brother Ranulf's death in October 1232 Matilda inherited a share in his estates with her other 3 sisters, and his Earldom of Chester "suo jure". Less than a month later with the consent of the King, Matilda gave an "inter vivos" gift of the Earldom to her son John the Scot who became Earl of Chester by right of his mother. He was formally invested by King Henry III as Earl of Chester on 21 November 1232. He became Earl of Chester in his own right on the death of his mother six weeks later.
Matilda died on 6 January 1233 at the age of about sixty-two. Her husband had died in 1219. In 1290, upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, which caused the extinction of the legitimate line of William I, the descendants of David and Matilda became the prime competitors for the crown of Scotland. Through their daughter, Isobel, they were the direct ancestors of the renowned Scottish King, Robert the Bruce.

Palacio Legislativo Federal

The Palacio Legislativo Federal (Federal Legislative Palace) was a never-completed building for the legislative bodies of the Mexican Federal Republic. By the end of the 19th century, the government of President Porfirio Díaz, decided the congress needed an emblematic and proud building to house the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Inspired by the Reichstag building of the German Empire, the administration called for an international competition in which several famous architects of Europe and Mexico participated. Despite declaring a winner, the government decided to appoint a new architect to draw a completely new design.
The final project is a creation by Émile Bénard. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the new president, Francisco I. Madero, changed the building's functions and name to Palacio de los Tres Poderes (Palace of the Three Powers) to be the offices of not only the legislative, but also the executive and judicial powers of the republic.
The chaos of the revolution deflected attention and resources away from the project and only the foundations, and the iron structure were completed. The building remained standing and rusting until the 1930s when it was finally decided to destroy the erected structure. However, the cupola was saved and turned into the Monument of the revolution by Carlos Obregón Santacilia, and the massive structure stands today as a mausoleum to the heroes of the Mexican Revolution and a reminder of how the Capitol of Mexico could have been.

Freiburg Hauptbahnhof

Freiburg Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station in the German city of Freiburg im Breisgau. The Rhine Valley Railway (Mannheim–Basel), Höllentalbahn ("Hell Valley Railway", Freiburg–Donaueschingen) and the Breisach Railway (Breisach–Freiburg) meet here.
The station is located on the western outskirts of the Old Town of Freiburg, about a kilometre from Freiburg Minster at 5–7 Bismarckallee. This street is also fronted by the Freiburg concert hall ("Konzerthaus Freiburg"), several hotels and the "Jazzhaus Freiburg" jazz club and the "Xpress" office complex was built along the line in 2008.
The first station building was built in 1845 in the Rundbogenstil ("round arch style"), with Romanesque Revival elements. A temporary station built after the destruction of the station in 1944/45 lasted 50 years. This was replaced around the turn of the 21st century with an ensemble of buildings, including the station hall, a shopping mall, hotels and office blocks.
It is a Category 2 station serving southern Baden-Württemberg.
History.
Construction and inauguration of the 19th century.
The construction of the Baden Mainline from Mannheim to Basel was approved at an extraordinary meeting of the Baden parliament in 1838. The first bill, presented by the Minister of State Georg Ludwig von Winter on 13 February 1838, contained no information about the places to be connected. This draft was referred to a commission, which presented its findings on 5 March. Deputy Karl Georg Hoffmann (1796–1865) introduced a motion during the debate that provided, among other things, 500,000 South German gulden to avoid Freiburg being left off the route of the line. The final version of the “Act for the construction of a railway from Mannheim to the Swiss border near Basel” ("Gesetzes betr. die Erbauung einer Eisenbahn von Mannheim bis an die Schweizer Grenze bei Basel"), which was signed by the Baden Grand Duke Leopold at the end of March 1838, included a provision explicitly stating that the line would run through Freiburg.
Although Freiburg was described as the main trading centre of upper Baden at the time, there was more political debate and more consideration of options by the railway planners than in relation to any other city of the Grand Duchy. There were two major challenges to the integration of Freiburg with the, originally single-track, line between Offenburg and Basel: The city of Freiburg is not only away from a relatively straight line between Mannheim and Basel, it is also higher than any other city on the Rhine Valley Railway north of Haltingen and in particular it was 308 Baden feet or 92.4 metres higher than Kenzingen, which is located 25 kilometres to the north. Alternative routes through the Rhine Valley that omitted Freiburg, running either from Riegel to Hartheim or from Kenzingen to Biengen near Bad Krozingen, would have been much shorter and would not have involved the gradients required to climb to the "Freiburger Bucht" (the lowlands around Freiburg) at the foot of the Black Forest.
The commission's proposal for the construction of the line to begin in Mannheim, Freiburg and Isteiner Klotz (a hill south of Schliengen) had not come about. The commission wanted to wait to benefit from the experience of the construction of the line from Mannheim and found that this approach facilitated the work while also allowed a degree of flexibility in the operation of the line. According to the law of 1838 work should have started immediately, at least preliminary work, so "that the progress of the railway is stopped nowhere" ("daß die Bahn in ihrem Fortschreiten nirgends aufgehalten wird"). After a proposal to build a passenger station at a site in Lehen in the area of the current A 5 autobahn was excluded as being located too far from Freiburg, it decided to build the line immediately west of the city through the "Vauban belt", the flat zone previously kept clear for firing cannon-shot from the fortifications ("Festungsrayon") designed by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban. There was plenty of space for an extensive network of tracks. This solution, however, required a grade of 1:171 (0.58%, according to other sources 0.53%), the largest grade on the Baden mainline. This required levelling of the route from Köndringen, continuing to the south to Schallstadt.
The railway reached Offenburg on 1 June 1844 and construction began on the section from Riegel to Freiburg in 1841. In 1843, the cornerstone was laid for the station in Freiburg; this ceremony involved the transportation of the locomotive, "Der Rhein" of the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe (“Karlsruhe Engineering Works”) over the highway to Freiburg. On 22 July 1845, the first trial train to Freiburg ran with six carriages, hauled by the locomotive, "Der Kaiserstuhl" of Baden class IIIc. Another trial followed on 26 July with the locomotive "Keppler", which hauled 700 passengers in 21 carriages to Freiburg.
On 30 July 1845 the station was opened in the presence of Grand Duke Leopold and his son Prince Frederick. Apart from politicians, such as the Baden Foreign Minister, Alexander von Dusch, the Minister for the Interior, Karl Friedrich Nebenius and Frederick Rettig, officials, mayors and officers of the town guards ("Bürgerwehr") of the local towns travelled on a train hauled by the locomotive, "Zähringen", with musical accompaniment by the guards regiment, which had already travelled over the line. When the train arrived in Freiburg at 12.40, Mayor Friedrich Wagner welcomed the guests at the still unfinished station building, while cannons on the Schlossberg fired a salute.
As early as August 1845, 1,474 passengers used the new express carriages to Freiburg and 1,682 passengers departed the city by train, which now operated five services per day. While the stagecoach service between Freiburg and Offenburg closed with the opening of the railway line, stagecoaches ran three times each day between Basel and Freiburg, each way. Franz Liszt is believed to have been one of the first famous passengers to use Freiburg station; he travelled on 16 October 1845 from Heidelberg to Freiburg in order to give a concert the next day. Freight operations also began in the summer of 1845.
With the completion of the section south to Schliengen in 1847, the temporary terminal station with two terminating tracks was converted into a through station with two continuing platform tracks, which were both required to deal with the increased volume of traffic. The rail link north to Rastatt and Karlsruhe played a decisive role in the Baden Revolution of 1848 and in its defeat in Breisgau by loyalists and Hessian troops and their heavy military equipment, which were quickly moved to Freiburg.
Extensions to the First World War.
The “station at Freiburg" ("Bahnhof bei Freiburg") was initially outside the city, as shown in the plan by Joseph Wilhelm Lerch of 1852. It was initially accessible only via the extended Bertoldstraße, until the completion of the entrance building on Eisenbahnstraße (railway street) in 1861. The construction of the railway station led to Freiburg finally growing out of the confines of the fortress. Hotels, restaurants and the central post office were built in the Vauban belt along Eisenbahnstraße and a landscaped area was established between the city and the station. The city of Freiburg implemented a zoning plan called "Hinterm Bahnhof" ("behind the station"), leading to the development of the current Stühlinger quarter. Commercial operations and factories were soon established there, some of which were displaced from the now residential areas of Herder and Wiehre.
During the 1870s, the Baden Railway expanded the station with waiting rooms, utility rooms and a courtyard. As a result of the annexation of Alsace after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, Alsace-Lorraine was quickly connected to the rail network by the Freiburg–Colmar railway, which made a third platform track and second platform necessary. The Elz Valley Railway branching from the Rhine Valley Railway in Denzlingen opened to Waldkirch in 1875 and was extended to Elzach in 1901.
In 1885, rail transport in Freiburg had increased so much that the old station hall was demolished and two new halls were built. The level crossing was replaced by a bridge, then called the Kaiser Wilhelm bridge and now called Wiwilí bridge, after Freiburg's sister city in Nicaragua. Two underpasses were created during the renovation of 1885/86; these still exist today and lead to stairs connecting to each platform.
The station was named "Hauptbahnhof" ("main station") following the opening of the Hell Valley Railway ("Höllentalbahn") and Freiburg Wiehre station in 1887.
Freight warehouses and loading areas in the station hardly increased in the late 19th century despite an increase of about 20 percent of traffic since 1878. Therefore, between 1901 and 1905, a separate freight yard and an 11 kilometre long freight bypass line was built between Gundelfingen and Leutersberg for the relief of the main line.
Growth during the Weimar Republic.
The station facilities for handling passengers were often criticised from the beginning of the 20th century. Complaints were made about the lack of platform tracks, which meant that arriving and waiting trains often had to share one of the three tracks. This could be a source of danger, as was shown, for example, in 1924, when a departing suburban train ran into another train that had run early and was waiting in the station. Also, the station was the target of criticism and the "Freiburger Zeitung" newspaper called it a "mousetrap". The passenger volume also increased massively in parallel with the population growth of Freiburg. Ticket sales in 1919 had almost doubled from the 1,340,954 tickets sold in 1900.
Therefore, in 1910 there were plans for a complete rebuild of the station. The initial plans called for an entrance hall crowned by a dome and with a natural stone frontage, which would have been 90 metres wide and 8 metres deep. However, with planning almost complete, construction was delayed "until further notice" by the outbreak of the First World War. The necessary preparatory work for the new construction, the complete separation of passenger and luggage movements, was still completed.
It took until 1929 to establish an operations and locomotive depot between the Dreisam river and Basler Straße. This made it possible to create space for additional tracks and platforms since the locomotive sheds and workshops that had been located west of the station could now be moved to the new depot, which is now on the site of the DB Regio workshop in Freiburg. The space created was used for the construction of two more platforms in 1929 and 1938. The first of the two new platforms had a width of eight metres and a length of 270 metres. The drain on the roof was initially installed in the centre and was no longer on the roof’s slope. A postal lift was also installed with the construction of one of the new platforms.
Basler Straße was relocated in the course of the work by 50 metres to the side and lowered by about six metres. This enabled the two tracks of the main line, a headshunt and the two separate tracks of the Höllentalbahn, which had been opened on 8 November 1934, to cross over the street on three new bridges. The most dangerous level crossings within the city had now been eliminated. Crossings removed earlier included those at Albertstraße (the underpass is now called Mathildenstraße), Lehener Straße (both replaced in 1905) and on the Höllentalbahn (replaced in 1934).
Despite the cramped conditions, luxury trains already passed through the station at this time: in the summer of 1901, the Amsterdam–Engadin Express began operating. It was not, however, destined for a long life. Much more successful was the launch of the Rheingold on 15 May 1928, which served the station until the beginning of the war on 1 September 1939, when it had recently run over the Gotthard as far as Naples. On 15 May 1939, the Reichsbahn began running high-speed railcars ("Schnelltriebwagen") via Freiburg on the Basel–Dortmund route (FDt 49/50) (operated with DRB 137 273 ... 858 sets) and Basel–Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof (FDt 33/34); these were both discontinued at the outbreak of war.
Second World War and its aftermath.
The number of tickets sold in Freiburg plummeted before the war began as a result of the promotion of road transport during the Third Reich (for instance by building the autobahns). This decrease was further enhanced with the outbreak of war, as from 1940, the government ordered the Reichsbahn to reduce its operations over the line. The use of the line by civilian passengers had to be restricted because of the war. In March 1942, the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda threatened persons who used the congested strategic railway "for fun" with heavy penalties and even dispatch to concentration camps.
On the night of 21/22 October 1940, the district leadership in South Baden, as part of the "Wagner-Bürckel Action", authorised 450 Jews from Freiburg and the former Freiburg district to be deported from the station’s goods hall to the Gurs internment camp. Since 2003, there has been a memorial to the deportation on Wiwilí bridge.
As in the First World War, when no major damage had been caused to railway installations by the air raids of the French, the station was the target of bombing raids in the Second World War, including two major raids at the end of the war. This time, however, it felt the impact: the British air raid on the city on the evening of 27 November 1944, Operation Tigerfish, destroyed all the overhead line, the majority of the tracks and almost the entire main station building. The clock tower, which survived the raid intact, was toppled in another raid on 8 February 1945. Even the marshalling yard and the engine shed were badly affected.
Already in 1945, the U.S. occupation forces in their zone of occupation required the northern part of the Baden Mainline to be restored to operation. The line was returned to working order to Freiburg, on 7 September, and the line was restored to Basel on 5 November. However, the French occupation troops were ordered to dismantle one track of the Offenburg–Freiburg–Müllheim and Radolfzell–Konstanz sections to reduce the business on the now single-track right bank (that is east or north of the Rhine) line and thus increase traffic for the French National Railways (SNCF) on the left bank. In fact, this work was limited to the Offenburg–Denzlingen section and so Freiburg was spared from the dismantling. The number of trains running between Freiburg and Offenburg was now much less substantial than directly after the opening of the line, 100 years earlier. Moreover, Germans could only use third class on the majority of the few trains running until 14 May 1950. In 1952, there were again 12 pairs of expresses on the Baden Mainline.
On 1 August 1945, the operation of a limited third class suburban passenger service commenced, using freight trains. Of these, one ran from Norsingen (on the Rhine Valley Railway to the south) to the Hauptbahnhof and another two ran from Denzlingen (in the north) and Hugstetten (on the Breisach Railway) and terminated in the marshalling yard. The line from Himmelreich ("Höllentalbahn") ran to Wiehre station. It was not until 19 December 1950 that repairs were completed to the damaged tracks on the Höllentalbahn and the Loretto tunnel, which had been blown up by the retreating Wehrmacht, restoring two tracks between Wiehre and Freiburg Hauptbahnhof. As early as October, the Baden Mainline had been restored to two-track operations, as the result of Swiss diplomacy.
The state railway of the French occupation zone in 1945 decided to continue the operation of the 20 kV 50 Hz experiment on the Höllentalbahn, which had operated on the line between 1936 and 1944. Electrification on the Baden Mainline at 15 kV 16 2/3 Hz, started in 1952, was completed to Freiburg by the end of May 1955. As the locomotives could not operate at 50 Hz, steam locomotives hauled freight trains from the Freiburg freight yard via the Hauptbahnhof to the Höllentalbahn. This system ran for five years before the experiment on the Höllentalbahn was abandoned. The two-system operation also made the establishment of ab eighth platform track necessary. With the electrification of the main line from Basel, a class E 10 electric locomotives hauled the first service to Freiburg on 4 June 1955, a day later it was hauled by a class 38 steam locomotive to Stuttgart.
Cleanup work on the station building did not begin until the autumn of 1947 and it was slow due to personnel shortages and poor materials until the currency reform of 1948. Freiburg station was rebuilt with a temporary entrance building, which was one of the first station buildings built in a German city after the war. The opening took place on 9 November 1949 in the presence of the Baden State President Leo Wohleb. A substantial renovation of the interior of the building was carried out between 1985 and 1986 on the occasion of the Freiburg State Garden Show, after the building had been extended in 1955/56.
At this time there was debate, that was to last for several decades, as to whether a renovation or construction of a new station building was required and there was much criticism in the press of the existing building. According to Badischer Zeitung newspaper the building was a disgrace to the commercial and touristic city of Freiburg and was appropriate for "a provincial 'nest' rather than a city with 160,000 people".
In the following years designs were produced, which provided for a multi-level pedestrian platform over the tracks connecting to the city centre. In addition to the mainline station, underground tram and bus stations were planned. Also, the "Technische Rathaus" (“technical town hall”), which was later realised in Fehrenbachallee would be built above the tracks, along with 7–15 storey high-rise buildings with cinemas, department stores, cultural and convention centres and parking garages. A plan put forward in 1965 by the chief architect of the Freiburg city council, Hans Geiges called for the sale and leasing of all the land and air space. Deutsche Bundesbahn agreed in 1969 to the project as it would get more space for tracks for the upgrade of the Rhine Valley line. However, the DM 40 million "Bahnhofsplatte" (station plate) project failed in October 1970 because the city could not find investors. During the debate over the construction of a new culture and congress centre, the architect Manfred Saß designed a new railway station with an integrated convention centre. This provided for a 115 metre long structural plate located 4.5 m above the tracks and would have accommodated the construction of a hall that was up to 12 metres high. The cost in 1978 was estimated at DM 86 million. In the same year, the resignation of the Minister President of Baden-Württemberg, Hans Filbinger, who had long lived in Freiburg, reduced the prospects of national funding for the project. Since Deutsche Bundesbahn did not want to finance any major projects as a result of increasing competition from air transport, it asked for the suspension of negotiations in 1980.
The operation at the station went on and Deutsche Bundesbahn had resumed operations of both high-speed railcars and the "Rheingold". The fastest train, stopping at the station in 1960 was a Trans-Europe Express, the Helvetia, which reached a top speed of 140 km/h.
The number of tickets sold at the railway station stood at 1.35559 million (plus 29,491 in Zähringen and 11,745 in Herder), roughly the same level as at the turn of the century and in 1935. Sales were declining as they were throughout the area of the DB Railway division in Karlsruhe. In the summer of 1960 on working days, Sundays and holidays, 163 passenger trains ran on the Rhine Valley Railway (49 express and long distance express trains, 25 semi-fast trains), 36 on the Breisach Railway (10 multiple units) and 48 on the Höllentalbahn (12 semi-fast trains).
On 26 September 1971, the winter section of the 1971/1972 timetable came into force and Freiburg became part of the Intercity age: the station was on line 4 from Basel to Hamburg-Altona from the beginning to the former IC network of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.
With the inauguration of the Stadtbahn bridge south of the station building the tram network was also expanded in 1983. The neighbouring Wiwilí Bridge was no longer adequate for the traffic. Previously, trams also ran on Bismarckallee in front of the main entrance. All tracks are accessible from the new bridge. On each platform there are lifts and platforms 1 and 2/3, which are used by Intercity-Express services, are also equipped with escalators. They were upgraded by 27 September 1992, when the first Intercity-Express was scheduled to stop at the station on its way to Switzerland.
Construction of a new station building.
After the failed plans for the "Bahnhofsplatte" project and for the congress centre, the decision to build the Freiburg Concert Hall in 1988 restarted progress in the station area. Steigenberger Hotels, then a subsidiary of Deutsche Bundesbahn, decided to build a new InterCity Hotel at the station. This expanded in 1990 into planning for the full redevelopment of the entire area. Deutsche Bundesbahn, which was organised as a government agency, found itself unable to fund the necessary investment and therefore invited proposals from investors to be judged by the architect and town planner Albert Speer, Jr. There were nine proposals from seven investors. The winner was the Waldkirch architectural firm of "Harter und Kanzler", with the Bilfinger Berger construction company as an investor. After consideration of various aspects of the plans by the public and the authorities, the plans were modified and the development plan for the new station were approved by Freiburg City Council on 22 June 1992.
Demolition carried out in February 1997 created space for the new building. The new station was opened on 29 September 1999 and the whole development zone around the station followed on 18 July 2001. During the renovation Corinthian columns were discovered, which since the renovation of 1885/86 had supported two platform canopies on track 1. Since retaining the columns would have required a complicated re-adjustment of the height of the roof, Deutsche Bundesbahn gave the columns away. Some of them went to the museum railway on the Wutach Valley Railway, where Weizen station has been completely rebuilt with one of the old platform canopies. The remaining columns were stored away by the city at the depot of the civil engineering office until the summer of 2010 when they were installed as a decoration in a beer garden near the station.
Today the station is served by about 250 trains a day, with 60,000 passengers embarking or disembarking daily. In addition another 50 to 150 trains pass the station each day without stopping. The station has largely reached capacity, especially as the number of passengers has doubled since 1979.
Architecture.
First building (1845–1945).
The two-storey station building was built to the design of the architect Friedrich Eisenlohr in the historicist style of the time with many Romanesque Revival components. As with the other important stations in Baden, the building in Freiburg was implemented in the Rundbogenstil (round arch style), which explains the preference for round-arched openings in walls and arcades.
The reception building was 70 metres long, 40 metres of this was built as two storeys. Its vestibule was reached through one of seven arches, which extended between two wings and were formed with lesenes. Above the roof turret there was a clock tower, which was crowned in the early drawings by a "graceful spire." After the spire was removed, which is already visible in photographs of 1910, the preservationist Manfred Berger considered the clock detracted from the otherwise well-balanced construction. On the ground floor there were offices for railway staff and rooms for a telegraph office and a post office. On the second floor there was housing for railway employees.
Between the platform area and the entrance building there was an open courtyard with a fountain, modelled after a Greek or Roman atrium. Along the sides there were facilities necessary for travel, including three waiting rooms for the first to third classes. The connecting building was, in contrast to many other former station buildings, arranged perpendicular to the tracks. This allowed Eisenlohr to leave the platform area and the entrance building as separate architectural units, despite the connection. However, passengers had to take into account a long walk.
The train shed was 110 metres long and 16.3 metres wide with ridgeline of the roof at a height of 12.3 metres, the biggest in Baden. It consisted of three naves in the style of a basilica with roofs that could be drained externally. This was an improvement over Mannheim station, where there had only been two naves and there had been problems with drainage. The slate roof lay on a structure made of native wood, as Eisenlohr had avoided expensive cast iron for reasons of cost. Nevertheless, this station was, like many other stations in Baden, criticised at first for its opulence.
As the freight yard was not yet separated from the passenger station, the loading of freight was possible using a loading siding and a loading road on both sides of the station. On the west side of the station there were larger loading areas and cranes, but no large gantry crane. The freight halls were on the east side of the station. The entrance freight hall contained both of the customs warehouses. The receiving and shipping area were each 99 metres long but only 13.5 meters wide. The express freight hall had a storage area of 640 m².
The only remaining building of the original station area, the carriage halls that were built in 1845 between Wenzingerstraße and track 8, are both under heritage protection.
Second building (1949–1999).
The lack of financial resources, building materials and construction machinery meant that an architecturally complex solution could be ruled out from the beginning. Therefore, it was decided the re-use of the intact foundations and the basement. On this basis, a floor plan was created with a massive central block and two lower wings in lightweight construction, which could be later expanded on one level or replaced by multi-storey buildings. It was designed and built by the railway administration and the architect Walter Lay.
The steel frame of the skylight of the old building had also survived the air raids. By reusing this component with dimensions of 15.6 × 12.4 metres, the middle part of the building was adequately supplied with natural light, which, given the height of the hall, which was only 5.5 meters, would otherwise not have been possible. Unlike its predecessor, the waiting rooms were no longer determined by ticket class, but instead by the distinction between smokers and non-smokers. A clock tower was placed on the roof in order to recall the memory of the old station.
The main hall, built between 1947 and 1949 for DM 300,000 by the construction company Bilfinger Berger was, according to the Badische Zeitung newspaper, recognised for its "extremely clever floor plan", especially in view the fact that there was only 30 metres between the platform and the station forecourt. At 520 m² the area with the station hall was even larger than its predecessor. The British magazine, The Railway Gazette described the building in 1950 as "not only fully adequate for the purpose, but also satisfactory architecturally".
The third building (since 2001).
The temporary station was demolished and replaced by a new building with a gross floor area of 40,000 m² and a gross volume of 230,000 m³, significantly larger than the old complex. The building cost a total of € 61.4 million.
Its core consists of two buildings with six floors (22 metres high) and a length of 275 metres on the tracks and 265 metres on Bismarckallee and two office towers with a height of 44 and 66 metres. They are located opposite Eisenbahnstraße and Rosastraße. The higher of the two towers is the second tallest building in the city after Freiburg Minster.
The two buildings are connected by a glass roof built above the level of their second floors; under it there are the entrance hall and a market hall connected to it along with the DB travel centre. In addition, there are a variety of restaurants and shops in the market hall and the loft over it. In the remaining floors and the two office towers there is 25,000 m² of office space. On the two upper floors of the higher tower is the "Kagan", a combination of café, bar and nightclub.
There is access via escalators and a glass elevator from the entrance hall to the basement, where there are also businesses. From there it is possible to reach all eight platforms, the station’s underground garage and the central bus station. A staircase and an elevator lead to the opposite side of Bismarckallee, where Eisenbahnstraße lead to the city centre. On the other side of the railway underpass, there is a ramp and a staircase to Wentzingerstraße, giving access to the Stühlinger district.
The underpass is illuminated by a skylight that is integrated into the station forecourt between the station building and the InterCity Hotel. Benches are placed around the skylight, which is about a metre high. The floating roof of the entrance building reflects, according to the architects, the roof of the concert hall and the two towers relate on the other hand, according to their owners, to the cathedral and the towns two gates ("Martinstor" and "Schwabentor").
The facade of the building is largely transparent as it is made of glass, but the west side is rather dark as a result of the use of prefabricated parts. The two towers on the south side have a photovoltaic system built to the plans of "Solarstrom AG", which earned the architectural firm of "Harter und Kanzler" an award for photovoltaic architecture in 2001 from the State of Baden-Württemberg.
Tracks.
The main tracks of the Freiburg station consists of the two tracks of the Rhine Valley Railway and the two tracks of the Höllentalbahn and the single track of the line to Breisach. Between the tracks of the Rhine Valley Railway and the Höllentalbahn to the south of the paltforms there is a depot with sidings that supply rolling stock for the Höllentalbahn and the Rhine Valley Railway between Basel and Karlsruhe and, since 2004, the Black Forest Railway. Currently it houses locomotives of classes 110, 111, 143, 146.1 and 146.2 and several red n-coaches and double deck coaches. 
Operations.
Long-distance passenger services.
In long-distance traffic there are regular Intercity-Express connections from Freiburg station to the north in the direction of Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne from platform track 1. Services operate to Hamburg, with some services continuing to Kiel. Services to Cologne consist of coupled sets, which are separated in Cologne, continuing to Amsterdam and Dortmund. In addition, there are daily IC services to both Frankfurt and Nuremberg. Most trains to the south run to Basel, with some continuing to Zürich or Interlaken Ost. The long-distance trains to the south mostly stop on track 3.
EuroCity services on the Chur–Hamburg/Hamburg–Chur route also stop in Freiburg.
In addition to an express train through Hanover and Minsk to Moscow, several City Night Line run through Karlsruhe, with portions continuing to Hamburg-Altona, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Another CNL service runs through Mannheim and Frankfurt to Weimar. From there, portions of the train run via Leipzig to Prague as well as to Halle and Berlin-Gesundbrunnen and from there, in the summer, to Binz.
Local services.
Regular intervals services (leaving and arriving around the hour and the half hour) result in many radial connections in all directions. On the Rhine Valley Railway, many of the Regional-Express services run between Offenburg and Basel without change.
Services run on the Höllentalbahn every half hour towards Hinterzarten/Titisee in the Black Forest, with trains continuing towards Neustadt or via the Three Lakes Railway ("DreiSeenBahn") to Schluchsee-Seebrugg. Neustadt is connected to Donaueschingen on the Black Forest Railway, where services connect towards Rottweil or over the Danube Valley Railway to Tuttlingen and Ulm.
The Breisgau S-Bahn, the regional rail services of the Freiburg area, connects Freiburg every half hour via the Breisach Railway with Breisach and the Kaiserstuhl Railway, which branches in Gottenheim, running through some of the towns of the Kaiserstuhl. The same company also operates the Elz Valley Railway. Trains run hourly to and from Elzach and every half hour to Waldkirch. The South German Railway Company ("Süddeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft AG", SWEG) operates the trains on the Münster Valley Railway, but only a few of its services run to Freiburg.
Transport links.
Freiburg station was already in the 1950s an important junction between long-distance, regional and local transport. It allowed direct transfer into post buses (buses then operated by the German Post Office) and trams; this was probably the only place this happed in Freiburg at the time. The central bus station is now located at the southern end of platform 1. It is mainly served by "SüdbadenBus" (SBG), which has also established and operates a service centre here. From here, there are up to 15 bus services each day operated by "Freiburger Reisedienst" to EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg. There are also links to Europa-Park in Rust, in the Black Forest to Elzach and St. Peter and to Colmar and Mulhouse, operated by SBG, and some private bus routes operated by "Regio-Verkehrsverbund" (Freiburg regional transport association of Freiburg, RVF). A total of 15 bus routes serve the central bus station.
Stühlinger bridge is located over the tracks as an overpass for pedestrians and trams and it has a stop called "Hauptbahnhof (Stadtbahn)" on the Freiburg tramway operated by Freiburger Verkehrs AG (Freiburg Taransport, VAG). This stop is served by three of Freiburg’s four tram lines. There is a bus stop for VAG under the bridge, near the bus station in Bismarckallee.

Carlo Pallavicino

Carlo Pallavicino (Pallavicini) (ca. 1630 – 29 January 1688) was an Italian composer.
Pallavicino was born at Salò, Italy. From 1666 to 1673, he worked at the Dresden court; from 1674 to 1685, at the "Ospedale degli Incurabili" (a conservatory where orphaned children were musically trained) in Venice and further in Dresden. In August and September 1687, he was with the concert master Georg Gottfried Backstroh back in Venice. He asked for renewal of his leave because his wife expected to give birth, but he was rejected. He died in Dresden, and his grave is located in the Convent of the St. Mariestern.
He wrote more than 20 operas premiered in Venice and Dresden, oratorios and sacred works. His son, Dresden court writer Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino was a known librettist.

Debolt Formation

The Debolt Formation is a stratigraphical unit of Meramecian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 
It takes the name from the hamlet of Debolt, Alberta, and was first described in the Amerada Crown GF23-11 well near Debolt by G. Macauley in 1958.
Lithology.
The Debolt Formation consists of bioclastic limestone in the base, with dolomitized areas in the east and with increased shale content in the north. Chert and dolomite are more frequent closer to the Canadian Rockies foothills. The upper Debolt is composed of dolomite and anhydrite and crystalline limestone. The facies is mainly limestone in north-eastern British Columbia.
Distribution.
The Debolt Formation is present in the sub-surface in the Peace River Country in northern Alberta and north-eastern British Columbia. The formation is thick close to the Rocky Mountains, and thins out northward and eastward. It has a thickness of at its type locality near Debolt, Alberta.
Relationship to other units.
The Debolt Formation is the upper most component of the Rundle Group. It rests conformably on the Shunda Formation, resting on shale and carbonates. It is overlain conformably by the Golata Formation of the Stoddart Group in the west, and the upper contact becomes unconformable with gradually newer formations to the east and north (Permian, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous beds).

China–Saudi Arabia relations

China–Saudi Arabia relations refers to the current and historical bilateral relationship between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The first Sino-Saudi official meeting took place in Oman in November 1985,
following several years of heightened contact between the two countries. The two governments established official diplomatic relations in July 1990. Prior to the 1990s, bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not exist. In 1975, Saudi Arabia refused to recognize the PRC as a country, despite the PRC's desire to establish relations and acceptance of Saudi Arabian policies. At present, it is said that "oil is the backbone of the relationship." 
Establishing relations.
As of 1989, Saudi Arabia was the only Arab country that still had not established Diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China (although Saudi Arabia did maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan). After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 occurred in Beijing in June of that year, Saudi Arabian government relations with the PRC were upgraded. Despite the event, Saudi Arabia did not provide any criticism of the event. In fact, in August 1989, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry official presented his credentials to the PRC's foreign minister. Less than a year later in July 1990, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States paid a visit to Beijing with an agreement to establish diplomatic relations. A few days later, diplomatic relations were established in Riyadh. At this point, Saudi Arabia ended over forty years of diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Taiwan–Saudi Arabia relations.
After World War II, Taiwan maintained diplomatic relations with only a few Middle Eastern countries, one of which was Saudi Arabia. This was for two reasons. The first reason was largely out of "economic necessity," as Saudi Arabia was the largest supplier of oil to Taiwan, with Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum Company importing about 40% of its oil annually from Saudi Arabia. Because Taiwan was so reliant on Saudi Arabia's oil supplies, Taiwan put a significant amount of effort into maintaining relations. The second reason for Taiwan's active foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia is because since 1949, Saudi Arabia was one of the few countries that recognized Taiwan as its own country, even after Taiwan lost its seat in the UN Security Council in 1971.
Relations between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia began in 1965 and were initially based on an agricultural relationship. As a way to demonstrate rice cultivation, Taiwan sent agricultural missions to Saudi Arabia. Then, in 1973, the two countries signed an agricultural cooperation agreement, in which Taiwan provided Saudi Arabia with a number of assistance programs, including irrigation, mechanized cultivation, soil, meteorology, crop rotation, and fishing technology. In 1978, Taiwan also began providing technical assistance in the field of health care. Taiwan has even provided Saudi Arabia with a number of doctors and nurses.
Taiwan has also provided significant technical assistance to Saudi Arabia. In 1973, Taiwan's largest heavy construction company, Ret-Ser Engineering Agency (RSEA), began working on the 110-kilometer Mecca to Hawiya highway in Saudi Arabia. This led to other large projects, including the $100.4 million Shaar highway (夏爾降坡道路), the construction of an industrial park and sewage system, offshore and onshore work in the Saudi Naval Expansion Program, and housing for the King Abd al-Aziz Military Academy and King Khalid Military City. As of 1984, RSEA's projects in Taiwan amounted to a total dollar value of $1.3 billion. The majority of trade between the two nations consisted of petroleum from Saudi Arabia and building materials and consumer goods from Taiwan.
Bilateral visits.
The first diplomatic visit between Saudi Arabia and the People's Republic of China occurred in 1999, when the PRC President Jiang Zemin visited Riyadh, which resulted in the mutual signing of the 1999 Strategic Oil Cooperation agreement. The agreement stipulated that the PRC would open its oil refinery sector to Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia would allow for exploration and development opportunities for Chinese investors. While the agreement acted as a starting point for bilateral relations, the results of the agreement were small, as China was not able to use most of the sour crude oil provided by Saudi Arabia's new reserves in Chinese refining facilities.
Sino-Saudi diplomatic and economic relations grew closer in the 2000s. In 2004, the People's Republic of China and Saudi Arabia initiated a series of regular political meetings. During the same year, Sinopec, China's state-run oil company, signed an agreement to explore gas in the Empty Quarter (Rub' al Khali) in Saudi Arabia. Then, in December 2005, the People's Republic of China and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held their first set of formal talks.
In January 2006, King Abdullah was the first ever Saudi head of State to visit China. While in China, King Abdullah signed five major agreements on energy cooperation. The visit was also used as a way to discuss broader economic trade, taxation and technical accords, a vocational training agreement, as well as to finalize an urban development loan for the Saudi Arabian Development Bank in China's Xinjiang province. President Hu exclaimed that this bilateral cooperation would "write a new chapter of friendly cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia in the new century." His visit was reciprocated by Chinese President Hu Jintao on April 22 of the same year, as part of a world tour. President Hu was only the second foreign leader in history who was granted permission to address Saudi Arabia's legislative council. During this time, the two leaders supposedly signed several agreements regarding further energy exploration and security collaboration. It is said that Saudi Arabia views economic ties with the PRC in a favorable light because they come with "no strings attached" and focus on economic issues rather than political ones. His only mention of non-economical related affairs was, "war and military force is never a permanent solution to a problem," advising to "persist with a just and fair handling of conflicts and bridging of differences through political means." He did not touch upon democracy or human rights.
In February 2009, Hu visited Saudi Arabia a second time, to "exchange views on international and regional issues of common concern" with King Abdullah. During this visit, Hu commemorated the opening of a cement plant in Saudi Arabia and worked to strengthen bilateral ties.
Trade and investment.
Sino-Saudi trade has increased significantly since 2000. In 2005 alone, trade increased 59%, allowing Saudi Arabia to overtake Angola as China's largest source of oil for the first time. After claiming the throne in 2005, King Abdullah adopted a pro-Asian, “look east” trade policy, with more than half of Saudi oil going to Asia. Saudi-owned Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) alone exports over $2 billion in petrochemicals to China on a yearly basis. In 2008, Sino-Saudi bilateral trade was worth € 32,500,000,000, making Saudi Arabia China's largest trading partner in Western Asia. In the first quarter of 2010, Saudi oil export to China has reached over 1 million barrels, exceeding exports to the USA. With the huge increase in Sino-Saudi trade, Saudi Arabia has emerged as a significant investor in the PRC. Saudis are eager to invest in Chinese oil-industry related projects as a way to secure their status as a major oil provider to China. For example, in 2004, Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco Overseas Company invested nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion in funds needed for the construction of a petrochemical facility in China's southeastern Fujian Province, which is planned to process 8 million tons of Saudi crude oil. Upon completion of this project, the refinery would be able to refine triple its capacity and have the ability to process the Saudi "distressed" crude oil that otherwise could not be refined in China. Further, in 2006, the PRC and Saudi Arabia agreed to jointly construct an oil storage facility on China's Hainan Island and Saudi Arabia invited Chinese firms to participate in infrastructure development worth $624 billion. On April 6, 2012, SABIC announced a new investment plan of $100 million to set up a new technology center in the Kangqiao area of Shanghai. Three days earlier on April 3, SABIC launched the second phase of construction projects for petrochemical plants in the cities of Tianjin and Chongqing, which were part of the US$11 billion project with the state-run Sinopec Group to continue boosting output at polycarbonate production complexes. Besides oil-related companies, other major Saudi companies - such as the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and Saudi Arabian Airlines have established offices in China. In 2006, Saudi Arabia invested $1.1 billion in China, the first significant investment since 2000. Likewise, in 2006, China's largest aluminum producer - Aluminum of China (Chalco) partnered with Saudi companies to build a $3 billion aluminum facility in Saudi Arabia. In 2009, China Railway Company won a $1.8 billion bid to build a monorail in Mecca as a way to help transport pilgrims.
Military relations.
While official diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and China were not established until the 1990s, defense relations began beforehand in the 1980s. When the United States refused to sell Saudi Arabia long-range fuel tanks for Saudi F-15 fighters, Saudi Arabia arranged a deal with China in 1988 to obtain between fifty and sixty nuclear-payload-capable CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missiles. However, the missiles that China sold to Saudi Arabia ended up being widely inaccurate and unusable. One commentator asserted, "The Chinese in essence hoodwinked the Saudis into buying an antique missile system worthless without its nuclear warhead." After this interaction, there is no more documented evidence of similar transactions. However, there is speculation that Sino-Saudi strategic military cooperation has continued to grow. Experts believe that China has based more than one thousand of its military advisers at Saudi missile installations. Press reports indicate that China has offered Saudi Arabia the opportunity to purchase modern missile systems. (i.e. 373-mile range CSS-6, 1,118-mile range CSS-5 solid-fueled missiles, 3,418-mile range CSS-2 intercontinental ballistic missile.) China is one of the few countries supplying this type of technology and as such is capable of demanding a cash transaction.
Scholarship and aid.
Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Saudi Arabia was the largest aid donor to China, providing close to € 40,000,000 in financial assistance, and an additional € 8,000,000 worth of relief materials. Chinese companies in Saudi Arabia have awarded scholarships to Saudi students allowing them to study abroad in China. The Chinese government is also offering scholarships directly to students and professionals for further training.
Nuclear cooperation.
On January 15, 2012, China and Saudi Arabia signed a deal signifying increased nuclear cooperation. According to Saudi Arabia, the goal is "to enhance cooperation between the two countries in the development and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes." The deal sets the stage for strengthened scientific, technological, and economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Saudi Arabia, focusing on areas such as maintenance and development of nuclear power plants and research reactors, as well as the supply of nuclear fuel components. This agreement is Saudi Arabia's fourth nuclear agreement, following such deals with France, Argentina and South Korea. The agreement was signed at the end of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's first trip to Saudi Arabia as part of a six-day tour to the Middle East.

Francis won medals at both the Youth Olympic Games in 1997 and Junior European Championships in 2000.
Coaching.
Francis has been a professional Coach since 2006. He has successfully headed programmes in South Africa and the UK and is currently coaching at Kelly College where he started work in 2009.
His desire to coach stems from the disappointment he encountered in 2002 when he was forced to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games in Manchester due to suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. Francis qualified in the 200 m Individual Medley, 400 m Individual Medley and 200 m Breastroke and was ranked in the top three for all. Unfortunately he had to witness medals being won in these events in slower times than he had previously achieved making him determined to prevent all swimmers under his guidance from being involved in a similar situation.

Bron–Kerbosch algorithm

In computer science, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm is an algorithm for finding maximal cliques in an undirected graph. That is, it lists all subsets of vertices with the two properties that each pair of vertices in one of the listed subsets is connected by an edge, and no listed subset can have any additional vertices added to it while preserving its complete connectivity. The Bron–Kerbosch algorithm was designed by Dutch scientists Joep Kerbosch and Coenraad Bron, who published a description of it in 1973. Although other algorithms for solving the clique problem have running times that are, in theory, better on inputs that have few maximal independent sets, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm and subsequent improvements to it are frequently reported as being more efficient in practice than the alternatives. It is well-known and widely used in application areas of graph algorithms such as computational chemistry.
A contemporaneous algorithm of , although presented in different terms, can be viewed as being the same as the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, as it generates the same recursive search tree.
Without pivoting.
The basic form of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm that searches for all maximal cliques in a given graph "G". More generally, given three sets "R", "P", and "X", it finds the maximal cliques that include all of the vertices in "R", some of the vertices in "P", and none of the vertices in "X". In each call to the algorithm, "P" and "X" are disjoint sets whose union consists of those vertices that form cliques when added to "R". In other words, "P" ∪ "X" is the set of vertices which are joined to every element of "R". When "P" and "X" are both empty there are no further elements that can be added to "R", so R is a maximal clique and the algorithm outputs R.
The recursion is initiated by setting "R" and "X" to be the empty set and "P" to be the vertex set of the graph. Within each recursive call, the algorithm considers the vertices in "P" in turn; if there are no such vertices, it either reports "R" as a maximal clique (if "X" is empty), or backtracks. For each vertex "v" chosen from "P", it makes a recursive call in which "v" is added to "R" and in which "P" and "X" are restricted to the neighbor set "N(v)" of "v", which finds and reports all clique extensions of "R" that contain "v". Then, it moves "v" from "P" to "X" to exclude it from consideration in future cliques and continues with the next vertex in "P".
That is, in pseudocode, the algorithm performs the following steps:
codice_1
With pivoting.
The basic form of the algorithm, described above, is inefficient in the case of graphs with many non-maximal cliques: it makes a recursive call for every clique, maximal or not. To save time and allow the algorithm to backtrack more quickly in branches of the search that contain no maximal cliques, Bron and Kerbosch introduced a variant of the algorithm involving a "pivot vertex" "u", chosen from "P" (or more generally, as later investigators realized, from "P" ⋃ "X"). Any maximal clique must include either "u" or one of its non-neighbors, for otherwise the clique could be augmented by adding "u" to it. Therefore, only "u" and its non-neighbors need to be tested as the choices for the vertex "v" that is added to "R" in each recursive call to the algorithm. In pseudocode:
codice_2
If the pivot is chosen to minimize the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm, the savings in running time compared to the non-pivoting version of the algorithm can be significant.
With vertex ordering.
An alternative method for improving the basic form of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm involves forgoing pivoting at the outermost level of recursion, and instead choosing the ordering of the recursive calls carefully in order to minimize the sizes of the sets of candidate vertices within each recursive call.
The degeneracy of a graph is the smallest number such that every subgraph of has a vertex with degree or less. Every graph has a "degeneracy ordering", an ordering of the vertices such that each vertex has or fewer neighbors that come later in the ordering; a degeneracy ordering may be found in linear time by repeatedly selecting the vertex of minimum degree among the remaining vertices. If the order of the vertices that the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm loops through is a degeneracy ordering, then the set of candidate vertices in each call (the neighbors of that are later in the ordering) will be guaranteed to have size at most . The set of excluded vertices will consist of all earlier neighbors of , and may be much larger than . In recursive calls to the algorithm below the topmost level of the recursion, the pivoting version can still be used.
In pseudocode, the algorithm performs the following steps:
codice_3
This variant of the algorithm can be proven to be efficient for graphs of small degeneracy, and experiments show that it also works well in practice for large sparse social networks and other real-world graphs.
Example.
In the example graph shown, the algorithm is initially called with "R" = Ø, "P" = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and "X" = Ø. The pivot "u" should be chosen as one of the degree-three vertices, to minimize the number of recursive calls; for instance, suppose that "u" is chosen to be vertex 2. Then there are three remaining vertices in "P" \ "N"("u"): vertices 2, 4, and 6.
The iteration of the inner loop of the algorithm for "v" = 2 makes a recursive call to the algorithm with "R" = {2}, "P" = {1,3,5}, and "X" = Ø. Within this recursive call, one of 1 or 5 will be chosen as a pivot, and there will be two second-level recursive calls, one for vertex 3 and the other for whichever vertex was not chosen as pivot. These two calls will eventually report the two cliques {1,2,5} and {2,3}. After returning from these recursive calls, vertex 2 is added to "X" and removed from "P".
The iteration of the inner loop of the algorithm for "v" = 4 makes a recursive call to the algorithm with "R" = {4}, "P" = {3,5,6}, and "X" = Ø (although vertex 2 belongs to the set "X" in the outer call to the algorithm, it is not a neighbor of "v" and is excluded from the subset of "X" passed to the recursive call). This recursive call will end up making three second-level recursive calls to the algorithm that report the three cliques {3,4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}. Then, vertex 4 is added to "X" and removed from "P".
In the third and final iteration of the inner loop of the algorithm, for "v" = 6, there is a recursive call to the algorithm with "R" = {6}, "P" = Ø, and "X" = {4}. Because this recursive call has "P" empty and "X" non-empty, it immediately backtracks without reporting any more cliques, as there can be no maximal clique that includes vertex 6 and excludes vertex 4.
The call tree for the algorithm, therefore, looks like:
The graph in the example has degeneracy two; one possible degeneracy ordering is 6,4,3,1,2,5. If the vertex-ordering version of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm is applied to the vertices, in this order, the call tree looks like
Worst-case analysis.
The Bron–Kerbosch algorithm is not an output-sensitive algorithm: unlike some other algorithms for the clique problem, it does not run in polynomial time per maximal clique generated. However, it is efficient in a worst-case sense: by a result of , any "n"-vertex graph has at most 3"n"/3 maximal cliques, and the worst-case running time of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm (with a pivot strategy that minimizes the number of recursive calls made at each step) is O(3"n"/3), matching this bound.
For sparse graphs, tighter bounds are possible. In particular the vertex-ordering version of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm can be made to run in time , where is the degeneracy of the graph, a measure of its sparseness. There exist -degenerate graphs for which the total number of maximal cliques is , so this bound is close to tight.

1976 in British music

This is a summary of 1976 in music of all genres in the United Kingdom, including the official charts from that year.
Overview.
This year saw the emergence of disco as a force to be reckoned with, a trend which would hold for the rest of the decade and peak in the last two years. This was also the year which truly established ABBA as the top selling act of the decade with them achieving their second, third and fourth number ones (as well as releasing the biggest-selling album of the year). The ABBA formula was also replicated in the biggest-selling song of the year - the Eurovision-winning "Save Your Kisses for Me" by Brotherhood of Man, who began a three-year run in the UK charts from 1976. Other acts to achieve notable firsts were Elton John, who scored his first UK number one single this year (albeit as a duet with Kiki Dee), Showaddywaddy had their first and only number one and long-standing hitmaker Johnny Mathis also scored his biggest hit this year. The album charts saw TV advertising become a major factor in changing the landscape of big sellers with non-regular singles artists achieving high sales with compilations. Among these were Slim Whitman, Bert Weedon, Glen Campbell and The Beach Boys, who remained at number one for ten consecutive weeks.
Also emerging this year was a new trend, which became known as punk rock. This was little evident on the charts as yet, and was more a lifestyle choice, but would become much more significant the following year, as many new acts who typified the trend came onto the scene.
Overall, 1976 is not considered a vintage year by music critics, with its overwhelming dominance by pop and MOR acts. Certainly, many consider 1976 to be the nadir of British music and hold the year's charts up to be the very reason why Punk and New Wave music emerged with such force the following year.
Britain's foremost classical composers of the late 20th century, including Sir William Walton, Benjamin Britten and Sir Michael Tippett, were still active. Sir Charles Groves conducted the Last Night of the Proms, and the soloist for "Rule Britannia" was contralto Anne Collins; the programme included Walton's "Portsmouth Point" overture.

Kevin Kent

Kevin Joseph Kent (born 19 March 1965) is an English former professional football winger, now working as a football coach.
Starting his career at West Bromwich Albion in 1983, he began playing regular football with Newport County the following year. He then made his name playing for Mansfield Town over a six-year period from 1985 to 1991. He then transferred to Port Vale, where he finished his career following a five-year spell. Over a thirteen-year professional career he played 455 games, scoring 53 goals (claiming 45 goals in 378 appearances in the Football League). He won the Football League Trophy both with Mansfield (1987) and Port Vale (1993), and helped the "Stags" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division (1985–86) and the "Valiants" to win promotion out of the Second Division (1993–94).
Playing career.
Kent began his career at West Bromwich Albion, and made two First Division appearances under Ron Wylie and Johnny Giles in the 1983–84 campaign. He then left The Hawthorns and signed for Newport County of the Third Division. He played 33 league games for Colin Addison's "Exiles" in 1984–85, before leaving Rodney Parade to join Mansfield Town. He helped Ian Greaves's side to win promotion out of the Fourth Division with a third-place finish in 1985–86. In 1986–87 he scored ten goals in 57 games, and wrote his name in the club's history books on 24 May 1987, when he became the first (and to date, the only) player in Mansfield's history to score at Wembley when the "Stags" won the Football League Trophy after beating Bristol City on penalties following a 1–1 draw (he also successfully converted his penalty). He scored fifteen goals in 58 games in the 1987–88 campaign. Mansfield posted a 15th place finish in 1988–89, before new boss George Foster led the club to another 15th place finish in 1989–90. They were demoted back into the basement division after a last place finish in 1990–91. In total, Kent played 276 first-team games and scored 47 goals in his six seasons at Field Mill.
In March 1991, Kent joined Port Vale in exchange for Gary Ford and £80,000. He featured in 11 Second Division games at the end of the 1990–91 season, but featured just 25 times in the 1991–92 campaign, as the "Valiants" suffered relegation with a last place finish. He played 28 Third Division (renamed the Second Division due to the creation of the Premier League) games in the 1992–93 season; he did though play 40 games in total throughout the campaign, as he helped the Vale to win the TNT Tournament, the Football League Trophy, and to reach the play-off final. They beat Stockport County in the Football League Trophy Final, but lost 3–0 to West Bromwich Albion in the play-off final. Manager John Rudge ensured his side made up for their failure to win the play-offs by leading them to promotion as the division's runners-up in 1993–94. However, injuries soon brought Kent's career to a halt; he fractured his hand in October 1994 and his kneecap the following February and was hospitalised in May 1995 with a back injury; this final injury brought about his early retirement at the end of the 1995–96 season. On his retirement he became a coaching assistant at Vale Park.
Coaching career.
Whilst at his final club, Port Vale, Kent began working as a coach at the club's Centre of Excellence from 1993 to 1996 and 2004 to 2006 under Mark Grew, Brian Horton and Martin Foyle. Before this he gained experience at Mansfield Town's Centre of Excellence under Ian Greaves. From 2005 to 2007 he worked at Stoke City's academy, before beginning a short coaching stint at Manchester United after obtaining his UEFA A Licence. Between 2009 and 2011 he worked as the Indonesian Football Association's National Academy Director. He also worked as a manager at Barclays Bank Sports Facilities and Events department between 1997 and 2009.

Tenacity

Tenacity is the customary measure of strength of a fiber or yarn. In the U.S. it is usually defined as the ultimate (breaking) force of the fiber (in gram-force units) divided by the denier.
Because denier is a measure of the linear density, the tenacity works out to be not a measure of force per unit area, but rather a quasi-dimensionless measure analogous to specific strength.

Khem Shahani

Khem Shahani (1923–2001) was a microbiologist who conducted pioneer research on probiotics (live microorganisms).
Career.
Khem Shahani is best known for his discovery of the DDS-1 strain of "Lactobacillus acidophilus" in 1959, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. One of his many contributions to biology in the years to come, in this landmark discovery, Shahani observed the high level of stability and nutritional viability of the DDS-1 strain. This unique feature meant that the probiotics were able to pass through the stomach acid and implant in the intestine where it could multiply over 200-fold. Shahani would later name the strain DDS-1 for the Department of Dairy Science Number One strain and spend the rest of his career unlocking its potential for improving overall health.
During his lengthy career, Shahani published over 200 articles in peer reviewed scientific journals and was a consultant for international agencies such as the World Health Organization. Among these, 80 publications were about Probiotics and Lactic Cultures.
In 1981, Shahani founded Nebraska Cultures, a probiotics manufacturing and research company. Today, Nebraska Cultures is one of the largest international probiotic supplement manufacturers and suppliers. He served as a consultant for several food and feed supplements and nutrients manufacturing and marketing companies, including Klaire Laboratories, National Enzyme Company, Nutraceutical Corporation, Kovac, TwinLab, Arise & Shine, American Biologics, Cell Tech (now Simplexity), Infinity2, Nutratec SAS, and others.
Khem Shahani died on July 6, 2001 while on a speaking tour in Sicily (Italy). In 2005, a professorship was established at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in his name, honoring his work as scientist and professor.
Academic background.
Khem Shahani earned the BS (1943, Major: Dairy and Food Technology; and Nutritional Microbiology) and the MS (1947, Major: Dairy Chemistry; Minor: Microbiology) degrees at the University of Bombay, then the Ph.D (1950, Major: Food and Dairy Science; Minor: Biochemistry) at the University of Wisconsin.
Research and teaching.
Khem Shahani taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1950–1952 and Ohio State University at Columbus from 1953-1957.
In 1957 Shahani accepted a post at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in the department of Dairy Science, later changed to the Department of Food Science and Technology in 1961. He retired from full-time teaching in 1994, but continued some teaching and research until 2000.
Shahani conducted basic research and developmental work as related to the science and technology of dairy foods - bioprocessed and cultured foods; lactic cultures, especially "Lactobacillus acidophilus", food safety, food fermentation, human and animal nutrition, food and feed supplements, bioprocessed and cultured foods, significance and role of proteins and enzymes in milk and other foods, whey utilization, water quality, vitamins, antibiotics and toxins in foods, human milk, infant foods, and biotechnology.
The professorial activity of Shahani consisted in teaching several multidisciplinary courses in Food Science and Technology, Biotechnology, Fermentation technology, for graduate students. He also supervised 16 postdoctoral fellows, 16 Ph.D. candidates, and 22 MS candidates.
Research and management.
In his lifetime, Shahani administered and supervised a large number of research projects with several graduate students and postdoctoral fellows actively engaged in biochemical and nutritional research work. Supervised three research projects. Worked with several national and international students and postdoctorals from U.S.A., Middle East, China, India, Korea, Africa, South America and Romania. Served as a member and Chairman of the Academic Planning Committee of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln pertaining to academic affairs and budget allocations.

Loughborough Public School

Loughborough Public School is part of the Limestone District School Board, and is centrally located within Sydenham, Ontario. The school is only seconds away from Sydenham High School, where graduates from Loughborough Public School will attend. The Public School teaches students from junior kindergarten all the way through to Grade eight where the students will graduate. The school holds a graduation ceremony for all graduating students at the end of both Grade eight terms. After the graduation ceremony is over the school holds a dance for the students. 
The building has quite a bit of history to it and was founded over 100 years ago as school house. The school house was rather large when Loughborough Public School (house) was created, and has since had two building expansion renovations. The most recent change to the school was in 1993 when the front entrance was reconstructed, a new library was built, improved design to upper level facility office space and an addition to classrooms. The renovation meant Loughborough Public School would no longer have to use the three portables along the side of the school. The portables have since been torn down and additional recess activity areas are now in their place.
The School has received a few awards over the years. Queen's University gave Loughborough Public School the Associate School of the Year Award in 2002–2003. Over 150 schools participate in the Associate School partnership practicum program involving the Faculty of Education, Teacher Candidates, faculty and staff. 
“To recognize this contribution, the Faculty of Education presents one Elementary School and one Secondary School with the "Associate School of the Year" award” Loughborough Public School is also the creator of the annual one-day Girls Active Living and Sport (G.A.L.S.) conference. G.A.L.S. caught Opera’s attention and she runs a contest where awards are given out to the best leaders setting a healthy example.

Kalki Koechlin

Kalki Koechlin (French: ) (born 10 January 1984) is an Indian film actress of French descent who debuted in Anurag Kashyap's critically acclaimed Hindi film "Dev.D" (2009). She played the character of Chandramukhi in the film, a modern take on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's Bengali novella "Devdas", and eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.
Koechlin subsequently featured in the comedy-dramas "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" (2011) and "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani" (2013), both of which were commercially successful, and earned her two more nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also worked as a co-screenwriter with then husband Anurag Kashyap.
Early life.
Her father Joel Koechlin came to India from France, 60 years ago and met Kalki Koechlin's mother, Francoise Armandie, at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Auroville, Puducherry. Her parents are devotees of Sri Aurobindo. Eventually they settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, where he established a business designing hang-gliders and microlight aircraft, and Kalki was born here. Her ancestor Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer, played an important role in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower.
Koechlin studied at Hebron School, Ooty and her parents then insisted she attend university. Koechlin studied drama and theatre in Goldsmiths, University of London, where she also worked with a theatre company called Theatre of Relativity for two years. She performed in various plays like David Hare’s "The Blue Room", Marivaux’s "The Dispute" and a devised play "The Rise of the Wild Hunt" in her two-year stint with the theatre group.
Film career.
Koechlin later decided to move to Mumbai to try her luck in Hindi cinema. She was doing modeling assignments for television commercials after being shortlisted for the role of Chandramukhi (Chanda) in "Dev.D". She was one of the people to be auditioned for the role of the prostitute. Koechlin can speak Tamil, English and French; she had to learn Hindi to prepare for her role in "Dev.D". About her role Koechlin said, "My character is much younger and there's much more to it than just being a prostitute. When she is not entertaining customers, she dresses up like any other girl in jeans and stuff and leads a normal life. My role in the film has a controversial streak to it, but I still don't know what would have been an ideal role to debut with. I've got the chance to work with a good director in Dev D and I feel I'm lucky enough." Koechlin was apprehensive about how people will judge her after seeing her in the role. She co-founded Quaff Theatre, a theatre group in 2008.
Upon release, her portrayal of the modern Chandramukhi, who goes from an innocent schoolgirl (Leni) to a vivacious prostitute (Chanda) was critically acclaimed saying "Kalki shows sparks in the scenes". "Hindustan Times" said, "Enter Chanda, the multilingual call girl who can seduce in Hindi, Tamil, English and French. With her bee-stung lips, unusual face and refreshing lack of acting guile, Kalki Koechlin imbues the part with a touching fragility." For her work in "Dev D", she was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2010. Koechlin paired with the actor Imran Khan for a Coca Cola advertisement. The advert was voted the best of the IPL by the TOI Advertisement awards.
In 2011, she was seen in "Shaitan". Film critic Komal Nahta commented, "Kalki Koechlin performs with admirable ease". She then starred in Zoya Akhtar's "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" alongside Abhay Deol, Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar and Katrina Kaif; film critic Taran Adarsh commented, "Kalki plays a Mumbai girl belonging to the upper crest and though it's not a typical 'heroine' role, Kalki infuses life into the character, fitting into the conceived character accurately". Komal Nahta wrote, "Kalki Koechlin does very well in a difficult role she stands her own amongst the other actors". Box office India declared the film a "super hit".
She co-wrote and also starred in Anurag Kashyap's "That Girl in Yellow Boots" film critics Komal Nahta commented, "Kalki Koechlin delivers a nuanced performance as the tumultuous Ruth. She uses her eyes and body language to the hilt to express varying emotions". Taran Adarsh wrote, "THAT GIRL IN YELLOW BOOTS is embellished with top notch performances, with Kalki scoring brownie points for her super performance in the film. Playing a stylish, sensible, sharp-witted British girl supporting herself by working illegally in a massage parlor, Kalki has the right look for her part, but it does take a lot of guts to portray this intricate role. She has an inimitable talent and onscreen presence by means of which she single-handedly carries the film with her gut wrenching raw performance". Kalki has also helped her husband Anurag Kashyap to write the 2011 film "That Girl in Yellow Boots". Koechlin will be seen in Ram Gopal Varma's "Happy Journey".
In September 2013, she was featured in a Video called It's Your Fault for Anti-Rape Campaign along with VJ Juhi Pandey. The Video went viral on Internet with over 150,000 views in just 2 days.
Personal life.
She married filmmaker Anurag Kashyap on April 30, 2011 in a private wedding ceremony in Ooty. The two had been dating since the release of "Dev.D". Koechlin was unemployed for a year and a half after Dev.D. Koechlin was cast in her husband's next films That Girl in Yellow Boots, both produced and directed by Kashyap and Shaitan which was produced by Kashyap but directed by Bejoy Nambiar. On November 13, 2013 both Koechlin and Kashyap issued a joint statement saying they were separating.

James Buchanan High School

James Buchanan High School is ia a small, rural public high school. The School is located in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and is part of the Tuscarora School District. The school was named after the 15th president of the United States, James Buchanan. There were 816 students enrolled in 2009. In 2011, 215 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. The school is not a federally designated Title I school. James Buchanan Senior High School employed 53 teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 14:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 1 teachers were rated "Non‐Highly Qualified" under No Child Left Behind. 
Graduation rate.
In 2012, Tuscarora School District's graduation rate was 87%. In 2011, the District's graduation rate was 81%. In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. Tuscarora School District's rate was 81% for 2010.
Academics.
In 2012, James Buchanan Senior High School achieved AYP status, even though math and reading scores remained low. In 2011, James Buchanan Senior High School is in "Making Progress: in School Improvement II" status due to lagging student achievement. In 2010, the high school was in '"School Improvement II" due to chronically low student achievement.
Science in Motion James Buchanan Senior High School did not take advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.Gettysburg College provides the experiences to schools in the region.
College Remediation.
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 11% of Tuscarora School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
Dual enrollment.
James Buchanan Senior High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school, including the graduation ceremony. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. 
For the 2009-10 funding year, the Tuscarora School District received a state grant of $7,968 for the program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.
Graduation requirements.
The Tuscarora School Board has determined that, in order to graduate, a student must earn 23.5 credits, including: 4 Credits of English; 3 Credits of Math; 3.5 Credits of Social Science; 3 Credits of Science; 2 Credits of Physical Education; Tech Exploration 0.5 credits;; 0.5 Credit Units of Driver’s Education; 0.5 Credits Of Family Economics and Development.
By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.
By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. For the class of 2019, a composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements. In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP.
SAT scores.
In 2012, 81 Tuscarora School District students took the SAT exams. The District's Verbal Average Score was 484. The Math average score was 499. The Writing average score was 468. The statewide Verbal SAT exams results were: Verbal 491, Math 501, Writing 480. In the USA, 1.65 million students took the exams achieving scores: Verbal 496, Math 514, Writing 488. According to the College Board the maximum score on each section was 800, and 360 students nationwide scored a perfect 2,400.
In 2011, 86 Tuscarora School District students took the SAT exams. The District's Verbal Average Score was 472. The Math average score was 485. The Writing average score was 454. Pennsylvania ranked 40th among states with SAT scores: Verbal - 493, Math - 501, Writing - 479. In the United States, 1.65 million students took the exam in 2011. They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing.
Summer program.
James Buchanan Senior High School offers a Summer Credit Recovery Program for students. The 4 week program offers both online instruction and face to face assistance for struggling students. James Buchanan Senior High School's credit recovery program is only available to students who have attended school regularly and who have failed to pass a required course
Classrooms for the Future grant.
The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Tuscarora School District Administration did not apply for funding in any of the three years of the program. The highest award in Franklin County was given to Greencastle-Antrim School District which received $165,458. The highest funding state wide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget.
Education Assistance Program.
The EAP initiative provides extended learning opportunities and is designed to boost student achievement and help all students succeed by utilizing evidenced-based instructional models. The funding provides tutoring in Math and Reading for students in grades 7-12. Tutoring is provided during the school day, during study halls and after school. In 2010-11, the Tuscarora School District received $61,355.
Tuition.
Students who live in the Tuscarora School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Tuscarora School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates for James Buchanan Senior High School were $10,000.17.
Extracurriculars.
Tuscarora School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania interscholastic Athletics Association (PIAA). The District also operates a costly indoor pool system with staffing and a weight room, which is open to students some weekday evenings. The District engaged in a capital campaign to raise over $1.9 million for sports facilities.
By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Rock Bottom (Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran song)

"Rock Bottom" was the British entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, performed in English by Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran. It was also written by de Paul and Moran.
The song says that when people are in a bad situation they should work to solve problems and not be pessimistic about tragedies. Apparently it represents the situation at the time; Eurovision 1977 was almost canceled due to budget restrictions. The BBC, who had to host the contest that year, did not give the song its whole-hearted support.
The song was performed ninth on the night, following Portugal's Os Amigos with "Portugal no coração" and preceding Greece's Pascalis, Marianna, Robert & Bessy with "Mathima Solfege". At the close of voting, it had received 121 points, placing second in a field of 18.
It was succeeded as British representative at the 1978 Contest by Co-Co with "The Bad Old Days".
It charted in several European countries, topping the charts in Switzerland, #2 in Austria, #4 in Germany, #6 in Sweden, #7 in Ireland and Norway and #10 in France. In the UK, it reached #19. On the basis of sales from the record-buying public of Europe, it was the winning entry, outperforming the contest's winner. 
The duo also recorded a German version of "Rock Bottom" called "Für Immer" and this was covered by the band Wir. Instrumental versions of the song also appeared on James Last's album "Auf Last Geht's Los". Other versions have been recorded by the Studio Group, Armi & Danny, Jörgen Petersenin Orkesteri, Ted Weber, Brothers Of The World, Leni, Günter Noris, Daniel Janin and The Hiltonaires.

<doc id="21481035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21481035" title="Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque">
Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque

The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque () is a mosque in Homs, Syria, located in a park along Hama Street in ash-Shuhada Square. Noted for its Ottoman-Turkish architectural style, the mosque is dedicated to Khalid ibn al-Walid, an Arab military commander who led the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century following the decisive Battle of Yarmouk, which put an end to Byzantine rule in Syria. His dome-topped mausoleum is located in a corner of the prayer hall and has served as a pilgrimage center. Two tall minarets with narrow galleries constructed of alternating horizontal rows of white and black stone are situated at the building's northwestern and northeastern comers and reflect the traditional Islamic architecture style of the Levant.
Geography.
The mosque is located in the Khaldiya district of Homs, the third largest city in Syria. It is situated in a park alongside Hama Street about north of Shoukri al-Quwatli Street, southwest of the National Hospital, and from the "souk" at ash-Shouhada Square.
Mamluk ablaq-style stonework is used in the courtyard. The old cemetery, which at one time surrounded the mosque, was moved and in its place a large garden has been created.
History.
A small mosque was supposedly built adjacent to the mausoleum of Khalid ibn al-Walid in the 7th century. The current interior shrine that contains Khalid's tomb dates to the 11th century, and is considered to be a "significant pilgrimage center."
Several sources state that the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque was originally built around Khalid's mausoleum during the reign of Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baybars in 1265. The building was later restored during the reign of Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Khalil in 1291. According to local tradition, when Tamerlane invaded Syria in the early 15th century, he spared Homs from destruction because it contained the mosque and the mausoleum of Khalid ibn al-Walid, whom he held in great regard in light of Ibn al-Walid's role as a companion of Islamic prophet Muhammad and a commander of the Muslim Arab army that conquered the city of Damascus and Byzantine Syria.
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, during Ottoman rule, the Dandan family, the most prominent clan of the Arab Bani Khalid tribe, held a stake in the extended revenue shares of the mausoleum and the mosque. The Bani Khalid claimed descent from Ibn al-Walid and the accompanying tribes that participated in the conquest of Syria under his command. However, their claim of ancestry had been previously refuted by the Mamluk-era historian al-Qalqashandi.
The present-day mosque was built in the early 20th century, although some sources claim it dates to the late 19th century. Nazim Hussein Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria between 1895 and 1909, during the reign of Sultan Abd al-Hamid II, ordered the demolition of the Mamluk-era mosque for renovation. The renovation was completed in 1912, after Hussein Pasha's term as governor ended. Thus, the current Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque is of relatively recent construction and is noted for its Ottoman architectural style. According to historian David Nicolle, the mosque's construction by the Ottoman government was an attempt to maintain the allegiance of the increasingly restive Arab inhabitants of Syria. In later years Khalid was adopted as a hero and symbol of Arab nationalism.
Modern era.
As of 2007, activities in the mosque were organized by shaykhs Haytham al-Sa'id and Ahmad Mithqan. Stamps depicting the mosque have been issued in several denominations.
The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque has been a symbol of anti-government rebels during the Syrian civil war. According to "The New York Times", Syrian security forces killed 10 protesters participating in a funeral procession as they were leaving the mosque on 18 July 2011. The mosque, which the Syrian government stated had been turned by the rebels into an "arms and ammunition depot", was abandoned by the rebels on 27 July 2013. Shelling by government forces damaged Khalid's tomb inside the mosque. Following its capture by the Syrian Army, state media showed heavy damage inside the mosque, including some parts of it being burned, and the door to the tomb destroyed.
Architecture.
The mosque is Ottoman in style: it contains a large courtyard, and the "walls are decorated in alternating bands of black and white stone", "i.e.", Ablaq. It is distinguished by its two tall, white stone minarets, which have narrow galleries constructed of white and black stone, laid in alternate horizontal rows. Situated at the building's northwestern and northeastern comers, they reflect a traditional Islamic architecture style of the Levant. The minarets and the window frames are made of white limestone. The building's metal central dome is silver in color and reflects sunlight. It is supported by four massive columns, built in Mamluk ablaq style. In addition to the large central dome, there are nine smaller domes.
A large prayer hall forms much of the interior. The walls are made of basalt stone, a building material which is widely available in Homs. The mausoleum of Khalid ibn al-Walid is in one corner. Khalid's tomb contains an ornate dome and interiors that depict over 50 victorious battles that he commanded. The body of Khalid ibn al-Walid was stored in a wooden sarcophagus carved with Kufic inscriptions and quoting the Quran. During renovation, the sarcophagus was moved to the National Museum in Damascus.

Robert Gurney

Robert Gurney (31 July 1879 – 5 March 1950) was a British zoologist from the Gurney family, most famous for his monographs on "British Freshwater Copepoda" (1931–1933) and the "Larvae of Decapod Crustacea" (1942). He was not affiliated with any institution, but worked at home, initially in Norfolk, and later near Oxford. He travelled to North Africa and Bermuda, and received material from other foreign expeditions, including the "Terra Nova" Expedition (1910–1913) and the "Discovery Investigations" of the 1920s and 1930s.
Biography.
Robert Gurney was born in 1879 as the fourth son of John Gurney and Isabel Charlotte Gurney (later Baroness Talbot de Malahide) of Sprowston Hall, Norfolk. He went to school at Eton College, and went on to study at New College, Oxford, graduating with first class honours in 1902. He was never associated with any institution, but worked from his home, initially near Stalham, Norfolk, but from 1928 at Boars Hill, outside Oxford. He became a lifelong friend of Walter Garstang after the two men met while Garstang was running Easter Classes at Plymouth, which Gurney was attending as an undergraduate. Gurney went on to marry Garstang's sister, Gamzu (1878-1972). Later, Garstang's daughter married Alister Hardy, strengthening Gurney's connections with zoology.
Robert and Gamzu had one child, Oliver Gurney (1911-2001), who became a leading Assyriologist and Hittitologist.
Scientific work.
Gurney's first scientific work was a paper on metamorphosis in the crab "Corystes cassivelaunus", which he published in 1902 while still an undergraduate at the University of Oxford. Two more papers on decapods appeared in 1903, and 1904 saw his first paper on freshwater copepods. Realising the need for a specialist field station for freshwater biology to match the marine biological stations at Plymouth (Marine Biological Association) and Naples (""), Robert and his brother Eustace (later Lord Mayor of Norwich) set up Great Britain's first freshwater laboratory at Sutton Broad. This station did not survive the First World War, but Gurney was later among the founders of the Freshwater Biological Association, which set up the field station at Far Sawrey on Windermere.
Gurney's two great study objects were the Copepoda and the larvae of Decapoda, and his greatest works were the three-volume monograph "British Freshwater Copepoda", published by the Ray Society in 1931–1933, and his "Larvae of Decapod Crustacea" published by the Ray Society in 1942. Perhaps through the influence of Garstang, Gurney rejected Ernst Haeckel's biogenetic law (that "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"), preferring Garstang's concept of paedomorphosis as an explanation for the similarities between copepods and decapod larvae. Gurney was, however, very tentative in his speculations.
Expeditions.
Gurney took part in several expeditions, including one to North Africa in 1906, and the Cambridge University Suez Expedition in 1924. He also worked on material collected by other expeditions, including the "Terra Nova" Expedition (1910–1913), the "Discovery Investigations" (1920s and 1930s) and the Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928–1929. Gurney returned to the Red Sea, visiting the marine laboratory at Hurghada in 1936, and visited Bermuda twice: once with Walter Garstang in 1935, and once with both Garstang and Marie V. Lebour in 1938.
Honours.
A number of organisms are named in honour of Robert Gurney:

Pitch drop-back

Pitch drop-back is the phenomena by which an aircraft which is perturbed in flight path angle from its trim position by a step input exhibits an output which is indicative of a second order system.
A pilot who actuates an elevator input may find that the aircraft then "droops" or "drops back" to a position further toward the start position. The phenomenon is particularly marked in tilt-rotor aircraft. Pitch drop-back may be controlled using a Stability Augmentation System or Stability Control and Augmentation System.

Ontario Power Generation's Deep Geologic Repository

Ontario Power Generation's (OPG) Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) is OPG's proposed repository for the safe storage of low and intermediate level nuclear waste. The DGR would be located adjacent to OPG's Western Waste Management Facility (WWMF) at the Bruce nuclear site, in Kincardine, Ontario.
The deep geologic repository would store about 200,000 cubic metres of low and intermediate level waste from OPG-owned or operated nuclear generating stations in Ontario. This includes the Bruce, Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating stations. Used fuel would not be stored in the DGR. Much of the waste that would be placed in the DGR is already safely stored at the WWMF in engineered storage structures.
Low level waste consists of materials such as mop heads, rags, paper towels and protective clothing used in nuclear stations during routine operation and maintenance. Intermediate level waste consists primarily of ion-exchange resins and filters used to purify reactor water systems, and used reactor components such as pressure tubes.
The proposed DGR would be located 680 metres or 2,230 feet below ground, in sedimentary shale and limestone rock formations that have remained stable for more than 450 million years. The DGR site is located more than one kilometre from any part of Lake Huron.
OPG is the project proponent. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) is the "consultant" to OPG. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency manages the federal environmental assessment review process, and is co-manager of the Joint Review Panel evaluating OPG's proposal. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is the federal regulator of nuclear facilities, and is responsible for licensing and overseeing nuclear projects, including the proposed underground repository.

Robert Crosse

Robert Crosse (1606–1683) was an English puritan theologian.
Life.
He was son of William Crosse of Dunster, Somerset. He entered Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1621, obtained a fellowship in 1627, graduated in arts, and in 1637 proceeded B.D. Siding with the presbyterians on the outbreak of the First English Civil War, he was nominated in 1643 one of the Westminster Assembly, and took the Solemn League and Covenant.
In 1648, submitting to the parliamentarian visitors, he was appointed by the committee for the reformation of the University of Oxford to succeed Dr. Robert Sanderson as Regius Professor of Divinity. He declined the post, however, and soon afterwards was instituted as vicar of Chew Magna in Somerset. At the Restoration he conformed, and as there was nobody to claim his living, he retained it till his death on 12 December 1683. Anthony à Wood says he was a noted philosopher and theologian, an able preacher, and well versed in the Church Fathers and scholastic philosophers.
He had a controversy with Joseph Glanvill, on the subject of Aristotelian philosophy. This became sharp when Crosse accused Glanvill, and the Royal Society of which he was a Fellow, of being "downright atheists", based on their experimental philosophy. Crosse then passed the baton to Henry Stubbe, who became a very persistent critic of the Society. A book which Crosse wrote against Glanvill was rejected by the licensers, but Glanvill, having obtained the contents of it, sent it in a letter to Dr. Nathaniel Ingelo, who had a hundred copies of it privately printed under the title of the "Chew Gazette". Afterwards Crosse wrote ballads against Glanvill with the object of ridiculing him and the Royal Society.
Works.
He was the author of "Logon alogia, seu Exercitatio Theologica de Insipientia Rationis humanae, Gratia Christi destitutae, in Rebus Fidei; in 1 Cor. ii. 14," Oxford, 1656, 4to.

China–Fiji relations

The Republic of the Fiji Islands was the first Pacific Island country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, in 1975. China established an embassy in Fiji in 1976, and Fiji opened its embassy in China in 2001. Fiji's current ambassador to China is Commodore Esala Teleni, who in late 2010 replaced "long serving diplomat" Sir James Ah Koy. China's ambassador to Fiji is Huang Yong.
Sino-Fijian diplomatic and economic relations significantly increased in the first decade of the 21st century. In May 2009, Fiji's interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama described Fiji's relationship with China as "wonderful", while Vice-President of Fiji Ratu Epeli Nailatikau described the country's "relationship with the government and the people of the People's Republic of China as one of its most important".
Context.
Oceania is, to the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), a stage for continuous diplomatic competition. Eight states in Oceania recognise the PRC, and six recognise the ROC. These numbers fluctuate as Pacific Island nations re-evaluate their foreign policies, and occasionally shift diplomatic recognition between Beijing and Taipei. In keeping with the "One China Policy", it is not possible for any country to maintain official diplomatic relations with "both Chinas", and this "either/or" factor has resulted in the PRC and the ROC actively courting diplomatic favours from small Pacific nations. In 2003, the People's Republic of China announced it intended to enhance its diplomatic ties with the Pacific Islands Forum, and increase the economic aid package it provided to that organisation. At the same time, PRC delegate Zhou Whenzhong added: "PIF should refrain from any exchanges of an official nature or dialogue partnership of any form with Taiwan". In 2006, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the PRC would increase its economic cooperation with Pacific Island States. The PRC would provide more economic aid, abolish tariffs for exports from the Pacific's least developed countries, annul the debt of those countries, distribute free anti-malaria medicines, and provide training for two thousand Pacific Islander government officials and technical staff. Also in 2006, Wen became the first Chinese premier to visit the Pacific islands, which the "Taipei Times" described as "a longtime diplomatic battleground for China and Taiwan". Similarly, according to Ron Crocombe, Professor of Pacific Studies at the University of the South Pacific, "There have been more Pacific Islands minister visits to China than to any other country".
Scope.
Economic relations.
When relations were first established, Fiji had no exports to China, and the volume of Chinese exports to Fiji amounted to just €1.6 million. In 2002, Chinese exports –consisting mainly in textiles, light industrial products and mechanical and electrical products– amounted to €21 million, while its imports from Fiji –mainly raw sugar, saw log and synthetics– amounted to €0.97 million.
The two countries signed an agreement on trade cooperation in 1997, and an agreement on economic and technical cooperation in 2001.
Culture and education.
A small number of Fiji students study in China, some with a scholarship provided by the Chinese government.
Fiji has also welcomed cultural performances from China – including a number of “martial art and acrobatic troupes”. Since 2001, Fiji Television relays programmes from China Central Television.
Top level visits.
The countries’ leaders have visited one another regularly. Not counting stopover visits, top ranking Chinese government visitors to Fiji have included Vice Premier Chen Muhua in 1979, Hu Yaobang (General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party) in 1985, Premier Li Peng in 1992, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in 1996, Chi Haotian (Vice Chairman of the Central Military Committee) in 1998, and Wu Yi (Minister of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade) in 1998.
Top ranking Fiji government leaders to China have included Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara in 1979, 1985, 1988 and 1990, Governor-General Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau in 1980, Foreign Minister Filipe Bole in 1987, Commander of the Fijian Armed Forces Sitiveni Rabuka in 1990, President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau in 1991, Commander of the Fijian Armed Forces Epeli Ganilau in 1992 and 1997, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka in 1994, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Berenado Vunibobo in 1997, Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudry in 1999, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Sugar Kaliopate Tavola in 2001 and 2002, and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase in 2002.
Current relations.
Fiji's foreign policy under Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase (2000–2006) was (in the latter's own words) to "look north" - i.e., strengthen its relations with Asia in general and China in particular. Qarase stated: "We look now for new markets, where there is flexibility of entry and a readiness to meet the export needs of small, isolated island countries. This is what we would like to engage on with China as we increasingly look north for the answers to our trade and investment aspirations." 
In 2005, Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian visited Fiji, where he was greeted by government delegates with "full traditional Fijian ceremony of welcome" - although he did not meet his counterpart President Josefa Iloilovatu, nor Prime Minister Qarase. Ambassador Cai expressed China's "disappointment" at Fiji for having authorised the visit. Later that year, relations were slightly strained once more when Fiji supported Taiwan's wish to join the World Health Organization. Nonetheless, Qarase's government did not vary from its official recognition of the "One China" policy.
Following the military coup in Fiji in December 2006, the PRC distanced itself from the Western nations which condemned the overthrow of Qarase's government. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy director general Deng Hongbo stated:
The post-coup "interim government" led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama has continued Qarase's "look north" policy. In July 2007, Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry responded to the contrast between Western criticism and Chinese support for Bainimarama's government:
Later that year, a China/Fiji Trade and Economic Commission was set up to enhance economic relations between the two countries. The PRC has maintained a position of support, calling on other countries to show "understanding" for Fiji's situation. And although Fiji has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the latter's Trade Mission representative in Fiji, Victor Chin, has also called on the international community not to pressure Fiji: “I think we should give the interim government the benefit of the doubt. They committed to have an election when everything is ready. I think we should take their words for it.”
In March 2008, following unrest in Tibet, Fiji expressed its support for China's actions in dealing with rioting in Lhasa. Shortly thereafter, police in Fiji arrested seventeen people who were protesting in support of Tibet outside China's embassy in Suva. Those arrested were "mainly women who had gathered peacefully", according to a Radio New Zealand International correspondent, and included human rights activist Shamima Ali.
A May 2008 article in the "Sydney Morning Herald" stated that "China's aid to Fiji has skyrocketed since the coup in December 2006", from €650,000 to over €100,000,000. The author of the article commented: "Just as Australia and other Western donors are trying to squeeze rebel Government, China has dramatically stepped up its aid, effectively dissipating any pressure Western donors might have been generating." The author suggested that China did not wish to risk antagonising Fiji and thus unwittingly push the Bainimarama government towards seeking aid from Taiwan: "China clearly finds itself boxed into a corner. On the one hand, Western states are asking it to help isolate the new dictatorship in Fiji. On the other, China faces the risk of losing a Fiji starved of funds to its renegade province, Taiwan."
In August 2008, while on a visit to China, Commodore Bainimarama spoke of the "very close and cordial relations that our two countries share in our trade, cultural and sporting linkages", and added:
In February 2009, at a time when Fiji was facing pressure from the Pacific Islands Forum over its apparent lack of progress towards a restoration of democracy, Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Fiji and met Prime Minister Bainimarama. On that occasion, Xi stated that he wished to "further enhance exchanges and cooperation in such fields as culture, education, public health and tourism". Xinhua reported that, during Xi's visit, China and Fiji had "signed a number of cooperative deals" by which China would provide Fiji with "economic and technical assistance". China committed itself to increasing its imports from Fiji. Bainimarama, for his part, re-affirmed his country's recognition of the One China policy, and, as reported by Fiji Village, "thanked the Chinese government for fully recognizing Fiji's sovereignty and adopting a policy of non-interference in its domestic affairs".
In May, Bainimarama told Australian reporter Graham Davis that, unlike Australia and New Zealand, the Chinese authorities were "very sympathetic and understand what’s happening here, that we need to do things in our own way".
In June 2009, the Fiji Democracy and Freedom Movement, an organisation founded in Australia to campaign for the restoration of democracy in Fiji, sent a petition to the Chinese embassy in Canberra, asking China to "withdraw support for the military regime". At the same time, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked China "not to use contacts with Fiji to undermine efforts to pressure Fiji to hold elections".
In February 2010, when Fiji's human rights record was examined by the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review, and several countries highlighted what they described as human rights violations under Commodore Bainimarama's administration, the Chinese delegation intervened to "commend the Fiji government for the efforts it has made in the promotion and protection of human rights".

<doc id="21481216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21481216" title="Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath">
Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath

Sir Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath (1587–1654) of Tawstock in Devon, was an English peer who held the office of Lord Privy Seal and was a large landowner in Ireland in counties Limerick and Armagh, and in England in Devon, Somerset and elsewhere. Following his inheritance of the Earldom of Bath from his distant cousin, in 1637 he moved from his native Ireland to Tawstock Court in Devon, a county previously unknown to him where he knew few people. As the most senior resident nobleman in the county he was destined to play the leading role for the Royalist cause in Devon during the Civil War but before the outbreak of hostilities he was captured in 1642 and imprisoned by the Parliamentarians before he had organised his local forces. In the opinion of Clarendon (d. 1674) he was a man of "sour-tempered unsocial behaviour" who "had no excellent or graceful pronunciation" and "neither had or ever meant to do the king the least service".
Origins.
Henry Bourchier was born in 1587, probably in Ireland, where he lived during his childhood. He was the fifth son of Sir George Bourchier (d. 1605), an English soldier who settled in Ireland, the 3rd son of John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath (1499–1561) of Tawstock, Devon, by his 2nd wife Eleanor Manners, daughter of George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros. Henry's mother was Martha Howard (c. 1555–1598), daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. Thus his uncle was Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral.
Education.
Henry entered Trinity College Dublin, which his father had helped to found in about 1597. He received the degree of BA in 1605, was elected the 21st Fellow of the college in 1606 and received his MA in 1610. He was one of only eight in the first thirty years of the college's existence who remained a layman.
Inheritance.
Three of Henry's four elder brothers died young and the fourth one, Sir John Bourchier (d. 1614), who had been knighted on 24 March 1610/11, of the manor of Clare, County Armagh, died on 25 March 1614 having been MP for county Armagh, 1613–14. By 1614, therefore, Henry had inherited in Ireland from both his father and brother over , and then when in 1636 he became 5th Earl of Bath, on the death of his first cousin once removed Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath (d. 1636), he added the Bourchier seat of Tawstock in Devon and 36 other manors in Devon and Somerset to his name.
Career.
Henry was knighted on 9 November 1621. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council on 8 August 1641.
Civil War.
At the start of the Civil War Bourchier was Devon's leading royalist. Although not Devonshire born and bred like many of his predecessor earls, he was the most senior noble resident in the county, and thus might have been expected, as later proved false, to wield "notable power and interest" among the local population. In June 1642 Bourchier's servants moved his household from his London townhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields to Tawstock in Devon, but were ordered to travel lightly to avoid suspicion.
On 19 July 1642 King Charles I, in an unconstitutional act and without the assent of Parliament, issued a commission of array for Devonshire to Henry Bourchier and 27 other nobles and leading gentlemen. This was designed to regain royal control over the county militia which Parliament had sought to control by its own unconstitutional enactment of Militia Ordinance without Royal Assent. The commissioners were required to organise, arm and train the county forces for purposes of defence against external or internal enemies of the kingdom. Bourchier arrived in Devon from York in August 1642 and his first act in putting his commission into effect was to visit the Exeter Assizes between 9–12 August 1642. His efforts were met with politeness but without enthusiasm. On 9 August 1642 an inquest into the looming civil conflict was held at the Exeter Assizes the jury of which appealed to Bourchier as a man of ""eminency and known interest in his Majesty's favour to use his good offices toward an accommodation between his Majesty and Parliament and that war, the greatest and worst of evils, be not conceived and chosen for a means to heal our distempers rather than a parliament, the cheapest and best remedy"". The local population viewed the commission of array as an act of royal aggression against them, whilst ignoring the royalist argument that it had been resorted to as a defense to the Militia Ordinance passed unconstitutionally by Parliament without Royal Assent. The two competing and contradictory orders had brought unrest and tension to the county. On 13th August 1642, in an attempt to defeat the anti-Royalist propagandists, Bourchier published the text of his commission of array, and issued a statement to the county of Devon that he had ""undertaken nothing contrary to the lawes of this kingdom, nor prejudicial or hurtful to any that shall observe it"". He attempted further to assure the population that the commission was limited in its intentions and was not a vehicle for levying taxes, as had been rumoured. Another of the commissioners of Array, Richard Culme
of Canonsleigh Abbey, then Sheriff of Devon, attempted (in the company of his neighbour Mr Ayshford of Ayshford in Burlescombe) to read his commission to a public gathering in his local town of Cullompton, but was met with strong opposition from the community. On Bourchier's sudden appearance on the scene with a body of cavaliers, the population became greatly alarmed and started to arm and reinforce their town's defences. Bourchier's next move, resulting in humiliation, was a visit to South Molton where he intended to read his commission to a public gathering. He had attempted to soften up the mayor and corporation beforehand with a meal of venison which he had sent his cook from Tawstock to prepare, and which is shown as an expense of 19 shillings 10 d. in his surviving household accounts. On Tuesday 13 September 1642 Bourchier accompanied by a substantial group of local royalist gentry entered South Molton for the purpose of reading his commission and raising troops, but was met by an angry mob of over 1,000 persons who were ""in a great rage with the mayor and his company for giving licence that they should enter and swore that if they did attempt anything there or read their commission of array they would beat them all down and kill them (even) if they were all hanged for it"". The mob was armed with muskets, halberts, bills, clubs, pikes and poles. The event was recorded by John Cock in 1642, who stated: ""The women had filled all the steps of the cross with great stones and got up and sat on them swearing if they did come there they would brain them. One thing, which is worth the noting, a woman which is a butcher's wife, came running with her lapful of ram's horns for to throw at them"." Bourchier was thus prevented from making any recruits in South Molton and withdrew.
Arrest and imprisonment.
On 15 August 1642 Bourchier rejected a summons from the House of Lords which required his attendance at Parliament, and stated as his reason that he wished to avoid the ""interruptions and menaces and affronts by people in London and Westminster"" he had suffered in the previous session. This was taken as a declaration of his break with Parliament and on 23 August the House of Lords ordered his arrest. After a delay during which Bourchier continued to recruit for the rayal cause in Devon, at 11 pm on 28 September 1642 Bourchier was peaceably arrested at home in Tawstock Court by the parliamentarian Captain Dewett and his troop of horse. He was immediately imprisoned in the Tower of London.
Release from imprisonment.
Bourchier made appeals to many persons, including the king, for his release. His wife helped him in this regard and wrote to the queen assuring her of their loyalty. Bourchier whilst in bed one morning was searched by his gaolers and correspondence from his wife was confiscated, to which he objected that such correspondence between husband and wife was privileged and therefore exempt from examination. He was released on 4 August 1643, but on condition that he should go into exile on the Continent and not serve the king. These conditions he ignored and two days after his release he wrote to the king and set off for the royal court then at Oxford. In October 1643 he wrote to his wife in Devon to ""remember me to as many in that country as you think worth the remembering"", a sign of his disenchantment with the Parliamentarian members of the gentry of Devon, his neighbours and former friends. On 22 January 1644 in the Oxford Parliament he was appointed by the king as Lord Privy Seal, which office had previously been held 1572–73 by his maternal grandfather Lord Howard of Effingham. He held the post of Lord Privy Seal for the remainder of his life. He was appointed in 1644 Commissioner for the Defense of Oxford. In the Summer of 1644, on the approach of the Parliamentarian army from the east, Bourchier and his wife fled from Tawstock and Devon into the far west of Cornwall. For this action he was publicly criticised by certain royalists for having abandoned his post, and petitioned the king for redress to what he viewed as a slander, stating that he feared for his safety and was thus entitled to withdraw. However in another account he claimed he went to Cornwall to inspect one of poorly performing estates. In June 1645 the 15 year-old Prince Charles (the future King Charles II) visited Bourchier at Tawstock Court, which event is recorded in the surviving Tawstock household accounts. (Prince Charles had been sent for his safety from plague-stricken Bristol to Barnstaple, where he stayed at the house of Grace Beaple, from about 15 June to 8 July) Amongst the provisions purchased for the occasion were lobsters, artichokes, rasberries and masards, a cherry long grown in the locality. A cook was brought in from nearby Barnstaple and payments were made to the Prince's own cooks and musicians.
Career during Commonwealth.
During the Commonwealth he was classed as a delinquent and in December 1648 the Standing Committee of Devon, responsible for the Articles of Delinquency accused him under five main charges:
He was forced to compound for his delinquency and his surviving household accounts for both his London residence and for Tawstock Court show recurring payments in this regard. In November 1648 the sequestrator drew up a room-by-room inventory of the contents of Tawstock Court, which survives, providing a valuable insight into the arrangement of what was then the grandest house in Devon, since burnt down and rebuilt. Bourchier died in 1654 and thus did not live to witness the Restoration of the Monarchy of 1660.
Marriage.
On 13 December 1638 at the age of 50, Henry Bourchier, by now 5th Earl of Bath, married at St. Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield (the Mildmay family church), to 25 year-old Rachael Fane (1612/13–1680), the fifth daughter of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland by his wife Mary Mildmay (d. 1640), daughter and eventual sole heiress of Sir Anthony Mildmay (d. 1617), of Apethorpe Hall, Northamptonshire. The marriage was childless.
Monument to wife.
Rachel's monument exists in St Peter's Church, Tawstock, in Devon, given by the Diocese of Bath and Wells, a white marble life-size standing female figure by Balthasar Burman, a replica of the statue made in 1671/2 by his father Thomas Burman of Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury (1556–1632) situated in a niche in the Shrewsbury Tower of Second Court, the building of which she financed, in St John's College, Oxford.W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p. 489; "Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury, promised to finance a second court. Built in 1598–1602, it cost £3,600, of which the countess, owing to her misfortunes, contributed only £2,700" From: 'The colleges and halls: St. John's', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge (1959), pp. 437–450. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66654</ref> The Latin inscription is as follows:
"Rachel Comitissa Henrico digna, vix altera e sexu vel animo, vel virtute aequipollens Rebus domesticis, civilibus, sacris, ingenio plusquam virili, at materno (quo suo tempore vix maius dabatur in terris) Ecclesiae Anglicanae Filia humilis, et devota, et iniquis temporibus eiectorum Patrum mater et hie pene unica fautrix Unicum Lugendum quod in se perjisset nobile Bourchieri nomen, ni sat illa habuit virtutum vel illud immortale reddere Et liset improlis plus mille liberorum Parens, quos liberalissime educavit, dotavit, sacravit, et nobilitavit. Adhuc vivit et nunquam moritura dum his Regionibus supersunt grata pectora."("Rachel, a countess really worthy of Henry, who had scarce an equal of her sex either in spirit or in virtue. In domestic, civil and religious affairs she had a genius exceeding that of a man, and such a motherly disposition that scarce a greater then existed in the world. She was a humble and devout daughter of the Church of England and in times of persecution a mother to the ejected Fathers and in these parts almost their only protectress. This alone was worthy of our tears, that in her the noble name of Bourchier would have been extinct if she had not been endowed with virtues sufficient even to render it immortal and though she was childless yet she was parent to more than a thousand children, whom in a very genteel manner she brought up, gave portions to, consecrated and even ennobled. She still lives and never will die while any spark of gratitude remains in this country")
Death & burial.
Henry Bourchier died at Tawstock on 16 August 1654 and was buried there the next day.
Monument at Tawstock.
His widow erected in the south aisle chapel of Tawstock Church a large monument to her husband, deemed "splendid" by Pevsner, "massive and ugly" by Hoskins and "almost unequalled in singularity and absurdity" by Marland. It consists of a free standing base of black and white marble on which sit four white marble dogs supporting on their shoulders a big black square bulging sarcophogus. On each of the four corners is a black obelisk. On the sides of the base is a lengthy epitaph in Latin.
Succession.
On Lord Bath's death without progeny ("decessit sine prole") the Earldom of Bath became extinct. His Irish estates passed to his widow, and from her to her nephew Sir Henry Fane (1650–1705/6), KB, then to his son Charles Fane, 1st Viscount Fane, who, on the strength of this inheritance, was in 1718 created "Viscount Fane" and "Baron Loughguyre", both in the Peerage of Ireland, thence by descent to about1979. The lesser entailed English estate in Devon centred on Tawstock, passed elsewhere, to the Wrey family, descended from one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Bath.
On Bath's death the Irish estates passed to his widow, and from her to her nephew Sir Henry Fane, KB, (1650-1705/6), then to his son Charles, who, on the strength of this inheritance, was created "Viscount Fane" and "Baron Loughguyre", both in the peerage of Ireland, in 1718, and thence by descent to c.1979. The lesser entailed English estate in Devon, centred around Tawstock, passed elsewhere, to the Wrey family, as a result of their descent from the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Bath.
Residences.
Henry lived from 1640 at Bath House, 53/54 Lincoln's Inn Fields, his London townhouse. His Devon seat was Tawstock Court, Tawstock, North Devon. Other seats of his were: Clare Castle, near Tandragee, co. Armagh; Bourchier Castle, Lough Gur, near Bruff, Limerick, a tower house originally built by the FitzGerald family, Earls of Desmond. Bourchier Castle still stands, although Clare Castle, 'a stoney house or castle of lime', a 100 by fortified house, is today a ruin.
Estates.
The county Limerick estate (which spilled over into county Tipperary) covered (English acres) and included the manors of Lough Gur and Glenogra, "in the Barony of the Small County in County Limerick, Munster", which had been granted by letters patent or other grant of Queen Elizabeth I (E.I. 30) on 2 November 1589 to his father Sir George.
In about 1718 the estate consisted of:
"The manor of Loughguyre & Glenogre, 5 castles, 300 Messuages, 1500 cottages, 400 Tofts, 8 Mills,"
"1600 Gardens, of land, of Meadow, of Pasture, of Wood & underwood,"
" of Furze & Heath & other".
Most of the estate in Armagh, at least , lying between Tandragee and Portadown, was granted to Henry's elder brother John (died 1614) by a patent of James I (J.I.8) on 30 November 1610. Henry acquired more land in county Armagh from Sir Francis Cook on 23 July 1646. Part of the Armagh estate, Brackagh Bog, under two miles (3 km) south of Portadown, is today a Nature and Moss Reserve. Other lands in both Limerick and Armagh were sold to them or once belonged to Sir William St Leger (1586–1642) as shown by a Deep Poll, dated 17 July 1619.
In 1805 at the time of its partition between the heirs of the Charles Fane, 2nd Viscount Fane, the last viscount, namely Peter, 3rd Count de Salis and John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, the Bourchier/Fane Irish estate comprised in county Limerick (with gross annual rental value of £4,189), and in county Armagh (worth £2,671 per annum). In 1883 the de Salis part of the divided Bourchier estate in Ireland was listed in Bateman's "Great Landowners, Return of Owners of Land" (taken from the Return of Owners of Land, 1873), as consisting of , (worth £5,392 per annum), in County Armagh and , (worth £3,349 per annum), in County Limerick.
Tawstock accounts.
Todd Gray's transcription of the Bath account books reveals some of the Countess of Bath's orders:
The vicar of Shiplake the Rev. James Granger (1723–1776) in his "Biographical History of England, from Egbert the Great to the Revolution" (1769) describes the Lombart engraving of the Van Dyck portrait of "RACHAEL MIDDLESEXIAE comitissa":
"Rachel, daughter of Francis Fane, the first Earl of Westmoreland. She was first married to Henry Bourchier, Earl of Bath; secondly, to Lionel Cranfield, the third Earl of Middlesex, who succeeded his brother James in 1651. Lionel died without issue by her, 26 Oct 1674. I have seen her picture at Basilden, in Berkshire" Granger's Shiplake, "among the ancestors of the late Lord Viscount Fane. She is said to have left a very large sum to build a private chapel; but the money was never applied to the use for which it was intended. Lord Fane used to speak of her as a very good woman. Her portrait was painted by Vandyck, in the reign of Charles I. The print should have been inscribed, " Lady Rachel Fane, or Rachel Countess of Bath." Anachronisms of this kind are too common upon portraits".
Oswald Barron, writing in 1905 and 1906, described her: ""She was a great lady and a busybody, and her cloud of kinsfolk held her in fear as their patroness and suzerain...a masterful woman, she lived feared and respected by her numerous kindred whom she advanced by her interest at court"."

SM UB-47

SM "UB-47" was a Type UB II submarine or U-boat for the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. "UB-47" was sold to the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during the war. In Austro-Hungarian service the "B" was dropped from her name and she was known as SM "U-47 or U-XLVII" as a member of the Austro-Hungarian "U-43" class.
"UB-47" was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September. "UB-47" was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an deck gun. As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service, "UB-47" was broken into railcar sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and launched in June 1916, and commissioned in July. Over the next year the U-boat sank twenty ships, which included the French battleship and two Cunard Line steamers in use as troopships, and .
The German Imperial Navy was having difficulties in finding trained submarine crews and offered to sell "UB-47" and a sister boat to the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the terms were agreed to in June 1917, both boats were handed over at Pola. When commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the "B" in her designation was dropped so that she became "U-47" or "U-XLVII". She sank an additional three ships in Austro-Hungarian service through the end of the war. "U-47" was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 and broken at Bizerta that same year.
Design and construction.
The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, "U-47" could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats.
The Imperial German Navy ordered "UB-47" from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as the final boat of a series of six UB II boats (numbered from to "UB-47"), and the last UB II submarine numerically. "UB-47" was long and abeam. She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draft of when surfaced. She displaced while submerged but only on the surface.
The submarine was equipped with twin diesel engines and twin electric motors—for surfaced and submerged running, respectively—that drove twin propeller shafts. "UB-47" had a surface speed of up to and could go as fast as while underwater. The U-boat could carry up to of diesel fuel, giving her a range of 6,940 nautical miles at 5 knots (12,850 km at 9.3 km/h). Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of 45 nautical miles at 4 knots (83 km at 7.4 km/h) while submerged. "UB-47" was equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The U-boat was also armed with an 88 mm/26 (3.5 in) deck gun and an machine gun.
"UB-47" was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 4 September 1915. As one of six U-boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction, "UB-47" was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped overland to the Austro-Hungarian port of Pola. Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola, where she was launched on 17 June.
German Imperial Navy career.
SM "UB-47" was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 4 July 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang Steinbauer. "UB-47", Steinbauer's first U-boat command, was assigned to the Navy's Pola Flotilla () in which she remained throughout her German career. Although the flotilla was based in Pola, the site of the main Austro-Hungarian Navy base, boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro-Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean. German U-boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs.
On 17 August, Steinbauer and "UB-47" achieved their first success when they sank the Italian steamer south of Cape Matapan. Although Italy and Germany would not formally be at war for another ten days, German U-boats in the Mediterranean routinely attacked Italian vessels by posing as Austro-Hungarian submarines and flying the ensign of that country's navy. "Stampalia" was an ocean liner of that had formerly been in passenger service between New York and Genoa, and had been one of the first Italian merchant vessels to be armed against submarine attacks. At the time of her sinking, she was in the service of the Italian government but was not carrying any passengers; no casualties from "Stampalia" were reported in the attack.
Three weeks later, Steinbauer and "UB-47" scored a triple kill, sinking three ships on the same day. The British steamer "Butetown", en route from Malta to Mudro, was carrying coal and other cargo when she was sent down west-southwest of Cape Matapan on 8 September. "UB-47" attacked "Llangorse", another British steamer, away, sending the ship and her cargo of Canadian oats headed to Salonica to the bottom. The third ship was the Greek ship "Spetzai", headed from Cyprus to Liverpool when sunk in the same vicinity. There were no casualties from any of the three ships; the crews of "Butetown" and "Llangorse" were rescued and landed at Marseilles on 16 September.
On 4 October, Steinbauer sank the largest ship of his career when "UB-47" torpedoed the 1911 Cunard Line steamer at position , east of Malta. The long, wide "Franconia"—nicknamed the "Bath Ship" in civilian days because of the number of passenger baths and showers—was, at , the fifth largest ship sunk by a U-boat during World War I. "Franconia" had been in service as a troopship since February 1915 but was not carrying troops at the time of the attack. The hospital ship picked up 302 survivors from "Franconia"; 12 men were killed in the attack.
"UB-47"s next success came a week later, on 11 October, when the 5,002-ton British steamer "Crosshill" was sunk west of Malta with the loss of four men. A German military announcement of 20 October proclaiming Steinbauer's sinking of the ship reported that "Crosshill"s cargo included horses and Serbian grooms. The following day, "Sebek", a British ship headed to Alexandria, was torpedoed southeast of Gozo. Although the German Admiralty reported her sunk, "Sebek"s captain was able to ground his ship and prevent it from sinking. On 14 October, "UB-47" sank five small Italian sailing vessels—ranging in size from 32 to 80 tons—near Syracuse, Sicily. The next day, "UB-47" closed out the month of October with the sinking of the Greek steamer "Avis". "UB-47"s tally of sunken ships for the month of October came to 24,776 gross register tons, which accounted for nearly 20% of the total sunk by all German U-boats in the Mediterranean.
On patrol in the Aegean Sea on 27 December, Steinbauer came across the French pre-dreadnought battleship . Although screened by light cruisers and naval trawlers, Steinbauer was, nonetheless, able to sink the 11,100-ton displacement ship east of Cerigo. Two men were killed in the initial explosion and another two men died in the aftermath; "Gaulois"s normal complement was 631 men. Five days later, New Year's Day 1917, "UB-47" torpedoed and sank the Cunard Line ship —in service as a British troopship—at position , from Cape Matapan. Under the command of Captain William T. Turner, who had been in command of when that liner was sunk in May 1915, the 14,278-ton "Ivernia" was ferrying troops to Salonica when sunk by "UB-47". Because of the heavy weather at the time of "Ivernia"s sinking, 120 officers and men and 33 crewmen were killed in the attack. Like "Franconia", both "Gaulois" and "Ivernia" were among the largest ships sunk by U-boats; "Ivernia" was the 20th largest sunk. Two days after the attack on "Ivernia", "UB-47" torpedoed and damaged the British steamer , killing one person in the process. The "Huntsend" was the former North German Lloyd liner "Lützow" which had been captured by British naval forces in the Mediterranean in August 1914, and, like "UB-47", had been built by AG Weser in Bremen.
On 1 March 1917, "UB-47" torpedoed and damaged the British steamer "Euterpe" near Suda Bay, killing two men in the process. A week later, on 8 March, Steinbauer sank his last ship at the helm of "UB-47", when "Georgian" was sent to the bottom from Cape Sidero. The 1890 British ship, rated at 5,088 gross register tons, was carrying government stores; five of her crew perished in the attack.
On 1 April, "Oberleutnant zur See" Hans Hermann Wendlandt replaced Steinbauer as commanding officer of "UB-47". A week after assuming his first U-boat command, the 30-year-old Wendlandt scored his first success by sinking two Greek steamers on the same day. "Livatho" was sailing in ballast from Salonica for New York when she was sunk northwest of Crete by an explosive charge placed by "UB-47"s crew. "Nestos" was carrying a load of wheat from New York for Piraeus when shelled and sunk from Sapientza. Three days later, the British ship "Cyfarthfa" was torpedoed from Cerigotto. The master of "Cyfarthfa", which had been headed from Oran to Salonica, was taken prisoner by Wendlandt.
Wendlandt and "UB-47" sank the Greek destroyer , a of displacement, on 27 June. Although a part of the Royal Hellenic Navy, "Doxa" had been seized by the French in October 1916 and was operating as a French ship with an all-French crew when torpedoed and sunk by "UB-47" in the Straits of Messina; 29 sailors died in the attack. Three days later, Wendlandt sank two Italian sailing ships of about each while east of Sicily. Five days later, "UB-47" attacked the Japanese steamer "Shinsan Maru", from Karachi with a cargo of wheat for delivery to Italy. Wendlandt torpedoed the 1898 ship between Crete and Sicily. "Shinsan Maru" was the last ship sunk by "UB-47" in her German service.
On 21 July, "UB-47" was decommissioned at Pola and handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In her German Imperial Navy career of just over a year, "UB-47" sank twenty merchant ships totaling , damaged three ships of , and sank two warships with a combined displacement of .
Austro-Hungarian Navy service.
In November 1916, the German Imperial Navy, having a hard time finding trained submarine crews, inquired to find out if its ally Austria-Hungary was interested in purchasing some of its Mediterranean submarines. A general agreement led to protracted negotiations, which stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany. But, with all of the details worked out, the two parties agreed on the sale of "UB-47" and sister ship to Austria-Hungary in June 1917.
When handed over by the Germans on 21 July, "UB-47" was in a "worn out condition". Despite the rough condition of the boat, the U-boat was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 30 July 1917 as SM "U-47", dropping the "B" from the U-boat's former designation. "Linienschiffsleutnant" Otto Molitor was installed as the U-boat's new commander. "U-47"s first success in Austro-Hungarian service came nearly six months later when, on 12 January 1918, Molitor torpedoed the French steamer "Mica" from Saigon just short of her destination of Milos.
In early April, "Linienschiffsleutnant" Freiherr Hugo von Seyffertitz replaced Molitor as commander of "U-47", and a month later, von Seyffertitz achieved his first success as "U-47"s commander. The British steamer "Itinda", a ship built in 1900, was sunk north of Susa, Libya, with one man killed. The next victory for von Seyffertitz and "U-47" came in September. On the 20th "U-47" launched a torpedo attack against the submarine off Cattaro, sinking the French boat.
At the end of the war, "U-47" was at Cattaro. In her Austro-Hungarian Navy career, "U-47" sank two merchant ships of 6,467 gross register tons, and sank a single warship of displacement. "U-47" was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920, towed to Bizerta, and broken up there within a year.

Weihnachtsmann vom Dach

"Weihnachtsmann vom Dach" ("Santa Claus from the roof") is a Christmas song by Die Toten Hosen, released as Die Roten Rosen. It's the first single and the sixth track from the Christmas album "Wir warten auf's Christkind...".
The song is sung from the perspective of somebody, who has Santa hiding from Christmas in his house and is depressed. On a card he has written "Merry Christmas" and that he hopes everyone's happy and apologises for the escape. For the second verse, he has hanged himself. In his diary is the same message, as there was on the card.
Music video.
The music video was directed by Ralf Schmerberg.
The music video depicts a girl hanging a figurine Santa in her home, as she notices a midget in a Santa costume stealing her presents. She starts chasing him as he notices the Santa doll and is devastated. Then, a life-sized version of a similar Santa is shown hanging in a similar room as the self-made dollhouse had. He is surrounded by others like him, who then visit the girl (probably to seek revenge). The man, who tried to steal the girl's presents then saves her by somehow turning them small, like the figurine, and escaping to a tunnel on a railroad maquette as the lifesize figurine Santas search the house. The Santa-like people leave and the two hug. The next scene shows them ice-skating on the maquette with a man with a similar hat that the Santa-like people were wearing.

Oil Refineries

Oil Refineries Ltd. (ORL or BAZAN, ), is an oil refining company located in Haifa Bay, Israel. It operates the largest oil refinery in the country. ORL has a total oil refining capacity of approximately 9.8 million tons of crude oil per year with a Nelson complexity index
of 9.0.
History.
Its origins date to the British Mandate for Palestine when Consolidated Refineries Limited (CRL), a joint venture of Shell and the Anglo-American Oil Company (now Esso), started constructing the complex which sat at the end of the British-built Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline which stretched from the oil fields near Kirkuk in then British-controlled Iraq. Construction of the refinery started in 1938 and was carried out by the M. W. Kellogg Co. with assistance from Solel Boneh, and was completed in 1944. During World War II, the complex supplied refined products to British and American forces operating in the Mediterranean and North African theaters, and was bombed 21 times during the early stage of the war, though the damage it suffered was quickly repaired. Due to concerns about the Arab League Boycott, the British Government sold CRL to the State of Israel in 1958 which then changed its name to Oil Refineries Ltd. Since then the complex has undergone significant expansion and upgrades. In the past, ORL also owned the Ashdod Oil Refinery in southern Israel and therefore as a company, it held a monopoly over oil refining in the country. This changed in 2006, when the Ashdod facilities were sold to the Paz Oil Company, while at the same time ORL became a public company and its shares were listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
Oil Refineries Ltd.'s vast petrochemical plants have released significant amounts of pollution to the environment around Haifa Bay. However, starting in March 2011, after being connected to the new national natural gas distribution grid, the plants will switch to using natural gas (rather than mostly fuel oil) as their main power source, thus greatly reducing the amount of air pollution emanating from the complex. The switch to natural gas is also expected to save the company US$200 million per year in fuel and other costs.

Marshall Loeb

Marshall Loeb (born c. May 1929) is an American author, editor, commentator and columnist specializing in business matters, who spent 38 years in the Time Inc. publication network which included service as managing editor of both "Fortune" and "Money" magazines. "The New York Times" called him "one of the most visible and influential editors in the magazine industry".
Loeb grew up on the West Side of Chicago. He was awarded a degree in journalism from the University of Missouri. After graduating, he was employed as a foreign correspondent in Germany and was hired as a reporter by St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He took a position with "Time" where he worked from 1956 to 1980, writing and editing more than 130 cover articles during his time with the magazine. He was named managing editor of "Money" magazine, serving in that position from 1980 to 1986, and filled the same role at "Fortune" from 1986 to 1994. 
During his tenure at "Fortune", Loeb was credited with expanding the traditional focus on business and the economy with added graphs, charts and tables, as well as the addition of articles on topics such as executive life, and social issues connected to the world of business, such as the effectiveness of public schools and on homelessness. Loeb stepped down as managing editor of "Fortune" in May 1994 upon hitting Time Inc.'s mandatory retirement age of 65 after 38 years working for the company's network of magazines, to be replaced by Walter Kiechel III, an executive editor at the publication.
His commentaries have been syndicated in the "Your Money" column in publications nationwide and his "Your Dollars" has been broadcast on the CBS Radio Network. He is a former president of the American Society of Magazine Editors. The "Columbia Journalism Review" appointed him to serve as the publication's editor in December 1996, succeeding Suzanne Braun Levine.
"Plunging into Politics", a 1964 book coauthored with Conservative author William Safire provides a guide on getting into politics for interested amateurs, recommending that the best way to get involved is to start at the bottom by volunteering and working on political campaigns starting at the precinct level. The book emphasizes that being rich or a lawyer may help, but that both major parties in the U.S. need people who are willing, able and resourceful. His book "Marshall Loeb's Lifetime Financial Strategies" was published in January 1995 by Little, Brown and Company.
After Maryland Public Television dropped Louis Rukeyser in March 2002 as host of the "Wall $treet Week" program he had created 32 years earlier, Loeb and retired economics correspondent for CBS News Ray Brady were tapped to fill the hosting responsibilities during a three-month period while the program format was revamped.
He has two children Michael (1955) and Margret (1956) and has five grandchildren: Michael, Katie, Marc, Caroline and Jeremy Loeb. His son Michael is the co-founder of, a magazine distribution company. His wife Peggy Loeb died October 26, 2010.

Panty line

A visible panty line (VPL) is the situation when the outline of a person's underwear is visible through the clothing. The underpants may be seen as a ridge or depression in the clothes, or as a result of the clothing material being sufficiently clingy or transparent.
Origin.
The origin of the term is probably traced to barracks humor, the term "VPL" for 'visible panty line' as a mockery of overused bureaucratic initialisms, coined in an analogy with water line. "The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English" claims that the phrase was popularized by Woody Allen's 1977 comedy film "Annie Hall".

1997 Sangrampora massacre

1997 Sangrampora massacre was the killing of seven Kashmiri Pandit Hindu villagers in Sangrampora village of Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir on 21 March 1997 by alleged Islamic militants.
Background.
Since Islam had swept Kashmir about 700 years ago Hindus called Kashmiri Pandits had been an integral part of Kashmir. They speak the same language as Muslims, eat the same foods, farm the same fields and generally co-existed peacefully. In 1990 the bulk of 250,000 Kashmiri Pandits left kashmir after being selectively targeted by the militants. Most are packed in refugee camps in Jammu.
The attack.
This was the first of series of massacres which selectively targeted minorities in Jammu and Kashmir.The victims were led away and lined up. The militants shot and killed seven people. Several people were injured. The killers fled in the dark.
The aftermath.
Muslims in the area expressed deep outrage at this brutality and observed a partial strike to protest this heinous crime. The last rites of the victims were performed by residents of the village and were attended by Muslims and Sikhs from neighbouring areas as well. Bharatiya Janata Party called for the dismissal of the government of Farooq Abdullah after this massacre. After this massacre the main organisation of Kashmiri Pandits called Panun Kashmir was dissolved and reorganised. The motive of these killings which were considered ethnic cleansing was thought to be to discourage the Hindu's who had fled Kashmir from returning and getting rehabilitated by the Farooq Abdullah government.
Following the massacre Government of Jammu and Kashmir provided 2-room flats to Kashmiri pandits in a colony exclusively built for them in Sheikhpora in Budgam District. The state government also provided the survivors ration and Rs 100,000.
Police has identified Pakistani militants Abu Haris and Abu Khalid as those who carried out the Sangrampora killings. Both militants were killed in an encounter at Hewader on 24 March 1997.

Islamic Publishing House

Islamic Publishing House is a leading publisher of Islamic literature in the state of Kerala, India. It was founded in 1945 as the official publication division of Jama’at-e-Islami Hind, Kerala chapter. Its headquarters is in Kozhikode, Kerala.
History.
IPH began publishing in 1945 at a small mosque at Irimbiliyam, near Valanchery, Malappuram District.V. P. Muhammed Ali Haji (a.k.a. Haji Sahib) lead the initiative in its early stages. The office was later shifted from Irimbiliyam to Valanchery and then to Edayoor and finally to Vellimadukunnu. Abul Jalal Moulavi, T. K. Ibrahim and T. Muhammed Sahib headed IPH at various times. Sheikh Muhammed Karakunnu has been the Director of IPH since 1982 till 2008. The current Director is T. K. Farooque.
A translation of Abul A’la Mawdudi's Towards Understanding Islam (Urdu:Risal-e-Diniyat) by V. P. Muhammed Ali Haji (a.k.a. Haji Sahib), titled ‘Islam Matham’ was the first book to be published by IPH. It also marked a significant shift of Islamic publications in Kerala from the hybrid Arabi-Malayalam script to the Malayalam script. It has since sold 67000 copies.
Growth and development.
IPH is the biggest publisher of Islamic literature in the whole of South India. Apart from Calicut, it has branches at Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kannur, Malappuram and agencies at more than 20 places in Kerala and the Middle East. It has published almost 500 books so far and many of them have sold more than 50,000 copies. "Namaskaram"(Prayer) written by Abul Jalal Moulavi alone sold 1,34,000 copies. All IPH publications follow the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) standard of book identification and are numbered ISBN 817204XXXX. Many of its publications have been published as e-books and are available for download at the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Kerala website. "Lalithasaradsm", a Malayalam translation of the Qur'an, has also been published online.
In September 2008, IPH released the first electronic edition (DVD) in Malayalam of "Tafheemul Qur’an", the commentary of Quran by Abul Ala Maududi.
IPH has been a regular presence at international book fairs like the Sharjah Book Fair and the International Book Fair in Riyadh.

1985 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs, the championship of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 10, after the conclusion of the 1984–85 NHL season. The playoffs concluded on May 30 with the champion Edmonton Oilers defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 8–3 to win the Final series four games to one and win the Stanley Cup.
Playoff format.
Playoffs were organized to provide a champion for each of the NHL's four divisions. The two division champions then played off in a conference final to determine each conference's team in the Stanley Cup final. The first round of playoffs was a best-of-five series, the following three series were best-of-seven series.
Series.
Division semi-finals.
(A2) Quebec Nordiques vs. (A3) Buffalo Sabres.
"Quebec won best-of-five series 3–2."
(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (P4) New York Rangers.
"Philadelphia won best-of-five series 3–0."
(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) New York Islanders.
"New York won best-of-five series 3–2."

"Edmonton won best-of-five series 3–0."
(S2) Winnipeg Jets vs. (S3) Calgary Flames.
"Winnipeg won best-of-five series 3–1."
Division Finals.
The Philadelphia Flyers ended the New York Islanders' string of five straight seasons in the Stanley Cup Final by dispatching the club four games to one. Flyers goaltender Pelle Lindbergh registered a pair of shutouts, one in the first game and the other in the clinching fifth game, by a 1–0 score.
(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (P3) New York Islanders.
Philadelphia won series 4-1
The Quebec Nordiques and Montreal Canadiens battled in a seven-game series. Bitter rivals from the province of Quebec, the Nords shocked the Habs in 1982, only to see a fourth-place Montreal club upset Quebec a year later. In the deciding seventh game at the Montreal Forum, Peter Stastny scored the game and series winning goal, giving Quebec an improbable 3–2 overtime win and berth in the Wales Conference Finals. Quebec would not get to the conference finals again until 1996, their first year as Colorado Avalanche. They would win the Stanley Cup.
(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A2) Quebec Nordiques.
"Quebec won best-of-seven series 4–3."
The Chicago Black Hawks simply outscored the Minnesota North Stars in an offensive-minded six-game series that featured 61 total goals.
(N2) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (N4) Minnesota North Stars.
"Chicago won best-of-five seven series 4–2."
Defending Cup champion Edmonton was too much for the Winnipeg Jets, sweeping them in four straight games and doubling their goal total.
(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S2) Winnipeg Jets.
"Edmonton won best-of-seven series 4–0."
Conference Finals.
Although the Flyers held the best record in the NHL with 53 wins and 113 points, the Adams Division held a better record against the Patrick Division, so the Wales finals began in Quebec City. Philly and Quebec split the first four games, then the Flyers edged the Nordiques, 2–1, in game five. Game six in Philadelphia was a tour-de-force for the Flyers, outshooting Quebec 36–15, and winning 3–0. Flyers captain Dave Poulin's two-man disadvantage shorthanded goal early in the second period was the deciding factor in the contest. The team returned to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1980. Unfortunately, the win came at a high cost, as both 54-goal forward Tim Kerr and defenceman Brad McCrimmon would be lost for the remainder of the playoffs with injuries.
(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (A2) Quebec Nordiques.
"Philadelphia won best of seven series 4–2."
The Oilers steamrolled the Black Hawks in a six-game series which broke all sorts of records for total offense. Edmonton won the first two games at home by 11–2 and 7–3 scores, only to see Chicago strike back at home with 5–2 and 8–6 victories. However, Edmonton rebounded to blast the Hawks in the final two games, 10–5 and 8–2 to earn their third trip to the Cup Finals in as many years. Edmonton set all-time playoff marks with most goals in one series, most goals in a six-game series, and both clubs set records with most total goals in a semifinal series and most total goals in one six-game series. Oilers' Jari Kurri scored three hat tricks in the series, setting a still-standing NHL record.
(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N2) Chicago Black Hawks.
"Edmonton won best of seven series 4–2."
Final.
Edmonton would lose the first game to the Flyers but would then take the next four to win their second straight Stanley Cup. Wayne Gretzky was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' most valuable player.
(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (S1) Edmonton Oilers.
"Edmonton Oilers won best of seven series 4–1."

Royal Salute (whisky)

Royal Salute is a brand of Scotch whisky produced by Chivas Brothers (owned by Pernod Ricard), founded in 1801 in Aberdeen, Scotland. The Royal Salute brand's home is Strathisla Distillery at Keith, Moray in Speyside, Scotland. Royal Salute is a prestige Scotch whisky brand. It was launched on 2 June 1953 by Chivas Brothers in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her coronation. Named after the traditional 21-gun salute, all Royal Salute whiskies are aged for a minimum of 21 years, which allows the whisky to develop a rich and complex flavour.
Royal Salute whiskies are typically priced at between $300 and $900. The brand is sold primarily in Asia, Australia, Russia, South America and in duty-free shops. Stocks of Royal Salute are limited due to the age of whiskies. For each year of aging of Scotch whisky, about 2% of the whisky evaporates. This portion is known as the "angel's share".
Strathisla distillery.
The brand's distillery and visitor centre are at the Strathisla distillery, located in Speyside. The distillery was founded in 1786, and it is the oldest working distillery in the Highlands of Scotland. The Strathisla distillery is owned by Chivas Brothers, and Strathisla Single Malt is one of the malt whiskies used within the Royal Salute blend.
Royal Salute Marketing.
The Duke of Argyll and the polo player Facundo Pieres both hold the role of Brand Ambassador for Royal Salute.
Royal Salute is an international polo sponsor, with a calendar of tournaments that include the following:
Since 2006, Royal Salute has sponsored something called the Mark of Respect Awards in South Korea and Vietnam.
Royal Salute television, press, and outdoor advertising is managed by the TBWA agency.

<doc id="21481404" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21481404" title="Haplogroup R-M420">
Haplogroup R-M420

R-M420 (R1a) is a common Y DNA haplogroup in many parts of Eurasia. One sub-clade (branch) of R-M420, R-M17 (R1a1a), is much more common than the others in all major geographical regions. R-M17, defined by the SNP mutation M17, (and sometimes alternatively defined as R-M198), is particularly common in a large region extending from South Asia and Southern Siberia to Central Europe and Scandinavia.
The R-M420 family is defined most broadly by the SNP mutation M420, which was discovered after M17. The discovery of M420 resulted in a reorganization of the lineage in particular establishing a new paragroup (designated R-M420*) for the relatively rare lineages which are not in the R-SRY10831.2 (R1a1) branch leading to R-M17.
R-M420 and R-M17 are believed to have originated somewhere within Eurasia, most likely in the area from Central Europe to South Asia inclusive (see R-M17 for details on proposed origins).
Phylogeny.
The R-M420 family tree now has three major levels of branching, with the largest number of defined subclades within the dominant and best known branch, R1a1a (which will be found with various names; in particular, as "R1a1" in relatively recent but not the latest literature.)
Roots of R-M420.
R-M420, distinguished by several unique markers including the M420 mutation, is a subclade of Haplogroup R-M173 (previously called R1), which is defined by SNP mutation M173. Besides R-M420, R-M173 also has the subclades R-M343 (previously called R1b), defined by the M343 mutation, and the paragroup R-M173*. There is no simple consensus concerning the places in Eurasia where R-M173, R-M420 or R-M343 evolved.
R-M420 (R1a).
R-M420, defined by the mutation M420, has two branches: R-SRY1532.2, defined by the mutation SRY1532.2, which makes up the vast majority; and R-M420*, the paragroup, defined as M420 positive but SRY1532.2 negative. (In the 2002 scheme, this SRY1532.2 negative minority was one part of the relatively rare group classified as the paragroup R1*.) Mutations understood to be equivalent to M420 include M449, M511, M513, L62, and L63.( and )
Only isolated samples of the new paragroup R-M420* were found by Underhill 2009, mostly in the Middle East and Caucasus: 1/121 Omanis, 2/150 Iranians, 1/164 in the United Arab Emirates, and 3/612 in Turkey. Testing of 7224 more males in 73 other Eurasian populations showed no sign of this category.
R-SRY1532.2 (R1a1).
R-SRY1532.2 is defined by SRY1532.2, also referred to as SRY10831.2. SNP mutations understood to be always occurring with SRY1532.2 include SRY10831.2, M448, L122, M459, and M516 ( and ). This family of lineages is dominated by the R-M17 branch, which is positive for M17 and M198. The paragroup R-SRY1532.2* is positive for the SRY1532.2 marker but lacks either the M17 or M198 markers.
The R-SRY1532.2* paragroup is apparently less rare than R1* but still relatively unusual, though it has been tested in more than one survey. Underhill 2009 for example report 1/51 in Norway, 3/305 in Sweden, 1/57 Greek Macedonians, 1/150 Iranians, 2/734 Ethnic Armenians, and 1/141 Kabardians. While Sahoo 2006 reported R-SRY1532.2* for 1/15 Himachal Pradesh Rajput samples .
R-M17/M198 (R1a1a).
R-M17 makes up the vast majority of all R-M420 over its entire geographic range. It is defined by SNP mutations M17 or M198, which have always appeared together in the same men so far. SNP mutations understood to be always occurring with M17 and M198 include M417, M512, M514, M515 . 
R-M17 has many subclades of its own defined by mutations. Two important subclades appear to broadly divide the European and Asian parts of this large clade:
R-Z283 (R1a1a1b1).
This large subclade appears to encompass most of the R1a1a found in Europe .
R-Z93 (R1a1a1b2).
This large subclade appears to encompass most of the R1a1a found in Asia .
Popular science.
Bryan Sykes in his book "Blood of the Isles" gives imaginative names to the founders or "clan patriarchs" of major British Y haplogroups, much as he did for mitochondrial haplogroups in his work "The Seven Daughters of Eve". He named R1a1a in Europe the "clan" of a "patriarch" Sigurd, reflecting the theory that R1a1a in the British Isles has Norse origins.
Historic meanings of "R1a".
The historic naming system commonly used for R1a was inconsistent in different published sources, because it changed often, this requires some explanation.
In 2002, the Y chromosome consortium (YCC) proposed a new naming system for haplogroups, which has now become standard. In this system, names with the format "R1" and "R1a" are "phylogenetic" names, aimed at marking positions in a family tree. Names of SNP mutations can also be used to name clades or haplogroups. For example, as M173 is currently the defining mutation of R1, R1 is also R-M173, a "mutational" clade name. When a new branching in a tree is discovered, some phylogenetic names will change, but by definition all mutational names will remain the same.
The widely occurring haplogroup defined by mutation M17 was known by various names, such as "Eu19", as used in in the older naming systems. The 2002 YCC proposal assigned the name R1a to the haplogroup defined by mutation SRY1532.2. This included Eu19 (i.e. R-M17) as a subclade, so Eu19 was named R1a1. Note, SRY1532.2 is also known as SRY10831.2 The discovery of M420 in 2009 has caused a reassignment of these phylogenetic names.( and ) R1a is now defined by the M420 mutation: in this updated tree, the subclade defined by SRY1532.2 has moved from R1a to R1a1, and Eu19 (R-M17) from R1a1 to R1a1a.
More recent updates recorded at the ISOGG reference webpage involve branches of R-M17, including one major branch, R-M417.

Arthur Shurtleff

Arthur Asahel Shurtleff (1870–1957) was a landscape architect and urban planner. Shurtleff grew up in Boston. He graduated in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. in 1894, and from Harvard University in 1896. For eight years he worked in the Brookline, Massachusetts office of the Olmsted firm of landscape architects, and during that time helped Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. establish America's first four-year program in the field at Harvard in 1899. In his own practice that he began in 1904 he specialized in city planning work, certainly one of the earliest to do so in the United States.
His studies of the Boston area were carried out for the Boston Metropolitan Improvement Commission and the Massachusetts State Highway Commission as well as for several towns in the vicinity. It is from a longer section in the 1907 report of the Imaprovement Commission that the article below is drawn. Shurtleff also presented another abbreviated version of his longer study before the Fourth National Conference on City Planning, held in Boston in 1912. He then gave it the title "The Public Street Systems of the Cities and Towns About Boston in Relation to Private Street Schemes."
Shurtleff also prepared several campus plans, including those for Amherst and Wellesley Colleges and Brown University and for Deerfield, St. Paul's, and Groton among preparatory schools. In 1928 he became Chief Landscape Architect in the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia, serving until 1941. Later he planned the outdoor museum of Old Sturbridge Village in central Massachusetts.
Probably to avoid confusion with Flavel Shurtleff, a prominent Massachusetts city planning attorney (but adding to a modern bibliographer's dilemma), he changed his last name in 1930 to Shurcliff. Under one name or the other he wrote many articles on planning. One of these, delivered in 1908 as an illustrated lecture before the American Society of Landscape Architects, summarized many of the urban design theories of German planners then under the influence of the teachings of Camillo Sitte. From 1928 to 1932 he was a two-term president of the American Society of Landscape Architects, . He also served on the Boston Art Commission, and in 1917 became one of the 52 founding members of the American City Planning Institute.

Kirill Poluektovich Naryshkin

Kirill Poluektovich Naryshkin () (1623 – April 30, 1691) was the maternal grandfather of Peter the Great.
Naryshkin's father was an obscure nobleman, Poluekt Ivanovich Naryshkin from Tarusa. Kirill Naryshkin’s name was first mentioned in 1646, when he and Prince Nikita Ivanovich Odoyevsky were dispatched to guard the southern borders of the Muscovy against possible attacks by the Crimean Tatars. In 1654, Kirill Naryshkin participated in Alexei Mikhailovich’s military campaign against Poland and Lithuania. In 1656, he joined Prince Yuri Baryatinsky in his Orsha campaign. In 1658, Kirill Naryshkin served as head of a Streltsy unit in Smolensk. In 1660, he was sent to the Terek region as a commander to repel the attacks of the rebellious Nogais. In 1662, Kirill Naryshkin was sent to Kazan to serve as a second voyevoda of Prince M.P. Shuleshov. 
The tsar’s marriage to Naryshkin’s daughter Natalia Kirillovna in 1671 greatly affected the lives of the Naryshkins. Summoned to Moscow, Kirill Naryshkin attended the wedding of his daughter and then received numerous gifts and awards. That same year, he was conferred the title of a "dumniy dvoryanin" (3rd rank in Boyar Duma after boyars and okolnichys), only to become an okolnichy a year later (together with Artamon Matveev) on the day tsarevich Peter was born. Around the same time, Kirill Naryshkin was granted large estates and a very substantial salary. 
Again in 1671, Naryshkin (under the command of Yuri Alexeyevich Dolgorukov) participated in the pacifying of the Nizhny Novgorod region after the Razin rebellion. After his raise to the rank of a boyar on November 27, 1672, Kirill Naryshkin never really played any significant role at the royal court or in political life of the Tsardom of Russia, only occasionally overseeing Moscow during the tsar’s pilgrimages to different monasteries or trips to the surrounding countryside. Naryshkin, however, held the post of a chief magistrate at the Grand Palace Prikaz (Приказ большого дворца). 
During the reign of Feodor III of Russia, Kirill Naryshkin seems to have stopped taking part in the life of the royal court (possibly, due to the intrigues of the Miloslavskys), because we do not see him among guests at formal dinners or receptions of foreign ambassadors. He attended, however, the Sobor of 1682, convocated for the purpose of abolishing the mestnichestvo, and was among the ones who signed its final resolution (соборное деяние). During the Streltsy Uprising of 1682, Kirill Naryshkin had to suffer through several personal tragedies. His sons were killed during the rebellion and then he himself was forced by the Streltsy to take monastic vows under the name of Kiprian (Cyprian) and banished to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. 
Upon the enthronement of his grandson Peter I, Kirill Naryshkin could have returned to the royal court, but chose to remain within the monastery walls due to his venerable age. He died at the monastery on April 30, 1691. His wife – Anna Leontyevna Naryshkina – died on July 2, 1706, and was interred at Vysokopetrovsky Monastery.

China–Kiribati relations

The Republic of Kiribati and the People's Republic of China (PRC) currently have no official diplomatic relations. The government of Kiribati recognises the Republic of China, and, in accordance with the "One China" policy, Beijing does not maintain formal relations with countries that recognise the ROC. However, the PRC and Kiribati maintained diplomatic relations in the past.
Context.
Oceania is, to the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), a stage for continuous diplomatic competition. Eight states in Oceania recognise the PRC, and six recognise the ROC. These numbers fluctuate as Pacific Island nations re-evaluate their foreign policies, and occasionally shift diplomatic recognition between Beijing and Taipei. In keeping with the "One China" policy, it is not possible for any country to maintain official diplomatic relations with "both Chinas", and this "either/or" factor has resulted in the PRC and the ROC actively courting diplomatic favours from small Pacific nations. In 2003, the People's Republic of China announced it intended to enhance its diplomatic ties with the Pacific Islands Forum, and increase the economic aid package it provided to that organisation. At the same time, PRC delegate Zhou Whenzhong added: "PIF should refrain from any exchanges of an official nature or dialogue partnership of any form with Taiwan". In 2006, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the PRC would increase its economic cooperation with Pacific Island States. The PRC would provide more economic aid, abolish tariffs for exports from the Pacific's least developed countries, annul the debt of those countries, distribute free anti-malaria medicines, and provide training for two thousand Pacific Islander government officials and technical staff. Also in 2006, Wen became the first Chinese premier to visit the Pacific islands, which the "Taipei Times" described as "a longtime diplomatic battleground for China and Taiwan". Similarly, according to Ron Crocombe, Professor of Pacific Studies at the University of the South Pacific, "There have been more Pacific Islands minister visits to China than to any other country".
History and current situation.
Kiribati first established official diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1980, and maintained them for twenty-three years. In November 2003, Tarawa established diplomatic relations with Taipei, and Beijing severed its relations with the country. For the PRC, relations with Kiribati had been relatively important, since Beijing had a satellite-tracking station established there (since 1997). Therefore, for three weeks the PRC called upon I-Kiribati President Anote Tong to break off relations with Taiwan and re-affirm his support for the "One China" policy. Only after those three weeks did the PRC sever relations, thereby losing the right to maintain its satellite-tracking base in Kiribati. The Republic of China began providing economic aid to Kiribati, while Kiribati began supporting Taiwan in the United Nations.
In 2004, President Tong said he believed the PRC was still trying to exert influence over his country.

Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)

Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) is the dominant paternal lineage of Western Europe. In human genetics, Haplogroup R1b is the most frequently occurring Y-chromosome haplogroup in Western Europe and in parts of sub-Saharan Central Africa (for example around Chad and Cameroon). R1b is also present at lower frequencies throughout Eastern Europe, Western Asia, Central Asia, and parts of North Africa, South Asia, and Siberia. Due to European emigration it also reaches high frequencies in the Americas and Australia. While Western Europe is dominated by the R1b1a2 (R-M269) branch of R1b, the mostly Chadic-speaking area in Africa is dominated by the branch known as R1b1c (R-V88). These represent two very successful "twigs" on a much bigger "family tree."
Nomenclature.
"R1b", "R1b1", and so on are "phylogenetic" or family tree based names which explain the branching of the family tree of R1b. For example R1b1a and R1b1b would be branches of R1b1, descending from a common ancestor. This means that these names can change with new discoveries.
The alternative way of naming haplogroups is to refer to the SNP mutations used to define and identify them, for example "R-M343" which is equivalent to "R1b." Haplogroup R1b is in other words now identified by the presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation M343, which was discovered in 2004. From 2002 to 2005, R1b was defined by the presence of the SNP named P25.
Standardized naming as described above, both using phylogenetic or mutational systems, was first proposed in 2002 by the Y Chromosome Consortium. Prior to 2002, today's Haplogroup R1b had a number of names in differing nomenclature systems, such as Hg1 and Eu18.
After 2002, a major update of the YCC phylogenetic nomenclature was made in 2008 by Karafet et al. which took account of newer discoveries of branches which could be clearly defined by SNP mutations, including some which changed the understanding of R1b's family tree. Since 2008 it has become increasing necessary to refer to the frequently updated listing made on the ISOGG website.
Also prior to 2002, major Y DNA signatures based on markers other than SNPs were recognized. In Western Europe the STR haplotype known as the Atlantic Modal Haplotype was found to be most common by Wilson et al. Even earlier research using RFLP genotyping identified two distinct haplotypes within R-M269. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia (e.g. the Balkans, Georgia and Turkey) "haplotype 35" or "ht35" was found to be a common form of R-M269, whereas in western Europe "haplotype 15" or "ht15" dominated in frequency.
Origin and dispersal.
R1b is a sub-clade within the much larger Eurasian MNOPS "macro-haplogroup", which is one of the predominant groupings of all the rest of human male lines outside of Africa, and this whole group, along indeed with all of macro-haplogroup F, is believed to have originated in Asia.
The point of origin of R1b is thought to lie in Eurasia, most likely in Western Asia. T. Karafet et al. estimated the age of R1, the parent of R1b, as 18,500 years before present.
Early research focused upon Europe. In 2000 Ornella Semino and colleagues argued that R1b had been in Europe before the end of the Ice Age, and had spread north from an Iberian refuge after the Last Glacial Maximum. Age estimates of R1b in Europe have steadily decreased in more recent studies, at least concerning the majority of R1b, with more recent studies suggesting a Neolithic age or younger. Only Morelli et al. have recently attempted to defend a Palaeolithic origin for R1b1b2. Irrespective of STR coalescence calculations, Chikhi et al. pointed out that the timing of molecular divergences does not coincide with population splits; the TMRCA of haplogroup R1b (whether in the Palaeolithic or Neolithic) dates to its point of origin somewhere in Eurasia, and not its arrival in western Europe.[http://www.pnas.org/content/95/15/9053.full.pdf+html]
Barbara Arredi and colleagues were the first to point out that the distribution of R1b STR variance in Europe forms a cline from east to west, which is more consistent with an entry into Europe from Western Asia with the spread of farming. A 2009 paper by Chiaroni et al. added to this perspective by using R1b as an example of a wave haplogroup distribution, in this case from east to west. The proposal of a southeastern origin of R1b were supported by three detailed studies based on large datasets published in 2010. These detected that the earliest subclades of R1b are found in western Asia and the most recent in western Europe. While age estimates in these articles are all more recent than the Last Glacial Maximum, all mention the Neolithic, when farming was introduced to Europe from the Middle East as a possible candidate period. Myres et al. (August 2010), and Cruciani et al. (August 2010) both remained undecided on the exact dating of the migration or migrations responsible for this distribution, not ruling out migrations as early as the Mesolithic or as late as Hallstatt but more probably Late Neolithic.
They noted that "direct evidence from ancient DNA" may be needed to resolve these gene flows. Lee et al. (May 2012) analysed the ancient DNA of human remains from the Late Neolithic Bell Beaker site of Kromsdorf, Germany identifying two males as belonging to the Y haplogroup R1b. Analysis of ancient Y DNA from the remains of populations derived from early Neolithic settlements such as the Mediterranean Cardium and Central and North European LBK settlements have found an absence of males belonging to haplogroup R1b. At least one source now identifies haplogroup R1b with the western Indo-Europeans (Celts, Italics, and one of the three founding lines for the Germanics), with a chalcolithic or early Bronze Age arrival time.
European R1b is now known to be dominated by R-M269, and the origins of this branch are discussed further in more detail below.
Root of R1b tree.
For clarity, the identifiers below are those from both the 2010 and 2011 revisions of the ISOGG tree.
R1b (R-M343).
R1b* (that is R1b with no subsequent distinguishing SNP mutations) is extremely rare. The only population yet recorded with a definite significant proportion of R1b* are the Kurds of southeastern Kazakhstan with 13%. However, more recently, a large study of Y-chromosome variation in Iran, revealed R1b* as high as 4.3% among Persian sub-populations. In a study of Jordan it was found that no less than 20 out of all 146 men tested (13.7%), including most notably 20 out of 45 men tested from the Dead Sea area, were positive for M173 (R1) but negative for P25 and M269, mentioned above, as well as the R1a markers SRY10831.2 and M17, a study indicates that they are all R1b2-v88 [http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v19/n1/suppinfo/ejhg2010146s1.html?url=/ejhg/journal/v19/n1/abs/ejhg2010146a.html]. Hassan et al. (2008) found an equally surprising 14 out of 26 (54%) of Sudanese Fulani who were M173+ and P25-. Wood et al. report 2 Egyptian cases of R1-M173 which were negative for SRY10831 (R1a1) and P25 (R1b1), out of a sample of 1,122 males from various African countries, including 92 from Egypt. Such cases could possibly be either R1b* (R-M343*) or R1a* (R-M420*) (demonstrating the importance of checking exact mutations tested when comparing findings in this field).
It is however also possible that some of the rare examples represent a reversion of marker P25 from a positive back to a negative ancestral state.
Frequency table of R1b1 (R-P25) subclades.
An up-to-date compilation of data taking the latest information into account can be found in Cruciani et al. (2010) which can be summarised as follows. As will be discussed below however, in some parts of western and northwestern Europe, R-M269 frequencies can reach even higher levels.
R1b1 (R-P25).
R1b1*, like R1b* is rare. As mentioned above, examples are described in older articles, for example two in a sample from Turkey, but most cases, especially in Africa, are now thought to be mostly in the more recently discovered sub-clade R-V88 (see below). Most or all examples of R1b therefore fall into subclades R1b1c (R-V88) or R1b1a (R-P297). Cruciani et al. in the large 2010 study found 3 cases amongst 1173 Italians, 1 out of 328 West Asians and 1 out of 156 East Asians. Varzari found 3 cases in the Ukraine, in a study of 322 people from the Dniester-Carpathian region, who were P25 positive, but M269 negative. Cases from older studies are mainly from Africa, the Middle East or Mediterranean, and are discussed below as probable cases of R1b1a (R-V88).
R1b1a (R-P297).
R1b1a is defined by the presence of SNP marker P297. In 2008 this polymorphism was recognised to combine M73 and M269 into one R1b1a cluster. The majority of Eurasian R1b is within this clade, representing a very large modern population. Although P297 itself has not yet been much tested for, the same population has been relatively well studied in terms of other markers. Therefore the branching within this clade can be explained in relatively high detail below.
R1b1a1 (R-M73).
R1b1a1 (2011 name) is defined by the presence of SNP marker M73. It has been found at generally low frequencies throughout central Eurasia, and in Altay, but has been found with relatively high frequency among particular populations there including Hazaras in Pakistan (8/25 = 32%); and Bashkirs in Bashkortostan (62/471 = 13.2%), 44 of these being found among the 80 tested Bashkirs of the Abzelilovsky District in the Republic of Bashkortostan (55.0%). Four R-M73 men were also found in a 523-person study of Turkey, and one person in a 168-person study of Crete.
A large proportion of Kumandin Y chromosomes belong to R-M73 which is largely restricted to Central Asia but has also been found in Altaian Kazakhs and other southern Siberians.
In 2010, Myres et al. report that out of 193 R-M73 men found amongst 10,355 widespread men, "all except two Russians occurred outside Europe, either in the Caucasus, Turkey, the Circum-Uralic and North Pakistan regions."
R1b1a2 (R-M269).
R1b1a2 (2011 name) is defined by the presence of SNP marker M269. R1b1a2* or M269(xL23) is found at highest frequency in the central Balkans notably Kosovo with 7.9%, Macedonia 5.1% and Serbia 4.4%. Kosovo is notable in also having a high percentage of descendant L23* or L23(xM412) at 11.4% unlike most other areas with significant percentages of M269* and L23* except for Poland with 2.4% and 9.5% and the Bashkirs of southeast Bashkortostan with 2.4% and 32.2% respectively. Notably this Bashkir population also has a high percentage of M269 sister branch M73 at 23.4%. Five individuals out of 110 tested in the Ararat Valley, Armenia belonged to R1b1a2* and 36 to L23*, with none belonging to subclades of L23. 
European R1b is dominated by R-M269. It has been found at generally low frequencies throughout central Eurasia, but with relatively high frequency among Bashkirs of the Perm Region (84.0%). This marker is also present in China and India at frequencies of less than one percent. The table below lists in more detail the frequencies of M269 in various regions in Asia, Europe, and Africa.
The frequency is about 82% in Ireland 70% in Scotland, 68% in Spain, 60% in France (76% in Normandy), 45% in Eastern England, 50% in Germany, 50% in the Netherlands, 42% in Iceland, and 33% in Denmark. It is as high as 95% in parts of Ireland. It is also found in some areas of North Africa, where its frequency peaks at 10% in some parts of Algeria.
From 2003 to 2005 what is now R1b1a2 was designated R1b3. From 2005 to 2008 it was R1b1c. From 2008 to 2011 it was R1b1b2. 
As discussed above, in articles published around 2000 it was proposed that this clade had been in Europe before the last Ice Age, but by 2010 more recent periods such as the European Neolithic have become the focus of proposals. A range of newer estimates for R1b1b2, or at least its dominant parts in Europe, are from 4,000 to a maximum of about 10,000 years ago, and looking in more detail is seen as suggesting a migration from Western Asia via southeastern Europe. Western European R1b is dominated by R-P310.
It was also in this period between 2000 and 2010 that it became clear that especially Western European R1b is dominated by specific sub-clades of R-M269 (with some small amounts of other types found in areas such as Sardinia). Within Europe, R-M269 is dominated by R-M412, also known as R-L51, which according to Myres et al. (2010) is "virtually absent in the Near East, the Caucasus and West Asia." This Western European population is further divided between R-P312/S116 and R-U106/S21, which appear to spread from the western and eastern Rhine river basin respectively. Myres et al. note further that concerning its closest relatives, in R-L23*, that it is "instructive" that these are often more than 10% of the population in the Caucasus, Turkey, and some southeast European and circum-Uralic populations. In Western Europe it is also present but in generally much lower levels apart from "an instance of 27% in Switzerland's Upper Rhone Valley." In addition, the sub-clade distribution map, Figure 1h titled "L11(xU106,S116)", in Myres et al. shows that R-P310/L11* (or as yet undefined subclades of R-P310/L11) occurs only in frequencies greater than 10% in Central England with surrounding areas of England and Wales having lower frequencies. This R-P310/L11* is almost non-existent in the rest of Eurasia and North Africa with the exception of coastal lands fringing the western and southern Baltic (reaching 10% in Eastern Denmark and 6% in northern Poland) and in Eastern Switzerland and surrounds.
In 2009, DNA extracted from the femur bones of 6 skeletons in an early-medieval burial place in Ergolding (Bavaria, Germany) dated to around 670 AD yielded the following results: 4 were found to be haplogroup R1b with the closest matches in modern populations of Germany, Ireland and the USA while 2 were in Haplogroup G2a.
Population studies which test for M269 have become more common in recent years, while in earlier studies men in this haplogroup are only visible in the data by extrapolation of what is likely. The following gives a summary of most of the studies which specifically tested for M269, showing its distribution in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia as far as China and Nepal.
R1b1a2a1a1a (R-U106).
This subclade is defined by the presence of the SNP U106, also known as S21 and M405. It appears to represent over 25% of R1b in Europe and is most common in the Netherlands and the northern half of Belgium.
While this sub-clade of R1b is frequently discussed amongst genetic genealogists, the following table represents the peer-reviewed findings published so far in the 2007 articles of Myres et al. and Sims et al.
R1b1a2a1a2 (R-P312/S116).
Along with R-U106, R-P312 is one of the most common types of R1b1a2 (R-M269) in Europe. Also known as S116, it has been the subject of significant study concerning its sub-clades, and some of the ones recognized by the ISOGG website are summarized in the following table. Myres et al. described it distributing from the west of the Rhine basin.
Amongst these, scientific publications have given interpretation and comment on several:-
R-P312-2 (R-Z196) unites several branches of R-P312:-
R-P312-3 (R-U152) is defined by the presence of the marker U152, also called S28. Its discovery was announced in 2005 by EthnoAncestry and subsequently identified independently by Sims et al. (2007). Myres et al. report this clade "is most frequent (20-44%) in Switzerland, Italy, France and Western Poland, with additional instances exceeding 15% in some regions of England and Germany." Similarly Cruciani et al. reported frequency peaks in Northern Italy and France. Out of a sample of 135 men in Tyrol, Austria, 9 tested positive for U152/S28. Far removed from this apparent core area, Myres "et al." also mention a sub-population in north Bashkortostan where 71% of 70 men tested were in R-U152. They propose this to be the result of an isolated founder effect.
R-P312-4 (R-L21) is defined by the presence of the marker L21, also referred to as M529 and S145. Myres et al. report it is most common in England and Ireland (25-50% of the whole male population). Known sub-clades include the following:-
R1b1b (R-M335).
R1b1b is defined by the presence of SNP marker M335. This haplogroup was created by the 2008 reorganisation of nomenclature and should not be confused with R1b1b2, which was previously called R1b1c. Its position in relation to the much more populous sub-clade R1b1a is uncertain. The M335 marker was first published in 2004, when one example was discovered in Turkey, which was classified at that time as R1b4.
R1b1c (R-V88).
R1b1c (formerly R1b1a) is defined by the presence of SNP marker V88, the discovery of which was announced in 2010 by Cruciani et al. Apart from individuals in southern Europe and Western Asia, the majority of R-V88 was found in northern and central Africa:
As can be seen in the above data table, R1b1c is found in northern Cameroon in west central Africa at a very high frequency, where it is considered to be caused by a pre-Islamic movement of people from Eurasia.
Suggestive results from other studies which did not test for the full range of new markers discovered by Cruciani et al. have also been reported, which might be in R-V88.
R1b1c1 (R-M18).
R1b1c1 is a sub-clade of R-V88 which is defined by the presence of SNP marker M18.
It has been found only at low frequencies in samples from Sardinia and Lebanon.
Historical note.
The DNA tests that assisted in the identification of Czar Nicholas II of Russia found that he had haplogroup R1b.
In popular culture.
Bryan Sykes, in his book "Blood of the Isles", gives the populations associated with R1b the name of Oisín for a clan patriarch, much as he did for mitochondrial haplogroups in "The Seven Daughters of Eve".
Stephen Oppenheimer also deals with this haplogroup in his book "Origins of the British", giving the R1b clan patriarch the Basque name "Ruisko" in honour of what he thinks is the Iberian origin of R1b.

Nina Petronzio (born October 15, 1979) is an American interior and furniture designer, and actress. An ASID Industry member, she is best known for her high-end, Transitional style interior designs and Plush Home furniture line.
Childhood.
Nina was born in Victoria County, Nova Scotia to New York artists who were inspired to open an art foundry after her father, bronze sculptor Robertino Petronzio returned from his studies at the prestigious Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze in Florence, Italy.
At age eleven Nina was cast to play the female lead "Jo", in the film "Vincent & Me". Tcheky Karyo played the role of Vincent van Gogh. The film was shot in the Netherlands, France and Montreal, and her performance won her a nomination for a Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (1991). The film’s small screen release in the States by Disney was awarded an Emmy for Outstanding Children’s Special.
Nina's travels for the European release and film festival circuit of “Vincent & Me” introduced her to a sensibility of fashion, architecture and style that she had not yet been exposed to in the woods of Nova Scotia. Visiting her ancestral Italy, where her father learned sculpture, is what initially peaked Nina’s interest in interior design, home building and furniture.
Design career.
Nina founded her Melrose Avenue interior design firm and furniture line, Plush Home in West Hollywood, California, with her husband Steven Ho in 2003. Known for her celebrity and discerning clientele, Nina is well known for her high-end, transitional style interior and furniture designs, fabric selections, and custom home plans.
