Palestine Investment Fund

The Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) was established in 2003 as an independent investment company aiming to strengthen the local economy through strategic investments, while maximising long-run returns for its ultimate shareholder; the people of Palestine. It was created by a transfer of assets previously managed by the Palestinian Authority.
The PIF invests through an investment strategy focused on long-term value creation with an aim to generate high and stable returns through diversified strategic investments in partnership with international, regional and local partners. The PIF has a positive reputation across global markets as a trusted and responsible investment partner. Its assets total $800m.
According to one source, the PIF does two internal audits; one from PricewaterhouseCoopers and another by an internal audit unit. External audits are undertaken by Ernst and Young, who have independently verified that PIF’s financials are in accordance with international auditing standards. Furthermore, the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau audits the PIF’s governance and financial systems and, in addition, scores the performance of its internal auditing systems. Even further, the PIF is partners with US OPIC, UK DFID, and the World Bank’s IFC.
Under Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salaam Fayyad, the PIF was celebrated for its transparent business practices, but in recent months, it has become involved in funding more and more questionable projects.
Controversy.
In June 2012, Mohammed Rashid (also known as Khaled Salam), the former economic adviser to Yasser Arafat, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty of embezzling from the Palestine Investment Fund, the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. He was also given a $15 million fine and was ordered to repay the $34 million he embezzled.

<doc id="36727085" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36727085" title="Active redundancy">
Active redundancy

Active redundancy is a design concept that increases operational availability and that reduces operating cost by automating most critical maintenance actions.
This concept is related to condition-based maintenance and fault reporting.
History.
The initial requirement began with military combat systems during World War I. The approach used for survivability was to install thick armor plate to resist gun fire and install multiple guns.
This became unaffordable and impractical during the Cold War when aircraft and missile systems became common.
The new approach was to build distributed systems that continue to work when components are damaged. This depends upon very crude forms of artificial intelligence that perform reconfiguration by obeying specific rules. An example of this approach is the AN/UYK-43 computer.
Formal design philosophies involving active redundancy are required for critical systems where corrective labor is undesirable or impractical to correct failure during normal operation.
Commercial aircraft are required to have multiple redundant computing systems, hydraulic systems, and propulsion systems so that a single in-flight equipment failure will not cause loss of life.
A more recent outcome of this work is the Internet, which relies on a backbone of routers that provide the ability to automatically re-routre communication without human intervention when failures occur.
Satellites placed into orbit around the earth must include massive active redundancy to ensure operation will continue for a decade or longer despite failures induced by normal failure, radiation-induced failure, and thermal shock.
This strategy now dominates space systems, aircraft, and missile systems.
Principle.
Maintenance requires three actions, which usually involve down time and high priority labor costs:
Active redundancy eliminates down time and reduces manpower requirements by automating all three actions. This requires some amount of automated artificial intelligence.
"N" stands for needed equipment. The amount of excess capacity affects overall system reliability by limiting the effects of failure.
For example, if it takes two generators to power a city, then "N+1" would be three generators to allow a single failure. Similarly, "N+2" would be four generators, which would allow one generator to fail while a second generator has already failed.
Active redundancy improves operational availability as follows.
Passive components.
Active redundancy in passive components requires redundant components that share the burden when failure occurs, like in cabling and piping. 
This allows forces to be redistributed across a bridge to prevent failure if a vehicle ruptures a cable.
This allows water flow to be redistributed through pipes when a limited number of valves are shut or pumps shut down.
Active components.
Active redundancy in active components requires reconfiguration when failure occurs. Computer programming must recognize the failure and automatically reconfigure to restore operation. 
All modern computers provide the following when an existing feature is enabled via fault reporting.
Mechanical devices must reconfigure, such as transmission settings on hybrid vehicles that have redundant propulsion systems. The petroleum engine will start up when battery power fails.
Electrical power systems must perform two actions to prevent total system failure when smaller failures occur, such as when a tree falls across a power line. Power systems incorporate communication, switching, and automatic scheduling that allows these actions to be automated.
Benefits.
This is the only know strategy that can achieve high availability.
Detriments.
This maintenance philosophy requires custom development with extra components.

Fourth Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference

The Fourth Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit was a conference organised by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca on 14 and 15 August 2012. The venue of the conference was Al Safa Palace.
Background.
The summit was organised in response to the increased violence as a result of the Syrian Civil War.
Participants.
Nearly all member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation took part in the summit. However, Syria was not invited to participate in the conference. Amongst the participants were host leader king Abdullah, Turkish president Abdullah Gul, Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, Jordan's king Abdullah, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, Qatari emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, Palestine's Mahmoud Abbas, Malaysia's Najib Razak, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir, Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai, Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki, Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari and Bangladesh's Zillur Rahman.
Discussions.
Discussions centred on Syria and preventing the spread of sectarian unrest that began to be experienced in the region. The king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, proposed the establishment of a center for dialogue in order to address the secterian unrest in the region. It was reported that the center would be established in Riyadh. During the summit, Abdullah called for a dialogue among eight sects: the Sunni Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and the Shia Ja'fari, Zaidi, al-Abazi and al-Zahiri, which exist in the Gulf region, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen and Iraq.
Conclusion.
On 16 August 2012, the summit was closed with a call for more unity among Muslim countries and the need to avoid divisive tendencies. The joint decision of the summit was the suspension of Syria's membership. This move was opposed by Iran and Algeria. Both the proposal to establish a dialogue center and its planned headquarter were included in the closing statement of the summit. The closing statement also focused on the question of Palestine, stating it as the central cause of the Islamic Ummah.
Reactions.
Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign and Expatriates Minister Walid Muallem stated that the decision over the suspension of Syria's membership was a clear violation of the OIC's charter. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi argued in Mecca on 16 August 2012 that the suspension was an unjust move and that Iran did not support this decision. The U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland commented that the decision over the suspension supports the Syrians and their struggles, and increases the international isolation of the Assad regime.

Poornima Jayaram, a widow living in Ooty leads a peaceful life with her two sons. Jaishankar, a tourist who visits the place gets tempted and rapes her. In the act, Pornima dies leaving her two sons who witness the murder. The eldest son (Bhanu Chander) is raised by his maternal uncle while the younger brother (Thiagarajan) joins a blind music teacher as he has great interest in music. Years later he becomes a great singer. Meanwhile, his brother is trained effectively by his uncle learning martial arts with the intention of avenging the death of his mother as he very well remembers the culprit's face. With a turn of events leading to both sons joining together and take revenge for their mother's death forms the rest of the story.
Production.
Archana made her Tamil cinema debut through the film. The film unlike Mahendra's previous ventures was an "outright commercial picture". Mahendra later claimed that he made the film to prove to critics that he could make commercial films. Despite being a box-office success, the film did not prompt Mahendra to make more films of the same genre. A few scenes were shot at the VGP golden beach.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The album comprised six songs and was highly successful.

<doc id="36727319" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36727319" title="Spanish expedition to Formosa">
Spanish expedition to Formosa

The Spanish expedition to Formosa was a campaign mounted by the Spanish based in Manila, Philippines in 1626. It was the Spanish response to Dutch settlements being built in Formosa, now known as Taiwan. In cooperation with the Portuguese, this venture was made to attract Chinese traders and curtail the expansion of Dutch power in Asia.
Background.
The Dutch Republic was not proclaimed with great fanfare. In fact, after the departure of Leicester the States of the several provinces and the States-General conducted business as usual. To understand why, one has to look at the polemic that took place during 1587 about the question who held sovereignty. The polemic was started by the English member of the Council of State, Sir Thomas Wilkes, who published a learned Remonstrance in March 1587, in which he attacked the States of Holland because they undermined the authority of Leicester to whom, in Wilkes view, the People of the Netherlands had transferred sovereignty in the absence of the "legitimate prince" (presumably Philip). The States of Holland reacted with an equally learned treatise, drawn up by the pensionary of the city of Gouda, François Vranck on their behalf, in which it was explained that popular sovereignty in Holland (and by extension in other provinces) in the view of the States resided in the "vroedschappen" and nobility, and that it was "administered" by (not transferred to) the States, and that this had been the case from time immemorial. In other words, in this view the republic "already existed" so it did not need to be brought into being. Vranck's conclusions reflected the view of the States at that time and would form the basis of the ideology of the States-Party faction in Dutch politics, in their defense against the "monarchical" views of their hard-line Calvinist and Orangist enemies in future decades.
The coastal provinces of Holland and Zeeland had for a long time prior to Spanish rule been important hubs of the European maritime trade network. Their geographical location provided convenient access to the markets of France, Germany, England and the Baltic. The war with Spain led many financiers and traders to emigrate from Antwerp a major city in Flanders and then one of Europe's most important commercial centres, to Dutch cities, particularly Amsterdam, which became Europe's foremost centre for shipping, banking, and insurance. Efficient access to capital enabled the Dutch in the 1580s to extend their trade networks beyond northern Europe to new markets in the Mediterranean and the Levant. In the 1590s, Dutch ships began to trade with Brazil and the Dutch Gold Coast of Africa, and towards the Indian Ocean and the source of the lucrative spice trade. This brought the Dutch into direct competition with Portugal, which had dominated these trade networks for several decades, and had established colonial outposts on the coasts of Brazil, Africa and the Indian Ocean to facilitate them. The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580, after the battle of Ksar El Kebir, the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an "Iberian Union" under Philip II of Spain. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence. Thus began the several decade-long Dutch-Portuguese War.
The latter (and many contemporary foreign observers and later historians) often argued that the confederal government machinery of the Netherlands, in which the delegates to the States and States-General constantly had to refer back to their principals in the cities, "could not work" without the unifying influence of an "eminent head" (like a Regent or Governor-General, or later a stadtholder). However, the first years of the Dutch Republic proved different (as in hindsight the experience with the States-General since 1576, ably managed by Orange, had proved). Oldenbarnevelt proved to be Orange's equal in virtuosity of parliamentary management. The government he informally led proved to be quite effective, at least as long as the war lasted. In the three years after 1588 the position of the Republic improved appreciably, despite setbacks like the betrayal of Geertruidenberg to Parma by its English garrison in 1588. The change was due to both external and internal factors, that were interrelated.
In 1594, the "Compagnie van Verre" (Company of Far Lands) was founded in Amsterdam, with the aim of sending two fleets to the Spice Islands or Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and returned in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened to drive up the price of spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving them down in Europe.
As a result of the problems caused by intercompany rivalry, the Dutch East India Company (, VOC) was founded in 1602. The charter awarded to the Company by the States-General granted it sole rights, for an initial period of 21 years, to Dutch trade and navigation east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. The directors of the company, the ""Heeren XVII"" were given the legal authority to establish "fortresses and strongholds", to sign treaties, to enlist its own army and navy, and to wage defensive war. The company itself was founded as a joint stock company, similarly to its English rival that had been founded two years earlier, the English East India Company. In 1621, the Dutch West India Company was set up and given a 25-year monopoly to those parts of the world not controlled by its East India counterpart: the Atlantic, the Americas and the west coast of Africa.
As part of its campaign in Asia, the Dutch East India Company attempted to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622, but were driven off by the Ming authorities.
In 1624, the Company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on an coastal islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
David Wright, a Scottish agent of the Company who lived on the island in the 1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under Dutch control while others remained independent. The Company began to import laborers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.
Expedition.
On 5 May 1626, the first Spanish landing on Formosa, as ordered by Governor-General of the Philippines Fernándo de Silva, was at Cape San Diego, but they decided that the area was not suitable for defense. So, the Spanish continued westwards along the coast until they arrived at Keelung. A deep and well-protected harbor, including a small island in the mouth of the harbor, made it the ideal spot to build the first settlement, which they named Santisima Trinidad. Forts were built, both on the island and on the harbor itself. It was garrisoned by hundreds of Spanish and Filipino soldiers from the Philippines. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan.
Aftermath.
Fort San Domingo was built by the Spanish in 1628 at Tamsui after which the present site of the Fort was named in order to bolster the success of establishing Spanish power in Formosa. On a night in 1636, a group of local people, angered by the taxes that the Spanish governor had imposed, successfully attacked the fort and demolished it. In 1637, the Spanish rebuilt the fort using stone and raised the height of the walls to twenty feet or more. 
However, in August 1642, the Dutch returned to Jilong with four large ships, several smaller ships, and with approximately 369 Dutch soldiers. A combination of Spaniards, aboriginals, and Pampangos from the Philippines held off troops for six days, they eventually returned to Manila defeated, and gave up their flags and what little artillery remained with them. Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, governor of the Philippines, was originally to blame for the loss of the Formosa and was eventually tried in court for his actions, and was imprisoned for five years in the Philippines. Historians since Corcuera's time have chastised him for the loss of the Formosa, but other factors, such as the continuing rise of the Dutch Empire in Southeast Asia, and financial troubles within the Spanish Empire, were also contributing factors.

Saft Groupe S.A.

Saft is a company involved in the design, the development and the manufacturing of batteries used in transport, industry and defense. Headquartered in France, it has an international presence.
History.
Beginnings.
The "Société des Accumulateurs Fixes et de Traction (SAFT)" was founded in 1918, mainly by Victor Hérold, which since 1913 had been manufacturing batteries for the luggage carts that were used in railway stations and for the lighting of the locomotives from the Paris-Lyon-Marseille Company (PLM). In 1924, the company was partially listed on the Paris Bourse.
In 1928, the Compagnie Générale Electrique (Alcatel) purchased it. In 1949, it introduced a new type of alkaline battery. The company widened its range of activities and markets, including power plants, telephone systems and industries in general. It introduced a revolutionary manufacturing system for sintered plates, which had a great impact in the aeronautic field. In 1953, the US Naval Air Command requested 2000 batteries of 24 V. The contract with the US military was of US$ in dollars. In 1980, together with PSA, Saft conducted a study to evaluate the potential of using batteries to power electric cars. During the next years, the investment was focused on built a sophisticated robotic assembly line.
Global growth.
In the 1940s, Saft opened a subsidiary in the United Kingdom and, in the '70s, one in the United States. In the '80s, the company settled in Singapore and continued its expansion. It became the leading manufacturer of nickel-cadmium batteries both in the aviation sector and in the railway sector. 
In 1995 Alcatel delisted the company from the stock market and acquired a 100 percent of its shares. Later, Saft purchased Nife and Alcad, its main rivals, as well as the Czech company Ferak. In 2001 it suffered a setback and sold facilities in Korea and Mexico. The same year it acquired from Invensys plc the American company Hawker Eternacell, a leading provider of lithium batteries to the American and British armed forces. It also took control of the American company ASB and Sonnenschein Lithium.
In 2003, it purchased the German company Friemann und Wolf Batterietechnik GmbH (Friwo), and the assets of Emisa and Centra, from Exide.
Doughty Hanson Funds era.
In 2004, the private equity firm Doughty Hanson Funds purchased from Alcatel, at a cost of 900 million euros, a 100 percent stake in Saft, and listed it on the Euronext in June. 
In July 2005, Saft agreed the purchase of a 51 percent stake in AMCO Power Systems Ltd with its owner, Amalgamations Private Ltd. 
In January 2006 Saft and Johnson Controls Inc announced the launch of a joint venture named Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to develop, produce and sell advanced technology batteries for hybrid electric and electric vehicles. In February of that year, Saft purchased from Amalgamations Private its remaining stake in AMCO Power Systems, which was renamed AMCO-Saft India Ltd.
In May 2006, EADS and Saft America, through ASB, formed the new subsidiary Advanced Thermal Batteries Inc located in Cockeysville, Maryland, with the purpose of supplying the military industry.
In April 2007, Doughty Hanson sold all its stake in Saft, after an accelerated bookbuilt offering of 6.8 million shares by Goldman Sachs International at a price of 23.75 euros per share. Since then, the majority of the shares were kept on free float.
Rise and fall of the partnership with Johnson Controls.
In January 2008 Johnson Controls-Saft opened the first production facility for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in Nersac, France. In 2009, Johnson Controls-Saft started the construction of a lithium-ion production plant in Michigan, while Saft built another for itself in Florida. Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally. In May 2011, the American company request the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery. The two companies agreed the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.
Projects and present.
Saft wanted accelerate its development through acquisitions in 2012 after cashing in on the end of its joint venture with Johnson Controls and refinancing debt. In February 2013, the Boeing's difficulties with the 787 Dreamliner made Airbus to drop the use of lithium-ion batteries for its A350, which hit Saft because it had a supply contract with the aircraft manufacturer, though the company publicly denied a major impact.
In July 2013 SAFT has been awarded a $6.5 Million contract to supply High power Lithium-ion battery for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II
Saft also supplies the battery for the Exagon Furtive-eGT, a four-seat electric sports car produced by Exagon Motors. The battery is capable of withstanding 3,000 charge cycles while conserving 80% of its capacity.

He also attended the Lund University in Sweden and also Costa Rica for "Small scale organized self-help housing" in 2003. He joined BRAC University in 2005 as a lecturer of Architecture.
Design.
Kabir used a local carpenter and a bamboo worker to build a platform extending over Gulshan Lake, and connected it to the garden with a bridge. The "Platform of Hope", measures 18 by 36 feet serves as an open area where local children in the slums of Dhaka can gather to play. It is also equipped with a small library. The slum which is home to 120,000 people, is the largest slum in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Located at the city's center, it is boxed in by a growing rich neighborhood and a lake, and increased population density has led to a decrease in open land. Dhaka, according to UNEP, will be the second largest city in the world by 2015.

Abdulmumin resigned from his position as the Chairman of Green Forest Group Ltd in 2011 to fully participate in politics.
Politics.
Abdulmumin is a member of the ruling political party in Nigeria, People's Democratic Party (PDP)
Though Abdulmumin had previously served as an officer of a civil society group and occupied different positions in political formations from serving as the Group National Coordinator Grand Alliance of Nigeria (pro-Democracy Group) between 2002 and 2004 to being a member of the Presidential Campaign Committee of the PDP in 2003 and Programme Officer of the party's Presidential Campaign Headquarters (2007), he only contested for an elective political office in 2011 which won him a place as a member of Nigeria's House of Representatives representing Kiru/Bebeji Federal constituency of Kano State of Nigeria.
No sooner had Abdulmumin got elected into the House of Representative than he formed a group, called 7th Assembly Group, which was made up of mostly the newly elected first-time lawmakers. The aim of the group according to Abdulmumin, as quoted in a national newspaper, was to serve as a "platform for members-elect to establish acquaintance and cross fertilize ideas emanating from various constituencies for the overall interest of the country." 
Abdulmumin was subsequently appointed Chairman Committee on Finance of the House of Representatives with oversight on the Federal Ministry of Finance and its Parastatals, Federal Revenue, Preparation of Revenue framework/Estimate for the Federal budgets, Tax Matters, Fiscal matters, Government investment in banks and Statutory Corporations and Agencies, Insurance and Insurance of Government properties and assets amongst others. Since his assumption of position as the head of the finance committee, Abdulmumin has been a vocal voice on national matters; a critic and appraiser of some government's policies and actions.
Abdulmumin was appointed by the House of Representatives as the head of a joint ad-hoc committee on Finance, Petroleum Upstream, Petroleum Downstream and Gas Resources to investigate an alleged indebtedness of NNPC to the federation account in response to the continuing outcry by Nigerians for increasing accountability on the part of their governments. The investigation conducted by the Abdulmumin Jibrin-led joint committee later revealed a non-remittance of the sum of N450 billion by the NNPC to the federation account in contravention of Section 162 (1) of the 1999 constitution.
Similarly, following a motion passed by the House of Representatives directing President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria to fully implement the country's budget of 2012, 
Abdulmumin equally toed the line of his colleagues in the House as he warned the government against breach of the constitution Abdulmumin has also expressed discontentment on Nigeria's over-dependence on oil and gas revenue. He is therefore in the forefront of pioneering a national summit on diversification of Nigeria's economy.
Apart from his position as the Chairman of House Committee on Finance, Abdulmumin has headed and co-chaired a number of parliamentary investigations and assignments which include but not limited to the following: investigation of independent revenue which deals with the internally generated revenue of corporations. Under Abdulmumin's leadership, the Finance Committee discovered billions of unremitted funds to the consolidated revenue fund and subsequently compelled the corporations to pay. 
With the mandate of the house, Abdulmumin also launched a comprehensive investigation on the insurance industry and insurance of government asset and properties where wide-ranging discoveries were made bothering on issues of abuse of processes and existing laws. The committee has commenced work to repeal and re-enact the existing insurance law. In the same vein, Abdulmumin proceeded to look into tax compliance and remittances by various sectors of the economy. Specifically, the committee has commenced investigation of tax compliance by banks. This will review the role of the banks as tax collecting agents and tax-payers.
Abdulmumin has also co-chaired investigation on the planned liquidation of NITEL which used to be the largest telecommunication company in Nigeria, investigation on ports congestion, investigation on discretionary granting of waivers and other incentives by government for big companies, investigation into multi-billion naira housing fund, investigation of the management of the petroleum subsidy funds and investigation on budget implementation among others.
Abdulmumin is also a member of the House committee on Foreign Affairs, Gas, Electoral Matters, Youths Development and Special Duties where he has contributed significantly in the works of these committees. Abdulmumin is the chair of the yearly joint committee that modifies the federal government Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF) which deals with all the macro-economic indices that serve as the fore-runner for Nigeria's national budget.
In March 2012, Abdulmumin became the third Nigerian to be selected for participation at the prestigious France’s International Visitor Leadership Program organised by the French Government through the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over one thousand promising leaders have participated in the programme since its inception in 1989. Only nine percent of the participants were selected from Africa and only three from Nigeria. Abdulmumin used the opportunity of the programme to drum up attention to issues of development in Nigeria and emphasis on increasing collaboration between Nigeria and France.
Interests.
Beyond politics and his business engagements, Abdulmumin has shown interest in philanthropy through which he instituted awards and yearly donation/lecture at the NYSC. He was the sole sponsor of his alma mater, University of Abuja re-union event. Abdulmumin has also provided needful equipment that would improve academic endeavours at the university and renovated some of the institution's academic buildings. He co-founded Laila foundation with his wife as a charity organisation dedicated to the less-privileged. He's a member of Rotary International and Paul Harris Fellow.
Awards.
Abdulmumin has received several awards and honours for his meritorious achievements both in professional and public life. And he has also been inducted into different professional bodies for his sterling contributions to professional best practices in accordance with the global standards. In 2000, Abdulmumin was bestowed with the Award of Life Membership by the Students' Union Government, University of Abuja, Nigeria. The United Nations Global Peace Foundation conferred on Abdulmumin an award of Peace Ambassador in 2009. He was a recipient of the Icon of Hope Award by the African-Caribbean Society of the University of Reading in 2010. He was also honoured as a World Youth Ambassador by the Youth Federation for World Peace in the same year 2010.

ThinkPad X1 Carbon

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a high-end notebook computer released by Lenovo in 2012 and updated in 2013 and 2014. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch features a multitouch enabled screen in order to take more effective advantage of Microsoft's touch-optimized Windows 8 operating system.
Launch.
In early August 2012, Lenovo released the ThinkPad X1 Carbon as the successor to the earlier ThinkPad X1. The X1 Carbon was first released in China due to the popularity of ThinkPads in that market.
Specifications.
The X1 Carbon features a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a hard drive. The base model has 4 gigabytes of memory, an Intel Core i5-3317U processor, and a 128-gigabyte SSD. The most expensive model has an Intel Core i7 processor and a 256-gigabyte SSD. The X1 Carbon requires the use of a dongle to access wired ethernet and some models include 3G cellular modems.
The X1 Carbon has a 14-inch screen with a resolution of 1600 by 900 pixels. The X1 Carbon weighs 1.35 kilograms and measures 12.8 inches by 8.94 inches by 0.68 inches (at its thickest). The X1 Carbon's case is made of light carbon-fiber and has a matte black finish.
Touch-enabled version.
In November of 2012, Lenovo announced a touch-screen variant called the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch designed for use with Windows 8. Its display makes use of multi-touch technology that can detect simultaneous inputs from up to ten fingers.
On the X1 Carbon Touch's SSD performance Engadget states, "The machine boots into the tart screen in 11 seconds, which is pretty typical for a Windows 8 machine with specs like these. We also found that the solid-state drive delivers equally strong read and write speeds (551 MB/s and 518 MB/s, respectively), which we noticed the last time we tested an Ultrabook with an Intel SSD."
Reviews.
In a review published for CNET, Dan Ackerman wrote, "At first glance, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon looks a lot like other ThinkPads, but in the hand it stands out as very light and portable. The excellent keyboard shows up other ultrabooks, and the rugged build quality is reassuring. With a slightly boosted battery and maybe a lower starting price, this could be a serious contender for my all-around favorite thin laptop."
In another review for CNET, Nicholas Aaron Khoo wrote, "For this geek, there are many things to like about this 14-inch Ultrabook when it comes to usability when traveling on economy class. These include the backlit and spill-resistant keyboard, side-positioned ports, nice viewing angles, TrackPoint (which not everyone likes), nicely implemented touchpad and biometric login. Unlike poorer cousin, the Lenovo IdeaPad U410, it is able to go into hibernate mode without having the user jump through hoops to enable it."
Touch.
In a review for Engadget, Dana Wollman wrote, "Starting with ergonomics, this has one of the best keyboard / touchpad combinations we've seen on a laptop, and that's not even counting that signature red pointing stick. We're also enamored with the design: aside from being well-made, the X1 Carbon Touch is also notably thin and light for a 14-inch machine, especially one with a touchscreen. The display is hardly our favorite, what with the narrow viewing angles, but at least the 1,600 x 900 resolution is nice and crisp."
In its review of the Carbon X1 Touch "Wired" wrote, "Lenovo also hasn’t forgotten about the things that users actually care about. Audio is impressive and Dolby-certified. The keyboard is backlit and fully usable, and the glass touchpad was rock solid on this go-round with the Carbon." In its final verdict Wired stated that an "Excellent combination of performance, portability, and durability" and "the best keyboard going" make the Touch 'Wired." Wired considered the Touch's price, display, and battery life to be "Tired."

Social Optimization (Social Optimisation) is the building and maintaining of mutually beneficial and effective relationships.
Not to be confused with social media optimization. Social optimisation was coined as a key element to the The Art of Social Strategy methodology developed by Heidi Forbes Öste in 2008. Components of the application of social optimization were first presented in university lectures at Malmö Högskola (University) Sweden in 2009, followed by global conferences from 2010: Global Summit of Women and BPW International, as well in keynote to OpenText Content Days.

Foundations of Differential Geometry

Foundations of Differential Geometry is an influential 2-volume mathematics book on differential geometry written by Shoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu. The first volume was published in 1963 and the second in 1969, by Interscience Publishers. Both were published again in 1996 as Wiley Classics Library.
The first volume considers manifolds, fiber bundles, tensor analysis, connections in bundles, and the role of Lie groups. It also covers holonomy, the de Rham decomposition theorem and the Hopf-Rinow theorem. According to the review of J. Eells, it has a "fine expositional style" and consists of a "special blend of algebraic, analytic, and geometric concepts". Eells says it is "essentially a textbook (even though there are no exercises)". An advanced text, it has a "pace geared to a term graduate course".
The second volume considers submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds, the Gauss map, and the second fundamental form. It continues with geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, the Jacobi field, Morse index, the Rauch comparison theorems and the Cartan-Hadamard theorem. Then it ascends to complex manifolds, Kahlerian manifolds, homogeneous spaces, and symmetric spaces. In a discussion of curvature representation of characteristic classes of vector bundles, it covers Euler classes, Chern classes, and Pontryagin classes. The second volume also received a favorable review by J. Eells in "Mathematical Reviews".

Mailbox provider

A mailbox provider, mail service provider or email service provider is a department or organization that provides email hosting. It provides email servers to send, receive, accept, and store email for other organizations and/or end users, on their behalf and upon their explicit mandate.
The term "mail service provider" was coined in RFC 5598, the famous Internet Mail Architecture document.
Types.
There are various kinds of email providers. There are paid and free ones, possibly sustained by advertising. Some allow anonymous users, whereby a single user can get multiple, apparently unrelated accounts. Some require full identification credentials; for example, a company may provide email accounts to full-time staff only. Often, companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves adopt naming conventions that make it straightforward to identify who is the owner of a given email address. Besides control of the local names, insourcing may provide for data confidentiality, network traffic optimization, and fun.
Mailbox providers typically accomplish their task by implementing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), the Post Office Protocol, Webmail, or a proprietary protocol. Parts of the task can still be outsourced, for example virus and spam filtering of incoming mail, or authentication of outgoing mail.
ISP-based email.
Many mailbox providers are also access providers. Not the core product, their email services could lack some interesting features, such as IMAP, Transport Layer Security, or SMTP Authentication —in fact, an ISP can do without the latter, as it can recognize its clients by the IP addresses it assigns them.
Free mail providers.
AOL Mail, Hotmail, Lycos, Mail.com, Yahoo! Mail, launched in the 90's, are among the early providers of free email accounts, joined by GMail in 2004. They attract users because they are free and can advertise their service on every message. According to Jurvetson, Hotmail grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months. That was before it was bought by Microsoft.
Premium email services.
These are the paid equivalent of free mail providers. That is, a better alternative to ISP-based email. Much less popular than free mail, they target a niche of users.
Vanity email.
It is also possible to run a shim service, providing no access but just forwarding all messages to another account, which does not lend itself to direct use, for example because it is temporary or just less appealing.
Role as identifier.
A mailbox provider is the administrator of the registered domain name that forms the domain-part of its email addresses. As such, it controls the MX records that specify which hosts will receive email destined to those addresses. The operators of those hosts define the meaning of the local-part of an address by associating it to a mailbox, which in turn can be associated to a user. The mailbox provider also specifies how users can read their mail, possibly creating SRV records to ease email client configuration, or giving detailed instructions.
Email addresses are convenient tokens for identifying people, even at web sites unrelated to email. In fact, they are unique, and allow password reminders to be sent at will.
From a bureaucracy-oriented point of view, there is no formal undertaking beyond domain name registration. This role is based on IETF standards, and, unlike X.400 and other ITU-T works, in and of itself requires no arrangements with local authorities. The notion of Administration Management Domain (ADMD) is derived afterwards, from empirical evidence. However, local authorities concerned with Internet privacy issues may add rules and requisites on top of the original Internet email design.

Bayley Lane

Bayley Lane is a historic street in the centre of Coventry and is thought to follow the line of the outer ditch or bailey of the former Coventry Castle, founded by the Earls of Chester between 1088 and 1147. 
The economic stagnation of the city between the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540s, and the 19th century has enabled several medieval buildings and underground remains to survive.
During extension work on Herbert Art Gallery and Museum (completed in 2008), excavations by Birmingham Archaeology found evidence of occupation in Bayley Lane from as early as 12th century, and also stone foundations of numerous 14th century buildings. The excavation also uncovered numerous 19th century buildings, some of which had been built on the medieval foundations. These included a 14th century cellar which is now incorporated into the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. A rare medieval chess piece, thought to be the first of its kind in the region was also unearthed.

Because Mommy Works

Because Mommy Works is a 1994 film directed by Robert Markowitz. It is about Abby (Anne Archer) who fights with Ted Forman (John Heard) for the custody of their son Willie Forman (Casey Wurzbach). The action takes place in California. 
The film confronts the issue of women being denied custody rights during divorce partly or solely because they work at jobs outside the home, allegedly making them less available as maternal caregivers. It focuses in particular on the added custodial challenge that working women face if their former husband has remarried a woman who does not have a job. 
The film was inspired by a true story that appeared in "McCall's Magazine" in 1992, "Why a Good Mother Lost Custody of her Child," by author Cameron Stauth. The article was about a custody case in Eugene, Oregon, that involved a female teacher who lost custody of her young son, primarily because her husband had remarried a woman who did not work outside the home. Stauth co-produced the film with Anne Archer, and it was written by writer/director Lynn Mamet, sister of writer/director David Mamet. 
The issue of working mothers being penalized in custody cases is still being debated in the courts, and is the subject of heated debate among women's rights advocates.

Symbols of Portugal

The symbols of Portugal are official and unofficial flags, icons or cultural expressions that are emblematic, representative or otherwise characteristic of Portugal and of its culture.
Flags.
The present national flag of Portugal was officially introduced in 1911, after the introduction of the republican regime in the 5 October 1910 Revolution. It is the latest in a series of national flags since the 12th century. Since at least the 15th century, the flags of Portugal had been known as ""Bandeira das Quinas"" (Flag of the Quinas), the quina being each one of the five escutcheons of the Portuguese Coat of Arms that are the central motif of the flag.
Anthem.
"A Portuguesa" (The Portuguese) is the national anthem of Portugal. It was composed by Alfredo Keil and written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça during the resurgent nationalist movement ignited by the 1890 British Ultimatum to Portugal concerning its African colonies. Used as the marching song of the failed republican rebellion of January 1891, in Porto, it was adopted as the national anthem of the newborn Portuguese Republic in 1911, replacing "O Hino da Carta" (The Charter Anthem), the anthem of the deposed constitutional monarchy.

<doc id="36727839" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36727839" title="Citadel of Liège">
Citadel of Liège

The Citadel of Liège was the central fortification of the strategic Belgian city of Liège until the end of the 19th century. It is located in the Sainte-Walburge neighborhood, above the Meuse valley. The first citadel was built on the heights overlooking the city in 1255. It was rebuilt in a pentagonal shape by Prince-Bishop Maximilian Henry of Bavaria in 1650. This fortress was destroyed by France shortly afterwards, then rebuilt in 1684. During the Napoleonic Wars it was given five bastions in the style of Vauban. By the late 19th century the citadel had become obsolete, replaced by the twelve forts of the Fortified Position of Liège. It continued in use as a barracks and as a command post. In the 1970s the citadel was largely destroyed by the construction of a hospital on the site. The southern walls remain. An area on the north side is a memorial to Belgians executed in the citadel by German occupiers in World Wars I and II, while 20th-century bunkers remain on the south side.
History.
Early history.
Around the year 1000, during the reign of Notker, Prince-Bishop of Liège, the city built its first walls in sandstone. The enclosure was shaped like an elongated rectangle of about , surrounded with a ditch and lined with towers and gates. A gate tower was built at the foot of Pierruse. The first bridge at the site of the Pont des Arches was built around 1033. In the early 12th century Holy Roman Emperor Henri IV proposed a larger enclosure, but failed to raise the necessary funds. A new wall was started in 1204 from the Porte Sainte-Walburge to Paienporte, then down to the river, and another wall was under construction between the Hocheporte and Sainte-Walburge. In May 1212 the still uncompleted walls were scaled by the troops of Henry I, Duke of Brabant, who sacked the city. Encouraged by this setback, the townsmen completed the walls in 1215.
In 1255 Prince-Bishop Henri de Gueldre built the Porte Sainte Walburga, furnished with towers, a well, a drawbridge and a prison, which was in effect the first citadel on the site. In 1468 the troops of Charles the Bold destroyed the city despite an attack by the 600 Franchimontois.
17th century.
In 1650 the Holy Roman Emperor granted Prince-Bishop Maximilien Henri de Bavière obtained permission to build a fort. He erected a large well-protected rectangle, relying on German engineers. The walls were of earthern construction, incorporating the 1548 Sainte-Walburge bastion. However, the construction was blown up by the French shortly after completion.
Work began in 1663 on the first permanent masonry citadel. In 1671 work was completed on a pentagonal fortress with bastions at the angles and demi-lunes. On the outer side the walls were lined with ditches, and the citadel was integrated with the city walls. The bastions were named for St. Lambert, St. Francis, St. Mary, St. Maximilian and St. Henry. The Chapel of St. Balbina was placed in the center of the citadel. The French took the citadel in 1675. In 1676 the French demolished the citadel to prevent it from falling into the hands of its enemies. The bastions, demi-lunes and part of the old ramparts were undermined. In 1684 Prince-Bishop Maximilian Henry of Bavaria began to rebuild the citadel. However, the 1685 Treaty of Versailles, which guaranteed the neutrality of the Liégeoise, required the citadel's demolition. In 1691 French troops commanded by Louis François, duc de Boufflers bombarded the city from the vicinity of the Fort de la Chartreuse during the Nine Years' War.
In 1692 the Dutch general Menno van Coehoorn organized the defense of Liège. He established a series of protected trenches on the left bank of the Meuse. This system employed light troops supported by artillery, reflecting van Coehoorn's lack of interest in fortifications.
18th century.
With the commencement of the War of Spanish Succession in 1701, the engineer Jacques de la Combe was delegated by Vauban to repair the citadel. In 1702 the engineer Filley reported to Vauban, describing the state of the citadel as lamentable. Vauban came to Liège to try to convince Prince-Bishop Joseph Clemens of Bavaria to underwrite the cost of repairs. 
In 1702 the allies under van Coehoorn laid siege to the citadel for three days. In 1703 in accordance with the Treaties of Namur and Utrecht, Liège was declared neutral. New work continued from 1707 to 1711 with the addition of new bastions and demi-lunes. 
The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht established peace between France and the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, followed by the Treaty of Rastatt which settled disputes between France and the Holy Roman Empire, thereby ending the War of Spanish Succession. In 1715 the Treaty of the Barrier was signed at Antwerp between the Empire and the United Provinces, requiring the demolition of the citadel of Liège The bastions and walls on the town side of the citadel remained. 
19th century.
In 1815 the Dutch took control of the area following the defeat of Napoleon. In 1816 William I of the Netherlands authorized the reconstruction of the citadel to a plan by Camerlingh. In 1817 the St. Balbina chapel, the old Porte Sainte-Walburge and the bastion du Clergé were demolished. The Sainte-Lambert and Sainte-François bastions were rebuilt and demi-lune outworks were added. 
The Dutch garrison capitulated during the Belgian Revolution of 1830. The second battalion of the first Belgian Independent Regiment occupied the citadel. In 1891 a royal decree downgraded the citadel and the nearby Fort de la Chartreuse, following the construction of twelve modern forts surrounding Liége. The citadel was used as a barracks.
Gallery.
20th century.
In 1911 Belgian troops were billeted in the citadel. In August 1914 they participated in the defense of Liège from German invasion. Following the surrender of the city the citadel was used as a place of internment and as a hospital. It continued in use as a hospital following the 1918 armistice.
A command post for the Fortified Position of Liège was established in the southern portion of the citade between the warsl, which survives. The rounded concrete forms of the three bunkers contrast with the older masonry. The command post was augmented after World War II with an air intake tower equipped with filters for nuclear, biological and chemical contaminants. 
Following the Battle of Belgium in May 1940 the citadel was once again used by German forces to intern Belgians. It was occupied by American forces in 1945, and in 1947 Belgian forces reoccupied the citadel. 
In 1946 a memorial was established to those who had been executed in the citadel during World Wars I and II. The "Enclos des Fusillés" ("enclosure of those shot by firing squad") was dedicated in 1947, with 197 crosses commemorating the dead.
In 1967 the citadel was turned over to the Public Centre for Social Welfare of Liège, and in 1970 construction of the Centre hospitalier régional de la Citadelle was begun, destroying much of the old citadel. Work on the hospital building started in 1974 and was completed in 1978. Due to the presence of underground excavations, the hospital was placed on driven piles for support.
On 21 December 1977 the fortress and the were listed as classified structures. On 11 October 1982 the bastions and curtain walls were designated, and on 23 March 1988 the walls and the Porte de Païenporte were classified.

Something for the Weakened

Something for the Weakened is the third studio album by Scottish indie rock band Meursault, released on July 16, 2012 on Song, by Toad Records. Regarding the album, songwriter Neil Pennycook noted, "This album makes more sense to me, and I think I’m more relaxed this time. I can hear it as a body of work, and it resonates more with me than the other records."
Unlike the band's previous two studio albums, "Something for the Weakened" does not feature any electronica elements, with Pennycook noting that his Macbook broke prior to recording, and that "I think we all wanted to move towards something which had a more human element to it."
Background and recording.
Recorded by band member Pete Harvey, "Something for the Weakened" is the first Meursault album to feature contributions from Lorcan Doherty, Sam Mallalieu, Kate Miguda and Rob St. John. Neil Pennycook notes, "With the last two records I was into that idea of just locking myself in a room for a few weeks and emerging with an album, so it was nice to have everyone getting together this time, bouncing things off each other." Pennycook also noted that the band had more input than on previous recordings; "When the songs are being recorded/arranged the rest of the guys have a lot more input now due to the nature of the sessions. Whereas before I treated recording as quite a solitary thing, I play better with others these days."
Writing and composition.
Upon the album's release, Neil Pennycook stated, "I'd written a bunch of songs, a few we’d been playing live for a little while in some form or other, but most were worked up from pretty sparse guitar, piano and vocal demos."
Neil Pennycook noted that "song "Flittin’ gave me an idea of what I wanted the album to be about. While the other two are pretty heavily-themed, I just wanted this album to reflect what was happening over the course of a year. I don’t think the lyrics are quite as metaphorical as they’ve been in the past, they’re a bit more direct and that’s what I was after. That carried through the instruments as well."
The lyric, "So long, it's been good to know you," featured in "Flittin'", is by Woody Guthrie.

Särskilda operationsgruppen

Särskilda Operationsgruppen (English: Special Operations Task Group, abbreviated SOG) is a special forces unit within the Swedish Armed Forces which has been active since 2011. The unit is based at Karlsborg Fortress in Karlsborg, Västra Götaland County.
History.
Särskilda operationsgruppen was formed in 2011 by merging the Särskilda skyddsgruppen (SSG) and Särskilda inhämtningsgruppen (SIG).
Organisation.
The Special Operations Task Group (SOG), combined with the Special Forces Command, comprises the Swedish Armed Forces Special Forces (FM SF). In addition to this, there are several special forces support units (FM SOF). The personnel are specially selected, trained and equipped units for air, sea and land transportation, technical, logistical and medical support. For example: Special Maritime Transportation unit (STE), Special Signals Group (SSE) and the Section for Special Operative Technology (SOT).
SOG answers directly to the Supreme Commander and the Director Special Forces (currently Brigadier General Urban Molin).
Although, their exact organisation is unknown to the public, it is known that SOG consists of several troops. Each troop then consists of three "teams" or patrols of four operators each.
Activities.
What most people see of the operators is when they are employed as personal protection for the Supreme Commander or other high-ranking officers of the Swedish Armed Forces when they visit Swedish areas of operation. However, their most frequent usage is during multi-national special operations such as Direct Action, Special Reconnaissance and Military Assistance. 
SOG combat operations are of great strategic importance that cannot be accomplished by conventional forces or weapon systems. Combat missions can be to eliminate high value targets or objects of great importance to the enemy, to conduct complex rescue operations of Swedish personnel held captive or hostage, or to gather time-critical intelligence through action.
Special reconnaissance and intelligence gathering is intended to gather information of great tactical importance about the enemy´s activities, enemy personnel or other bits of information of operational significance.
Special Forces can also be tasked with advising and training foreign military units as part of an international peace-keeping military operation.
The unit maintains a high degree of readiness and can be deployed on short notice within a 6000 km radius of Brussels and can operate in any environment, for example jungle, desert, mountain/alpine, sub-arctic and urban. The unit is deployed on request by the UN or the EU but must then be sanctioned on a political level.
The unit is lightly equipped for greater mobility, both tactically and strategically. SOG strive for simplicity in planning and execution, and unpredictability through unconventional and flexible methods. 
Due to operational security, the unit's capabilities, equipment, operational methods, previous or on-going operations and the identities of their personnel are classified.
SOG have been deployed in support of ISAF operations in Afghanistan.
The patrol.
Each operator has a broader skill base than regular soldiers and one or two patrol skills at which he or she is exceptionally skilled. A typical SOG team consists of four operators: A team leader, a demolitions expert, a signaller and a medic. Each patrol can be augmented with, EOD technicians, JTAC-specialists or snipers.
Selection.
Selection is open for Armed Forces members of both sexes who are at least eligible for specialist officer's training and can only be attempted once unless mitigating circumstances caused the candidate to fail on the first attempt.
The candidates are advised to prepare themselves at least six months prior to the selection course and are invited to attend a pre-selection weekend where they will be tested and advised on their likelihood of success or failure and also where they need to improve.
The selection process takes two weeks and is held once a year. Historically, candidates for SOG´s predecessor, the SSG were sought out by the unit and invited to attempt selection. Selection for SOG however, is advertised on the Armed Forces website and is open for anyone who meets the basic requirements.The first week of selection consists of an extremely grueling field exercise where the candidates are tested on their fitness, field craft and land navigation and the tests are conducted during great stress. The second week consists of psychological tests, similar to those undertaken by fighter pilots. They are also tested for their predisposition for phobias, such as heights and confined spaces. If the candidate is successful, he or she will begin the basic operator course which lasts for 12 months and is divided into three blocks:
Once completed, the operator will be put in an operational team and can be deployed with the unit.
Operators train at their own compound at a secret location near Karlsborg, which, among shooting ranges, also features a large multi-story CQB-building, with bullet-absorbing lining in its walls. The building also facilitates helicopter insertions on its roof.
Heraldry.
The SOG coat of arms is blazoned thusly: Upon a black shield is a six-pointed star in silver in the upper left corner.
It was developed by the Armed Forces Board of Traditions and symbolizes the unit´s ability of special problem solving, effectiveness of duty and clandestine operations.

The Berlin Post Office was established on 15 February 1869 but was changed to the Rheola Post Office in November 1876 when the town changed its name to Rheola after the town in Wales. The Post Office closed on 19 June 1974.
The 'Berlin Rush' beginnings, August 1868 when Alexander Clelland sank a shallow shaft outside John Catto's Paddock and found a 60 oz nugget at the bottom. The Government rewarded him 100 pounds for the discovery of what he called "Bervie" Gold field. This name was spelled incorrectly and became Berlin in the official register. The Rheola area became famous for its beds of large nuggets scattered through the gullies.
Some of the gold nuggets found during the 19th century include: The Needful found in 1869, Rum Ton found in 1870, Viscount Canterbury found in 1871, Precious found in 1871, Viscountess Canterbury and the Cresent found in 1872. John Catto's Paddock was the location of both the Precious and the Viscount Canterbury. The Precious was Victoria’ fourth largest nugget, weighted at 1,717 ounces.

Fort Massey Cemetery

Fort Massey Cemetery is a military cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia dating back to the 1750s, and is the resting place for British and Canadian soldiers, veterans and spouses.
History.
Fort Massey was a square earthen redoubt, with a blockhouse, barracks, and a magazine, built between 1776 and 1778 on what was then known as Windmill Hill, presently at Queen and South Streets. It was to command the deep hollow formed by Freshwater Brook, which was a blind spot to the Citadel's guns, and also to cover Greenbank and Grand Batteries. The 17-gun earthwork fort was enlarged in 1782 to be 320 feet long and 170 feet wide, with two semi-circular works connected by a redan on each side. There are no remains, except the site of the Fort Massey Cemetery, maintained by Veterans Affairs Canada.
Notable interments.
It contains 86 Commonwealth burials of the First World War and 41 from the Second World War. Most of these graves are in a plot at the lower end of the cemetery, next to which stands the Cross of Sacrifice. The HALIFAX (FORT MASSEY) MEMORIAL stands within the cemetery and commemorates two servicemen who were killed in the 1917 explosion but whose bodies were not found.

St. George's Church, Cologne

St. Georg's Church is one of twelve Romanesque churches in the city of Cologne, Germany.
History.
The date of the foundation of St Georg's is unknown, but it was consecrated towards the end of the 11th century. The nave was vaulted in the mid-12th century, the westwerk was added in 1188 and the entrance portal on the north side in 1551. The church was damaged during World War II, resulting in extensive restoration which included the removal of the Baroque extension to the westwerk and replacement with a simple hip roof in the Romanesque style.
Architecture.
St Georg's has the trefoil-shaped eastern end typical of other Romanesque churches of Cologne, its chancel and transepts each terminating in an apse. The nave is unique in Cologne in having its arcade supported on columns rather than piers.
There is a robust westwerk with walls of 5 metres thick, suggesting that it was intended to be much taller than actually built. The original Romanesque roof of the westwerk was replaced with a Baroque belfry, but this was damaged during WWII and later replaced with a steeply pitched hip roof of copper. During the late 1920s the church had been entirely glazed by the Expressionist artist, Jan Thorn Prikker. These widows were lost during the war, but have been reproduced from the original cartoons.

The video was uploaded onto Youtube on 6 September 2011 and has since received over 210,000 views.
During October 2011 "Penniless Optimist" was remixed by C@ in the H@ and Sam Redmore. "Penniless Optimist" received airplay on BBC Radio 6 on The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show. The video for "Penniless Optimist" was also shown on BBC Big Screens nationwide. 
At the ElectroSwing People’s Favorite Awards, The Electric Swing Circus won Best Live Act award in December 2011.
Electric Swing Circus has a residency at Hot Club de Swing, a club night at the Hare and Hounds, Birmingham. Hot Club de Swing hosts a 1920s theme and performers include cabaret, burlesque and electro-swing acts. The band also have a residency at Electric Swing Club, which has many venues across the UK.
2012.
The band collaborated with European electro-swing act Lyre le Temps on the track "Lindy Hop" in June 2012.
The Electric Swing Circus played many festivals during 2012, including Bestival, Secret Garden Party, Nozstock, Boomtown Fair, Beat-Herder, Fieldview and WOMAD. The band also performed as headline act on the Main Stage of Vale Festival 2012.
2013.
The Electric Swing Circus filmed the video for the single "Valentine" in March 2013. It was filmed in Birmingham Municipal Bank and premièred at Swingamajig Festival in May that year. 
On 9 May 2013, the band released their self-titled debut album. This was funded by their CrowdFunder campaign that began in July 2012. Electric Swing Circus are a cooperative and have been featured in both cooperative events and press.
Over the European summer, the band played several big name festivals, including Glastonbury Festival, Shambala and Fusion Festival.
Bridget Walsh joined the band in late 2013.
The band's track, "Valentine" has been featured in the semi-finals of New Zealand's Got Talent, as a backing track for dance-duo Silhouette, who have since been selected for the 2013 Grand Final. Interestingly, both Laura Louise and Bridget Walsh spent considerable time growing up in New Zealand, though Silhouette's choice to use an Electric Swing Circus song was only a coincidence.
Swingamajig Festival.
In May 2013, the band hosted a 1-day festival in Digbeth, Birmingham, which was the first of its kind in the UK. Headline acts included The Correspondents, Dutty Moonshine, Odjbox and Pierre, DJ Switch and C@ in the H@. The festival sold out and Swingamajig's 2014 festival date has just been announced: 4 May 2014.

Neumann–Poincaré operator

In mathematics, the Neumann–Poincaré operator or Poincaré–Neumann operator, named after Carl Neumann and Henri Poincaré, is a non-self-adjoint compact operator introduced by Poincaré to solve boundary value problems for the Laplacian on bounded domains in Euclidean space. Within the language of potential theory it reduces the partial differential equation to an integral equation on the boundary to which the theory of Fredholm operators can be applied. The theory is particularly simple in two dimensions—the case treated in detail in this article—where it is related to complex function theory, the conjugate Beurling transform or complex Hilbert transform and the Fredholm eigenvalues of bounded planar domains.
Dirichlet and Neumann problems.
Green's theorem for a bounded region Ω in the plane with smooth boundary ∂Ω states that
One direct way to prove this is as follows. By subtraction, it is sufficient to prove the theorem for a region bounded by a simple smooth curve. Any such is diffeomorphic to the closed unit disk. By change of variables it is enough to prove the result there. Separating the "A" and "B" terms, the right hand side can be written as a double integral starting in the "x" or "y" direction, to which the fundamental theorem of calculus can be applied. This converts the integral over the disk into the integral over its boundary.
Let Ω be a region bounded by a simple closed curve. Given a smooth function "f" on the closure of Ω its normal derivative ∂"n""f" at a boundary point is the directional derivative in the direction of the outward pointing normal vector.
Applying Green's theorem with "A" = "v""x" "u" and "B" = "v""y" "u" gives the first of Green's identities:
where the Laplacian Δ is given by
Swapping "u" and "v" and subtracting gives the second of Green's identities:
If now "u" is harmonic in Ω and "v" = 1, then this identity implies that
so the integral of the normal derivative of a harmonic function on the boundary of a region always vanishes.
A similar argument shows that the average of a harmonic function on the boundary of a disk equals its value at the centre. Translating the disk can be taken to be centred at 0. Green's identity can be applied to an annulus formed of the boundary of the disk and a small circle centred on 0 with "v" = "z"2: it follows that the average is independent of the circle. It tends to the value at its value at 0 as the radius of the smaller circle decreases. This result also follows easily using Fourier series and the Poisson integral.
For continuous functions "f" on the whole plane which are smooth in Ω and the complementary region Ω"c", the first derivative can have a jump across the boundary of Ω. The value of the normal derivative at a boundary point can be computed from inside or outside Ω. The interior normal derivative will be denoted by ∂"n"− and the exterior normal derivative by ∂"n"+. With this terminology the four basic problems of classical potential theory are as follows:
For the exterior problems the inversion map "z"−1 takes harmonic functions on Ω"c" into harmonic functions on the image of Ω"c" under the inversion map. The transform "v" of "u" is continuous in a small disc |"z"| ≤ "r" and harmonic everywhere in the interior except possibly 0. Let "w" be the harmonic function given by the Poisson integral on
"v" − "w" + ε log |"z"| on δ ≤ |"z"| ≤ "r", it must be negative for δ small. Hence "v"("z") ≤ "u"("z") for "z" ≠ 0. The same argument applies with "v" and "w" swapped, so "v" = "w" is harmonic in the disk. Thus the singularity at ∞ is removable.
By the maximum principle the interior and exterior Dirichlet problems have unique solutions. For the interior Neumann problem, if a solution "u" is harmonic in 0 and its interior normal derivative vanishes, then Green's first identity implies implies the "u""x" = 0 = "u""y", so that "u" is constant. This shows the interior Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants. Applying inversion, the same holds for the external Neumann problem.
For both Neumann problems, a necessary condition for a solution to exist is
For the interior Neumann problem, this follows by setting "v" = 1 in Green's second identity. For the exterior Neumann problem, the same can be done for the intersection of Ω"c" and a large disk |"z"| < "R", giving
The first term the last product uniformly bounded because of the smoothness of the Gauss map n("t"). The second is uniformly bounded because of the approximate version of Pythagoras' theorem:
Continuity of "f" implies that on ∂Ω
which gives the jump formulas.
Derivatives of layer potentials.
If the moment φ is smooth, the derivatives of the single and double layer potentials on Ω and Ω"c" extend continuously to their closures.
As usual the gradient of a function "f" defined on an open set in R2 is defined by
Set
If the moment φ is smooth, then
In fact
so that
Moreover
The second relation can be rewritten by substituting in from the first relation:
Regularity of layer potentials. As a consequence of these relations, successive derivatives can all be expressed in terms of single and double layer potentials of smooth moments on the boundary. Since the layer potentials on Ω and Ω"c" have continuous limits on the boundary it follows that they define smooth functions on the closures of Ω and Ω"c".
Continuity of normal derivatives of double layer potentials. Just as the single layer potentials are continuous at the boundary with a jump in the normal derivative, so the double layer potentials have a jump across the boundary while their normal derivatives are continuous. In fact from the formula above
If "s""n" tends to "s" and λ"n" tends to 0, the first term tends to "T""K"("v"(s)) since the moments tend uniformly to a moment vanishing at "t" = "s"; the second term is continuous because it is a single layer potential.
Solution of Dirichlet and Neumann problems.
The following properties of "T" = "T""K" are required to solve the boundary value problem:
In fact since "a" I + "T" is a Fredholm operator of index 0, it and its adjoint have kernels of equal dimension. The same applies to any power of this operator. So it suffices to verify each of the statements for either "T" or "T"*. To check that "T" has no generalized eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1/2 it suffices to show that
has no solutions. The definition of the double layer potential shows that it vanishes at ∞, so that it is harmonic at ∞. The equation above shows that if "u" = "D"(φ) then "u"+ = 1. On the other hand, applying the inversion map gives a contradiction; for it would produce a harmonic map in bounded region vanishing at an interior point with boundary value 1, which contradicts the fact that 1 is the only harmonic map with boundary value 1. If the eigenvalue 1/2 has multiplicity greater than 1, there is a moment φ such that "T"*φ = φ/2 and ∫ φ = 0. It follows that if "u" = "S"(φ) then ∂"n"− "u" = 0. By uniqueness "u" is constant on Ω. Since "u" is continuous on R2 ∪ ∞ and is harmonic at ∞ (since ∫ φ = 0) and constant on ∂Ω, it must be zero. Hence φ = ∂"n"+ "u" − ∂"n"− "u" = 0. Thus the eigenspace is one-dimensional and the eigenfunction ψ can be normalized so that "S"(ψ) = 1 on ∂Ω.
In general if
then
since
If φ satisfies
it follows that ∫ φ = 0 and so "u" = "S"(φ) is harmonic at infinity. By the jump formulas, ∂"n"-"u" = 0. By uniqueness "u" is constant on Ω. By continuity it is constant on ∂Ω. Since it is harmonic on Ω"c" and vanishes at infinity, it must vanish identically. As above this forces φ = 0.
These results on the eigenvalues of "T""K" lead to the following conclusions about the four boundary value problems:
The solution is obtained as follows:
The smoothness of the solution follows from the regularity of single and double layer potentials.
Calderón projector.
There is another consequence of the laws giverning the derivatives, which completes the symmetry of the jump relations, is that normal derivative of the double layer potential has no jump across the boundary, i.e. it has a continuous extension to a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary given by
"H" is called a hypersingular operator. Although it takes smooth functions to smooth functions, it is not a bounded operator on L2(∂Ω). In fact it is a pseudodifferential operator of order 1, so does define a bounded operator between Sobolev spaces on ∂Ω, decreasing the order by 1. It allows a 2 × 2 matrix of operators to be defined by
The matrix satisfies "C"2 = "C", so is an idempotent, called the Calderón projector. This identity is equivalent the following classical relations, the first of which is the symmetrization relation of Plemelj:
The operators "T" and "S" are pseudodifferential operators of order −1. The relations above follow by considering "u" = "S"(φ). It has boundary value "S"φ) and normal derivative "T"* φ − φ/2. Hence in Ω
Taking the boundary values of both sides and their normal derivative yields 2 equations. Two more result by considering "D"(Ψ); these imply the relations for the Calderón projector.
Fredholm eigenvalues.
The non-zero eigenvalues of the Neumann–Poincaré operator "T""K" are called the Fredholm eigenvalues of the region Ω. Since "T""K" is a compact operator, indeed a Hilbert-Schmidt operator, all non-zero elements in its spectrum are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity by the general theory of Fredholm operators. The solution of the boundary value requires knowledge of the spectrum at ± 1/2, namely that the constant function gives an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1/2 and multiplicity one; that there are no corresponding generalized eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1/2; and that -1/2 is not an eigenvalue. proved that all non-zero eigenvalues are real and contained in the interval (-1/2,1/2]. proved that the other non-zero eigenvalues have an important symmetry property, namely that if λ is an eigenvalue with 0 < |λ| < 1/2, then so is –λ, with the same multiplicity. Plemelj also showed that "T" = "T""K" is a symmetrizable compact operator, so that, even though it is self-adjoint, it shares many of the properties of self-adjoint operators. In particular there are no generalized eigenfunctions for non-zero eigenvalues and there is a variational principle similar to the minimax principle for determining the non-zero eigenvalues.
If λ ≠ 1/2 is an eigenvalue of "T""K"* then λ is real, with λ ≠ ± 1/2. Let φ be a corresponding eigenfunction and, following Plemelj, set "u" = "S"(φ). Then the jump formulas imply that
and hence that
Since ∫ φ = 0, "u" is harmonic at ∞. So by Green's theorem
If both the integrals vanish then "u" is constant on Ω and Ω"c". Since it is continuous and vanishes at ∞, it must therefore be identically 0, contradicting φ = ∂"n"+ - ∂"n"−. So both integrals are strictly positive and hence λ must lie in (−½,½).
Let φ be an eigenfunction of "T""K"* with real eigenvalue λ satisfying 0 < |λ| < 1/2. If "u" = "S"(φ), then on
This process can be reversed. Let "u" be a continuous function on R2 ∪ ∞ which is harmonic on Ω and Ω"c" ∪ ∞ and such that the derivatives of "u" on Ω and Ω"c" extend continuously to their closures. Suppose that
Let ψ be the restriction of "u" to ∂Ω. Then
The jump formulas for the boundary values and normal derivatives give
and
It follows that
so that ψ and φ are eigenfunctions of "T" and "T"* with eigenvalue λ.
Let "u" be a real harmonic function on Ω extending to a smooth function on its closure. The harmonic conjugate "v" of "u" is the unique real function on Ω such that "u" + "i" "v" is holomorphic. As such it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:
If "a" is a point in Ω, a solution is given by
where the integral is taken over any path in the closure of Ω. It is easily verified that "v""x" and "v""y" exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of "u". Thus "v" is a smooth function on the closure of Ω, vanishing at 0. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations, "f" = "u" + "i" "v" is smooth on the closure of Ω, holomorphic on
Ω and "f"(a) = 0. Using the inversion map, the same result holds for a harmonic function in Ω"c" harmonic at ∞. It has a harmonic conjugate "v" such that "f" = "u" + "i" "v" extends smoothly to the boundary and "f" is holomorphic on Ω ∪ ∞. Adjusting "v" by a constant it can be assumed that "f"(∞) = 0.
Following , let φ be an eigenfunction of "T""K"* with real eigenvalue λ satisfying 0 < |λ| < 1/2. Let "u" = "S"(φ) and let "v"± be the harmonic conjugates of "u"± in Ω and Ω"c".
Since on ∂Ω
the Cauchy-Riemann equations give on ∂Ω
Now define
Thus "U" is continuous on R2 and
It follows that −λ is an eigenvalue of "T". Since −"u" is the harmonic conjugate of "v", the process of taking harmonic conjugates is one-one, so the multiplicity of −λ as an eigenvalue is the same as that of λ.
By Green's theorem
Adding the two integrals and using the jump relations for the single layer potential, it follows that
Thus
This shows that the operator "S" is self-adjoint and non-negative on L2(∂Ω).
The image of "S" is dense (or equivalently it has zero kernel). In fact the relation "SH" = ¼ "I" - "T"2 =(½ "I" – "T") (½ "I" + "T") shows that the closure of the image of "S" contains the image of ½ "I" – "T", which has codimension 1. Its orthogonal complement is given by the kernel of "T" – ½ "I", i.e. the eigenfunction ψ such that "T"*ψ = ½ ψ. On the other hand "ST"="T"* "S". If the closure of the image is not the whole of L2(∂Ω) then necessarily "S"ψ = 0. Hence "S"{ψ) is constant. But then ψ = ∂"n"+"S"(ψ) – ∂"n"−"S"(ψ) = 0, a contradiction.
Since "S" is strictly positive and "T" satisfies the Plemelj symmetrization relation "ST"* = "TS", the operator "T"* is a symmetrizable compact operator. The operator "S" defines a new inner product on L2(∂Ω):
The operator "T"* is formally self-adjoint with respect to this inner product and by general theory its restriction is bounded and it defines a self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operator on the Hilbert space completion. Since "T"* is formally self-adjoint on this inner product space, it follows immediately that any generalized eigenfunction of "T"* must already be an eigenfunction. By Fredholm theory, the same is true for "T". By general theory the kernel of "T" and its non-zero eigenspaces span a dense subspace of L2(∂Ω). The Fredholm determinant is defined by
It can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm eigenvalues λ"n" with modulus less than 1/2, counted with multiplicity, as
Complex Hilbert transform.
Now define the complex Hilbert transform ot conjugate Beurling transform "T""c" on L2(C) by
This is a conjugate-linear isometric involution.
It commutes with ∂ so carries A2(Ω) ⊕ A2(Ω"c") onto itself. The compression of "T""c" to A2(Ω) is denoted "T"Ω.
If "F" is a holomorphic univalent map from the unit disk "D" onto Ω then the Bergman space of Ω and its conjugate can be identified with that of "D" and "T"Ω becomes the conjugate-linear singular integral operator with kernel
It defines a contraction. On the other hand it can be checked that "T""D" = 0 by computing directly on powers "n" using Stokes theorem to transfer the integral to the boundary.
It follows that the conjugate-linear operator with kernel
acts as a contraction on the Bergman space of "D". It is thus a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
The conjugate-linear operator "T" = "T"Ω satisfies the self-adjointness relation
for "u", "v" in A2(Ω).
Thus "A" = "T"2 is a compact self-adjoint linear operator on "H" with
so that "A" is a positive operator. By the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, there is an orthonormal basis "u""n" of "H" consisting of eigenvectors of "A":
where μ"n" is non-negative by the positivity of "A". Hence
with λ"n" ≥ 0. Since "T" commutes with "A", it leaves its eigenspaces invariant. The positivity relation shows that it acts trivially on the zero eigenspace. The other non-zero eigenspaces are all finite-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. Thus an orthonormal basis can be chosen on each eigenspace so that:
Note also that
by conjugate-linearity of "T".
Connection with Hilbert transform on a closed curve.
The Neumann–Poincaré operator is defined on real functions "f" as
where "H" is the Hilbert transform on ∂Ω. Let "J" denote complex conjugation. Writing "h" = "f" + "ig",
so that
The imaginary part of the Hilbert transform can be used to establish the symmetry properties of the eigenvalues of "T""K". Let
so that
Then
The Cauchy idempotent "E" satisfies "E"1 = 1 = "E"*1. Since "J"1 = 1, it follows that "E" and "E"* leave invariant 
L20(∂Ω), the functions orthogonal to constant functions. The same is also true of "A" = 2 "T""K" and "B". Let "A"1 and "B"1 be their restrictions. Since 1 is an eigenvector of "T""K" with eigenvalue 1/2 and multiplicity one and "T""K" + ½ "I" is invertible,
is invertible, so that "B"1 is invertible. The equation "A"1"B"1 = − "B"1 "A"1 implies that if λ is an eigenvalue of "A"1 then so is −λ and they have the same multiplicity.
Eigenfunctions of complex Hilbert transform.
The links between the Neumann–Poincaré operator and geometric function theory appeared first in . The precise relationship between single and double layer potentials, Fredholm eigenvalues and the complex Hilbert transform is explained in detail in . Briefly given a smooth Jordan curve, the complex derivatives of its single and double layer potentials are −1 and +1 eigenfunctions of the complex Hilbert transform.
Let 𝕳 be the direct sum
where the first space consists of functions smooth on the closure of Ω and harmonic on Ω; and the second consists of functions smooth on the closure of Ω"c", harmonic on Ω"c" and at ≈. The space 𝕳 is naturally an inner product space with corresponding norm given by
Each element of 𝕳 can be written uniquely as the restriction of the sum of a double layer and single layer potential, provided that the moments are normalized to have 0 integral on ∂Ω. Thus for "f"− ⊕ "f"+ in 𝕳, there are unique φ, ψ in C∞(∂Ω) with integral 0 such that
Under this correspondence
The layer potentials can be identified with their images in 𝕳:
The space of double layer potentials is orthogonal to the space of single layer potentials for the inner product. In fact by Green's theorem
Define an isometric embedding of 𝕳R in L2(C) by
The image lies in A2(Ω) ⊕ A2(Ω"c"), the direct sum of the Bergman spaces of square integrable holomorphic functions on Ω and Ω"c". Since polynomials in "z" are dense in A2(Ω) and polynomials in "z"−1 without constant term are dense in A2(Ω"c"), the image of "U" is dense in A2(Ω) ⊕ A2(Ω"c").
It can be verified directly that for φ, ψ real
In fact for single layer potentials, applying Green's theorem on the domain Ω ∪ Ω"c" with a small closed disk of radius ε removed around a point "w" of the domain, it follows that
since the mean of a harmonic function over a circle is its value at the centre. Using the fact that −1 is the fundamental solution for ∂"w", this can be rewritten as

IBM 421

The IBM 421 accounting machine saw use in the 1960s. It accepted 80-column punch cards and its printing mechanism handled the upper-case letters of the alphabet, the decimal digits 0 to 9, a period (.), and plus and minus signs.
The operation of the 421 was directed by the use of a removable control panel and a carriage tape. By means of the control panel, any column of the card could be wired to any print column, by means of a wire link (the end terminals of which were inserted into slots in the control panel). When the control panel wiring was complete, the control panel was inserted into the guides in the machine, and a hand-operated lever moved the control panel so that the wire links made contact with corresponding terminals in the machine.
Printing speed was about 100 lines per minute. When forming totals, printing was suppressed, and the card reader mechanism read cards at an increased speed of about 150 cards per minute.
There was one type bar for each print column. Each type bar had every character in the available set. When printing a column of a card, the type bar was raised until the desired character was in position at the current line, and then the type bar was hit by a "hammer", thus impressing the character onto the paper. The entire line was printed simultaneously (that is, all hammers struck simultaneously).

Pafman is a clumsy, bungling superhero who is determined to fight evil, even though people probably would be better off without him. The name of the series is an obvious pun with Batman but the two characters have very little in common. The mood of the comic is based on non stopping jokes and for this the author use surreal situations, slapstick, puns, breaking the fourth wall and parodies. There are also influences from manga. A good example of the level of weirdness that the comic could reach up is in the strip titled "El caso de las gafas churrifocales" that begins with a confidant of Pafman being killed by "four hundred masked men with glasses and Mexican hats" (which appear from nowhere) and ends with the hero defeating the villain, an anthropomorphic chair, throwing termites, as he had known the nature of his enemy while reading the script of the story.
Pafman is accompanied by his faithful assistant Pafcat, an anthropomorphic cat coming out of the mutation of a friend of Pafman and a domestic cat (they were stuck in a washing machine along with 1 kg of plutonium) who has the ability to design quirky inventions.
The most frequent villain is "El Enmascarado Negro" ("Black Masqued)", a bandit dressed all in black and with an N on his chest. His face is never seen, as he is always wearing a hood under the other hood. He is able to commit all sorts of evil acts, from stealing the brick of a construction to summon a demon to destroy the planet. In newest strips (2004 onwards) Pafman and Pafcat are also accompanied by Pafman's niece Tina Tonas, a very attractive young cop who seems to have inherited all the intelligence of her family and the Professor Fuyú, an elderly scientist.
Pafman and Pafcat live in Logroño City, a megacity that only resembles the real Logroño in its name, that has a jungle, a beach, a statue with a torch and anything required by the plot of the strip.
The most notable secondary character is Mafrune, who also appears in other strips of the author. At first he was an all-purpose secondary character whose job varied from one comic to other, but since the 1992 strip titled "Pafman policía" his role is fixed as a commissioner who is the boss of the protagonists.
Publication.
The adventures of "Pafman" appeared in 1987 in the magazine "Mortadelo". Initially, the strips were two pages long and later increased to four. Compilations appeared on albums of "Colección Olé". Cera also drew longer strips such as "El doctor Ganyuflo" (20 pages) and another in 1993 titled "El asesino de personajes". In 1996 Ediciones B closed its comic magazines to focus its production of new comics directly in albums of "Mortadelo y Filemón" and "Superlópez" and due to this "Pafman" also disappeared from the market.
In 2004 "Pafman" returned to stores with a new comic published by Ediciones B titled "Pafman redevuelve" in the "Top Cómic" collection. Since then, a new album per year of the character has been published, except in 2012.

Gruner AG

Gruner AG, with headquarters in Basel, is a Swiss engineering services company. It has 19 subsidiaries in Switzerland, Austria, Georgia, Germany, Peru, Portugal, Serbia, Turkey and the Czech Republic. The business activities include project development, general planning and consultancy tasks in building construction and infrastructure development, safety consulting, renovation, project management and controlling. The Gruner Group has about 1000 employees.
History.
It was founded in 1862 by Carl Heinrich Gruner in Basel with a focus on water supply. He specialized in setting up gas stations and urban water utilities. The era of hydraulic engineering was started by Henry Edward Gruner under the name of "Ingenieurbüro Dr. Gruner" in 1898. The next 40 years, the company was almost exclusively involved in the field of hydraulic engineering, hydropower plants and high dams worldwide. In the 1930s, his son, Edward Gruner drafted the idea of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, which he published in 1947 in his essay titled "Journey through the Gotthard Base Tunnel." George Gruner, the grandson of the founder, joined the office in 1938. This marked the onset of civil engineering activities in construction works. In 1942 was the foundation of Ingenieurbüro Dr. HE Gruner + Sohn (Engineering Office). In 1948, the company was renamed to Gebrüder Gruner, following the death of their father, Henry. This was followed by civil engineering work. In 1950, transportation planning was included as a new business area. In 1970, the company was restructured into a corporation (Gruner AG). In 1974 was the establishment of the subsidiary, Gruneko AG (today Gruneko Schweiz AG), which focused on energy economics and covered the areas of facilities engineering and energy installations.
In 1979, Böhringer AG became part of the Gruner Group in the business areas of local and regional civil engineering, utilities and waste management. 1980 witnessed the establishment of the Environmental Division. The companies, Tausky Leu Müller, Heinzelmann AG and Uli Lippuner AG became members of the Gruner Group between 1985 and 1990. In 1992, the subsidiary, Lüem AG was founded. In 1993, Gruner + Partner GmbH was founded in Leipzig. In the year 2000 was the establishment of the General Planning and Safety Divisions. The subsidiary, Tausky Leu Mueller, Bauingenieure AG was renamed to Gruner AG Ingenieure und Planer (Consulting Engineers) in 2001. Frey Strub AG became a subsidiary of Heinzelmann AG in 2001. Heinzelmann AG was renamed to Gruner Ingenieure AG in 2005. Likewise, in 2005, Berchtold + Eicher Bauingenieure AG became a member of the Gruner Group. Roschi + Partner AG, operating in facilities engineering and energy consultancy, was integrated into the Gruner group in 2006. The companies of the Wepf Group were merged with Gruner + Wepf Ingenieure AG, St. Gallen and Gruner + Wepf Ingenieure AG, Zurich in 2008. Similarly, Gruner GmbH was founded in Vienna to increase its presence in Austria. The engineering firm, H. Tanner became a subsidiary of Gruner AG Ingenieure AG in 2009. That same year, Gruner International Ltd. was established to enhance international business. Kiwi Systemingenieure und Berater AG became a member of the Gruner Group in 2011.In 2013 Stucky SA is integrated into the Gruner Group. The two time-honoured companies have historical
links: Alfred Stucky, who founded the engineering company bearing his name in 1926, worked at Gruner in Basel from 1917 to 1923, first as an assistant and later as head engineer and joint partner.

NER Class B1

The NER B and B1 Classes (London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Classes N8 were two classes of 0-6-2 tank locomotives designed by Thomas William Worsdell for heavy freight and mineral on the North Eastern Railway, introduced in 1886. They were tank engine versions of the NER C1 Class 0-6-0, using both simple expansion (Class B1) and also the von Borries configuration for two-cylinder compound locomotives (Class B). Both types were later rebuilt using saturated steam and the compounds were also rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives, and eventually formed a single class (albeit with variations in dimensions). Many of the superheated locomotives were also later returned to saturated steam as their original boilers wore out. As a result the classes have had a very complex history mechanical history.
B1 Class.
The first batch of ten locomotives were built at Darlington Works between June and November 1886. They had Joy valve gear and slide valves. They were originally designated Class B, but after 1888 were designated B1 class to differentiate them from the compound locomotives. They were given numbers which filled gaps in the sequence between 14 and 1165. An eleventh locomotive of the same design (No. 74) was built at Gateshead Railway Works in March 1888 for the purposes of comparison with a compound version built two months earlier (see below under B class).
All of these locomotives were rebuilt (sometimes on more than one occasion) by Wilson Worsdell and/or Vincent Raven between 1893 and 1924. Seven of the eleven were fitted with larger cylinders, Stephenson valve gear and piston valves, raising the weight to . Six out of these seven were also fitted with superheating between 1919 and 1930, raising the weight to , although in two of these cases they were returned to saturated steam in 1941 and 1944.
B Class.
One similar locomotive (No. 9) was constructed at Gateshead in January 1888, but fitted with the Von Borries compounding system. Its performance was tested against another new-built member of the B1 class (No.74) . As a result of these trials a further fifty were ordered., eleven of which were built at Gateshead between October and December 1888, and the remainder at Darlington between December 188 and May 1890. They were given numbers which filled gaps in the sequence between 136 and 1168.
All of these locomotives were rebuilt (sometimes on more than one occasion) by Wilson Worsdell and/or Vincent Raven between 1904 and 1911, when they were returned to simple locomotives and reclassified B1. Some members of the class retained their original cylinders and Joy valve gear, whilst other were fitted with larger cylinders, or cylinders with Stephenson valve gear and piston valves. As with the other members of the B1 class many of the locomotives were with superheating between 1916 and 1927, although in several cases they were returned to saturated steam between 1941 and 1950.
All members of the B and B1 classes were reclassified as one single class N8 by the LNER (despite the variations in dimensions and valve gear. They were withdrawn between 1929 and 1956.

Locally acyclic morphism

In algebraic geometry, a morphism formula_1 of schemes is said to be locally acyclic if, roughly, any sheaf on "S" and its restriction to "X" through "f" have the same étale cohomology, locally. For example, a smooth morphism is universally locally acyclic.

2012–13 Primera Divisió

The 2012–13 Primera Divisió is the eighteenth season of top-tier football in Andorra. It began in September 2012 and ended in April 2013. The defending champions are FC Lusitanos, who won their first championship in the previous season. The title was retained by Lusitanos.
Competition format.
The participating teams first played a conventional round-robin schedule with every team playing each opponent once "home" and once "away" (in actuality, the designation of home and away was purely arbitrary as the clubs did not have their own grounds) for a total of 14 games. The league was then split up in two groups of four teams with each of them playing teams within their group in a home-and-away cycle of games. The top four teams competed for the championship. The bottom four clubs played for one direct relegation spot and one relegation play-off spot. Records earned in the First Round were taken over to the respective Second Rounds.
Promotion and relegation from 2011–12.
FC Rànger's were relegated after last season due to finishing in 8th place. They were replaced by Segona Divisió champions FC Encamp.
Inter Club d'Escaldes, who finished last season in 7th place, and 2nd place Segona Divisió club UE Extremenya played a two-legged relegation play-off. Inter Club d'Escaldes won the playoff, 3–0 on aggregate, and remained in the Primera Divisió while Extremenya remained in the Segona Divisió.
Relegation play-offs.
The seventh-placed club in the league competed in a two-legged relegation play-off against the runners-up of the 2012–13 Segona Divisió, for one spot in 2013–14 Primera Divisió.

Rangers F.C. supporters

Rangers Football Club, are a Scottish association football club based in the city of Glasgow. Rangers have developed a strong following since their formation in 1872. The clubs fans are often known as Bluenoses, or The Bears, derived from the team's nickname, the Teddy Bears.
Numerous fan magazines, blogs and supporters' websites are dedicated to the club and the fans have a famous long-standing rivalry with Celtic, the two Glasgow giants collectively known as "The Old Firm".
Rangers supporters have traditionally been identified with the Protestant and Unionist community in Scotland, as well as in Northern Ireland. The club has a global fan-base, with a worldwide spread of over 600 supporters clubs ranging from North America, Australasia and the Middle East to those closer to home in the United Kingdom. In season 2012–13, Rangers recorded the 18th highest average league attendance in Europe. Rangers is one of the best-supported clubs in the UK with an estimated 1.4 million supporters in Scotland alone. Rangers have an estimated worldwide fanbase in excess of 5.5 million supporters.
Fanbase and attendances.
Rangers, along with Old Firm rivals Celtic, have the largest support base of all the clubs in Scotland. The club's average attendance is consistently one of the highest in Europe, the figure of 45,750 for the domestic league Season 2012–13 being the 18th highest across the continent.
Record attendances.
Rangers fans have contributed to a number of records for massive attendances, most notably the highest home attendance for a British league fixture, 118,567 on 2 January 1939. Ibrox Park hosted numerous crowds of over 100,000 during the 1950s and 1960s, prior to reconstruction following the Ibrox disaster. Rangers supporters also hold records for the highest attendance at a friendly fixture, 104,679, set at Hampden Park in 1961 vs Eintracht Frankfurt, as well as the largest crowd to watch a non-Cup final fixture, 143,570 for a Scottish Cup semi-final vs. Hibernian in 1948. Rangers hold the world record for a 4th tier match with an attendance of 50,048 against Berwick Rangers during the 2012/13 season.
2008 Uefa Cup final.
In 2008, an estimated 300,000 Rangers supporters travelled to Manchester for the UEFA Cup Final, at the time this was said to have been the largest movement of people within the United Kingdom since the end of World War II. Despite the vast majority of supporters behaving impeccably, a small minority of fans rioted in the city centre, clashing with police and damaging property.
Songs and chants.
Anthems.
Rangers fans song of choice and most commonly sung is a rendition of Follow Follow, this is also the clubs official anthem and is played before every home match at Ibrox Stadium. Other anthems played at home matches include Penny Arcade by Roy Orbison and Simply the Best by Tina Turner which is played as the teams come onto the pitch. Rangers adopted this anthem after the club won 9 titles in a row in the 1990s and Rangers supporters started a campaign that got the song into the top 10 of the UK singles chart in 2006 to commemorate the clubs 53rd title win.
Fans songs and chants.
Songs frequently chanted by Rangers fans include The Bouncy, a chant which involves bouncing up and down on the spot chanting the word "Bouncy" or "Lets all do the bouncy" over and over again; Derry's Walls, a song commemorating the historic siege of Derry in 1689; and Every Other Saturday's My Half Day Off a song written in the 1960s and originating from an era where Rangers supporters finished work on a Saturday morning, a lot from the River Clyde shipyards, and headed to Ibrox for the afternoon fixture.
Rivalries.
Old Firm Derby.
The club's most distinct rivalry is with Glasgow neighbours Celtic; the two clubs are collectively known as the Old Firm. Rangers' traditional support is largely drawn from the Protestant Unionist community, whilst Celtic's traditional support is largely drawn from the Catholic republican community. The first Old Firm match was won by Celtic and there have been nearly four hundred matches played to date. The Old Firm rivalry has fuelled many assaults, sometimes leading to deaths, on Old Firm derby days; an activist group that monitors sectarian activity in Glasgow has reported that on Old Firm weekends, admissions to hospital emergency rooms have increased over normal levels and journalist Franklin Foer noted that in the period from 1996 to 2003, eight deaths in Glasgow were directly linked to Old Firm matches, as well as hundreds of assaults.
Aberdeen.
The rivalry with Aberdeen began in the late 1970s when the two clubs were among the strongest in Scotland. Relations between fans were further soured during a league match on 8 October 1988, when Aberdeen player Neil Simpson's tackle on Rangers' Ian Durrant resulted in Durrant being injured for two years. Resentment continued and in 1998 an article in Rangers pre-match programme branded Aberdeen fans "scum". Rangers stated that they had "issued a full and unreserved apology" to Aberdeen and their supporters, and this was accepted by Aberdeen. In another incident, then Rangers captain Richard Gough accused Aberdeen of only playing when it was against Rangers. This further increased the hostility between supporters of both clubs, which has continued.
Issues with sectarianism.
Sectarian chanting by supporters has incurred criticism and sanctions upon the club. In 1999, the vice-chairman of The Rangers Football Club Plc, Donald Findlay, resigned after being filmed singing songs regarded as sectarian during a supporters club event. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body have punished Rangers for incidents during European ties, most notably Villareal CF in 2006, Osasuna in 2007, and PSV Eindhoven in 2011.
Rangers partnered with Celtic to form the 'Old Firm Alliance', an initiative aimed at educating children from across Glasgow about issues like healthy eating and fitness, as well as awareness of anti-social behaviour, sectarianism and racism. The club's 'Follow With Pride' campaign was launched in 2007 to improve the club's image and build on previous anti-racist, anti-sectarian campaigns. William Gallard, UEFA's Director of Communications, commended the SFA and Scottish clubs, including Rangers, for their actions in fighting discrimination. In September 2007, UEFA praised Rangers for the measures the club has taken against sectarianism.

Yellow Air Cab Company

Yellow Air Cab Company was a short lived American aircraft manufacturer based in Kansas.
The Yellow Air Cab Company was chartered on 27 May 1929. It was based in a hangar built from 1928-1929; previously occupied by the Knoll Aircraft Company in Wichita, Kansas. Stock was issued in August 1929. The company entered into an agreement that October to purchase 200 all-metal Buckley LC-4s designed with William Bushnell Stout at the same airport in an attempt to build aircraft for an air-taxi service and franchise through the Midwest. The company also bought the rights to the Hilton Super Mid-Wing in January 1930. The prototype crashed in February 1930 when a stabilizer broke off in flight, killing company pilot Shannon. Another stock sale followed shortly after the crash. In all cases, the company did not put these aircraft into profitable revenue service. The company remained optimistic, and purchased the remainder of the Knoll Aircraft company, the facilities, and the airport it resided on for $166,000 and issued more stock in June 1930. The location became the home of Straughn Aircraft Company until 1934, and Beechcraft plant number two in 1940, where the Beechcraft Staggerwings, and later Beechcraft Bonanza production took place.

Wallenberg (opera)

Wallenberg is an opera by the Estonian composer Erkki-Sven Tüür to a libretto by Lutz Hübner. The plot is developed from events in Raoul Wallenberg's personal life. The opera premiered at the Opernhaus Dortmund on May 5, 2001. It premiered at the Estonian National Opera on June 1, 2007, directed by Dmitry Bertman.
Synopsis.
Act 1.
1. Prologue. Nameless Voices asked questions — after Wallenberg's deeds and his fate: "Do we doing honour a living person or a dead person?"
2. The Conference I.
Sweden in 1944. A reception. Three guests whispering about the professional misses of the young Wallenberg. But three diplomats give his life new meaning. You go to entrust your with the mission to Hungary, to save "as many Jews as possible". The warnings of a lady, not to be exploited for foreign targets, can not stop Wallenberg. After initial hesitation, he accepts the order.
3. Railway Station I.
Hungary 1944. Wallenberg must helplessly watch as running a German officers and his men the order of the Nazi regime, "thousands of Jews every day ..."
4. The Plan I
Wallenberg takes a promising tactic: Swedish protective passports "Will make Jews like Sweden" and keep them from being deported.
5. Railway Station II
Wallenberg again meets the German officer. He manages to rescue some people from the brutality of the Nazis "Passport hits gun"
6. The rescued.
A group of saved of Wallenberg shows for the fragility of their destiny in mind: "Life is not be more than dead." Wallenberg realizes that there is every life is individual and very expensive.
7. The Plan II
Wallenberg is struggling with self-reproach: "Not enough! I not act enough!" He decides to face the evil.
8. Eichmann I.
Wallenberg met Adolf Eichmann. He confronted him with the goal of his saving deeds. But Eichmann was a bureaucrat and behaves like a gentleman. With relish, he shows the Wallenberg's limits of its possibilities in mind. And even the diplomats start to doubt the mission of Wallenberg. The time he runs away.
9. Station III.
Wallenberg throws himself into the work. But an encounter with a woman he has rescued leaves him utterly disappointed in the meaning of his deeds. She returns her protective passport to Wallenberg — so unbearably she feels the guilt to have survived "by chance".
10. The Plan III.
Wallenberg gets in panics about the immensity of his task. Once again, he encounters a woman who advises him to pause and reflect on itself.
11. The death march.
Hungary, January, 1945 — "And He made me pass by them round about, and lo! they were exceedingly many on the surface of the valley, and lo! they were exceedingly dry." Old testament, Book of Ezekiel (37, 2).
The last time Eichmann demonstrates his superiority. The war ended. Wallberg hopes for a fresh start. But at the moment of the freeing appear two Russian soldiers. They summon Raoul Wallenberg for the questioning ...
Act 2.
12. SMERSH.
Moscow, 1945.
Wallenberg has got into the clutches of SMERSH, the Russian counter-intelligence. He is held prisoner in the infamous Moscow state prison Lubjanka. Two Russian officers denied knowing the whereabouts of Wallenberg: "We do not have him!"
13. The Conference II
Three diplomats visited Wallenberg. But instead of freeing him, they tell him about his new mission: "Only half of the war is now won". As a hero he was caught in the Cold War and more useful than a free man.
14. Gulag I.
Kolyma, uncertain time.
Wallenberg is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Meanwhile, the inmates of the Gulag tell each other about their fate and the arbitrariness of the judicial authorities. There are circulating rumors contradictory: "The Swede is alive. The Swede is dead."
15. Gulag II
Three Gulag prisoners believes Wallenberg recognizable as one of their fellow prisoners. His survival also maintains their hope. But Wallenberg not remember — neither of his time in the camp, even to his own identity. "There is a hole in my head". The other prisoners reacted with aggression to Wallenberg refusal to accept his role as savior.
Intermezzo.
Traces of Wallenberg are erased.
16. The struggle.
From Nothing appears Wallenberg 2, a masterful bugbear of the acts complained of Wallenberg, "I'm your hero, you will not get rid of me."
17. Eichmann II
Eichmann is preparing for the penalty. For the last time he taunted Wallenberg: While he was a "clean finish" would be granted, would fail a saving Wallenberg's death. Eichmann is hanged.
18. The conference III.
Wallenberg hopes explanations to find about his destiny with three diplomats. But these dismiss his doubts about the sense of the history as "child questions". Wallenberg silent. But his "For which?" does not remain in entirety unanswered. Two survivors remembers their rescue.
19. Wallenberg circus.
Future generations takes the heritage of Raoul Wallenberg. The public sings praises heroism. And Ronald Reagan appointed him an honorary citizen of the United States. Wallenberg 2 takes the honors of the crowd with pride: "No trace of a doubt!"
The voice of a woman remembers the dead.

Aldeburgh Music

Aldeburgh Music is a registered charity delivering music performance, artist development and education, located in converted Victorian malting buildings on the edge of the River Alde in the village of Snape, Suffolk. Originally founded by Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and Eric Crozier in 1947 as an organisation to present the first Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts in 1948, Aldeburgh Music today carries on the founders' aim of presenting a world-class music programme with its roots in the local community and artist development at its heart, in the inspirational setting of the Suffolk coast.
Each year Aldeburgh Music promotes the Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts, the Snape Proms, concert series at Easter and October, together with a year-round performance programme at Snape Maltings Concert Hall and other venues on the Snape site. The Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme – formerly known as the Britten–Pears School of Advanced Musical Studies - provides development opportunities for musicians early in their professional lives, between the ages of 18 and 25. Aldeburgh Young Musicians offers a programme of music mentoring for children from 8 to 18, who are of exceptional potential. Aldeburgh Education offers an annual programme of work involving the wider community, while Aldeburgh Residencies provides opportunities for established artists to develop their creative talents.
History.
While touring with the English Opera Group in Europe in 1947, the composer Benjamin Britten, tenor Peter Pears and producer Eric Crozier developed the idea of a music festival in Aldeburgh, where Britten had a house on Crag Path. An executive committee was formed under the chairmanship of the Countess of Cranbrook and the first meeting took place at Thelluson Lodge, Aldeburgh on 27 October 1947. The first Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts was held from 5 to 12 June 1948 under the Artistic Direction of Britten, Pears and Crozier, with the Earl of Harewood as President and Elizabeth Sweeting as General Manager. 
Needing to expand the Festival into larger premises, in 1967, the Festival management acquired a lease on disused Victorian buildings at Snape Maltings, and converted the largest of the redundant malthouses into Snape Maltings Concert Hall. The Snape Maltings Foundation Ltd was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee, no. 980281, on 21 May 1970 under the name of Snape Maltings Foundation Ltd. to manage the Snape buildings and develop further buildings on the site. The initial subscribers were Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears, Imogen Holst, Fidelity, Countess of Cranbrook, Marion, Countess of Harewood, Charles Gifford and The Lord Goodman. The company was registered with the Charity Commission as the Aldeburgh Foundation, registration number 261383, on 23 July 1970. The company changed its name to Aldeburgh Festival–Snape Maltings Foundation Ltd (known as AF-SMF) on 7 September 1976, and to Aldeburgh Foundation on 12 October 1983. In November 1997, the name of the company was changed to Aldeburgh Productions, and in July 2006 to its current name of Aldeburgh Music.
Background and ethos.
Following its successful launch in 1948, the Aldeburgh Festival expanded year by year until it outgrew the available venues in the town. When redundant malting buildings in Snape became available in 1965, an initial 25-year lease was taken on the largest of the Victorian malthouses, and it was converted by Arup Associates (architects and engineers) and Wm. C. Reade (builders) into Snape Maltings Concert Hall. The 820-seat Hall was opened by HM The Queen on 2 June 1967. From that date, the main events of the annual Festival were re-located to Snape. A major fire in 1969 led to the re-development of the site, re-opening the following year, and gradually what was once a Concert Hall for a three-week Festival, became a year-round venue, including the introduction in the 1980s of the annual Snape Proms.
From the very beginning, part of the artistic vision of the original directors had been the development of young musical talent. As early as 1953, Britten and Pears, committed to the musical development of young people, formed the idea of having a school of music at Snape. The fundamental concept was “to prepare and promote young singers or string players for professional life at the very highest level.” It took until September 1972 for the first masterclasses to be given, by Pears, and in 1975 a Snape Maltings Training Orchestra rehearsed and performed at the Hall for the first time. Following the death of Britten in 1976, the Benjamin Britten Memorial Appeal was launched, and the barley store adjacent to the Concert Hall was converted by Arup Associates into the Britten–Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies. Opened on 28 April 1979 by the patron of the Aldeburgh Foundation, HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the School incorporated a 120-seat recital room (today named the Peter Pears Recital Room), a top-floor Seminar Room, with many practice rooms in between and a reference library, the Holst Library.
The aim remains to bridge formal musical education and the professional life, exposing developing artists in a safe and nurturing environment to the skills and talents of world-class artists and teachers. Over the years, such leading artists as Dame Joan Sutherland, Ann Murray, Sir Thomas Allen, Galina Vishnevskaya, Murray Perahia, Sir Charles McKerras, Elisabeth Söderström and Dawn Upshaw as well as Pears himself have been notable teachers, while its many alumni have included Thomas Adès, Ian Bostridge, Simon Keenlyside and Dame Felicity Lott.
From the beginning, the Festival was committed to working with and for its local community, breaking down the barriers between amateur and professional. Education and working with young people always featured, and this continues today with Aldeburgh Education involving the local community as creators and performers as well as audiences. The department now runs 3 year-round programmes and in 2011/12 delivered 432 sessions, with over 15,000 participants, over 17,000 audience members and 147 artists. In 2012 the annual Celebration of Schools’ Music, presented in association with Suffolk County Council, celebrated its 25th year at Snape Maltings Concert Hall.
Aldeburgh Residencies was launched in 2003 to offer bespoke development opportunities to established artists. The Residencies enable individuals and ensembles to come to Snape to create new work, develop new partnerships and explore new possibilities.
Aldeburgh Young Musicians is a Centre for Advanced Training (CAT), created in 2007 with funding from the government to provide advanced music mentoring for exceptionally talented young musicians aged between 8 and 18 based in the Eastern Region.
The growth of the work of Aldeburgh Music led to the need for more accommodation, and further semi-derelict buildings adjacent to the Concert Hall on the Snape Maltings site were acquired in 2006 on a 999-year lease, and the Aldeburgh Music Development Plan launched to raise the money necessary for their conversion. Following a successful £16 million fund-raising campaign, a new Creative Campus was opened in May 2009, designed by architects Haworth Tompkins. The Hoffmann Building contains the Britten Studio (capacity 340), the Jerwood Kiln Studio (capacity 80) and a number of rehearsal spaces. The Britten–Pears Building has been redeveloped and now incorporates the Trask Artists’ Cafe. A small studio has been created out of the derelict Victorian Dovecote. In Aldeburgh, the Pumphouse, Aldeburgh Music’s small alternative venue, has been redeveloped.
Aldeburgh Music Today.
The Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts remains at the core of Aldeburgh Music’s annual programme. The current Artistic Director of the Aldeburgh Festival is Pierre-Laurent Aimard.
Traditionally starting on the second Friday in June and running for 17 days, events are presented not only in the various venues at Snape Maltings, but in all the traditional Festival venues such as Aldeburgh Parish Church, Orford Church, Blythburgh Church and the Festival’s original home, Aldeburgh’s Jubilee Hall. Site-specific events have taken place elsewhere, such as Sizewell Beach (Everlasting Night, 2011), Leiston Long Shop Museum (Before Life and After, 2012), RAF Bentwaters Airbase (Faster than Sound), and community events on the beach. In 2012 there were 74 events in the main festival, with a further 24 events at The Pumphouse. The Pumphouse, situated off the marshes on the outskirts of the town, provides an informal, alternative performance venue. 
Although Britten’s work always features in the Festival – and played a large role in 2013, his centenary year – it by no means dominates the programme, which continues to commission and present new work from contemporary composers, as well as exploring themes across many genres. In 2012, the Festival’s Artist in Residence was composer-conductor Oliver Knussen, a former Artistic Director of the Festival, and featured works by Helmut Lachenmann. Previous contemporary composers to be examined in depth in recent festivals include György Ligeti and Marco Stroppa (2011), George Benjamin and Pierre Boulez (2010), Harrison Birtwistle and Elliott Carter (2009) and György Kurtág (2008).
Festivals also include work by the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme, including Britten–Pears Alumni. A programme of fringe events takes place at The Pumphouse in Aldeburgh.
Snape Proms.
The Snape Proms take place throughout August each year in the Concert Hall. Some seats in the main block are removed, and audiences sit on cushions on the floor. With a different concert each evening throughout the month, the Proms present an eclectic range of music, including classical, jazz, folk and world music, and incorporate comedy and poetry.
Easter Festival.
An Easter Festival is mounted each year, together with an autumn weekend generally themed around the work of Benjamin Britten. The autumn of 2012 sees the start of a year-long celebration of Britten’s centenary, and will feature Britten’s arrangement of Poulenc’s Les Mamelles de Tirésias, believed not to have been performed since its premiere at the 1958 Aldeburgh Festival. Other concerts are programmed throughout the year, which may be programmes emerging from one of the strands of activity such as the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme or an Aldeburgh residency, or Faster than Sound. English Touring Opera is a regular visitor. In the spirit of Britten’s embracing of local amateur music making, community groups are invited to hire the Concert Hall for their own performances, and the Hall is regularly booked by such local groups as Aldeburgh Music Club Choir, Woodbridge Choral Society and the Co-op Juniors. Aldeburgh Music also runs its own choir, Aldeburgh Voices, under the direction of Ben Parry.
Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme.
Since the very first course in 1972, over 10,000 young artists have attended what started as the Britten–Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, and is now called the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme. The programme aims to bridge the gap between conservatoires and professional life, offering unique development and performance opportunities to young musicians. Many have gone on to become leading musicians in their own right. Masterclasses for singers, ensembles, instrumentalists and composers are held from March until October. There are also opportunities for emerging young professional musicians to work with leading conductors, soloists and orchestral principals in both the Britten–Pears Orchestra and the Britten–Pears Baroque Orchestra. Many of the masterclasses are open to the public, and each course culminates in a public performance, including at the Aldeburgh Festival and Snape Proms. Auditions are held across the world, now using modern technology to access countries on the other side of the globe. In 2012, the Britten-Pears Orchestra was conducted by Antonello Manacorda, performing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony at Snape Maltings Concert Hall at Easter. Previous conductors of the BPO include Edward Gardner, Oliver Knussen, Kirill Karabits, Vasily Petrenko and Robin Ticciati. The Britten–Pears Baroque Orchestra, formed in 1992, is formed each year to work on baroque repertoire, and previous tutors have included period specialists Richard Egarr, Emmanuelle Haïm, Laurence Cummings, Andreas Scholl and Harry Bicket. They presented Rameau’s Naïs as part of the 2012 Snape Proms under Christophe Rousset. In 2012, as part of the Cultural Olympiad, the Aldeburgh World Orchestra was formed, conducted by Sir Mark Elder. Young musicians from across the globe submitted their auditions on YouTube, and an international ensemble of around 124 young musicians came to Suffolk to train and perform both in the Concert Hall in Snape and as part of the BBC Promenade Concert season at the Royal Albert Hall, as well as on a short European tour.
In 2012, Aldeburgh Strings have been created to perform under the baton of Markus Däurnet at the 2012 Britten Weekend, when the programme will include Britten’s Prelude and Fugue, Lachrymae and In memoriam Dennis Brain.
Singers are auditioned for song recital courses, and recent courses have included American and French song with Dawn Upshaw. Singers and orchestra come together to perform opera; recent productions have included Death in Venice and Albert Herring, and in the autumn of 2012 soloists from the programme will be singing Poulenc’s "Les Mamelles de Tiresias" in Britten’s arrangement. At Easter 2012, the programme will present Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas under the direction of Christian Curnyn.
Each year there is a digital media course, called New Music/New Media. In September 2012, the course is led by Rolf Wallin, Tansy Davies, and Alexander Refsum Jensenius, co-founder of the Oslo Laptop Orchestra. String quartets come together each spring and present a weekly recital of “work-in-progress” at the Jubilee Hall, and in late summer the International Academy of String Quartets provides further opportunities for working on repertoire. Menahem Pressler, Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the Arditti Quartet have all taught masterclasses.
Aldeburgh Residencies.
Aldeburgh Residencies are designed to provide a unique opportunity for established musicians and other artists to experiment, take risks, develop new skills and recharge creative batteries. It is intended for the development of specific creative projects, each generally lasting for a week – longer, sometimes, in the case of composers. 
Groups or individuals are generally funded by Aldeburgh Music for their accommodation, food and travel, and are expected to allow some public access to the work being undertaken. This may be in the form of an informal Open Session performance, but may also be a full performance in an upcoming Aldeburgh Festival or concert series. Residencies are supported by the John Ellerman Foundation.
Recent artists to benefit from an Aldeburgh Residency include Mark Padmore, Gwyneth Herbert, Netia Jones and Pippa Nissen, I Fagiolini, Exaudi, Alex Wilson (working on a new collaboration with two Malian musicians, preparing for a tour and new CD), the Aurora Orchestra, Mitsuko Uchida and Katie Mitchell.
A particular strand of Aldeburgh Residencies entitled the Composer Residency Scheme enables three composers each year to spend three weeks working on individual new projects. Amongst the composers and librettists participating in this programme have been Anna Meredith, Larry Groves, Simon Limbrick, Mark Ravenhill and Conor Mitchell, Man Fang, Tansy Davies, Christian Mason and Charlotte Bray.
James Boyd developed a programme entitled Sea Change during an Aldeburgh Residency, inspiring new repertoire for guitar and voice by Elspeth Brooke and Jonathan Dove, presented at the 2012 Aldeburgh Festival. Other work developed during Aldeburgh Residencies performed at the 2012 Festival included a programme entitled European Connections, including a new work for voice and piano trio by Vasco Mendonça.
Aldeburgh Alumni.
Aldeburgh Alumni is a network of artists including past participants in the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme. Each year, Alumni are given showcases at the Aldeburgh Festival, and as part of an exchange programme, at the Festival of Aix-en-Provence.
Jerwood Opera Writing Programme.
The Jerwood Opera Writing Programme develops new work in the field of opera. The first Jerwood Opera Writing Foundation, led by Artistic Advisor Giorgio Battistelli and a distinguished faculty of experienced practitioners, featured three week-long workshops in March, July and October 2007. Ten of the participants were composers, mostly at the start of a professional career but with little or no experience in writing opera, while the remaining participants were a mix of poets, playwrights and directors with an interest in, but no experience at that stage of, writing libretti. In 2010, the second Jerwood Opera Writing Foundation course began, involving composers, writers and directors both in the UK and worldwide. The participants, twenty composers, writers and directors, took part in three week-long workshop-led courses at Snape Maltings in November 2010, March and July 2011. The workshops mixed practical exercises, theory and discussion, with contributions from teachers including Harrison Birtwistle, Stephen Langridge, Stephen Plaice, David Sawer, Lavinia Greenlaw, Jonathan Dove and Orlando Gough amongst others, and culminated in performances of mini music-theatre works created by the twenty participants.
At the end of November 2011, Aldeburgh Music invited applications for Jerwood Opera Writing Fellowships from composers and writers and their collaborators who wanted to develop a particular opera project for commission and performance. Fellowships were to give support during the development of a new opera by providing a collaborative, supportive environment, as well as financial and practical support and expertise, such as workshops and mentoring. Over sixty applications were submitted from countries worldwide and the following four proposals were each awarded a Jerwood Opera Writing Fellowship: "Knots and Do-Nots" – composer Sasha Siem and director Ted Huffman; "Pleasure" – composer Mark Simpson and writer Melanie Challenger; "Thanatophobia" – composer Joanna Lee and writer Hannah Silva; and "Beyond the Pale" – composer Benjamin Scheuer, writer Tom Swift and director Tom Creed.
Aldeburgh Education.
The work of Aldeburgh Education has developed far beyond just working with schools and colleges, to encompass high quality creative and performance projects for the whole community, working throughout Suffolk and beyond and including work with juvenile offenders at HMP and YOI Warren Hill. Aldeburgh Education has been at the forefront of engaging young people and artists in music and media projects, developing personal, social, artistic and creative skills, using modern technology to engage with youngsters of all abilities and from all backgrounds. Over 8,000 young people participate in Education projects each year. The latest initiative is Group A, a non-audition choir for young people of between the ages of 13 and 18, and The Big Shout, an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to sing. Aldeburgh Education also devises training in participatory settings for artists at all levels. 
Aldeburgh Education has been working with Suffolk County Council since 1987, and has been a lead partner in the Suffolk Music Education Hub since 2012. It has worked with HM YOI Warren Hill since 1999, and with Lapwing, an organisation providing individual learning programmes for young people who have complex barriers to learning, since 2009, as well as with a variety of local and national arts organizations around the UK and beyond including the development of audio/visual interactive media.
Aldeburgh Education has been given the following Awards:
Aldeburgh Young Musicians.
Aldeburgh Young Musicians (AYM) was created to fill the perceived gap in Aldeburgh Music’s engagement with the musical development of younger people. Funded by the Department of Education, each of 45 young musicians between the ages of 8 and 18 has a tailored, individual learning programme, which co-ordinates individual lessons, intensive weekends and residential holiday courses, expert professional advice, mentoring and performance opportunities . Individual students are matched to tutors for additional tuition which can be done on-line. AYM works in partnership with Suffolk County Council Music Service, Pro Corda, Junior Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Purcell School.
In 2011/12, new strands have been added to the Aldeburgh Young Musicians programme: AYM Apprentices for younger students who have shown musical talent and potential but need further musical support and development before joining the main scheme; AYM Open House providing the opportunity to Aldeburgh Young Musicians to use rehearsal facilities with other AYMs, provide a venue for individual lessons or master-classes, a private practice space and specialist coaching days; and AYM Exchanging Worlds Ensemble, launched for the Cultural Olympiad 2012. This commissioning group is cross cultural and cross genre in content, working collaboratively and exchanging global musical conversations. Connected to the Aldeburgh World Orchestra and Cultural Olympiad, two AYM composers were commissioned to create a new fanfare to be performed by the Aldeburgh World Orchestra brass section for the Olympic Torch Relay, performed when the Relay travelled to Aldeburgh and Ipswich on 5 July 2012 . AYM projects for 2012 include an exploration of the musical world of 1912 with Charlotte Bray.
Faster than Sound.
Faster than Sound is a strand of activity, supported by the Paul Hamlyn and Esmée Fairbairn Foundations, exploring connections between traditional music and new media, developing new collaborations between experimental musicians from different backgrounds, including electronic and classical. Starting in 2006 with performances in disused hangars at RAF Bentwaters, Faster than Sound, co-produced with Joana Seguro from Lumin, is now based in the Hoffmann Building at Snape Maltings. Since 2009, there have been five week-long residencies each year, culminating in a performance. Recent presentations include I Burn for You, a new music theatre piece based on Dracula, by Ian Wilson (composer) and Tom Creed (director); Symmetry with Marcus du Sautoy and Fall Back connecting the legacy of Dubstep with some of the earliest experiments in electronic music and projection. During the 2012 Aldeburgh Festival, choral ensemble EXAUDI teamed up with sound artist Bill Thompson and students from the University of East Anglia and presented a promenade performance in the Hoffmann Building of John Cage’s Song Books. Other Faster than Sound projects in 2012 include Star-shaped Biscuit, text and music by David Toop, which will be performed in one of the remaining semi-derelict buildings at Snape Maltings. Later in 2012, composer Richard Baker and sound artist Brian Duffy collaborate on a new work exploring the hidden voices of electronic toys and toy instruments in combination with a small chamber ensemble.
TEDx Aldeburgh.
TED is a US-led non-profit organisation devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It brings together in international conferences, people from the worlds of Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED), with the mission of “spreading ideas”. The TEDx programme allows organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at a local level.
Aldeburgh Music hosted the inaugural TEDx Aldeburgh Conference on November 6, 2010. Hosted by the TED music director Thomas Dolby and produced by Joana Seguro as an opportunity of having in one place great minds and explorers of contemporary music, the event featured talks by David Toop, Tod Machover, Martyn Ware, William Orbit, Tim Exile, Imogen Heap, Ash Nehru of United Visual Artists. In addition, there were TED talk videos from David Byrne, Itay Talgam, Evelyn Glennie and Benjamin Zander. The gathering of people and ideas coincided with Aldeburgh’s New Music New Media course for emerging professional composers and musicians, led by Tod Machover. The second conference was held on 5 November 2011 when the speakers included Vincent Walsh, Peter Gregson, Kingslee Daly, Jennifer Stumm, Nitin Sawhney, Kathy Hinde and the Modified Toy Orchestra.
Visual Arts: SNAP.
The Aldeburgh Festival has always included the visual arts as well as music, and a number of exhibitions are curated each year to accompany the music programme. From 2011, the main exhibition of contemporary art has been promoted under the title SNAP, at various locations around the Snape Maltings site, organized by Abigail Lane. In 2012, featured artists included Glenn Brown, May Cornet, Brian Eno, Ryan Gander, Maggi Hambling, Mark Limbrick, Emily Richardson and Gavin Turk.
Aldeburgh Music is also responsible for running the Peter Pears Gallery in Aldeburgh and the Pond Gallery at Snape Maltings. For most of the year these galleries are hired out to local artists, but provide the space for Aldeburgh Music-curated exhibitions during the Aldeburgh Festival.
People.
The first Artistic Directors of the Aldeburgh Festival were Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and Eric Crozier. Britten and Pears remained Artistic Directors until their respective deaths, in 1976 and 1986. After Britten died, the artistic direction of the Festival was shared; many world-class musicians joined the artistic team, including at various times Philip Ledger, Colin Graham, Steuart Bedford, Mstislav Rostropovich, Murray Perahia, Simon Rattle, John Shirley-Quirk and Oliver Knussen. In 1999, a sole Artistic Director in the Britten mould – composer, solo performer, accompanist and conductor – was appointed in Thomas Adès, joined in 2004 by composer John Woolrich, first as Guest Artistic Director then as an Associate Artistic Director. Adès had first appeared at an Aldeburgh Festival as a member of the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme on the New Music course in 1992. Adès was succeeded by Pierre-Laurent Aimard in 2009, again supported by John Woolrich. Oliver Knussen returned for the 2012 Festival as Artist in Residence.
Many of the world’s leading musicians, ensembles and orchestras have appeared at the Aldeburgh Festival over the years.
Chief executive of Aldeburgh Music since 1998 has been Jonathan Reekie. The current Chairman of the Aldeburgh Music Council is Simon Robey. The President of Aldeburgh Music is the Lord Stevenson of Coddenham CBE, Aldeburgh Music Chairman from 2000 to 2012.
Music.
The Britten–Pears Library holds an archive of programmes dating back to 1948. 
Aldeburgh Music has commissioned and presented many world premieres over the years, starting with many of Britten’s own compositions from 1948.
A selection of composers whose works have been premiered by Aldeburgh Music include Thomas Adès, Gerald Barry, Richard Rodney Bennett, Harrison Birtwistle, Elliott Carter, Jonathan Dove, Deirdre Gribbin, Oliver Knussen, György Kurtág, Nicola LeFanu, Colin Matthews, Thea Musgrave, Dmitri Shostakovich and John Tavener.
Facilities.
Aldeburgh Music is based at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Snape, Saxmundham, Suffolk. It now has a 999-year lease, negotiated with the overall site owners, Johnny and Alesha Gooderham, in 2006, on all its facilities at Snape Maltings.
Snape Maltings Concert Hall is an 830-seat international concert hall, converted from a redundant Victorian malthouse in 1967. The Concert Hall incorporates a Restaurant and the Oyster Bar, and displays exhibitions in the Concert Hall Gallery. A Visitor Centre off the main foyer houses the Box Office, an information point and a shop.
The Hoffmann Building, converted from semi-derelict malting and storage buildings adjacent to the Concert Hall, was opened in 2009 and houses the Britten Studio (340 capacity), the Jerwood Kiln Studio (80 capacity), the Foyle and the Weinrebe Studios, as well as office and circulation space.
The Britten-Pears Building was converted from an old barley store in 1979 to create the Britten–Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, now renamed the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme. The building contains the Peter Pears Recital Room (120 capacity) and a number of practice and seminar rooms, and the Holst Library. Adjacent is the Trask Artists' Cafe.
The Pond Gallery is a small art gallery, let to local artists, and adjacent is a long room currently known as Building 19, awaiting further development.
In Aldeburgh itself, Aldeburgh Music has a full-time Box Office on the High Street, and runs the Peter Pears Gallery and The Pumphouse. During the Festival, performances are presented at the Jubilee Hall and the Aldeburgh Parish Church, as well as other venues around Suffolk including the churches of Orford and Blythburgh. Site-specific events have been held in a number of locations, including Aldeburgh and Sizewell beaches, Bentwaters Airbase, and Leiston Long Shop Museum.

Ilkley Golf Club

Ilkley Golf Club is a golf club in Ilkley in West Yorkshire, England. It is located about a mile to the northwest of Ilkley and southeast of Addingham. The River Wharfe flows past the course. It was established in 1890 and is ranked as the 6th best golf course in the county by the website Top 100 Golf Courses.
History.
Ilkley is the oldest club in the West Riding and the third oldest in Yorkshire (Beverly and East Riding Golf Club 1889); a 9-hole course was established on Rombald's Moor at the behest of Ben Hirst and Alfred Potter in June 1890. The location for theoriginal 9 hole course was planned with assistance from George Strath, the club professional at Southport and George Kay, the club professional at Redcar was employed at £1 per week to lay out the course. 
In October 1897 the committee negotiated with Myddleton Estate to rent 70 acres of pasture running along the north side of the River Wharfe. Work began on the new course in February 1898 and was completed by July of that year. The course was designed by Alister MacKenzie and Harry Colt and measures 6,262 yards. The old links course on the moor was leased to an Ilkley Tradesmen's group and golf continued to be played there until the Moor Club was wound up in 1947. On 13 April 1907, Harry Vardon and noted golf architect James Braid played an exhibition match to mark the opening of the new clubhouse. In 1921 the course was described as an "excellent links" course. In 1970 many trees were planted around the course, changing its appearance. The club has hosted the competition for the OCCA and West Riding Golf Trophies, the Yorkshire Ladies' Challenge Bowl in 1955 and the British Girls' Open Championship in 1969.
The 19th bar in the Clubhouse has on display one of the golf balls that Alan Shepard took to the Moon on Apollo 14 in 1971. The ball was given by Shephard to Father Paddy Roche who bequeathed it to the club.
Members.
A number of professionals started or played at Ilkley, including Harry Vardon, Tom Vardon, Sam Whiting, William Baxter, John Ball, Peter Thomson, Bill Ferguson, Colin Montgomerie, Mark James, and James Hepworth. Harry Vardon won his first prize as a professional golfer on this course in 1893. Montgomerie met Ferguson at the club when Ferguson was club pro and Montgomerie was just a boy.

Veeramunai

Veeramunai is a rural village in the Ampara District situated within the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. Most of the residents are minority Sri Lankan Tamils and are farmers. According to local chronicles, Veeramunai was founded by early settlers in a medieval feudal division called Nadukadu during the pre colonial period (prior to 1505 CE). Feudal lords known as Vanniar resident in the village controlled large swaths of farm land around the village and the region. These farm holdings led to considerable conflicts with residents of a demographically larger nearby village of Sammanthurai. Most residents of Sammathurai were also members of the Sri Lankan Muslim minority. In 1954, a mob from Sammanthurai burned down Veeramunia after a local conflict. About 75% of the villagers left Veeramunai as refugees and setup satellite settlements like Malwattai, Kanapathipuram and Veeracholai away from Sammanthurai. Veeramunai land holdings were eventually sold to the residents of Sammanthurai thus the village reduced in size and population considerably. During the 1990’s life was affected by the insurgency and counter insurgency operations during the Sri Lankan civil war. Members of the village were also present within the Hindu temple at Veeramunai as refugees when it was attacked by Home Guards from Sammanthurai on August 12, 1990 resulting in the death of 55 civilians. Subsequently the village was resettled by returning refugees.

The Battle of the Strong

The Battle of the Strong is an 1898 novel by Gilbert Parker. It was first published in serial format in "The Atlantic Monthly" starting in January 1898, and as a single volume late in the same year. It was ranked as the tenth-highest best selling book overall in the United States for 1898, and appeared as high as Number 2 on the monthly bestseller list published in "The Bookman" in early 1899. The book is set in the Channel Islands, primarily during the period 1781-95, and opens with attempted invasion of Jersey by France in the Battle of Jersey.
The title is derived from Ecclesiastes 9:11, "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong."
Willis Steell and Edward Everett Rose adapted the novel into a play in 1900, which starred Maurice Barrymore and Marie Burroughs. Of the play, Parker later remarked that "the adaption, however, was lacking much, and though Miss Marie Burroughs and Maurice Barrymore played in it, success did not attend its dramatic life."

Achilles from the kindred Hont-Pázmány

Achilles from the kindred Hont-Pázmány () was a prelate in the Kingdom of Hungary in the middle of the 13th century. He was provost of the collegiate chapter of Székesfehérvár and vice-chancellor between 1243 and 1251, and bishop of Pécs from 1251 until his death in 1252.
Life.
Achilles was one of the five children of Pázmány from the kindred Hont-Pázmány. Although the "genus" Hont-Pázmány was one of the most illustrious clans in the Kingdom of Hungary, its Újhely branch from which Achilles descended was less prosperous. The small family lands were located in the region of the rivers Berettyó and Körös.
All the same, Achilles was admitted to the royal court sometime after 1225 where he was employed as royal chaplain. His early carrier is uncertain, because there were four namesake prelates in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1230s and 1240s. He can most probably be identified with one Achilles, provost of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom from around 1236. When the Mongols invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1241, this Achilles fled to Dalmatia similarly to King Béla IV of Hungary. Since Archbishop Matthew of Esztergom was killed by the Mongols in the Battle of Mohi, Achilles administered the archdiocese for more than two years.
Following the withdrawal of the Mongols Provost Achilles was at least twice appointed by the pope to investigate the circumstances of appointments to higher Church offices. Achilles himself was transferred to the collegiate chapter of Székesfehérvár in September 1243. Head of the prestigious chapter, Achilles also became the vice-chancellor, the leader of the royal administration. The royal chancery started to function more uniformly under his auspices, and the registration of the charters issued by the chancery was also begun in this period. King Béla IV of Hungary granted him a landed property in Ugocsa County which suggests that the monarch also respected Achilles's work. 
When Bishop Bartholomew le Gros of Pécs retired in 1251, King Béla IV recommended Achilles to his place. Respecting the monarch's wish, the canons of the cathedral chapter of Pécs elected Achilles bishop. The pope confirmed his election by November 23, 1251. The new bishop visited the monastery his predecessor had established for hermits on the Saint James Hill at Pécs and personally marked out the borders of its nearby properties. He also promised to make further donations to the community, but he unexpectedly died in the first months of 1252. He left his lands in Ugocsa to his relatives.

Estelle Griswold

Estelle Naomi Trebert Griswold (June 8, 1900 – August 13, 1981) was a civil rights activist and feminist most commonly known as a defendant in the Supreme Court case "Griswold v. Connecticut", in which contraception for married couples was legalized in the state of Connecticut, setting the precedent of the right to privacy. Griswold served as the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood in New Haven when she and Yale Professor C. Lee Buxton opened a birth control clinic in New Haven in an attempt to change the Connecticut law banning contraception. Their actions set into motion legislation that resulted in both "Poe v. Ullman" and "Griswold v. Connecticut."
Griswold's personal role in both cases was vital to achieving success and starting a women's rights revolution that went on to aid the support for such cases as "Roe v. Wade".
Early life.
Estelle ("Stelle") Trebert was born in Hartford, Connecticut on June 8, 1900 to Frank Trebert and Jennie Church Trebert. Frank Trebert was a toolmaker of Irish and German descent. Throughout Estelle’s childhood, her father educated her thoroughly on Native American customs and strongly advocated for outdoor activity. Her mother, Jennie Trebert, is most commonly described as being reserved and "placid." Estelle was the youngest of two surviving children; one of her older brothers died before she was born, leaving only her and her older brother, Raymond Trebert. Their parents were said to have had a tumultuous marriage and serious "personality differences." Despite this, they never divorced. Estelle Griswold was raised a Catholic but was not devout later in life.
Estelle attended Hartford public schools throughout her youth. Due to academic process, she skipped both fourth and seventh grade but graduated high school in five years instead of four due to her habitual truancy and her encouragement of other students, mainly boys, to skip school. After graduating from high school in 1920, Estelle began taking music classes at the Hartt School of Music. Despite wanting to go to college and further her academic career, her family could not afford the tuition. She worked in a bank in order to pay for the music school.
In 1922, she moved to France to pursue a singing career, ignoring the disapproval of her parents. She had a very impressive contralto singing voice, and traveled to both Paris and Nice for employment. While in France, Estelle caught tuberculosis, which limited her abilities to work. She also became engaged to an aspiring playwright, but the relationship ended prior to the marriage.
Upon learning that her mother had fallen seriously ill, Estelle left Paris. A short time afterward, both of her parents died. Estelle did not return to Paris after the incident, instead remaining in Hartford. She spent a brief time traveling in hopes of furthering her singing career, auditioning in New York and going on tour with a Chicago based show group for six months. After this, she returned to Hartford and remained there until her marriage to Richard Griswold.
Marriage.
Estelle married Richard "Dick" Whitmore Griswold (b. Feb. 11, 1898 - d. Oct. 1, 1966) on October 20, 1927 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The two had both attended Hartford High School, Richard being two years her senior. Though they were not close friends, they knew each other during their school years. Upon graduating from high school, he attended Yale University and spent a brief time in service during World War I. He went on to work in advertising, traveling throughout New York and New England for various jobs. After Estelle's return from France, they met again, beginning a relationship, and marrying in the fall of 1927. Due to this, Richard Griswold decided to take a job with the Guardian Life Insurance Agency, which offered him a salaried position. They briefly moved to New York, commuting from Mount Vernon to New York City for Richard’s business and Estelle's singing jobs. Griswold took a job as a radio singer for such broadcasts as the NBC Red Network in 1929.
In 1935, Richard and Estelle Griswold moved from Connecticut to Washington D.C. where Estelle began taking classes at George Washington University. While in D.C., Griswold decided to end her singing career, given that her tutor had died, and she instead began studying medicine. Her advancement in the subject led her to become a medical instructor with the university.
Life abroad.
At the beginning of World War II, Richard Griswold left his advertising business and joined the Office of Political Affairs in the State Department, during which time he was sent abroad to Europe to help with various crises. In 1945, Griswold joined him in Europe, becoming involved with humanitarian efforts, including the aid of refugees, mainly from Eastern European countries. In attempting to gain employment at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), however, she was turned down. Eventually, Griswold managed to bypass the initial employment offices and went straight to the top of the organization in order to achieve employment.
In doing so, she became involved with the resettlement plan in Europe to aid refugees and send them away to such places as Rio de Janeiro, Algiers, and Puerto Rico. Throughout this time, Griswold witnessed deep poverty and starvation, and realized that the cause of this was, ultimately, overpopulation, as there was no access to birth control in these countries. This realization fueled Griswold's beliefs that women should be granted access to contraception to protect themselves, as they often faced the challenge of giving in to their husbands and dealing with an unwanted pregnancy or refusing them and suffering often abusive consequences.
Griswold ended her time with the Church World Service in 1951, feeling that the organization was not properly aiding refugees, instead being crass in their efforts.
New Haven Planned Parenthood.
Upon returning to the United States in 1950, Richard and Estelle moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Richard Griswold decided to continue working as an advertising executive and believed that moving to New Haven would be beneficial due to the appeal he could draw from the Yale community. During this time, Estelle became the Executive Secretary to the Human Relations Council, a volunteer job that she did for free. In addition to this, she helped fund the infertility program and the marital counseling program at Yale, the latter of which was run by the wife of lawyer Fowler Harper, who would play a large role in the legislation for Griswold v. Connecticut. Her role in these programs was fueled through both her knowledge of population gained from experience abroad, as well as her empathy towards couples who, like her, could not have children.
Richard and Estelle lived at 40 Trumbull Street, directly next to Planned Parenthood’s New Haven offices at the time, where they became familiar with various people throughout the building. Within the organization, many had been attempting to formulate new legislation to challenge the 1879 Connecticut law banning the use of contraception, facing challenges and scrutiny from many conservative organizations. It became clear that they would need a figurehead to operate the plan in order to attempt success who would be more docile than the radical liberals the courts were expecting. Griswold was quickly considered for involvement, as many knew her from her work in the Human Relations Council and understood her political platforms. The idea to involve Griswold came initially from a chance encounter with Jennie Heiser, assistant to the soon-to-be-retired Planned Parenthood Executive Director Nancy Williams, who half-jokingly offered her the upcoming position. Griswold was, at first, reluctant to accept the position. She did not have a great deal of knowledge regarding birth control and did not know what a diaphragm was upon her first interview with PPLC President Molly Milmine, though diaphragms were the main source of birth control during the era.
Overcoming these challenges, she finally accepted the position in late 1953, as she desperately needed a paying job, given that Richard Griswold had been diagnosed with emphysema in 1953 and could not work as frequently as he had in previous years.
On January 1, 1954, Griswold began her work as Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. Among her duties was the practice of organizing “border runs” in which women would be taken to New York or Rhode Island in order to seek the proper birth control methods that were unavailable to them in Connecticut.
"Poe v. Ullman".
Shortly after Griswold became Executive Director, she became involved in the movement to abolish the birth control laws within Connecticut.
An 1879 law outlawing the sale or manufacture of contraception had been upheld since its enactment, despite constant protest shown at several state legislative meetings within the decades since. The law was sponsored by State legislator P.T. Barnum, of the Barnum and Bailey circus. Griswold, in an attempt to seriously change the law, employed the help of two married women and a young married couple, all of whom needed contraception for medical reasons. She and Dr. C Lee Buxton, Obstetrics and Gynecology Professor at Yale, with the assistance of Fowler Harper and Catherine Roraback, both civil rights lawyers, brought the matter to the courts. The case involved a married couple, who underwent the aliases Paul and Pauline Poe, a young couple that had given birth to three children that had all died of medical complications shortly after their birth, as well as a woman under the alias of Jane Doe, who had experienced paralysis and speech impediment after almost dying in childbirth.
Buxton, the medical expert in the case, stated to the court that the couple required contraception to prevent further physical or mental deterioration, as this issue was genetic and could potentially recur if they were to have another child. However, the state courts upheld the statute, allowing Roraback to appeal to the US Supreme Court, who accepted their case. Griswold and Buxton had intended only to change the statute so that married women could seek contraception for medical purposes. However, in a 5-4 ruling issued on June 20, 1961, the Court upheld the Connecticut statute, declaring that the law had never been enforced and the consequence of its violation was not harmful and so was constitutional.
Very shortly before the decision was made, a Connecticut man was arrested and fined for providing condoms to gas stations, hoping that workers would sell them to customers. There were reported multiple cases in which people called the police regarding the incident. The man accused, however did not face any serious punishment, which may have had an impact on the Court's decision. Hearing this, Griswold and Buxton were angered by the Court's ruling and, with the understanding that the law had never been significantly challenged, decided to test it.
"Griswold v. Connecticut".
Griswold located a small building with which to open the clinic near to the Planned Parenthood offices at 79 Trumbull Street. The PPLC had saved $60 in the event that they should open a clinic, be it after contraception was legalized or as an experiment to test the law. The found several qualified and safe doctors willing to help that would advise women and provide the proper medical care. The clinic opened in early November, 1961 and almost immediately was this met with controversy, largely due to protesters such as James Morris, who picketed outside of the clinic with the message that what Griswold and Buxton were doing was immoral. Within days, detectives arrived to inspect the practice. Griswold allowed them to inspect and clearly informed them of the functions of the clinic. She was enthusiastic in her descriptions and provided specific and detailed information that she assumed would be used in the trial. She informed the detectives as they were leaving the clinic that she was fine with being arrested, but refused to be fingerprinted or photographed.
Two days later, the detectives returned to the clinic demanding names of at least two patients that had been treated since the clinic's opening. Griswold chose a 33-year-old Yale Divinity School Graduate and a graduate student in Yale's Public Health School, who was an English citizen and married to a colleague of Fowler Harper. Both provided their names and details of the assistance they were given at the clinic and signed formal statements. Though they had not specifically intended to get arrested to achieve their goals, Griswold and Buxton had no fear of doing so as they understood that it would help their cause. The clinic was shut down on November 9, 1961 after the witnesses had given their statements and Griswold and Buxton were charged with minor accounts pertaining to their distribution of birth control and were each fined $100. As per Griswold’s demand, neither she nor Buxton were fingerprinted or photographed.
Immediately, their lawyers began their defense, now able to argue that the law would be enforced, providing a stronger and more persuasive argument. This time, Griswold decided not to employ aliases during the trial, making it widely known as the Buxton case in local Connecticut courts and "Griswold v. Connecticut" when the appeal made it to the Supreme Court. The lead litigator on this case was Catherine Roraback, with assistance from Thomas Emerson, who took over Fowler Harper's position after his death in 1963. 1963 was a year of significant internal tensions within Planned Parenthood and was had much to do with Griswold's actions and motivations for finding a new Planned Parenthood headquarters. A new building had been purchased at 406 Orange Street with a carriage house at the back of the property.
Due to her husband's emphysema, she proposed that the two use the carriage house as their private residence to ease her husband's difficulties regarding climbing stairs. Many Planned Parenthood members were angered by this proposition, especially because of the financial crisis faced by the organization. After many arguments and much resentment throughout this time period, Griswold made the decision to resign as Executive Director. However, because of the urgency of the forthcoming Supreme Court trial, as well as the general progress Griswold had made to advance Planned Parenthood since first taking the job, she eventually persuaded to remain in her position.
The Supreme Court trial began in 1965. As with "Poe v. Ullman", Griswold continued argue that the anti-contraception law was a clear violation to the privacy of married couples, making it unconstitutional and dangerous. The decision in this case changed on the basis that the argument in Poe had become invalid. The law had been challenged and punishment had been enforced based on Griswold's crime. Regarding the evidence and constitutional background of the right to privacy, the Court voted 7-2 in favor of Griswold on June 7, 1965. The law was declared unconstitutional and married couples could now obtain birth control.
Later life.
Shortly after the Supreme Court decision was made, Griswold resigned as Executive Director of Planned Parenthood. It is stated that within the organization was much tension between colleagues that she wanted to avoid. She remained in New Haven, even after Richard Griswold died of emphysema on October 1, 1966. Griswold died in Fort Myers, Florida on August 13, 1981 at the age of 81. She is buried in the cemetery of the Congregational Church in Wethersfield, Connecticut next to her husband.
Griswold was inducted in the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1994.

Doonshean

Dún Síon otherwise known as Doonshean is a townland situated in the western County Kerry, Ireland. It is located about 3.8 km from the neighbouring town Dingle.
The village gets its name from the Dún, meaning "doon", and Síon, meaning "weather'. There were battles fought on the famous Doon, which is accessible by walking through the fields. There are many fairy forts in the fields which hold great significance, as people used to live there long ago; there is a great sacredness about these forts.
The population approximately 25 people. The main language in the village is Irish but many have adapted and now speak English also.The various families worked the land and still continue to do so till this day.
The renowned beach boasts tremendous views of the village Kinnard in the neighbouring parish of Lispole. The "Siorrach", meaning "foal", is a seastack which can be seen from the beach and is said to resemble a foal. The "Trá Bheag", meaning "small beach", runs along the picturesque beach until it meets the sea. There are many small fishing boats moored on the stream in which the Dún Síon residents used to fish in the earlier times and where the women would enjoy picking cockels and mussels.
Many of the residents own cows or cattle, and it is said that cows outnumber humans 6:1. 
Notable people.

John Hilton (the elder) (15651609(?)) was an English countertenor, organist and composer of mainly sacred works.
Works.
Hilton is best known for his anthems "Lord, for Thy Tender Mercy's Sake" (which may actually be by one of the Farrants) and "Call to Remembrance".
Life.
Hilton was born in 1565. By 1584 he was a countertenor at Lincoln Cathedral. At the start of 1594 he became organist at Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was the father of John Hilton the younger, also a composer, which makes definitive assignation of their combined sacred works problematic; whereas his only secular work appears to have been the madrigal "Fair Oriana, beauty's Queen", which he wrote for "The Triumphs of Oriana."
He died, probably in Cambridge, prior to 20 March 1609.

<doc id="36728961" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36728961" title="Aircraft engine starting">
Aircraft engine starting

Many variations of aircraft engine starting have been used since the Wright brothers made their first powered flight in 1903. The methods used have been designed for weight saving, simplicity of operation and reliability. Early piston engines were started by hand, with geared hand starting, electrical and cartridge-operated systems for larger engines being developed between the wars. 
Gas turbine aircraft engines such as turbojets, turboshafts and turbofans often use air/pneumatic starting with the use of bleed air from auxiliary power units (APUs) now seen as a common starting method.
Piston engines.
Hand starting/propeller swinging.
Hand starting of aircraft piston engines by swinging the propeller is the oldest and simplest method, the absence of any onboard starting system giving an appreciable weight saving. Positioning of the propeller relative to the crankshaft is arranged such that the engine pistons pass through top dead centre during the swinging stroke. 
As the ignition system is normally arranged to produce sparks before top dead centre there is a risk of the engine kicking back during hand starting, to avoid this problem one of the two magnetos used in a typical aero engine ignition system is fitted with an 'impulse coupling', this spring loaded device delays the spark until top dead centre and also increases the rotational speed of the magneto to produce a stronger spark. When the engine fires the impulse coupling no longer operates and the second magneto is switched on.
As aero engines grew bigger in capacity (around the period of WWI) single-person propeller swinging became physically difficult, ground crew personnel would join hands and pull together as a team or use a canvas sock fitted over one propeller blade, the sock having a length of rope attached to the propeller tip end.
Accidents have occurred during lone pilot hand starting, high throttle settings, brakes not applied or wheel chocks not being used, all resulting in aircraft moving off without the pilot at the controls.
Hucks starter.
The Hucks starter (invented by Bentfield Hucks during WWI) is a mechanical replacement for the ground crew. Based on a vehicle chassis the device uses a clutch driven shaft to turn the propeller, disengaging as the engine starts. A Hucks starter is used regularly at the Shuttleworth Collection for starting period aircraft.
Pull cord.
Self-sustaining motor gliders (often known as 'turbos') are fitted with small two-stroke engines with no starting system, for ground testing a cord is wrapped around the propeller boss and pulled rapidly in conjunction with operating decompressor valves. These engines are started in flight by operating the decompressor and increasing airspeed to windmill the propeller. Early variants of the Slingsby Falke motor glider use a cockpit mounted pull start system.
Electric starter.
Aircraft began to be installed with electrical systems around 1930, powered by a battery and small wind-driven generator the systems were initially not powerful enough to drive starter motors. Introduction of engine-driven generators solved the problem.
Introduction of electric starter motors for aero engines increased convenience at the expense of extra weight and complexity. They were a necessity for flying boats with high mounted inaccessible engines. Powered by an onboard battery, ground electrical supply or both, the starter is operated by a key or switch in the cockpit, the key system often combining switching of the magnetos.
In cold ambient conditions the friction caused by thick engine oil causes a high load on the starting system, another problem is the reluctance of the fuel to vaporise and combust at low temperatures. Oil dilution systems were developed (mixing fuel with the engine oil), engine pre-heaters were used (including lighting fires under the aircraft) and a Ki-Gass priming pump system was used to assist starting of British engines.
Aircraft fitted with variable-pitch propellers or constant speed propellers are started in fine pitch to reduce air loads and current in the starter motor circuit. 
Many light aircraft are fitted with a 'starter engaged' warning light in the cockpit, a mandatory airworthiness requirement to guard against the risks of starter motor failure.
Coffman starter.
The Coffman starter was an explosive cartridge operated device, the burning gases either operating directly in the cylinders to rotate the engine or operating through a geared drive. First introduced on the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engine in 1936 the Coffman starter was not widely used by civil operators due to the expense of the cartridges.
Pneumatic starter.
In 1920 Roy Fedden designed a piston engine gas starting system, this was in use on the Bristol Jupiter engine by 1922. A system used in early Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines ducted high-pressure air from a ground unit through a camshaft driven distributor to the cylinders via non-return valves, the system had disadvantages which were overcome by conversion to electric starting.
In-flight starting.
In the event of needing to restart a piston engine in the air the electrical starter motor can be used, this is normal procedure for motor gliders that have been soaring with the engine turned off. During aerobatics with earlier aircraft types it was not uncommon for the engine to cut during manoeuvres due to carburettor design, with no starter system engines could be restarted by diving the aircraft to increase airspeed, 'windmilling' the propeller.
Inertia starter.
An aero engine inertia starter uses a pre-rotated flywheel to transfer kinetic energy to the crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.
Gas turbine engines.
Starting of a gas turbine engine requires rotation of the compressor to a speed that provides sufficient pressurised air to the combustion chambers. The starting system has to overcome inertia of the compressor and friction loads, the system remains in operation after combustion starts and is disengaged once the engine has reached self-idling speed.
Electric starter.
Two types of electrical starter motor can be used, direct-cranking (to disengage as internal combustion engines) and starter-generator system (permanently engaged).
Hydraulic starter.
Small gas turbine engines, particularly turboshaft engines used in helicopters and cruise missile turbojets can be started by a geared hydraulic motor using oil pressure from a ground supply.
Air-start.
With air-start systems gas turbine engine compressor spools are rotated by the action of a large volume of compressed air acting directly on the compressor blades or driving the engine through a small, geared turbine motor. These motors can weigh up to 75% less than an equivalent electrical system.
The compressed air can be supplied from an on-board auxiliary power unit (APU), a portable gas generator used by ground crew or by cross feeding bleed air from a running engine in the case of multi-engined aircraft.
The Turbomeca Palouste gas generator was used to start the Spey engines of the Blackburn Buccaneer, the de Havilland Sea Vixen carrying its own Palouste in a removable underwing container to facilitate starting when away from base. Other military aircraft types using ground supplied compressed air for starting include the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and variants of the F-4 Phantom using the General Electric J79 turbojet engine.
Combustion starters.
AVPIN starter.
Versions of the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine used a geared turbine starter motor that burned isopropyl nitrate as the fuel. In military service this monofuel had the NATO designation of S-746 AVPIN. For starting a measured amount of fuel was introduced to the starter combustion chamber then ignited electrically, the hot gases spinning the turbine at high revolutions with the exhaust exiting overboard.
Cartridge starter.
Similar in operating principle to the piston engine Coffman starter, an explosive cartridge drives a small turbine engine which is connected by gears to the compressor shaft.
Fuel/air turbine starter (APU).
Developed for short-haul airliners and military aircraft requiring self-contained starting systems these units are known by various names including Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) or Gas Turbine Compressor (GTC).
Comprising a small gas turbine which is electrically started, these devices provide compressed bleed air for engine starting and often also provide electrical and hydraulic power for ground operations without the need to run the main engines.
Internal combustion engine starter.
An interesting feature of the German Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engine was the starter system, which consisted of a Riedel 10 hp (7.5 kW) two-stroke motorcycle engine hidden in the intake, and essentially functioned as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit (APU) for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the centrebody contained a manual pull-handle which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two small petrol tanks were fitted in the annular intake.
In-flight restart.
Gas turbine engines can be shut down in flight, intentionally by the crew to save fuel or during a flight test or unintentionally due to fuel starvation or flameout after a compressor stall.
Sufficient airspeed is used to 'windmill' the compressor then fuel and ignition are switched on, an on-board auxiliary power unit may be used at high altitudes where the air density is lower.
During zoom climb operations of the Lockheed NF-104A the jet engine was shutdown on climbing through and was started using the windmill method on descent through denser air.
Pulse jet starting.
Pulse jet engines are uncommon aircraft powerplants however the Argus As 014 used to power the V-1 flying bomb and Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg was a notable exception.
In this pulsejet three air nozzles in the front section were connected to an external high pressure air source, butane from an external supply was used for starting, ignition was accomplished by a spark plug located behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit.
Once the engine started and the temperature rose to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 40 to 45 times per second. The electrical ignition system was used only to start the engine, heating of the tailpipe skin maintained combustion.

Patricia Erbelding

Patricia Erbelding (born in Paris in 1958) is a French artist who works in a variety of media producing abstract art.
Biography.
Her first solo exhibition was held at the Galerie du Haut Pavé in Paris in 1993, curated by Jean Pierre Brice Olivier.
Her work has been exhibited around the world and she is held in many collections both public and private. Her multidisciplinary artistic work spans painting, collage, sculpture, photography and artists’ books.
She grew up in France and most of her work is still produced in Paris where she has her studio.
After literary studies, she worked in a number of professions before starting painting full-time in 1988. She is a figure of the new scene in Abstract Art and is known for the unique technique in painting as well as for her Artist’s books.
Her work has been exhibited at the Industry Museum (now renamed "Bois du Cazier") of Charleroi in Belgium; the Nagoya Museum; the Toyama Museum; the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art and the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art in Japan; the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taiwan; the Musée des Avelines, Saint Cloud, France; the Swedish American Museum in Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, Maracaibo, Venezuela; the Sofia Imber Contemporary Art Museum, Caracas, Venezuela; the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Sejong Center in Seoul, Korea; the Collage Museum, Mexico; the Musée Barrois in Bar-Le-Duc, France; the Argonne Museum in Varennes, France; the O Art Museum, in Tokyo, Japan; the Art and Historical Museum of Montbeliard, France; the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art, Tarpon Springs, Florida; the Austin Museum of Art, Austin, Texas.
Her work was exhibited at the FSU Museum of Fine Arts, Tallahassee, Florida in 2011 and 2012.
In her new works Patricia Erbelding continues to place keen attention on the concepts of transformation and metamorphosis, their application to organic and inorganic materials, and the meaning behind and produced by the process of inscribing such materials herself. Metaphors of time passing and evolution are also at play in her photographic work.
Erbelding is currently represented by Jacques Levy Gallery, Paris; Galerie Insula, Paris and Port-Joinville in Île d'Yeu; Art Forum Gallery, Antwerp, Belgium ; Dhalgren Gallery, Paris; Envie D'Art, London; Le Cabinet Amateur Gallery, Paris and Eva Doublet Gallery, St Georges du Bois.
Background.
Erbelding was raised in the suburbs of Paris and studied literature at the .
Through her family she nevertheless inherited an artistic tradition – her father sculpted and her uncle painted. In 1983 she started working in an engraving studio on printmaking. While she perfected the techniques of intaglio and etching she also started working in painting and clay.
Her early works included painted photography and collages and at the same early period she also produced her first Artist’s books. After a few years, Erbelding refined what have been a trademark technique involving Iron oxidations and beeswax.
Techniques and processes.
Erbelding apply an oxidation process which acts almost as an etching of the paper-coated canvas – the characteristic lines that forms are practically burnt into the media through the oxidation process. There is a clear link with her earlier works in etching.
A slow and rigorous production process is a distinguishing feature. For her works, she uses acrylic and oil paint, paper, beeswax and iron oxide.
Photography appeared in her work in 1995 and was also important in her creation of artists books. 
Her artist’s books are realized as collaborations with writers and poets such as Joël Bastard, Michel Bohbot, Michel Butor, Serge Gavronsky, Hubert Lucot, Tita Reut and more.
She has also produced cover art and illustrations for books, notably for Christina Mengert at Burning Deck Press.
Career.
Early years.
Her first solo exhibition at the Haut Pave Gallery which was well received was followed by a number of other gallery shows in Paris and other cities. Works from this period was often noted for its likeness to epidermis with the oxidation traces as scar tissue.
Erbelding was elected to be Artist in Residence in 1995 at the Ponts De Sambre Art Center in Charleroi in Belgium.
Next year in 1996, she received a grant from the Wallonie Center in Paris and the French Embassy in Belgium and developed a series of forged iron sculptures produced in the Industry Museum of Charleroi. She also invited the artist Tony Soulié to work there and in 1997 their sculptures were exhibited at the Museum together with paintings and photographies.
Her 1998 artist’s book “Gestes”, a collaboration with the poet Pierre Marc Levergeois was included in the collection of the New York MOMA Library.
Later years.
Today, Erbelding has established her studio in the 19th arrondissement of Paris where in 2003 she took part in a street art event organized by Christine Phal. 2003 also saw the kick-off for the world-travelling exhibition “8th international shoebox sculpture exhibition” initiated by the University of Hawai Art Gallery that were to visit 16 different museums and art centers over two years.
She has regular solo exhibitions at the Jacques Levy Gallery in Paris since 2003, beginning with “Vues des anges”, an exhibition based on a poem of Rainer Maria Rilke. Will follow “Cinabre” in 2005, “Interstate”(photographic work) in 2006, “Noir” in 2007, “Urban Legend” in 2009 and recently in 2011 with “Lost Paradise” where she refers to Milton’s poem “Paradise Lost” in a game of white and light blue paintings where the blue sphere of melancholia imposes its presence.
A first monograph of her work “L’Etat des métamorphoses“ was published in 2005 by Art Inprogress with text and poems by Tita Reut, translated by Keith Waldrop and in 2007, she was selected into the 14th International Art Exhibition at the National Art Center in Tokyo.
2008 saw her photographic work in the “Y’a pas photo” exhibition at the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques (MABA) in Nogent sur Marne.
In 2009 was held at the Espace Saint Louis Art Center, in collaboration with the Barrois Museum, Médiathèque and Theatre in Bar-le-Duc, France, her solo exhibition : “La peinture à livre ouvert”. Large scale paintings and artists books were presented. The subject matter was the link between painting and writing. 
She was featured in a number of collective shows throughout 2010, among others: with the Denjoy collection at the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art in Tarpon Springs, Florida and Artita-2010 in Piran, Slovenia. She also collaborated on a number of Artist’s Books including an edition of “Carcasses” with Eric Coisel and Michel Butor and the “The Ghost Lemur of William S. Burroughs” with Tony Soulié.
2011 saw Erbelding featured at the 26th Annual Tallahassee International at the FSU Museum of Fine Art as well as in the International Art Fair (SETEC) in Seoul. A book on her works “H2O“, by Corine Girieud was also published.
In 2012, she received an award for the 2012 Professional Women Photographers exhibition in New York, juried by Mary Ellen Mark and had a major exhibition during the summer at the Eva Doublet Gallery.

Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany

The merger of the Communist Party of Germany (, KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD) into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (, SED) occurred on April 1946 in the territory of the Soviet occupation zone is also called the forced merger of the KPD and SPD. In the course of the merger, about 5,000 Social Democrats who opposed were detained and sent to camps and jails.
Background.
Among circles of the workers' parties KPD and SPD there were different interpretations of the reasons for the rise of the Nazis and their electoral success. A portion of the Social Democrats blamed the devastating role of Communists in the final phase of the Weimar Republic. The Communist Party, in turn, insulted the Social Democrats as "social fascists". Others believed that the splitting of the labour movement into the SPD and KPD prevented them effectively opposing the power of the Nazis, made possible by the First World War.
In 1945 there were calls in both the SPD and KPD for a united workers' party. The Soviet Military Administration in Germany was initially against it because it was believed that the Communist Party would develop under their guidance, the strongest political force in the Soviet occupied zone. The outcome of the elections in November 1945 made in Hungary and Austria, and especially the poor performance of Communist parties from November 1945 a made it clear that a rapid Restructure of the Communist party is needed. Both Stalin and Walter Ulbricht recognized the "danger of Austria" and launched in November 1945, a unit of an accelerated campaign to secure the leadership of the Communist Party.
Preparation for the Merger.
Under heavy pressure from the Soviet occupation forces and the Communist Party leadership, and with the support of some leading Social Democrats, working groups and committees were formed at all levels of the parties, whose declared aim was to create a union between the two parties. Many Social Democrats unwilling to unit were arrested in early 1946 in all areas of the Soviet occupation zone.
On 1 March 1946, at an official meeting of the SPD held in the Admiralspalast, Berlin decided on a vote on the merger with the Communist Party. On March 14, 1946 the Central Committee of the SPD published a call for a merger of the SPD and KPD. As it came to the ballot in March 1946, 31 SPD deputies urged the central committee in West Berlin for a boycott. At least 70% of West Berlin SPD members attended the vote. The question that was put to the vote was not about the readiness for the merger, but an immediate unification. Contributions have been 82% of those present with "No". Because many members agreed, however, advocate a general merger of the two parties, a second question was asked: "Are you for an alliance, which ensures joint working and excludes the brother fight?". According to the official results 62 percent answered "Yes".

Green Heroine

Green Heroine is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series "Pugad Baboy", created by Pol Medina Jr. This particular story arc lasts 87 strips long and was published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer from November 2011 to March 2012. In June 2012, the story arc was reprinted in the 24th compilation of the comic strip series, named "PB24". For the first time in the series, Cristina "Tiny" Sungcal and her gay friend Pao Tang appear as main characters.
Synopsis.
One day, Tiny seeks Mang Dagul's help in a field trip to the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) in Mandaluyong as part of a school field trip. Bab drops her off instead. After the trip, Tiny tells her experiences to Pao in a series of flashbacks that break the fourth wall. 
In the asylum, Tiny interviews a deranged patient named Dr Arnibal Necter, who calls her Agent CS of the Fat Bitch Ingenue (FBI) agency. Over the course of the interview, Dr Necter makes a series of cryptic predictions. Tiny and Pao connect two predictions on recent events: the sabotage of a biodiesel-producing liposuction clinic that botched an operation on US Ambassador to the Philippines Harry Thomas and the destruction of a local jatropha farm using swarms of the Pennsylvania marmorated stink bug and the California scutellarid bug - insects only found in the US. The duo's research identifies a piggery in Cavite and a hydrogen processing plant as possible targets. Tiny visits the plant and talks to the supervisor, averting an explosion that could be traced to hydrogen vapors. As Tiny calls Pao to report on the latest development, Pao himself crashes from the sky in front of her. 
Pao explains that she visited the piggery and met a Korean man named Mr Shin (who often emphasizes the word SHIN in a loud voice). He says the piggery's waste is processed at a co-located methane research facility for alternative fuel in passenger cars. However, the facility explodes when a door Shin opens triggers a whole set of matches attached to one door, thereby lighting the methane gas and sending the two into the air. Tiny and Pao head to an ethanol production plant in Tarlac that could be another target. A man in shades, jeans, and jacket named the "Tsimaymenator" kidnaps the plant's consultant, Ciara Connor, and escapes despite the FBI agents shooting him and his goons with special nonlethal darts. The kidnapping fumes Connor's husband, Christian Bale Connor.
Reflecting on two more of Dr Necter's predictions, Tiny matches them to a purported leak of sulfuric acid from a battery plant in Sta Rosa, Laguna and a potential terrorist threat at an international bio-energy conference held in the Manila Hotel. While scoping out the security at the hotel, Tiny chances upon Ciara at the women's restroom and tries to get her out of the hotel - only to run into several bodyguards. Polgas appears to bring Ciara to safety while Tiny and Pao fight off their pursuers. Tiny turns into another alter-ego named Obesa Vanidosa and sends some agents into a long chase. Obesa rejoins Pao, and so does Mr Shin, who has finally crashed back to the ground after the plant explosion in time to squash the Tsimaymenator from killing the two. 
The group heads to the safehouse - a nipa hut - in San Pablo, Laguna, but Pao gets a hunch about being followed. It is proven true as their Toyota Prius and the safehouse is blown up apparently by Predator drones. Fortunately, the entire safehouse is specially armored underneath the thatching, and Obesa uses a special rod to fire explosive anti-vehicle rounds at two black Ford E-150 vans carrying the agents from the hotel. When the vans are destroyed, Ciara identifies the drone that attacked them as an Avenger, which repositions for another attack until Mr Shin flies into the air to forcibly crash it. Obesa, Pao, and Mr Shin finally mop up the remaining agents. Obesa reverts to Tiny and introduces herself to Mr Shin - who recognizes Ciara as Dr Alecx dela Cruz, a senior consultant in his methane plant.
Now angered at the subterfuge, Tiny and Pao crosscheck and learn that Connor/dela Cruz is actually Dr Cristina Torres, who worked at the hydrogen plant Tiny visited earlier (also as a consultant). Tiny deduces that the consultancy job was a cover for the sabotage operations. She forces Torres to come clean and make sense of all the evidence compiled against her.
Torres explains that the Tsimaymenator was actually in Tarlac to rescue her now that her cover was blown and reveals that a Detroit-based syndicate of American muscle car enthusiasts plotted the sabotage to stifle research on alternative fuels. To Tiny and Pao's surprise, she admits that Dr Necter was the group's chief saboteur, whose handiwork in tampering the Prius' brake and acceleration systems resulted in its recall. However, he went soft after refusing to participate in the murder of Gerry Ortega and returned to the US to announce his exit from the group (but not before stowing sugar in the gas tanks and carburetors of the members' cars, plus putting rotten meat in the trunks of cars upholstered with horse hide leather).
Tiny returns to the NCMH and confronts Dr Necter about the revelations. He states that the beauty of Palawan made him appreciate the environment more and changed his goal to promote clean energy. As Mr Shin distracts the NCMH staff with a photo shoot, Tiny and Torres blast open Dr Necter's cell and spring him. Dr Necter and Dr Torres fly back to the US to settle their scores with the group.
Epilogue.
Tiny laments that despite the best efforts of current researchers, she would never see the widespread use of sustainable energy for cars in her lifetime. She and Pao get wind of a news report about a sinkhole that apparently formed underneath a car engine factory in Detroit and presume that Dr Necter did it. Pao is stunned to see that Mr Shin - whom he desires as a sugar daddy - is actually gay.

Poverty is No Vice

Poverty is No Vice (Bednost ne porok, Бедность не порок) is a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, written in 1853 and published as a separate edition in the early 1854. It was premiered in Moscow's Maly Theatre on January 25, 1854 and in Saint Petersburg's Alexandrinsky Theatre on September the 9th.
History.
Ostrovsky started to work upon "Poverty is No Vice" (working title: "God Thwarts the Proud One", Gordym Bog protivitsa) in the late August 1853 and finished it in a record time, just two months. On November 23, 1853, the play was publicly read in Apollon Grigoriev's house, had immense success - in the audience where only friends of the author gathered. The next reading took place at the sculptor Ramazanov’s place with totally different set of guests and again success was immense. For some reason Mikhail Pogodin was wary of publishing the play but it was quickly published as a separate edition and taken by the Maly Theater for Prov Sadovsky's benefice.
"Poverty is No Vice" was premiered on January 25, 1854, with Prov Sadovsky's extraordinary performance as Lyubim Tortsov, the 'virtuous drunkard' but a real Russian man, unlike his rich brother who is ashamed of all things Russian and tries to 'be' an Englishman. The premiere coincided with the famous French actress Rachel's shows, which had to be moved to morning hours. Such juxtaposition served to polarize even more the Moscow theatrical community as regards Ostrovsky's controversial phenomenon.

Gilad Segev

Gilad Segev (in Hebrew גלעד שגב; born 16 November 1974) is an Israeli singer-songwriter and musician.
He broke onto the Israeli music scene in 2004, with his first single, "Achshav Tov". Since then, Segev has released three albums, the most recent of which, "Noadnu", is a gold album.
His style varies between his albums, but Segev generally plays the guitar or sings, with his style varying from pop to rock, and world to folk, while sometimes even including electronic beats.
Early life and education.
He was born in Ramat Gan.
Career.
Segev's musical career began in high school when he started a band Johnny The Fireman with his friend Shy Nobleman, and they recorded some music, including the song "News from the North". By the end of the 1990s, he had started his own band, Gilad Segev and the Ties (יצירת גלעד שגב והעניבות), which did not receive too much recognition.
Then, in 2004, Segev released his first single, "Achsav Tov", which was written about his brother, a captain who was killed during his Israel Defense Forces service, and tells the story of a day the two had spent together just weeks before his passing. The song finished the year as the most-broadcast song on Israeli radio.
The single was followed by the release of his album of the same name, which included a few other singles including "Writing You a Story", which was the theme song for the Israeli television show, "Peach".
In 2006, Segev returned with a new single, "The Love That Stays", which would go on to be the song featured in Israeli telecommunications company Hot's marketing campaign for that year. The song was the namesake for his second album, which he says he wrote over a long period of time where he kept himself alone in his house, just writing music. 
In 2007, he helped Ran Danker and Ilai Botner write the song "Let's Leave", which would go on to win "Song of the Year" at the Israeli Music Channel's yearly award ceremony.
After his second album, Segev says he took some time off in isolation yet again, this time in order to rediscover his Jewish, Syrian and Polish roots and incorporate them into his music. He started learning to play traditional instruments from Syria and eastern Europe in order to accomplish this goal, and altered his artistic focus to creating an experience for the audience to assist them in discovering their own inner identities, as he had. This culminated with a new sound for Segev, which was seen in his third album, "Noadnu" (נועדנו), released in 2009. The album went on to be certified gold, selling over 20,000 copies. It features the song "Woman from the Sky", which went on to garner over two million hits on YouTube, and was Segev's second song to finish a year as Israeli radio's most-broadcast song. The album also included the title song, "Noadnu", which is a cover of the Swedish electronic-music band The Knife's song "Marble House".
In 2011, Segev wrote a song with the band Matbucha Project, a cover of Nathan Alterman's "Chana'leh Hitbalbelah", which finished the year as the fourth-most-played song on Israeli radio in 2011.
In early 2012, he released "Holy Day" (יום קדוש), the first single from his fourth album, which would break the record for most plays in a week on Israeli radio. Later in 2012, he released "The Voices of the Heart", the second single that album and featuring Miri Mesika.
Segev sat as a judge for selecting of the 2012 Israeli entry to Eurovision Song Contest.

Arturo Stable

Arturo Stable (born July 7, 1975) is a Cuban Master percussionist and composer. His diverse musical experience and unique sound have allowed him to work in many environments, but is best known as a Latin Jazz percussionist. He has performed in many famous Jazz Festivals around the world such as the San Francisco Jazz Festival, and Vitoria-Gasteiz Jazz Festival. This talented multi-instrumentalist and brilliant composer has also played with some of the most notable Jazz performers in the world including Paquito D’Rivera, Esperanza Spalding and David Sánchez, just to mention a few.
Early life.
Youth.
Stable was born in Santiago de Cuba, the cradle of the island nation's most important center of culture and home of such elemental music styles as the Guajira and Son. Nurtured in a family that is deeply involved in the performing and visual arts and encouraged by his father Arturo Sr., a musician and a painter, it's not surprising that the youngster began his formal study of music at the age of four, taking piano and theory lessons.
Early education.
When his family moved to Havana, Arturo continued his music education. He earned his first degree, in percussion, at the Amadeo Roldán Conservatory, the same esteemed institution that has over the decades groomed the talents of countless other celebrated Cuban musicians, among them pianists Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Hilario Durán and saxophonist Yosvany Terry.
In 1993, Stable relocated to Puebla, Mexico, a bustling metropolis south of Mexico City. While there, he polished his skills as a percussionist working as a sideman, performing everything from Latin Jazz to rock and traditional Latin styles He also began his career as an educator, teaching classical and Afro-Cuban percussion at the Puebla State University (Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla). At the same time, Stable continued his quest of knowledge, pursuing a post-graduate degree in music education from the Puebla State Development University.
Career development.
2001-07.
His rapidly expanding talents did not go unnoticed. In 2001, Stable received a scholarship to study at the Berklee College of Music. By 2003 he had earned a degree in Contemporary Writing and Production and cultivated friendships with many of the musicians who accompany him on his solo artist career. After graduating from Berklee, Stable released his first album as a leader called “3rd Step” in 2004. The album’s name had its origins in a three-step process that Stable had planned to fulfill his dream of becoming a skillful musician. The first step involved moving to the U.S. in order to have the chance to fulfill his career goals. The second step consisted of furthering his learning and growing musically. Finally, the third step was to create a recording where he could apply all the lessons he had learned (thus far). Stable’s debut album was received with warm reviews including those from Latin Beat Magazine, which stated “Stable, who also composed and arranged, shows that he has staying power with this first project.”
Throughout the years following his debut album, Stable began to expand his musical horizons and enrich his cultural knowledge even more. On July 2006 Stable played as a member of Javier Vercher’s Sexteto for the 30th edition of the Vitoria-Gasteiz Jazz Festival (Spain).
Stable contributed as a co-founder of Musinetwork School of Music (currently the most important music education website for Spanish speakers) in 2007. There, he has reached music students from all over the world who cannot afford the cost of studying abroad with great professors and has helped them master the skills and knowledge they will need to become talented musicians.
Also in 2007, Stable released his 2nd lead album “Notes on Canvas”. The album obtained several great reviews including that of JazzTimes magazine which stated that “Emotive melodies and masterful arrangements reflect his subjects’ origins, while Stable thrusts directly to the center with powerful rhythmic leadership". In this superb Jazz masterpiece that includes the participation of more than a dozen of great musicians, Stable composed each tune inspired by 9 different paintings that Stable chose from his favorite pieces of art. The album’s release was celebrated on December at Cachaça Jazz Club,
where Stable led a stellar quintet, featuring saxophonist Miguel Zenon, pianist Robert Rodriguez, bassist Edward Perez and drummer Henry Cole.
2008-present.
Stable played a major role in the 10th International Puebla Festival (Mexico) on September 2008. During the closing of the event, Stable played as a featured guest with the Puebla State Symphony Orchestra,
which performed one of Stable’s compositions titled “Suite Omnira”.
Following the success from the previous year, Stable returned to Mexico as the Adjunct Artistic Director of the first Puebla Jazz Festival in 2009.
Here, he collaborated with the Puebla State University and other sponsoring institutions to bring an impressive arrangement of great musicians, including Newman Taylor Baker, James Newton, Dave Samuels and Stable himself among many others.
In 2009, Stable also released his 3rd lead album titled “Call” This album won best album of the week in the Latin Jazz Corner
and received great reviews from many notable sources. Latin Jazz Network described it as “craftsmanship at its finest.”
A few months after the album’s release in 2010, DRUM Magazine wrote a 2-page article about Stable and this newly released album. The magazine stated that Call “redefines the outer limits of Latin jazz through complex and compelling original works and an outpouring of virtuosic performances by Stable and his quintet.”
While working resolutely in his career as a performer, Stable’s never-ending thirst for knowledge made him return to the academy to pursue a higher degree in music. In 2010 Stable acquired a Master Degree from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.
On January 2012, Stable teamed up with pianist Elio Villafranca and the Cuban duo crafted an exquisite Jazz album titled “Dos y mas”. In this album, the two great musicians’ similar backgrounds and musically rich experiences can be heard "as these two meld their minds and marry their musical intentions to create a program of organic, original music.”
JazzTimes magazine stated that “their kinship goes far beyond technical facility or theory. It’s more spiritual.”
Stable currently resides in the U.S. where he also serves as an endorser of and clinician for Ritmo Percussion and is the Chair of the Hand Percussion Department at the University of The Arts in Philadelphia. Later in 2012, Stable is also preparing to release in partnership with Ritmo Studios a new line of instruments many of which are his own design. This master percussionist and talented composer is one of the most prominent upcoming Latin Jazz talents of his time.

Barons' Letter, 1301

The Barons' Letter of 1301 was written by seven English earls and 96 English barons to Pope Boniface VIII as a repudiation of his claim of feudal overlordship of Scotland. It was, however, never sent. The letter survives in two copies, known as A and B, both held in the National Archives at Kew under the reference E 26. Historically they were held amongst the documents in the Exchequer, Treasury of the Receipt department.
The seals of the signatories to the letter survive in excellent condition. Although they are now detached from the document, they form the earliest contemporary group of true coats of arms, the rules of heraldry having only been established at around the start of the 1200s, and were stated for that reason by Lord Howard de Walden to be of very great value to students of heraldry. Many of the armorials also appear in the near contemporary Falkirk Roll of Arms made before the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 and in the near contemporaneous stained glass shields in Dorchester Abbey, Oxfordshire.
Purpose.
The letter was written by English barons (mainly feudal barons and a few barons by writ) as a repudiation to the pope of his claim to feudal overlordship of Scotland, which he had expressed in a papal bull dated 27 June 1299 at Agnani. The bull was addressed to King Edward I and it was delivered by Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury at Sweetheart Abbey in Galloway, Scotland, on 26th or 27 August 1300. The bull is preserved in the National Archives at Kew under reference SC 7/6/10.
The king sought the advice of William of Sardinia, a former Dean of Arches to the Archbishop, as to what his response should be, and was presented with various options set out in a letter preserved in the National Archives (C/47/31/15). The bull had been delivered to the king at a sensitive moment, just after the hard-won English victory at the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle over the Scots. Following their defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 the Scots had appealed to the pope for his protection, yet the English had fought to subject their northern neighbour and were not about to release it from under their control, perhaps only to rise up again against them.
The French were the real movers of the pope's claim, having suggested the move to him as a means to effect protection of the Scots, then their allies under the Auld Alliance, and were themselves allied with the Scots against the English. An English attack on a kingdom the feudal overlord of which was the pope would be virtually unthinkable in political and religious terms. There was thus no question of the English even considering the pope's claim, and the tone of the barons' reply to him is one of anger and open defiance, devoid of almost any of the diplomatic niceties with which the papal bull was replete.
In the event, the Barons' Letter was never sent to the pope, as events changed rapidly to such an extent that it appeared superfluous. A letter to the same effect from the king had however been sent to the pope; it is now held in the Vatican Archives with a copy in the National Archives at Kew under reference C 54/118. It was stored away within the archives of the Exchequer, where the two copies of it remained for several centuries until transferred to Public Record Office under the custody of the Master of the Rolls before 1903 and more recently transferred to the National Archives at Kew.

Seals.
The letter was composed and sealed at the parliament specially convened for the purpose of replying to the Pope's letter held at Lincoln between 13–20 January 1301. To it were summoned 9 earls and 80 barons, yet 7 earls and 96 barons are recorded in the letter itself as co-authors. Those barons who did not answer the summons sealed the letter later.
The seals appended by hempen cords to Exemplar B were "tricked" (i.e. reproduced by drawing) by Lancaster Herald Nicholas Charles in 1611. He also made a transcript of Exemplar B., which clearly was then in a better state of preservation than today. Whilst his drawings provide much detail which is otherwise difficult to see in photographs of the seals themselves, some of his transcripts of the legends are inaccurate.
In 1903 Lord Howard de Walden published Charles' drawings and a facsimile of his transcript, and also two sets of photographic images of the seals from Exemplar A; firstly of all the surviving individual cords of seals in colour (showing one face only of each seal), and secondly black and white images of each constituent seal on the cord, obverse and reverse (where existing). The number of surviving seals (series unspecified) is given as 95 by the National Archives catalogue entry, and as 72 (7 earls and 65 barons) by Brian Timms. Photographic images were published by Brian Timms on his heraldry website.

Abram Garfield

Abram Garfield (November 21, 1872 – October 16, 1958) was the youngest son of President James A. Garfield and Lucretia Rudolph Garfield, and an architect who practiced in Cleveland, Ohio.
Garfield received a bachelor of arts from Williams College in 1893 and a bachelor of science in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three years later. By 1898, Garfield had joined with Frank Meade to form the architectural firm Meade & Garfield in Cleveland, Ohio; the firm was noted for its residential designs. When the partnership ended in 1905, Garfield opened his own firm, which he ran until 1951. Garfield specialized in residential architecture, designing large houses in Shaker Heights and other Cleveland suburbs, but his work also included more modest houses for the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority and institutional projects such as schools and a hospital. Garfield served as chairman of the Cleveland Planning Commission from 1930 to 1942 and was a founder and first president of the Cleveland School of Architecture, which became part of Western Reserve University in 1941. He was named a trustee of the university that year and two years later was made an honorary lifetime member of the board; he received an honorary doctorate from Western Reserve University in 1945. Garfield was also a director of the American Institute of Architects from 1919 to 1922 and served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1925 to 1930, including as vice chairman from 1929 to 1930. In 1949 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

Bandspread

In a radio receiver, a bandspread control is a secondary tuning control that allows accurate tuning of closely spaced frequencies of a radio band. With a main tuning control that covered a wide range of frequencies, for example 10-14 megahertz in a few turns of the tuning knob, a very small motion might chang the tuning by tens of kilohertz and would make accurate tuning to any given frequency difficult. A calibrated bandspread tuning control would allow the main tuning to be set to a predefined spot on the control and the bandspread would allow tuning of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main tuning control. 
One method of adding a bandspread control was to put a relatively small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency. A second method, mechanical bandspread, was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the bandspread dial moved the main dial through a small part of its range, improving the precision of tuning.
Bandspread controls were found on communications receivers, amateur radio receivers, and some broadcast receivers. With the advent of digital frequency synthesizers that could be set with high resolution by a keypad or incremental tuning knob, the requirement for bandspread control in many applications was eliminated.

Puppeteer (video game)

Puppeteer (パペッティア) is a platformer game developed by SCE Japan Studio for the PlayStation 3 It is directed by Gavin Moore; who served as lead animator on "The Getaway", "Forbidden Siren 2" and "". The game was released worldwide on September 2013.
It is playable in both traditional 2D and in 3D. Gavin Moore says "Puppeteer" plays better in 3D than other games because the camera doesn’t move and his team used a method of 3D that hasn’t resulted in a reduced frame-rate.
Gameplay.
"Puppeteer" is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls a boy named Kutaro, who has been turned into a puppet and had his head torn off. Throughout the game, Kutaro is able to find various types of heads to replace his own, each with its own unique ability. Kutaro is armed with a pair of magical scissors: not only do the scissors serve as a weapon, but they can also cut through anything made of paper or fabric, dragging Kutaro behind them and taking him to otherwise inaccessible areas.
If Kutaro is damaged by an enemy or obstacle, he loses his head, which rolls away. Should the player not retrieve the head within a few seconds, it will disappear. Kutaro can hold up to three heads at a time, and when they are all lost, he loses a life. The player can earn an extra life by collecting 100 "Moonsparkles".
The game is playable by one or two players. If two are playing, the second player controls Kutaro's companion (initially a ghostly cat named Ying-Yang), who can examine foreign objects and find new heads for Kutaro. In single-player mode, the two analog sticks on the joypad each control a character.
The game is presented as a puppet show in front of an audience, who can be heard cheering and laughing when impressive actions take place on-stage. It is divided into seven "acts", each of which comprises three "curtains". Each curtain has a set number of heads to collect, a set number of souls to rescue, and a hidden area. If the player is aiming for 100% completion, he will have to revisit old curtains once he has gained new abilities.
Plot.
Once upon a time, the Moon Realm was ruled by a beautiful Goddess. But then Little Bear, to whom the Goddess had shown nothing but love, stole two of his mistress's precious possessions: the Black Moonstone, and a magic pair of scissors known as Calibrus. After declaring himself Moon Bear King, he invaded the Goddess's castle, and smashed the White Moonstone to pieces, thereby obliterating the Goddess. He then gave a shard of the White Moonstone to each of his twelve generals (the animals of the Chinese Zodiac), who proceeded to wreak havoc on the moon. 
Night after night, the King spirited away the souls of Earth's children, and locked them inside wooden puppets. The children were then doomed to serve as slaves in the King's mobile fortress, Castle Grizzlestein.
One of those unfortunate children is a boy named Kutaro. He awakens in his new puppet body in the clutches of the King, who asks if he would be his friend. Kutaro agrees, but the King calls him a liar, bites off his wooden head, and tosses his puppet body into the dungeons.
Kutaro is found by the Goddess's pet cat, Ying Yang, who saves the boy's life by helping him to find a new temporary head. Ying Ying leads Kutaro out of the dungeons and to the kitchens, to meet his current mistress, the Moon Witch Ezma Potts. The witch, who is being forced to cook endlessly to feed the King's insatiable appetite, instructs the pair to infiltrate the throne room and take Calibrus, the key to overthrowing the evil King. Unbeknownst to Kutaro, the Witch has already sent many puppet-children on this dangerous mission, all of whom perished before reaching their goal.
With the player's help, Kutaro succeeds in finding Calibrus, which immediately chooses him as its new master. This weapon allows Kutaro to fight the King's puppets and release the souls trapped within, allowing them to escape back to Earth. As Kutaro flees the castle, the infuriated King commands General Tiger to pursue him and take back the scissors.
Kutaro returns to the Witch with his prize, but Calibrus refuses to be taken away from its new master. The power to defeat the evil tyrant is in the hands of Kutaro alone.
General Tiger catches up with Kutaro, but the Witch throws him off the scent by hiding the puppet boy in her skirts. Before leaving, the General accidentally mentions "the power of the Knight," hidden somewhere inside the castle. The Witch sends Kutaro and Ying Yang back up into the castle to investigate. Assisted by the player, Kutaro not only retrieves the enchanted Knight's Shield. The shield belonged to the Knight, one of the Goddess's 4 champions who led a revolt against the Moon Bear King but failed due to the Knight's cowardice. Kutaro then defeats General Tiger, claims his shard of the White Moonstone, and rescues Pikarina, the Princess of the Sun, whom the Moon Bear King had captured and transformed into a puppet.
The gang retreat to the Goddess's abandoned home, Castle Whaxx Whane where they set up base. Pikarina expresses distrust for Potts as she secretly conspires to be the Moon's new goddess. Under Potts' guidance, Kutaro and Pikarina venture to the various realms of the moon, taking down the remaining 11 generals and reconstructing the White Moonstone.
Development.
On July 21, 2010, Sony filed a trademark titled "Puppeteer". It has been speculated that it would be a game that would make use of the PlayStation Move technology in order to control the main character. Two years later, the trademark was later revealed to be indeed for a game with its official announcement at Gamescom 2012.
In December 2012, Gavin Moore, the director of the video game, posted an entry on the European PlayStation Blog, stating that the video game is "Shaping up nicely, playing great and looking awesome. From January we will be polishing, refining and adding extra little details, to make the whole experience something fantastical and wonderful that PlayStation fans deserve. I will be in London for two weeks doing the Voice recordings in January, popping across to Budapest for the music recordings, then back to Japan with all my wonderful assets to shove them lovingly into the game. This is one of my favourite parts of game creation. Getting the final assets into the game really brings everything together."

École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Tunis

École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Tunis, ("المدرسة الوطنية العليا للمهندسين بتونس") in Arabic, ("Tunis national higher school of engineering)" as translated to English, commonly known as ENSIT, is a public institution of higher education and scientific research and a member of the University of Tunis.
ENSIT establishment was a response to the increasing industrialization of Tunisia. The school is currently an ""école d'ingénieurs"" or a school of engineering as translated from French which follows to some extent the European polytechnic university model. In 2011, the main focus of ENSIT was to form engineers with high scientific aptitude in the fields of civil, mechanical, electrical engineering and computer science. The academic year of 2012/2013 brought two more specializations: industrial engineering and applied mathematics. The change of curriculum has dictated an end to the LMD reforms ("License, Master, Doctorate") by which the admission process was organized. However, the school will still retain its doctorate and masters programs.
History.
Established in 1973, the ENSIT was known as École Normale Supérieure de l'Enseignement Technique which was an accredited higher education institution that reformed professors in electrical engineering and industrial science.

The 'Lights (TV show)

"The 'Lights" is a daily morning sports highlights program on NBC Sports Network that launched in August 2012. "The Lights" is different from ESPN's "SportsCenter" because it is presented as repeating 20-minute segments in which scores and replays from the previous day's games are shown with David Diamante acting as the unseen anchor. Split-screen coverage includes highlights on one side while the screen's other side shows comments, like interviews or post-game press conferences, pertaining to the highlights. Originally for 2 hours from 7-9 AM., the program has since expanded to 3 hours from 6-9 AM. 
The program was placed on hiatus during the Stanley Cup Playoffs and was scheduled to be re-tooled to re-air in late August 2013. However, as yet, the program has not returned to the air.

In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law. DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why."

Congressman DeSantis recently spoke at a Ripon Society forum and addressed the 2013 IRS scandal and tax reform. DeSantis echoed his colleagues on understanding the main part of government. "Part of having a constitutional government is that you have an accountable government", he stated. He went on to say that he "think(s) we make a huge mistake if we try to generate political outcomes, thinking that it will help us politically or that we’re trying to bring somebody down. I think it’s necessary if we are just trying to find the truth and hold individuals accountable. I think we need to see more of that in this government."

Rolling Wave planning

Rolling Wave Planning is the process of project planning in waves as the project proceeds and later details become clearer. 
Work to be done in the near term is based on high level assumptions; also, high level milestones are set. As the project progresses, the risks, assumptions, and milestones originally identified become more defined and reliable. One would use Rolling Wave Planning in an instance where there is an extremely tight schedule or timeline to adhere to; whereas more thorough planning would have placed the schedule into an unacceptable negative schedule variance.
This is an approach that iteratively plans for a project as it unfolds, similar to the techniques used in Scrum (development) and 
other forms of Agile software development. The concepts of Rolling Wave Planning and Progressive Elaboration are techniques within the PMBOK Define Activities process and it also describes how the Project Management Plan evolves.

Grup d'Acció Valencianista

The Grup d'Acció Valencianista (GAV) (Group of Valencianist Action) is a blaverist organization which was created in 1977. They 
define themselves as "the fighting and warlike faction of real valencianism". Nonetheless, they are generally considered
as a fascist group or as an extreme right group due to their activities.
Along their history, they have used repeatedly violence, especially their youth wing.
Some of their threatening actions against education centers, and individuals, associations and democratic parties have been made with false names, such as "Maulets 1707" or "Colectiu Vinatea" (sic).
Historical background.
The main Valencianism after the Spanish Civil War (the ""new Valencianism"", according to Joan Fuster) generally had a progressive ideology. Its main feature was a breaking-off from Francoist ideology and also against the tendencies of traditional Valencianism before the Spanish Civil War. The blaverism was born as a reaction against that. and the GAV was allegedly created in order to unify the regionalist people that defended Spain as their nation. They also tried to embody ""traditional Valencianism"".
The ideas of "new valencianism" were considered by the GAV as the ""essence and symbol of the imperialist pancatalanism that aimed at the annexation of the Kingdom of Valencia into the illegal Catalan Countries"". With this kind of justification, during the Spanish transition, the GAV tried to create a controversial atmosphere in order to stop the process of the approval of the Valencian Country Statute of Autonomy. According to the critics of blaverism, the GAV had been infiltrated by important men and women from the Francoist right. Some people consider it a terrorist group. In fact, the UCD representative, Emilio Attard, introduced members from the GAV into the ranks of his own party.
During the festivities of 9 October (the Valencian regional day) in 1979, a group of people linked to the GAV burned the Flag of the pre-autonomous Council of the Valencian Country, that was waving from the balcony of Valencia City Hall, with a fuse that was created by Rafael Orellano, who was then a UCD city councillor, and who had been previously president of GAV. At the same time, some members of the Pre-Autonomous Council of the Valencian Country were assaulted. 
From then on, the GAV began to play an important role inside blaverism, and it claimed responsibility for violent actions, in order to try to justify their ideals. 
Nowadays, they have a very reduced and limited presence. Nonetheless, they continue their acts of extortion and persecution.
Violent actions.
Two terrorist attacks against Manuel Sanchis i Guarner's and Joan Fuster's lives (in 1979 and 1981 respectively) with extremely powerful explosives were made by people that in some respect were linked with the GAV. Nobody claimed responsibility for these actions. Nobody was prosecuted either. Nonetheless, according to the legal process, they were "vandalistic actions". The fact that GAV has never claimed responsibility for these facts, but they have claimed responsibility for one terrorist attack against Sanchis-Guarner in 1978 as a "reaction of the Valencian people against the Catalanist agression" and as a "not bloody action" show the ideological proximity between the aggressors and this organisation. 
Two months after these "vandalistic" acts, Sanchis-Guarner died of a heart attack. On the other hand, Joan Fuster acknowledged in a TV interview in 1992 that he had decided to abandon active social life because that terrorist attack had caused him to be depressed. Nonetheless, the GAV does not define itself as a fighting or terrorist group. 
In their magazine, "SOM", the GAV apologised for the terrorist attack against Sanchis-Guarner in October 2002, just after the crime was prescribed, and therefore it was not possible to condemn the guilty ones. 
Among their most famous violent acts, was the boycott of a David Rosenthal speech inside the Llotja de València because of his Tirant lo Blanc's translation into English, in January 1985. Some GAV supporters (among them Carles Recio, a so-called modern Valencian intellectual), delivered mice through the "Llotja" in order to disrupt the speech.
Juan García Sentandreu acknowledged in front of a Spanish judge that he had attacked a Catalan television car with eggs after an illegal demonstration against the "Consell Valencià de Cultura" (a consultative Valencian culture organisation). During this illegal demonstration, the members of this official institution were also attacked. 
On 1 December 2007, GAV members delived pamphlets around "La Garrigosa" high school, in Meliana. These pamphlets contained photos and personal details of some of the teachers of this high school, such as their personal addresses. They were accused of being "Catalanists". In these pamphlets the neighbours were encouraged to "stand up against them". These actions are thus similar to making political "black lists".
On January 2008, some GAV put threatening and xenophobic graffiti on the walls of the cultural association "Ca Revolta" and the "Centre Social-Bar Terra". These places had a strong link with Valencia's progressive and nationalist environment. 
In the same month. the Casal Jaume I from "Acció Cultural del País Valencià" (a nationalist cultural Valencian organization) in Catarroja, was attacked by unknown people with a bomb of hydrochloric acid while a meeting of the civic platform "Salvem Catarroja" (Let's save Catarroja) was held inside it. The victims had declared that they suspected GAV involvement. Some days before, members of this civic platform received death threats by phone, and the barrack huts that they used in order to store their materials had been attacked while they were making a demonstration against the speculation. Several objects were stolen, and other ones were broken or painted. The authors had signed in the barrack huts with the acronym "JJGAV".
In February 2008, the Valencian Nationalist Bloc headquarters were attacked by a group of people who put graffiti on the door and broke the lock. The BLOC linked these people with GAV.
In November 2010 GAV sent a letter to UNESCO, in which they opposed castells becoming part of the World Heritage according to their standards. They argued that children that took part in that were in danger. They also had the aim of showing that in Valencia "there could be interferences of Catalan culture". the report was rejected.
Legal sentences and arrests.
During the campaign for the 1996 Spanish general election, three supporters of the Valencian nacionalist party "Unitat del Poble Valencià" (UPV) were menaced and injured by members of GAV. The current president of this organisation, Manolo Latorre, was condemned by these facts.
Similarly, during the civic procession of 9 October 1997, Juan García Sentandreu, who was then president of GAV, pushed, threatened to kill and insulted Pere Palés, who was a nationalist and progressive member of the youths of the blaverist party "Unió Valenciana". Sentandreu was ordered to pay two fines of 70,000 pesetas.
On 29 December 2003 some members of GAV assaulted people and broke into the "Casal Jaume I" (nationalist center) in the "Russafa" district of Valencia), which was made by Alejandro Esteve Caballero, José Luis Conejero Asunción and Amalia Lidia Bonheme. The three members of the GAV were condemned to prison because of these facts. The legal condemn stated a crime of theft with force and a fault (crime of lesser cathegory in the Spanish Law) of damages, with the aggravating circumstance of ideological discrimination but with the mitigating factor of damages repair.
Alejandro Esteve was, when the assault took place, the president of the youths of the GAV. After this sentence, the youths of the GAV were expelled from the Valencian Youth Council and Esteve was disqualified from holding positions in the boards of associations. At the same time, the GAV expelled Alejandro Esteve. After that, he founded the "Plataforma Jovenil Valencianista" (Valencianist Youth Platform).
On 14 December 2007 some members of the JJGAV assaulted the "Casal Jaume I" in Sueca, with the aim of avoiding the presentation of Eric Bertran's book ""Èric i l' exèrcit del fènix"" (Eric and the army of the phoenix), and they assaulted several people. Four members of the JJGAV were arrested by the municipal police.
On January 2008, three ERC deputies at the Spanish Congress of Deputies were withheld inside the building of Valencia where they were launching a book. Around fifty extreme right people were responsible, and they were throwing glass bottles against the façade of the building, while they were insulting and menacing. 24 people, linked with the GAV, were sentenced to pay a fine of 3.000€ each one.
On 26 September 2008, a group of extreme right activists, who were gathered by the Gandia section of the GAV, they made an illegal demonstration when the fire of the "Correllengua" came to Gandia. When it happened, Maité Peiró, town councilor of the Valentian Nacionalist Bloc in L'Alqueria de la Comtessa was hit by a stone on her head. It caused her an injure that needed 12 stitches. 18 people from the ones that caused the riot were identified, and were fined with 301 euros for "illegal demonstration" and for "insulting and rebuking the police and the public", although Maite Peiró's attacker could not be identified.
On December 2008, and after several reports by the "Movement against Intolerance", the Valentian Nacionalist Bloc or the Youth Council of Valencia, the festivities counciliorship pf the City Hall of Valencia announced more control in order to avoid the distribution of political pamphlets in "Expojove" (fair for the children that takes place in Christmas), but it did not ban the GAV, as the it was requested, since they said that "they had not seen any judicial sentence against the youths of the GAV". Finally, the GAV was banned from this fair for children in 2010.
On 5 July 2011, some members of the GAV and España 2000 boycotted the launch of Vicent Flor's book "Noves Glòries a Espanya" (New glories for Spain), that took place in the FNAC of Valencia. After that, the GAV's ex-president Juan García Sentandreu was arrested and taken by the police to jail.
As a consequence of these facts, the Parliament of Catalonia condemned the "repeated attacks of the extreme right" in the Valencian Country. Previously, Coalició Compromís had already proposed a similar motion in the Corts Valencianes, but it had been rejected by the People's Party.
Publications and performances.
The GAV is one of the institutions that consider that Valencian is different from the Catalan language. So they signed in 1981 the Normes del Puig (which state a different ortography for the Valencian variety of the Catalan language). It is a member and also founder of the "Coordinadora d'Entitats Culturals del Regne de València" (Coordinator of Cultural Institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia).
The GAV has published several books and magazines according to their own ortographical rules. They have published books for children such as "Nelo i Carmeta", "Avant", "Pobles i gents", and also propaganda books such as "La Llengua Valenciana en perill", "Valencians front al catalanisme". Moreover, it created el "Colectiu de Mestres de la Secció de Pedagogia" (sic) (Group of teachers of the Pedagogy Section), which made dictionaries Valencian-Spanish/Spanish-Valencian according to the normes del Puig.
The GAV has also created a prize, called ""Premi Llealtat""(sic) (Loyalty Prize), which they give to the people that "have kept their spirit of defense of the Kingdom of Valencia"". Among the people that have received this prize, there are the following ones: Ricart Garcia Moya, Miguel Ramón Izquierdo, Lleopolt Penyarroja and Josep Mª Guinot.
Furthermore, they publish a magazine called SOM, which appears iiregularly. This magazine publishes opinion articles of authors that share the group ideology, they criticize the Valencian government, the corruption of the mass-media and the "attacks" from Catalanism against the Valencian people.

These days, the GAV looks for new supporters through the JJGAV (Youths of the GAV). This organization is quite often linked with other groups, such as España 2000 (extreme right Spanish political party, with its headquarters in Valencia). Some GAV activists are even E2000 activists at the same time.
The Youth's program is almost exclusively based on anticatalanist actions, such as the boycotts against Catalan products, demonstrations, protest acts, and so on.
The present leaders ot the GAV's Youths are Aitor Alan Marquina Bañuls and Gonzalo Palanca González. Both of them have been involved in radical and violent acts. Moreover, it seems that there would be a third leader of the youths, that until now is still unidentified.

Industry change.
Saxon has been active in various industry organisations, particularly those promoting more collaborative approaches to project delivery. For example, he was a member and - from 1999-2002 - chairman of the Reading Construction Forum, which played a key role during the late 1990s in applying the recommendations of the 1994 Latham and 1998 Egan Reports. He was also involved with the Design Build Foundation (1997-2002) and BE: Collaborating for the Built Environment (2002-2005).

National Water Policy

National Water Policy is formulated by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Government of India to govern the planning and development of water resources and their optimum utilization. The first National Water Policy was adopted in September, 1987. It was reviewed and updated in 2002 and later in 2012.
India accounts for 15% of the world population and about 4% of the world’s water resources. One of the solutions to solve the country’s water woes is to link the rivers.
India has been successful in creating live water storage capacity of about 253 billion cubic meter(BCM) so far. In a first, the ecological needs of river have also been taken into consideration.
Salient features.
The major provisions under the policy are:
The policy also deals with participation of farmers and voluntary agencies, water quality, water zoning, conservation of water, flood and drought management, erosion etc.
National Water Policy 2012.
The main emphasis of National Water Policy 2012 is to treat water as "economic good" which the ministry claims to promote its conservation and efficient use. This provision intended for the privatization of water-delivery services is being criticized from various quarters. The policy also does away with the priorities for water allocation mentioned in 1987 and 2002 versions of the policy. The policy was adopted with a disapproval from many states.

Ars Moriende

Ars Moriende is an album by bass guitarist Jonas Hellborg, released in 1994 through Day Eight Music. Performed together with percussionist and overtone singer Glen Velez, the recording is a journey into a state of meditation on the subject of life and death.
The three relatively long pieces tell a story that's in turn relaxing and impetuous, and simultaneously modern and ancient, familiar and exotic sounding. "As always, Hellborg amazes with his skill and emotiveness." (Walter Kolosky for Jazz.com)
The album was awarded a Swedish Grammy for the best instrumental album of the year 1994.
Album Theme.
This music was written in a period when Hellborg was exploring the reality of Death, its symbolic meanings and 
its significance in human cultures. To evolve, people often have to die under a certain aspect, to put an end to an identity within, in order to continue with a new life chapter.
The piece "Regicide" is inspired by the ritual, common in some ancient cultures, of killing their king at the end of his 7 years rule. This can also be seen as a metaphor for the contemporary public's mindset in making and breaking celebrities - when a star's popularity fades, he's forgotten (symbolically killed) and a new "king" is appointed.
Instruments.
Jonas Hellborg plays here two acoustic bass guitars, an Ovation and The Roman Bass, an instrument custom built for Hellborg by luthier Abraham Wechter, also heard on some of his other albums (Aram of the Two Rivers, Silent Life, Octave of the Holy Innocents).
Glen Velez, whose rhythms evoke the Middle East, India and Western Europe, uses as a main instrument is the frame drum, which has a drumhead diameter wider than its depth.

Jaga mohan

A Jaga Mohan or Jagamohan or "Jagamohana" is an assembly hall in the Hindu temple architecture, especially in Orissa.
It is located between the temple entrance and the Garba griha that is to say, the heart of the sanctuary. It is typical of the Nagara architecture temples of northern India. In the south of India, the halls are named "mandapas" which are often large halls with columns.
As garba griha, it is most often built on a plan based on structures of squares and circles. However, for the temples of goddesses, the jaga mohan is built on a plan based on structures of rectangles and triangles. Such as for example the plan of the temple of Varahi Deula at Chaurasi near Puri in Orissa.
Generally the garbhagriha is a windowless and sparsely lit chamber, intentionally created thus to focus the devotee's mind on the tangible form of the divine within it. On the contrary, the jaga mohan is highly decorated with sculptures of deities, mythologic scenes or ornements.
The most famous is the one of the Temple of Surya at Konark. Due to the collapse of the main temple tower (Sikhara), the jaga mohan now appears to be the main building of the temple.

Lillian Feickert

Lillian Ford Feickert (July 20, 1877 – January 21, 1945) was an American suffragette, New Jersey state political organizer, and the first woman from New Jersey to run for United States Senate. She served as the President of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association from 1912 to 1920, and later helped organize the New Jersey League of Women Voters. She went on to serve as the Vice-Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee and unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in 1928.
Personal background.
Lillian Ford was born on July 20, 1877 in Brooklyn, New York. She was the daughter of Herbert L. and Emeline Margaretta (née Kirkland) Ford. Her father was a lawyer and her mother was a homemaker. She had three siblings, two brothers and one sister.
On December 6, 1902, Ford married Edward Foster Feickert. They had one child, who died in infancy. Following their wedding, they moved to Plainfield, New Jersey, when Edward became an assistant secretary at the Plainfield Trust Company. In 1908, the Feickerts moved North Plainfield Township, near the foothills of Watchung Mountains. Between 1902 and 1910, Edward had served as assistant secretary and treasurer of the Plainfield Trust Company, followed by his taking the reins of the company as the Vice President of the company that would later emerge as the State Trust Company.
Professional background.
After arriving in North Plainfield, Feickert began expressing a passion for women's rights, along with an interest in the women's suffrage movement. She also took on a leadership role in her local congregation at Grace Episcopal Church of Plainfield. She taught mission study classes for the Episcopal Church at both the local and state levels. She also became a member of local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association.
In 1910, Clara Laddey, President of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association appointed Feickert to serve as the organization's enrollment chairman. She served in this capacity for two years, resulting in a positive impact on membership during this time and was consequently elected President of the association in 1912. Over the next eight years, she sharpened her political skills, as well as her leadership ability, and increased membership to over 120,000 members. Feickert was considered the leader of the New Jersey suffrage movement and represented them in attempts to gain the right to vote. After failing to have a state suffrage amendment approved in 1915, she worked harder than ever before and was selected to lead several organizations in their attempt to have the federal suffrage amendment ratified. The state legislature officially ratified the amendment on February 10, 1920.
In 1920, the New Jersey State Republican Party recognized Feickert's achievements and named her vice-chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. With this position, Feickert was assigned the job of organizing the Republican women in New Jersey. At the same time, she was also appointed treasurer of the New Jersey League of Women Voters, a position she left approximately a year later due to a difference of opinion regarding the direction the organization was headed. With more time on her hands, Lillian began focusing her attention on the New Jersey Women's Republican Club, of which she was President. Financial backing from the Republican organization allowed membership to reach up to 100,000 members.
As a firm supporter of Prohibition and insistent women's rights activist, the Republican party cut off funding to the NJWRC and failed to re-elect Feickert as vice-chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee in 1925. The New Jersey Women's Republican Club slowly began to fall apart and was eventually replaced by the Women's State Republican Club of New Jersey in 1929. Feickert unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1928 as a pro-Prohibition candidate. Upon her failed attempt at Senate and the defeat of Prohibition, she stepped away from politics. Having divorced her husband in 1925, her remaining years were spent working on her home, reading, and traveling. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Saint Vincent's Hospital in New York City on January 21, 1945.

Tim O'Toole (businessman)

Tim O'Toole CBE JD is an American businessman, the current Chief Executive of Scottish-headquartered global transport company, FirstGroup.
Early life.
Born in Pittsburgh, one grandfather was an assistant general manager on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, while the other was a trolley car driver. After studying law at La Salle University, Philadelphia, he attended law school at the University of Pittsburgh.
Career.
Conrail.
After training as a lawyer, he joined Conrail in 1987 as a Vice President in the legal department, preferring to spend his working days in the train depot at Stanley Yard in Walbridge, Ohio, the primary classification yard for Toledo. After serving as Senior Vice President of Law and Government Affairs at subsidiary Consolidated Rail Corporation, he served as Group Vice President and General Counsel from May 1989 to April 1994. Moving into finance and accounting, O'Toole served as Senior Vice President from April 1996.
From 1997, competitors CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) had been in a takeover battle for Conrail. However, under an agreement with the Surface Transportation Board, Norfolk Southern acquired 58 percent of Conrail's assets, including roughly 6,000 Conrail route miles; and CSX received 42 percent of Conrail's assets, including about 3,600 route miles.
The agreement was put in place on August 22, 1998, under which newly appointed Chief Executive O'Toole transferred the lines to two newly formed limited liability companies, to be subsidiaries of Conrail but leased to CSX and Norfolk Southern, respectively: New York Central Lines (NYC); Pennsylvania Lines (PRR). The NYC and PRR reporting marks, which had passed to Conrail, were also transferred to the new companies, and NS also acquired the CR reporting mark. Operations under CSX and NS began June 1, 1999.
In three major metropolitan areas - North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit - Conrail Shared Assets Operations continues to serve as a terminal operating company owned by both CSX and NS. The Conrail Shared Assets Operations arrangement was a concession made to federal regulators who were concerned about the lack of competition in certain rail markets and logistical problems associated with the breaking up the Conrail operations as they existed in densely populated areas with many local customers. The smaller Conrail operation that exists today serves rail freight customers in these markets on behalf of its two owners. A fourth area, the former Monongahela Railway in southwest Pennsylvania, was originally owned jointly by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O), Pennsylvania Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE). Conrail absorbed the company in 1993, and assigned trackage rights to CSX, the successor to the B&O and P&LE. With the Conrail breakup, those lines are owned by NS, but the CSX trackage rights are still in place.
O'Toole served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Conrail until to 2001, succeed by Gregory R. Weber.
Since 2008, he has served as both the President of residual Conrail company CRR Holdings LLC that owns the Conrail Shared Assets Operations, and is an independent director and member of the Audit Committee at CSX Transportation.
London Underground.
While looking to retire, he was offered the job as Managing Director of London Underground. Appointed by Mayor of London Ken Livingstone in 2002, during his tenure O'Toole led the response to the 7/7 terrorist attacks:
In light of his leadership during the terrorist attack, O'Toole was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2005 New Years Honours List.
In February 2009, he resigned for personal reasons from his £450,000 position, citing his requirement to spend more time with his wife who was unwilling to move to London.
As one of his last acts, O'Toole secured an additional £2bn of support from the Department for Transport in the wake of the collapse of Metronet. O'Toole commented before his exit, that Londoners should "scream bloody murder" if the Metronet upgrade of the Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines is delayed or scaled back because of funding problems.
FirstGroup.
In May 2009, he was appointed a non-executive on the board of FirstGroup. Appointed Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief Executive in June 2010, in light of the retirement of Sir Moir Lockhead 21 years after founding the group, on 1 November 2010 O'Toole was appointed FirstGroup CEO.

Sabueso Cántabro

The Sabueso cántabro or Cantabrian Scenthound is an scenthound breed with its origin in Cantabria, the far north of Iberian Peninsula. This breed has being used in this mountainous region since hundreds of years ago in all kind of game: wild boar, hare, brown bear, wolf, red deer, fox, roe deer and chamois. It is an exclusive working breed, employed in hunting with firearms. 
The first reports of its existence are from the early nineteenth century in the mountains of Cantabria.
Always tricolor, the breed exhibits predominantly black colour with white and chestnut spots. This scenthound is notable for its great sense of smell and its sociability with other dogs. For this reason is employed as an assistant in packs in the game, especially for hares and wild boar.
After years of degeneration by crosses it is been recovered by the Spanish Cantabrian Scenthound Association founded in 2005.

Design and construction.
Designed by Thomas Parker for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR), a total of 55 locomotives were constructed up to 1892. The MS&LR changed its name to the GCR in 1897. In 1892 the final fourteen locomotives were built with a larger coal bunker, increasing their weight to 
The GCR 9A locos were reclassified as N4 under the LNER locomotive numbering and classification system when the GCR was absorbed into the London & North Eastern Railway after the 1923 grouping. The original design were N4/2 and those with extended bunkers N4/4.
In 1925, shorter chimneys began to be fitted to bring the N4s within the LNER Composite Loading Gauge, creating two further variant s N4/1 (short bunker) and N4/3 (long bunker).
Locomotive numbering.
They were built in three batches and numbered 161, 165, 173 (later renumbered 512–514), 601–638, and 712–725. GCR locos had 5000 added to their original numbers when the line was absorbed by the LNER in 1923, resulting in numbers ranging between 5512 and 5725. As part of the LNER's numbering rationalisation scheme introduced in 1946, the surviving 24 N4s were renumbered between 9225 and 9247 with the earliest built receiving the lowest number, and so on. British Railways, formed on 1 January 1948, added 60000 to all LNER loco numbers.

Okhta Center

Okhta Center or phonetically Oḱhta-Tseńtr (Russian: О́хта-це́нтр), known before March 2007 as Gazprom City (Russian:Газпро́м-си́ти), is a failed construction project of a business centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was supposed to include the first supertall skyscraper in the city. The 403 meters high main tower of Okhta Centre is set to be the tallest building in Europe amongst live building proposals. This project, remained unrealised, was supposed to house headquarters of the Gazprom energy company, along with museums, library, sports and leisure facilities, and a concert hall. It was to be build in the mouth of the river Okhta, on the right bank of the river Neva. Its 403-meter high tower was conceived not only as a dominant, but also as a new symbol of Saint Petersburg. It was to be completed by 2016. However, the project met fierce opposition from citizens, civil groups, and international organizations. When the project ideas were introduced to international jury, three out of four architects walked off the jury in protest, the competition was also boycotted by the Russian Union of Architects. It was eventually relocated to the new site Lakhta in Saint Petersburg in December 2010. 
The core design team of the Okhta Centre includes Chief Design Architect Charles Phu, Russian architect Philip Nikandrov, Roger Whiteman and Tony Kettle. In 2008, Arabtec, the construction company involved in construction of the world’s tallest building in Dubai, has won a contract to build this 60 billion-ruble ($2.56 billion)  complex.
Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller claimed that he is "positive that St. Petersburg’s citizens will be proud of these new architectural masterpieces." However, the Director of the Hermitage Museum, Mikhail Piotrovsky, has spoken out against the plan. Russia's culture ministry has also been reported to object to the tower's plan.
As the historical centre of Saint Petersburg is a World Heritage Site in 1991; in December 2006 UNESCO World Heritage centre Director Francesco Bandarin reminded Russia about its obligations to preserve it and expressed concern over the project. In 2007, the World Monuments Fund placed the historic skyline of St. Petersburg on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites due to the potential construction of the building, and in 2009 reported that the tower "would damage the image of Russia." 
In 2010 it was reported by Russian and UK press that the project's designer Charles Phu said at a public debate in London that the architect has been getting regular memoranda from Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, encouraging them to go ahead with the project of Okhta Centre and promising support from the government. This was proved to be untrue according to Putin, Phu himself and the debate participants. This controversial report, followed by heated public discussions, has resulted in certain impact on the politics in Russia.
Lakhta Center, presently under development on a site farther from Saint Petersburg's historic center, is based on the Okhta Center plans including its main tower, but on an even larger scale.
__TOC__
Project design.
Gazprom City project was first introduced in November 2006. Russian Academy of Arts hosted an exhibit of the six competitive designs.
Jury.
Representatives from Gazprom
Representatives from the Saint Petersburg administration
Architects
All the presented projects conceptulized the building as a new architectural dominant with proposed height ranging from 300 to 400 meters.
Three out of four architects walked off the jury. Kurokawa stated that the height of construction in Saint Petersburg is "the most sensitive issue to keeping the existing cultural value of the old city centre". 
The competition was also boycotted by the Russian Union of Architects.
Winning design.
British architecture company RMJM London Limited won the competition. The decision was announced on December 1, 2006. In addition to the opinion of the jury, Gazprom invited the public to cast their votes on the company's web-site (it was closed after the project was renamed Okhta Center) and through the ballots distributed at the exhibit. 
Notably, the ballots did not provide a "none of the above" option, which automatically made all those who had cast their votes into supporters of the construction. Newsportal Vedomosti organized their own survey, asking whether respondents considered it an option to construct a 300-meter skyscraper on the site of the Nyenschantz fortress. Out of 735 respondents only 68 replied affirmatively.
The proposed twisting tower is inspired by a Swedish fortress named Landskrona, occupied the site in early 14th century, and another fortress Nyenschantz on the site until 18th century in the form of a five-sided star to maximise views for defensive purposes. The inspiration for the design also comes from energy in water, with the building form deriving its shape from the changing nature of water and ever changing light. It gives a new interpretation to the historical fortresses with modern aesthetics and technology - transparency and democracy, internal and external interactions. It also features a unique environmental strategy, which acts as a low energy double-layered skin of the tower allowing maximum daylight and minimum heat loss in the extreme climate of the city.
Project description.
The area of the complex was to be divided according to the following ratio: 35% - public use, 49% - business offices, 16% - offices of Gazprom and its subsidiaries.
The complex was to consist of three main zones:
Zone 1: Multifunctional high-rise complex. 396 meters high, 67 floors. The complex would have contained office spaces and parking, 67th floor would have been turned into an observation deck. Sport complex and conference hall were to be constructed next to it. 
Zone 2: Multifunctional cultural center. Museum of modern art, Museum of architecture, and a theater building were to be constructed in this area.
Zone 3: Zone for prospective development, most likely to include sports and recreations center containing a swimming pool, skate ring, and fitness and spa centers, apartment hotel, and parking.
Architects planned to create green zones and linear parks along the embankment of the river Neva.
The 396 meter high-rise was to be pentagon-shaped in its base - a reference to the Landskrona fortification and Nyenschantz fortresses that were located at the same site in the 14th and 17th centuries respectively. Remnants of the fortresses were uncovered during archaeological excavations that begun as a result of the contention around the project
Financial scheme.
Originally, the 60 billion rubles construction was supposed to be 100% funded from the city budget. The city was supposed to disburse annual payments of 6 billion rubles starting in 2006 through 2016. In return, Gazprom was to pay 7 billions in taxes annually. The building was supposed to become the property of Gazprom Neft. The city was also supposed to fund construction of housing for Gazprom executives. This scheme, in which city was supposed to return a ten-year worth of taxes to a commercial company, provoked a public outcry from a number of civil groups and the Democratic party Yabloko. The latter demanded a citywide referendum to uphold the height regulation of 48-meters. 
In March 2007 Gazprom City was renamed Okhta Center. Simultaneously, as a result of the pressure from opposition groups, financial scheme was changed: now Gazprom was supposed to provide 51% of the cost of the construction, city would have covered the remaining 49% and received capital stocks in exchange. However, according to the federal law about joint stock companies, shareholders do not become owners of the property. Thus, Gazprom would have still been a full owner of the Okhta Center real estate. As a result of contention around the construction, it became apparent that Valentina Matviyenko, the governor of Saint Petersburg, included funding of the construction in the city budget in the absence of feasibility studies and land agreement. Yabloko initiated a court case questioning the legality of the financing scheme. Saint Petersburg City Court denied the case 
December 28, 2008 Alexey Miller announced that Gazprom will cover the full cost of the construction. However, even though officially the city did not fund the construction, it established a tax break for Gazprom, that over ten years would have come up to the cost of the construction. Thus, even in the third version of the financial scheme, construction of Okhta Center would have been paid for by the taxpayers.

Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund

Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund, Inc. (OPSEC) is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization in the United States. It began a media campaign critical of President Obama in August 2012, accusing his administration of disclosing sensitive information about the killing of Osama bin Laden and taking too much credit for the operation.
OPSEC's members are primarily former U.S. special operations forces and intelligence community personnel. Its leaders have ties to the Republican Party though the group describes itself as non-partisan. As of mid-August 2012, it claims to have raised almost $1 million.
The military portmanteau "OPSEC" (Operations Security) is where security measures are taken to prevent friendly operations and intentions from being observed by an adversary's intelligence systems.
Leadership and composition.
OPSEC's president is Scott Taylor, a former Navy SEAL who vied for the Republican nomination for a Virginia congressional seat in 2010. Its lead spokesperson and former SEAL, Ben Smith, was also a spokesperson for Tea Party Express. Another spokesperson is Chad Kolton, who worked for the Bush administration as a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, and who was hired to perform media relations for OPSEC in July 2012 through HDMK, a Republican strategic communications firm. Public records filed with authorities indicate the group's treasurer, lawyer and TV producers also have affiliations with Republican Party organizations.
Activities.
During the 2012 United States presidential election it began a media campaign asserting that leaks of sensitive information from the Obama Administration have endangered U.S. personnel and compromised national security, and that Barack Obama has taken too much credit for the death of Osama bin Laden.
Web video.
On August 15, 2012, the organization released "Dishonorable Disclosures", a 22-minute documentary film that accuses the Obama Administration of taking credit for killing bin Laden and leaking information for political advantage, featuring interviews with former special forces personnel. The film appears on the organization's website and on YouTube, and OPSEC also intends to show it in a handful of swing states, including Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Nevada. Elizabeth Flock of US News questioned the group's claims to be non-partisan noting that "its ranks are filled with Republicans" and stating that OPSEC "has clearly taken a political side". News reports have described the group's ties to the Republican Party, noting that several prominent leaders of the group are Republicans and Tea Partiers and that it shares an office with a Republican consulting firm and a Republican polling firm. 
The Obama campaign has likened it to the discredited "swift boat" smear tactics used against presidential nominee John Kerry in 2004. In an official statement, the Obama campaign responded to the film by saying "The Republicans are resorting to 'Swift Boat' tactics because when it comes to foreign policy and national security, Mitt Romney has offered nothing but reckless rhetoric". Leaders of OPSEC responded by stating the group is non-partisan and unconnected to any political party or presidential campaign. The veterans political action committee called VetPAC has said "OPSEC is a shadowy Republican front group," and called their video "dubious" and "silly". Juliet Lapidos of the New York Times called the OPSEC video "a dishonest hatchet job" and remarked that while the stars of the video presented themselves as concerned citizens with no partisan motivations, their positions were inconsistent with their decision to appear in the video. Military journalist and former Marine, Geoffrey Ingersoll, reported in BusinessInsider that the video is a partisan effort instead of an effort to protect US troops, saying, "Obama used SEALs to kill bin Laden. Republicans are using them to eliminate Obama."
Funding.
In mid-August 2012, the group said that it had raised almost $1 million since June of that year. Registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, which requires that its activities not be primarily political, the group is not required to disclose its donors and OPSEC has declined to discuss its funding.

Pry (software)

Pry is an interactive shell for the Ruby programming language. It is notable for its Smalltalk-inspired ability to start a REPL within a running program. This lets programmers debug and modify the current state of a system.
Features.
Pry exposes most of its introspective capabilities using a filesystem metaphor. For example, it has a `cd` command to start interacting with a particular object, and uses `ls` to list methods and variables.
It is possible to start Pry at any point inside a running program. Due to the reflective nature of Ruby, this lets the programmer inspect the program, change its current state, or correct the source code without restarting the process.
A number of third party plugins are available for Pry, these add tighter integration with other Ruby projects, enhance the abilities of Pry itself, and make Pry available over a remote connection.
Competitors.
The main competitor to Pry is IRB, a standalone interactive shell that is packaged with releases of the Ruby programming language. There are a reasonable number of third-party plugins that add features to make IRB behave more like Pry, packaged as irbtools.
There are other projects to bring a better-than-IRB REPL to Ruby, such as ripl, but they are yet to see widespread adoption.

Hans Heyting

Hans Heyting (13 August 1918 – 9 June 1992), born Johannes Heijting was a Dutch poet, playwright, radio personality, children's book writer and painter. Writing in Drèents (except for his Dutch-language children's books and some poems in Dutch), he was one of the earliest Drèents writers to express personal themes and is considered to have been "the first true, modern Drèents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways".
Youth.
Heyting was born along the Beilervaart, not far from the village of Beilen. He and his three sisters grew up in a poor family of "gereformeerd" (reformed) creed. His father was a clogmaker and poached on the side to add to the family income; in his spare time he painted and drew. Reflected on his father's artistic activity, Hans noted that he "painted small landscapes, very primitively, with brushes made of his own hair. When he'd been to the barber, he took tufts of hair with him. Ja! None of his work was kept."
When he was about ten, his father died; he and his sister found the body. From this point on, Heyting - who detested the suffocating atmosphere at the reformed school - became alienated from his surroundings. He remarked on his faith that he was taught: "I felt God was spying on me all day long. At night I sensed an angel standing by the bed. I was terrified because I could feel the draught of his wings beating." Around this time he met his later fellow Drèents poet, Roel Reijntjes, who was also from Beilen.
Heyting was expelled from vocational school in Hoogeveen for blowing up the bicycle shed with a homemade bomb. Various contacts outside his family caused the rift between him and his background to grow; later he would cut the ties completely. He worked as an electrician's apprentice and a paperboy for some time.
Work as a painter.
Because of a humpback - presumably caused by rickets - Heyting was unable to perform strenuous physical labour. He was trained as a painter at the studio of Louis Kortenhorst in Assen, painting mainly children's portraits. The journalist and religion teacher G.A. de Ridder, whose children he portrayed, introduced him to literature. Heyting's interest in art and literature grew when he met Hendrik Fernhout, an authority on literature who was being cared for at psychiatric institution Beileroord. Fernhout especially familiarized Heyting with the poet Rilke. Heyting's physician Meijering proved another influence on his intellectual development.
Heyting made friends, and fell in love, with Ina Konings, a girl who was sixteen years younger and who lived next door to the Heytings. He painted and drew her and gave her a prominent place in his later poems and children's books. It was long thought that she died of tuberculosis at age thirteen and because of this, lived on as Heyting's muse. Heyting stated: "She has become my inspiration. She always shows up in my work. (...) Because she died, she stayed alive for me." However, in 2005 Drèents scholar Henk Nijkeuter established that she was still alive and living abroad.
Life in Borger.
In 1944, during World War II, Heyting went in hiding at a general practitioner's in the village of Borger. He later said, "At the end of the war, in 1944, I got in trouble with Fritz. I went about freely and that was no longer permitted. I was afraid I'd be arrested." He briefly returned to Beilen just after the war, but memories of his reformed childhood drove him back to Borger, where he would stay for the rest of his life. He painted in the post-war years, joined the Drents Painters Society and wrote about painting in the periodicals "Erica", "Drenthe", and "Nieuwe Drentsche Volksalmanak".
In 1946, Heyting lived for a while with painter Anton Heyboer, whose interest in Drenthe had been fanned by Vincent van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo. In the same year, Heyting joined the painters' association De Drentse Schilders (which existed from 1946 to 1954) and exhibited his work in Assen and Emmen. Following the exhibitions, he got many commissions for portraiture, but he had a growing conviction that he lacked the requisite talent. About this he wrote in a poem, "Is it pointless? Something fleeting, this laborious digging down? / Has everything he does not been done better?" The Drentse Schilders collective disintegrated due to conflicts between members; at one point, Heyting and two of his colleagues had spent the association's funds on booze.
The portraits painted by Heyting are in various private collections. Many of his paintings were destroyed when the museum farm he was living in burnt down in 1967. The few extant still lifes show an affinity with the Magic Realist style. After the fire, Heyting focussed more on writing, and "gradually his work took on a literary dimension".
In 1954, Heyting married Wilhelmina Carolina Hilverink ('Wil') from Hengelo.
Radio work.
Heyting became a stage director at the dramatic society of Borger. At private parties after performances, he often recited his work, played the lute and sung his own compositions. In 1950 he was seriously injured when jumping off the stage and was bedridden for almost a year. In 1951, he directed his own play "De vrömde vögel" (The oddball) about a painter who settles in a Drents village.
He became active as a writer and performer at Regionale Omroep Noord, the regional radio station, and got voice training from the station's director. He wrote Drèents texts for singers De Thrianta's and presented a fortnightly programme on art in Drenthe. Heyting performed in his own radio play "Schuppen is troef" and grew out to a popular radio presence in the province. His radio sketches feature village characters, their merits and especially their shortcomings. The Drèents-language programmes on regional radio strongly helped awaken people's interest in the regional language. At age 62, Heyting quit radio work because it was becoming too much of a physical burden.
At the time of his radio work, Heyting was also employed at the library for the blind in Groningen, for which he selected voices to record material.
Poetry.
Heyting published four collections of his own poetry: "Tweetalig" (Bilingual, 1973, with poems in Dutch by Harm Werners), "Spiegelschrift" (Mirror writing, 1977), "Toegift" (Encore, 1983) and "Dubbelfocus. Een cyclus gedichten" (Bifocal. A poetry cycle, 1986). As to why he had only collected his poetry at a late stage, he declared, "You see, I'm not the type to peddle my own work".
In the nineteen-fifties, Heyting was a member of the Drentse Schrieverskring, the Drèents writer's circle. His first poems were published by the Drèents-language monthly "Oeze Volk" which he helped found and of which he was a long-standing editor. In 1966-1967 he was the sole editor for a year, when the editorship was continued by writer Bart Veenstra. From 1980 on, Heyting published in the avant-garde Drèents literary magazine "Roet", of which he was also an editor for a number of years.
Heyting was initially influenced by traditional Drèents-language poets such as L.A. Roessingh and Jan Naarding, writing anecdotal verse in archaic Drèents. Later, he was one of the first Drèents poets to distance himself from traditionalist poetry. Drèents poet Gerard Nijenhuis a friend of Heyting's, wrote about this change, "Concepts are no longer described in detail, but only hinted at. (...) Moreover, the content becomes more 'condensed'."
Marga Kool, a fellow Drèents poet, discerns two main themes in Heyting's poems, "the safe home as contrasted with the stupid, frightening outside world" and "the girl who has passed away". The first theme is exemplified in the poem "Spiegelschrift" (Mirror writing):
The other key theme, the deceased girl, is reminiscent of the poetry of Gerrit Achterberg, which is informed by a similar theme. Heyting also shares Achterberg's penchant for choosing technical words as titles for poems ("Optiek", "Dubbelfocus", "Concaaf").
Heyting's poems often express highly personal sentiments, which was rare in Drèents poetry before the nineteen-eighties. Roel Reijntjes saw as Heyting's central theme the pain of being a loner, an outsider, different from others, including physically; socializing with many yet feeling lonely.
Using the pseudonym Hans Heideknupper, Heyting wrote nonsense verse which was published in several publications; he prepared a collection of comic poems, "Het malle vel" (The silly skin), which was never published.
Further writing.
Most of Heyting's books appeared in the seventies and eighties: poetry volumes, translations and nine children's books.
Heyting began to write children's books at the suggestion of writers Gerard Nijenhuis and Anne de Vries. He wrote them in Dutch (there was no extant market for children's books in Drèents). He felt a strong affinity for children, something about which his friend G. de Jonge declared, "Hans loved children and this shows clearly in his poetry and writing. Children also loved him. This was obvious when on Saturdays our grandchildren and their parents went to visit the Heytings. (...) Not a word was spoken, gestures and looks of understanding were enough. Hans started to read to the children and their thumbs went into their mouths."
Heyting's novel "Om je dood te schamen" (Shame!) was voted best children's book of the year by a children's jury in 1979; a year later his novel "Eva en Bert alleen" (Eva and Bert alone) was awarded the same distinction. Heyting later distanced himself from his early children's books, saying that the publishers had restricted him too much. The stories had to be sweeter than he had intended to write them, and he was asked to scrap passages in Drèents. 
Heyting received a lot of fan mail, mainly from girls aged 12 to 15 who wore glasses just like the stories' protagonitsts. Many of his fans also visited him.
In 1974, Heyting was awarded the Cultural Prize of Drenthe; in 1979 he received the golden medal of honour in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Heyting retreated from public life in his final years. He deteriorated physically, suffered pains and had a cancer operated on. When he could no longer cycle, he made his way through the village on an electric motorcycle. He declared to Gerard Nijenhuis, "I wouldn't like to die, I love life dearly. I think I will reconcile myself with the prospect of death fast. It's just, I would just like to spend some more time with my wife." Hans Heyting died in 1992 in the Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen.
After his death.
A few months after his passing, "Roet" magazine dedicated an issue to Heyting.
A bust of Heyting by Bert Kiewiet was placed in the centre of Borger. The plaque reads, "Writer, poet, recorder of the Drèents language. Co-founder of Drèents monthly OEZE VOLK. The Oeze Volk Foundation has placed this commemorative bust on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. To honour Hans for his services rendered to Drenthe and its language."
In 2004, the Drèents language institute Drentse Taol (now Huus van de Taol) released a video portrait of Heyting entitled "Een kapotte bril" (Broken glasses) on DVD.
In 2005, publisher Het Drentse Boek released Heyting's collected poems, "De dichter en de wichter: verzamelde gedichten van Hans Heyting". Edited by Henk Nijkeuter, the collection includes a short biography and a bibliography. The publisher released a CD in 2006, "Drentse dichters lezen: Hans Heyting", on which Drèents writers read poems by Heyting.
Critical assessment.
Heyting's early dramatic work was received positively: the monthly "Drenthe" wrote that his play "De vrömde vögel" "is vastly better than what has appeared so far in this field" His children's books were characterized by the Lectuur-repertorium as "easy-to-read, unpretentious popular stories for young people" "Drèentse schrieverij", a history of Drèents literature, judges Heyting's book "Esther en het geheim van opa" (Esther and grandpa's secret, 1983) to attain the level of well-known children's book author Guus Kuijer.
With regard to Heyting's painting, Drentse Taol refers to his artistic shortcomings, in contrast to the verdict on his poetry, "His poems in Drèents are among the best work written in Drèents." "Drèentse schrieverij" concurs, "Hans Heyting's work, especially his poetry, has great authority. Coming from the restricted tradition of dialect writing, he innovated it, moving from general themes such as descriptions of nature and village life to writing about issues as personal as grief about a deceased child, longing for a lost love, trying vainly to conquer death. [...] Heyting can be seen as the first true, modern Drèents poet who innovated old forms and showed new ways."

Peter Roizen

Peter Roizen (born 1946 in Montreal, Quebec Canada) is a software developer, game creator and entrepreneur.
Roizen graduated from Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California in 1963 and from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 with a degree in mathematics.
He was employed as a software developer for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was also the unofficial ‘resident cartoonist’ for the internal newsletter. Later, Roizen moved to Washington DC and worked for the World Bank. It was his work with the World Bank that led him to invent a "Table Maker" software program that would allow formulae to be abstracted from data, therefore allowing the table's formulae to be re-used with different data sets without the need for a new program.
Coincident with the advent of early personal computer platforms such as Vector Graphic and Northstar, which both utilized the CP/M operating system, Roizen was able to develop his "Table Maker" software for individual use on personal computers. Not only was his software one of the earliest spreadsheet programs, it can also claim title to the earliest ‘integrated application’ as the program was also a capable word processor and early database system. Roizen renamed it T/Maker and sold the first version through software distributor Lifeboat Associates of New York.
In 1983 he co-founded T/Maker Company (with his sister Heidi Roizen) to take over sales and distribution of T/Maker and other software products.
Roizen went on to develop other software products, including T/Master and ""I Hate Algebra"" as well as the early internet communications product Touchpoint. In 2005, Roizen created WildWords, a board-based word game.
Peter has also been published in "Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions...", "History of the Personal Computer", "Wicked Problems, Righteous Solutions: A Catalogue Of Modern Software Engineering Paradigms", and multiple issues of InfoWorld in the 1980s, 1990's and 2000.
He and his wife Sonja Roizen live in South Lake Tahoe, California. His son, Alexander Roizen, is an entrepreneur and investment banker.

Northern fin whale

The northern fin whale ("Balaenoptera physalus physalus") is a subspecies of fin whale that lives in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean. It is possible that the population in each ocean represents a separate subspecies. At least one other subspecies of fin whale, the southern fin whale ("B. p. quoyi"), exists in the southern hemisphere.
Size.
Northern fin whales are smaller than their southern hemisphere counterparts, with adult males averaging and adult females . Maximum reported figures are for males and for females in the North Pacific, while the longest reliably measured were and — all were caught off California, the former in the 1920s and the latter in the 1960s. At sexual maturity, males average in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific, while females average in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific. At birth, calves are in the North Pacific.
Reproduction.
Because of the opposing seasons in each hemisphere, "B. p. physalus" breeds at a different time of the year than "B. p. quoyi". Peak conception for "B. p. physalus" is December-January, while peak birthing is in November-December — in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

Leeds Municipal election, 1953

The Leeds municipal elections were held on Thursday 7 May 1953, with one third of the council as well as a vacancy in Richmond Hill to be elected.
Winning control of Leeds was one of Labour's highlights in a night that seen them make gains across the country. Whilst there was a swing away from Labour to the Conservatives of over four percent from the previous year's high benchmark, Labour were able to repeat most of the gains they achieved the year before, with the two exceptions being Armley - a seat they already held - and Beeston, which the Tories managed to hold by sixty-six votes this time around. In total they gained seven seats, replacing the Tories slim majority of two with a majority of twelve. Turnout continued its trend downwards with a post-war low of 41.4%.

Chilomycterus antennatus

Chilomycterus antennatus (Bridled burrfish) is a species of fish belonging to the Diodontidae family. It is native to the tropical waters of the Western Atlantic from southeastern Florida and the Bahamas to northern South America. They are also found in the Eastern Atlantic off the cost of Mauritania.
Description.
"C. antennatus" has a maximum length of 38 cm. They have 10–12 short, fixed spines with fleshy sheaths on their head and body. These are arranged in an approximate row from the snout to the dorsal fin, with the ones on the sides and top of body being more vertically erect. They have long tentacles above the eyes and small black spots on their head and body.
Like all members of the Diodontidae family, "C. antennatus" has the ability to inflate their body through the swallowing of water or air. This, along with the spines, protects them against most predators.
Habitat.
They are found on or near coral reefs and seagrass beds between 2–13 m.

Southern fin whale

The southern fin whale ("Balaenoptera physalus quoyi") is a subspecies of fin whale that lives in the Southern Ocean. At least one other subspecies of fin whale, the northern fin whale ("B. p. physalus"), exists in the northern hemisphere.
Taxonomy.
Based on differences in the vertebrae, the Swedish zoologist Einar Lönnberg (1931) designated "Balaenoptera physalus quoyii" (later the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin (1957) corrected this to "B. p. quoyi"). "B. p. quoyi" in turn is based on "Balaena quoyi" (Fischer, 1829), which was the name given to a 16.7 m (55 ft) specimen seen on the shores of the Falkland Islands by Monsieur Quoy and originally named "Balaena rostrata australis" by Desmoulins (1822).
Size.
Southern fin whales are larger than their northern hemisphere counterparts, with males averaging 20.5 m (67 ft) and females 22 m (72 ft). Maximum reported figures are 25 m (82 ft) for males and 27.3 m (89.5 ft) for females, while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929) were 22.4 m (73' 7" ft) and 24.5 m (80' 5" ft); although Major F. A. Spencer, while whaling inspector of the factory ship "Southern Princess" (1936-38), confirmed the length of a 25.9 m (85 ft) female caught in the Antarctic south of the southern Indian Ocean. At sexual maturity, males average 19.2 m (63 ft) and females 19.9 m (65.3 ft).
Reproduction.
Because of the opposing seasons in each hemisphere, "B. p. quoyi" breeds at a different time of the year than "B. p. physalus". Peak conception for "B. p. quoyi" is June-July, while peak birthing is in May.

Seattle General Strike Project

The Seattle General Strike Project is a multimedia initiative to chronicle the Seattle General Strike, the first general strike in the United States. In February 1919, what began as a wage dispute in the city’s shipyard expanded into a week-long walkout involving more than 50,000 workers that heralded a wave of post-war labor unrest and America’s first red scare. The website maintained by the project is one of the foremost collections of primary and academic material on the event, and is part of the Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects program at the University of Washington.
Content.
The site is divided into eight sections including an introductory slideshow, photographs, video, oral histories, maps, historical newspaper articles, documents and research reports. The material includes previously unavailable oral histories conducted in 1977 with major participants including David Beck, late President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. It also includes an excerpt from a biographical film of Anna Louise Strong, a key strike leader and journalist who became a key figure in the American Left through the 1960s, which shows the only known footage of the strike. In addition to an extensive narrative of the conflict written by Strong and other leaders, the site includes original research reports on the role of Mayor Ole Hanson, the Industrial Workers of the World and the press, among a wide range other topics. Many of these essays also examine Seattle labor history in the years prior to the strike, exploring the climate that precipitated the city shutdown. Additionally, the site showcases a collection of rare photographs and pamphlets from the strike, video of a conference commemorating the 90th anniversary of the strike and curriculum for Washington State history teachers.

Legends.
Mu Guiying practiced martial arts from a young age after her bandit father Mu Yu (穆羽) who ruled the Muke Fortress (穆柯寨). One day Yang Zongbao, the youngest warrior of the illustrious Yang clan, came to the fortress demanding the Dragon-Taming Wood (降龍木) on the order of his father, Marshall Yang Yanzhao. Mu refused so they fought in a duel which resulted in Yang Zongbao being captured. While Yang Zongbao refused to surrender and demanded death, Mu found herself attracted to her prisoner and boldly made a marriage proposal, which Yang Zongbao eventually accepted. After Yang Zongbao returned and reported the events, an infuriated Yang Yanzhao ordered the disgraced son executed. To save Yang Zongbao, Mu came out of the fortress and engaged in a battle with Yang Yanzhao, also capturing him. Mu apologized to her father-in-law and finally Yang Yanzhao agreed to the marriage and welcomed Mu to his family and troops.
Mu played a huge part in the following battle against the Khitan forces, especially in breaking their previously unstoppable Heavenly Gate Formation (天門陣).
Mu Guiying had 2 children with Yang Zongbao, son Yang Wenguang and daughter Yang Jinhua.
Legacy.
The Mu Guiying crater on Venus is named after her.
During China's Great Leap Forward period (1958-1960), Mu Guiying was widely praised and a women-led Mu Guiying Brigade was established.

Manuel Salvat Dalmau

Manuel Salvat Dalmau (Barcelona, Catalunya, October 4, 1925 - September 11, 2012) was a Spanish publisher. From a family of important publishing tradition, he directed the Editorial Salvat and served as President of the International Publishers Association.
Private life.
Son of Santiago Salvat Espasa and Rosa Dalmau Vilá and grandson of Manuel Salvat Xivixell. He studied in the Colegio Sant Ignasi - Sarrià of Barcelona where he was acknowledged as a brilliant student. Graduated with a degree in Law from the Universidad de Barcelona and a degree in Business Management from IESE Business School. He was married to Blanca Vilá Reyes and had six sons and one daughter. He was also the joint cofounder of the Escuela Patmos of Barcelona in 1958 with five other couples (the Amor Sagués, Tornos, Poblet, Puche, Comas, and Latorre,) Priest Joan Alemany i Esteve, and writer and pedagogue Emili Teixidor.
Professional Life.
Editorial Salvat.
Manuel Salvat Dalmau joined the family business, Salvat Editores S.A. (the publishing company known as Editorial Salvat), in the late 1940s, becoming manager, together with his brothers Santiago and Juan. The company was then leading the Spanish American market in dictionaries and medical works. From that position it developed an important change in the Spanish publishing sector by massifying the sales of encyclopedias through fascicles. The Salvat Group associated with the Boroli family, owner of "De Agostini", which had initiated the sale through fascicles in Italy. For that purpose, they created a new distribution company, "Marco Ibérica S.A." (MIDESA), reaching 22 thousand kiosks weekly, resulting in unprecedented success in 1965 with the "Enciclopedia Monitor", of which more than 300 thousand complete collections were sold.
Other outstanding achievements while he directed the publishing company were: Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente's "Enciclopedia de la Fauna", with over 200 thousand sold copies and the paperback collection "RTV", of which the first edition in 1969 sold over a million copies. The Editorial Salvat created over 50 encyclopedias, being also pioneer in incorporating CDs and cassettes in diverse works. In France it obtained a very important market quota. In Latin America it specialized in the sales of encyclopedias with notable success.
Manuel Salvat's trajectory led him to become President of the International Publishers Association (IPA) from 1980 to 1984.
In the late 1980s the Salvat Group was purchased by the French multinational Hachette.
Matesa Affair.
Manuel Salvat Dalmau was the second-most shareholder of one of his family-in-law's companies, "Matesa" (Maquinaria Textil del Norte de España S.A.). When the scandal broke out in 1969, he was required to pay the guaranteed part of the official export credits that the company had arranged between 1963 and 1969. His brother-in-law and major shareholder (Juan Vilá Reyes) was condemned of swindling as he benefited from loans and export tax exemptions by falsifying sales contracts. The conviction was upheld by the Spanish Supreme Court in 1976. Manuel Salvat had secured these credits without having knowledge of doing so because his brother-in-law had signed them, using his name fraudulently. Even though he was not charged in the "Matesa Affair", Manuel Salvat took care of the debt with the "Liquidation of Export Credit Commission" (Spanish Ministry of Finance,) which allowed him to carry on with his publishing tasks.

Jolly Tambourine Man

Jolly Tambourine Man was a Canadian alternative rock band, active in the early 1980s. Although the band recorded only a demo tape and a 7" single during its lifetime, the single "Apple Strudel Man" became notable as one of the first independent videos ever placed into rotation on MuchMusic.
Based in Toronto, Ontario, the band was a side project of the punk rock band Blibber and the Rat Crushers during a period when the main band was having trouble finding a permanent drummer. Its core lineup consisted of Blibber guitarist Stewart Black and the band's friend Steve Rhodes. With guest musicians Warren Philips and Greg McKenzie, the band recorded a self-titled and self-released cassette in 1983. Songs on the demo tape were "Nazi Punks Go Bowling", "Lisa Burger", "Gropnick", "I am Albella", "Apple Strudel Man", "Mold in My Ears", "Scary Bowl" and "Movin' On Up". 
Rhodes and Black then recruited Ian Blurton and Mike Armstrong of Change of Heart and Caroline Savage of Fifth Column to appear on a rerecording of "Apple Strudel Man", which was released as a 7" single in 1984 with the B-side "Sweater in Sri Lanka". The single's video, released the very same week as MuchMusic's initial launch, was added to MuchMusic's rotation; the single was also a hit on Toronto's alternative music station CFNY-FM.
For personal reasons, both Blibber and Jolly Tambourine Man went on hiatus following the "Apple Strudel Man" single. Blibber reemerged in 1990 with the demo release "Pope Music". Songs by both bands, including "Apple Strudel Man", are currently available for streaming on Blibber and the Rat Crusher's Myspace page.

Bijago art

Bijago art or Bidyogo art is African tribal art produced by the natives of the Bijagos Islands of Guinea-Bissau. It includes many artifacts for daily use and ritual practices, following a traditional iconography that is unique to their culture, but shows variations from island to island. Such art pieces are known as Bidyogo art and their unique aesthetics make Bidyogo art distinctive from all other African tribal art with the exception of the nearby Baga people who share some of the iconography (and are considered a "related tribe" by Bacquart)."
Shrine pieces.
Among the most striking Bidyogo art pieces are the portable ancestor shrines ("iran") that can either be realistic or abstract.
Zoomorphic masks for coming-of-age rituals.
Zoomorphic masks respresenting cows ("vaca-bruta"), sharks, stingrays and, occasionally, other local animals are worn in adult initiation rituals ("fanado") mostly by boys, but occasionally by women.
Other ritual paraphernalia.
Traditionally-decorated artifacts are also produced for "fanado" coming-of-age ceremonies (wood masks, spears, shields, headgear, bracelets), Girls are also given stylized dolls to learn about child-caring.
Daily use objects.
The Bissagos produce unique objects for daily activities (fishing, agriculture) and personal use (stools, basketry, foodware) and boats.
Architecture.
Though most Bidyogo hut dwellings show no remarkable artistry, so have their walls painted in bright colors with traditional symbols and patterns; occasionally doors are also painted with human or animal figures.
Pieces for the tourist trade.
Some of the village artists carve for ritual use as well as for the tourist trade, which can thus enable visitors to acquire etnographically interesting pieces.

Barnes family

The Barnes family is one of the main families of the American prime time soap opera "Dallas" and its 2012 sequel.
Family members.
Wentworth family.
Around 1955, right after Pamela Barnes was born, Digger Barnes's wife Rebecca fled Dallas and was presumed dead. In 1981 she returned to Texas as Rebecca Wentworth, wife of rich businessman Herbert Wentworth with whom she had a biological daughter Katherine Wentworth. Soon after Herbert died due to terminal disease and Rebecca reconciled with her children Cliff and Pam and introduced them to their half-sister Katherine. In turn of events, Rebecca's plane crashed in 1983 (""Crash of '83"") and she died in Dallas Memorial. In her will, she left her huge Wentworth fortune to her children Cliff, Pam and Katherine. Katherine fled the country to Europe in 1984 after being wanted for attempted murder. In 1987, Pamela left Dallas after her car accident making her son Christopher sole heir of her Barnes-Wentworth Oil share along with Cliff.
Barnes-Wentworth Oil.
Barnes-Wentworth Oil, formerly Wade Luce Oil, is a fictional oil company from the television series "Dallas".
In 1982, Rebecca Wentworth bought the Wade Luce Oil company from retiring oilman Wade Luce in an effort to help her son, Cliff Barnes fight J.R. Ewing and Ewing Oil. Rebecca was killed in a plane crash in 1983. She split up the company between Cliff, Pam, and Katherine according to continuation. When Katherine died, she gave her shares to Cliff.
Cliff hired Sly Lovegreen to spy at Ewing Oil as J.R.'s secretary. She fed him information on pending deals at Ewing Oil, and Cliff managed to pull several profitable deals out from under him. J.R. eventually discovered the plot and turned the tables on Cliff feeding him useless information and nearly bankrupting Barnes-Wentworth. 
Cliff later sold Barnes-Wentworth to Jeremy Wendell, but in the continuation, the company was still owned by Cliff, who diversified the company and it became a multi-billion dollar conglomerate called Barnes Global. <br>

Barnes Global.
Barnes Global is a fictional company on the updated version of "Dallas" (Season 1 & 2 Only). It is owned by Cliff Barnes and Dr. David Gordon under the alias as Patricia Barrett. Dr. Gordon lives in Zurich, Switzerland and was Pamela Barnes Ewing's surgeon after the car accident that burned over 50% of her body.
Between the old version of "Dallas" and the newer version "Dallas", Cliff Barnes built a multibillion dollar conglomerate, consisting of over a hundred companies in over fifty countries, out of Barnes-Wentworth Oil, the company his mother had purchased back in 1982. 
Bobby (Cliff's former brother-in-law), John Ross (Cliff's current son-in-law) and Christopher (Cliff's nephew and former son-in-law) find a financial report on Barnes Global that J.R. Ewing had, revealing Cliff's mother started the company and gave Cliff, Pam, and Katherine each one-third ownership. Katherine died and left her share to Cliff, which he later ceded to his daughter Pamela Rebecca. Meanwhile, Pam left Dallas in 1988 still owning her third of the company, with her son Christopher as a potential heir. With his mother missing since he was 7, Christopher seeks to declare Pam legally dead to inherit his mother's share of Barnes Global as a means of protecting Ewing Energies. Investigation initiated by J.R., however, reveals the likelihood of Pam living in Zurich. This is how Christopher found Dr. David Gordon and got his mother's will passing on her shares to him. <br>

Ewing Global.
Ewing Global is a fictional company on the updated version of "Dallas". Formerly Barnes Global, it is owned by Cliff Barnes, his daughter Pamela (with husband John Ross Ewing), and his nephew Christopher Ewing. Cliff is currently being represented by his hired proxy Nicolas Treviño (an childhood friend of Elena Ramos).
John Ross, Pamela, and Christopher merged Barnes Global and Ewing Energies and renamed the company to show who was in charge. Nicolas Treviño showed up in Dallas soon after Elena talked to Cliff in Nuevo Laredo. The Ewings were about to sell their consumers division in order to pay for the arctic leases. The leases would earn the new merged company millions, but Treviño stopped them saying that the Ewings had a majority but not a "super majority". John Ross planned to frack Southfork as a second option, but Bobby disagreed. <br>

Miniature camera

When still cameras using 35 mm film, originally used for cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish them from the then commonplace rollfilm cameras. While the term could be used for a camera larger than a subminiature and smaller than a rollfilm camera, it was mostly used for cameras taking 135 film cassettes, or other 35 mm cassettes.
The smaller variants of rollfilm stayed popular for a while after introduction of 35mm film in still photography. Thus at least the smaller frame formats for 127 film where also seen as miniature formats, a fact reflected in camera names like Topcon's "Minion" (4×5cm format) and Utility Manufacturing Company's "Falcon Miniature" (3×4cm format).
