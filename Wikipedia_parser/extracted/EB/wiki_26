Zalutumumab

Zalutumumab (proposed trade name HuMax-EGFr) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr). It is a product developed by Genmab in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Specifically, zalutumumab is designed for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), a type of cancer. The current treatment for SCCHN includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors and human monoclonal antibodies. In addition, murine mAbs were tested successfully in mice, but caused an immune response in humans and were thus determined as ineffective in therapeutics.
Mechanism of action.
Zalutumumab works through inhibition of the EGFr signal. The EGFr is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Its structure includes an extracellular binding domain, a transmembrane lipophilic segment, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.
Mechanism of EGFr.
EGFr is over-expressed by many tumor cells. Upon binding by a ligand, such as the epidermal growth factor or TGF alpha, dimerization occurs, leading to autophosphorylation on the intracellular tyrosine residues. Following phosphorylation, the Grb2-SOS signaling complex is stimulated. This causes the activation of the G protein RAS through the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The exchange of GDP for GTP induces a conformational change of RAS to allow it to bind to Raf-1. Raf-1 is then activated through another multistep mechanism in which dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), as well as the phosphorylation of activating sites by p21 activated kinase (PAK) occurs. After this, Raf-1 activates MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which then goes on to activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK is then able to enter the cell nucleus and control gene expression by phosphorylating various transcription factors, such as Elk-1. It is from there that the specific gene transcription occurs to initiate the cell cycle. Through this mechanisam, apoptosis is inhibited, angiogenesis, migration, adhesion, and invasion occur. Each of these is a functional element to the progression and development of cancer, which is defined as an abnormal growth of cells with a tendency to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize.
Mechanism of zalutumumab.
In order to combat SCCHN, zalutumumab was designed to inhibit the EGFr signaling. Specifically, it binds to the EGFr Domain III on the cell surface. This locks the receptor in an inactive conformation, making the drug an inverse agonist. In doing this it is also acting as a competitive antagonist for the EGF ligand. In the inactive conformation, the distance between the intracellular tyrosine kinase residues is larger, which inhibits dimerization. Phosphorylation is consequently inhibited, so that no signal is released. Without a signal, cell cycle characteristics to enhance tumor growth are inhibited and the cancer progression is suppressed.
This is not the only way in which zalutumumab works. It also is responsible for some antitumor affects through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Fab, or fragment antigen binding region of the antibody, binds to the antigen on the EGFr expressing tumor cells. Through an immunological response, the body’s natural killer (NK) cells, which are a type of lymphocyte, recognize and bind to the Fc portion on the antibody through an Fc receptor, CD16. The NK cell is then activated through the cross linking of the Fc receptors which sends a signal to induce apoptosis and cell death. The target tumor cell is then destroyed.
Developmental status.
Zalutumumab treatment was approved for Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients suffering from SCCHN who have failed standard therapies and have no other options. The drug has undergone pre-clinical and Phase I and II studies and is also in Phases I and II for SCCHN front-line with chemo-radiation and SCCHN with radiation. Additionally, a Phase II is under way for SCCHN and Phase III studies are also being performed for SCCHN and SCCHN front-line with radio therapy. A phase III study reported a non significant improvement in overall survival, and a significant improvement in Progression-free survival

Spie Batignolles

Spie Batignolles is a French construction company based in Neuilly-sur-Seine. The company provides building and infrastructure construction in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland.
Company history.
Ernest Goüin founded Ernest Goüin & Cie in 1846. It later became "Société de Construction des Batignolles" (SCB). Meanwhile, the "Société Parisienne pour l’Industrie des Chemins de Fer et des Tramways Electriques" was founded and became, in 1900 under the directorship of baron Édouard Empain, "Société Parisienne pour l’Industrie Electrique" (SPIE).
As early as 1954, SPIE acquired part of SCB's capital and in 1968 the two companies merged to form Spie Batignolles.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Spie Batignolles acquired several other companies: "Compagnie Industrielle de Travaux" (CITRA) in 1972, "Canalisations Pétrolifères, Aquifères et Gazières" (CAPAG) in 1977, and "Travaux Industriels pour l’Electricité" (TRINDEL) in 1982. In 1989 the rail construction company Drouard was acquired, forming the foundation of the group's rail construction engineering company Spie Rail.
The 1990s brought several waves of restructuring. In 1990, Spie Batignolles created "Spie Construction", the building and civil engineering branch of the company. In 1992, Spie Construction merged with CITRA to become SPIE CITRA.
In 1997 the company was bought from the Schneider group with the help of a management buyout supported by AMEC. A year later, Spie Batignolles changed its name to SPIE with its three daughter companies becoming Spie Trindel, Spie Enertrans, and Spie Batignolles; operating the energy, transportation and construction fields respectively.
On 1 July 2003, Spie as a whole was purchased by AMEC; the acquired company was split in three: the engineering branch of Spie in Europe was renamed AMEC SPIE, a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was grouped under the name Spie Batignolles. AMEC announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business 'Spie Batignolles', and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division; the management buyout of the construction division by 78 senior managers was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance. In 2004, "Financière Spie Batignolles" purchased the remaining Spie Batignolles shares owned by Amec Spie.
The two other former divisions became separate companies: in 2005 AMEC announced it was to sell its Spie acquisition of 2003. the engineering company AMEC SPIE was sold to PAI Partners for €1040 million in 2006, The European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.
The metal construction company "CM paimbeuf" (acquired 1995) was bought by Fayat in 2008.

Black Bear Ranch

Black Bear Ranch is an 80-acre intentional community located in Siskiyou County, California, about 25 miles from Forks of Salmon. It was founded in 1968, with the slogan "free land for free people". It has been considered by some participants and commentators to be one of the more radical examples of communal living/intentional communities that grew out of the counterculture of the 1960s.
Before being converted into a commune, it was a ghost town that had been a gold mining settlement in the 1860s. The commune's legal ownership was held by one resident, Richard Marley, until in 1987 it was transferred to the Black Bear Family Trust, which limits development of the property and established trustees to oversee various specified duties. Black Bear Ranch was the subject of the 2005 documentary "Commune" by Johnathan Berman. The commune still exists today and continues to follow the basic ideals which motivated its founding. At the Summer Solstice Gathering in 2013, there were over 40 residents, the highest population in decades. It is located in a pocket valley in the Siskiyou Mountains.
Early life.
The motivations behind setting up the commune were, in the words of one of the founders, Richard Marley, to create a:
According to the historian Timothy Miller, the community bought the property for $22,500 using money from a variety of sources including from supporters in the entertainment industry, as well as "one large unexpected angelic gift" and the "proceeds from a major LSD deal". The money from the entertainment industry was obtained through what Stephen Holden in the "New York Times" describes as "emotional blackmail", quoting Michael Tierra:
Although they struggled at first due to a lack of planning, the community at Black Bear Ranch learned to live self-sufficiently, as the ranch was often snowed in for extended periods during the winter months, and was many hours' drive from the nearest city. The residents managed to gather large quantities of food and medical supplies to see them through the winter and were able to treat a variety of illnesses and medical problems onsite, delivering babies and performing veterinary care. The community homeschooled their children, and maintained tools like chainsaws and cars without a need for mechanics. To raise money to pay for food and supplies, they found work fighting fires in the nearby forests.
Despite their remoteness, the community managed to keep in contact with a variety of radical groups including the Hells Angels and Black Power groups. There was a tension between those with a radical—even paramilitary—persuasion who wanted to pursue weapons training and possibly harbor radical political fugitives and the many slackers. One of the founders of the commune, interviewed by the University of Kansas' 60s Commune Project and quoted in Miller:
Miller also records how "a strong sense of community" including ritual peyote use led to a variety of social experiments being conducted including the abolishing of private property and also the institution of a rule to prevent "coupling," which banned anyone from sleeping with the same partner for more than two consecutive nights, although this had disastrous consequences after a venereal disease spread amongst the community. Despite the ban on coupling (considered "bourgoise decadence"), traditional feelings of resentment came back when they tried to work out who had slept with whom in order to treat the disease:
At one point, a group called the Shiva Lila became part of the commune until they were asked to leave by the other members. "The New York Times" describes them as a "nomadic cult of acid-taking, baby-worshiping hippies looking for the perfect place to bring up children" and they were led by a man called Gridley Wright.
Very few rules were ever adopted by the community as Malcolm Terence notes: "Anarchists are good at lots of things but making rules isn’t one of them." After a hepatitis epidemic, they banned sitting on the kitchen counter, and they also banned turning the handle on the cream separator "because it used to drive people crazy when people would sit in the kitchen and play with the handle on the cream separator".
Miller believes the communes like Black Bear were an early progenitor of ultraconservative communal separatist movements in the 1990s:
Life today.
Life at the ranch continues on, with similar struggles about what communality means as took place during the early days. The rules have grown into a set of "Traditional Guidelines" which try to ensure "the continued existence of Black Bear Ranch and its tradition of communal living in a way that cares for and nourishes each other and the environment". Decision making by the group is managed through weekly 'Circles'.

Stamulumab

Stamulumab (MYO-029) is an experimental myostatin inhibiting drug developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of muscular dystrophy (MD). Stamulumab was formulated and tested by Wyeth in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. Myostatin is a protein that inhibits the growth of muscle tissue, stamulumab is a recombinant human antibody designed to bind to and inhibit the activity of myostatin.
Stamulumab is a G1 immunoglobulin antibody which binds to myostatin and prevents it from binding to its target site, thus inhibiting the growth-limiting action of myostatin on muscle tissue. Research completed in 2002 found that Stamulumab might one day prove to be an effective treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Phase 1 and 2 trials.
Wyeth undertook a Phase 1 and 2 clinical trial in 2005 and 2006 of stamulumab. The multiple ascending dose trial (36 patients per cohort) contained some measures of efficacy. The trial's participants included people afflicted with Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Becker's muscular dystrophy, and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Through 2007 Wyeth had been analyzing the results but the hoped-for news and/or a publication in 2007 did not occur. In January 24, 2008, Wyeth announced that the study had been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal and publication was expected "in the next few months". The publication appeared in Annals of Neurology in May 2008. 
On 11 March 2008 it was announced that Wyeth would not develop the drug further for MD, but would continue to explore myostatin inhibition along with other strategies.

The title derives from the United States Constitution's Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the President of the United States "shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States". 
The film, set in Washington, D.C., follows the consequences of a Presidential nomination for Secretary of State of a man with a hidden past who commits perjury in the course of confirmation proceedings.
Plot summary.
The President of the United States (Franchot Tone) nominates Robert A. Leffingwell (Henry Fonda) as Secretary of State. The second-term President, who is ill, has chosen him because he does not believe that Vice President Harley Hudson (Lew Ayres)—whom both he and others usually ignore—will successfully continue the administration's foreign policy should he die.
Leffingwell's nomination is controversial within the United States Senate which, using its advice and consent powers, must either approve or reject the appointment. Both the President's party, the majority, and the minority are divided. Majority Leader Bob Munson (Walter Pidgeon), the senior senator from Michigan, loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard-working Majority Whip Stanley Danta (Paul Ford) of Connecticut and womanizer Lafe Smith (Peter Lawford) of Rhode Island. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman (George Grizzard) of Wyoming is especially supportive. Although also of the majority party, President "pro tempore" and "curmudgeon" Seabright "Seeb" Cooley (Charles Laughton) of South Carolina dislikes Leffingwell for both personal and professional reasons, and leads the opposition.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee appoints a subcommittee, chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson (Don Murray) of Utah, to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman (Burgess Meredith). The minor Treasury clerk testifies that he was briefly in a Communist cell with Leffingwell and two others at the University of Chicago. Leffingwell denies the charge and effectively questions Gelman's credibility, but later tells the President that he had committed perjury and that Gelman was essentially correct. He asks the President to withdraw his nomination, but he refuses.
Cooley identifies another member of the cell, senior Treasury official Hardiman Fletcher. He forces him to confess to Anderson, who tells Munson. Despite personal lobbying by the President, the subcommittee chairman insists that the White House withdraw the nomination due to Leffingwell's perjury or he will subpoena Fletcher to testify. The President angrily refuses but the majority leader admits that the White House will soon have to nominate another candidate. Anderson delays his committee's report on Leffingwell but the President sends Fletcher out of the country, angering the senator.
Anderson and his wife (Inga Swenson) receive anonymous phone calls from Van Ackerman's men warning that, unless the subcommittee reports favorably on Leffingwell, information about what happened with "Ray" in Hawaii will appear. A worried Anderson visits a fellow Army veteran, Ray Shaff, in New York. Shaff admits that he sold evidence of a past homosexual relationship between the two. Hudson, Anderson's friend Smith, and others attempt to counsel the troubled chairman but, unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson commits suicide.
The President denies to Munson and Hudson knowing about the blackmail. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell's confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher, forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson's death, nonetheless, permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate.
In the Senate Chamber Cooley apologizes for his "vindictiveness". While he will vote against Leffingwell and his "alien voice", the senator will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley's action, cites the "tragic circumstances" surrounding the confirmation. Although the majority leader will vote for Leffingwell, he will permit a conscience vote from others. Hudson's quorum call and the majority leader's refusal to yield the floor prevent Van Ackerman from speaking until Munson asks for the "Yeas and Nays", ending debate. The majority leader tells the senator that were it not for the Andersons' privacy the Senate would censure and expel him. Van Ackerman angrily leaves the chamber before the vote.
Munson's side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell, and the majority leader prepares for the Vice President to break the tie in the nominee's favor. Secret Service agents enter the chamber and Hudson receives a message from the Senate Chaplain. He announces that he will not break the tie, causing the nomination to fail, and that the President has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own Secretary of State. The film ends as Munson makes a motion to adjourn due to the former president's death.
Cast.
Note
Production.
Many scenes were filmed at real locations in Washington D.C., including the Capitol, the canteen of the Treasury Building, the Washington Monument and the Crystal Room of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel.
Preminger offered Dr Martin Luther King Jr. a cameo role as a U.S. Senator from Georgia, although there were no serving African-American Senators at the time. King reportedly gave the offer serious consideration but eventually turned it down, feeling that it might cause hostility and hurt the civil rights movement.
Former Vice President Richard Nixon was offered the role of the Vice President but refused and pointed out some "glaring and obvious" errors in the script.
"Advise & Consent" was one of a sequence of Preminger films that challenged both the Motion Picture Association of America's Production Code and the Hollywood blacklist. It pushed censorship boundaries with its depiction of a married senator who is being blackmailed over a wartime homosexual affair, and was the first mainstream American movie after World War II to show a gay bar. Preminger confronted the blacklist by casting left-wing actors Will Geer and Burgess Meredith. It was the first of five films in which Preminger cast Meredith.
It also marked the screen comeback of Gene Tierney, whose breakthrough to major stardom came in Preminger's 1944 film "Laura". Tierney had withdrawn from acting for several years because of her ongoing struggle with bipolar disorder. "Advise & Consent" was the last of four films she made for Preminger and one of her last major film roles.
Actress Betty White (best known for her roles in the sitcoms "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "The Golden Girls"), made her film debut in "Advise & Consent", playing a young senator from Kansas.
Henry Fonda's character Leffingwell was seen as drawing particularly on real-life State Department official (and Soviet spy) Alger Hiss.
It was Charles Laughton's last film; he was suffering from cancer during filming, and died six months after the film's release.
Meredith's character draws on real-life Soviet spy (and, later, apostate Communist) Whittaker Chambers.
Peter Lawford was John F. Kennedy's brother-in-law when the story was filmed. He plays Lafe Smith, identified as a senator from Rhode Island (and modeled on Kennedy), although in Drury's book the character represents Iowa.
It should be noted that the Vice President was riding on a civilian airliner returning from New York City with the stricken senator from Utah. It was not the custom at the time for the Vice President to have a special plane as he does today.
Critical reception.
The staff of "Variety" liked the acting but believed the screenplay was problematic. They wrote, "As interpreted by producer-director Otto Preminger and scripter Wendell Mayes, "Advise and Consent" is intermittently well dialogued and too talky, and, strangely, arrested in its development and illogical… Preminger has endowed his production with wholly capable performers… The characterizations come through with fine clarity."
The film critic for "The New York Times", Bosley Crowther, did not like the contrived storyline of the script, and he wrote, "Without even giving the appearance of trying to be accurate and fair about the existence of a reasonable balance of good men and rogues in government, Mr. Preminger and Wendell Mayes, his writer, taking their cue from Mr. Drury's book, have loaded their drama with rascals to show the types in Washington." Crowther also was bothered by the use of the "homosexual affair." He wrote, "It is in this latter complication that the nature of the drama is finally exposed for the deliberately scandalous, sensational and caustic thing it is. Mr. Preminger has his character go through a lurid and seamy encounter with his old friend before cutting his throat, an act that seems unrealistic, except as a splashy high point for the film."

"Can't Get This Stuff No More" is a song on American hard rock band Van Halen's 1996 compilation "Best of Volume I". 
The song was one of two new songs recorded exclusively for the album (the other being "Me Wise Magic").
Recording.
As Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth got in touch again due to the upcoming compilation, Eddie decided to invite Roth to perform on two new songs. The music for this song was based on a track called the "Backdoor Shuffle" which was originally part of the sessions for the "Balance" album. "Can't Get This Stuff No More" is also Eddie Van Halen's first and only use of a talk box, which was actually played by guitar technician Matt Bruck as Eddie felt "it just sounded like a wah-wah" when he used it himself.
Release.
The song was written and recorded by the reunited original members Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth and Michael Anthony, and subsequently released on Van Halen's 1996 compilation "Best of Volume I". The reunion fell apart a month before the release of "Best of Volume I."

Stora Gråmunkegränd

Stora Gråmunkegränd () is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching west from Västerlånggatan down to Munkbron and Munkbroleden, it is crossed by Stora Nygatan, and forms a parallel street to Storkyrkobrinken and Helga Lekamens Gränd.
History.
The alley is named after the defensive tower "Gråmunketornet" ("Greyfriar's Tower") located in the city wall which used to pass along the eastern side of today's Västerlånggatan, in its turned named after the Greyfriars abbey on Riddarholmen, at the time called "Gråmunkeholmen" ("Greyfriar's Islet"). It appears in historical records as "grabroder strate" ("grey brother's street") in 1420 and "gramunka grendenne" (" grey monk's alley") in 1456.
The first element, however, doesn't appear until 1728 when the alley south of it (Helga Lekamens Gränd) was being referred as "Lilla Gråmnukegränd" ("Smaller Greyfriars Alley"), and the part of the alley west of Lilla Nygatan was named "Schaleri Gränd" after the doctor Peter Schallerus Gripenflycht who owned the property in the western end. The name have been used for the entire extent of the alley since 1885.
On number 5, is a flat with preserved wall paintings and a coffered ceiling from 1580. While sparsely used by the Stockholm Beauty Council since the city took it over in 1973, as of 2006 the flat will hopefully be made available to the general public.

Family Law (film)

Family Law () is a 2006 Argentine, French, Italian, and Spanish, comedy-drama film, written and directed by Daniel Burman.
The picture was produced by Diego Dubcovsky, José María Morales, and Marc Sillam, and co-produced by Amedeo Pagani.
"Family Law" was Argentina official submission for the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film
Plot.
The film tells the story of Ariel Perelman (Daniel Hendler). While he has an easygoing lifestyle, he's trying to find his way in life in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He works at a university as a law professor. The film begins with a long narration of the way things stand in his life. He describes his father, Bernardo Perelman (Arturo Goetz), in detail. Perelman, as he's known, is a popular public defender who meets his clients where they work or in restaurants so he can determine what they are "all about." Most of his clients are generally poor. He's very close to his secretary (Adriana Aizemberg) since his wife died fifteen years ago. Work fills Perelman's days, and Ariel is astonished by his energy.
After lusting after Sandra (Julieta Díaz), an attractive woman who takes his class, Ariel decides to chase her and takes the Pilates class she teaches. Not much happens until Sandra is sued for teaching Pilates without the approval of the company who hold the rights to teach Pilates in Argentina. Ariel (known as Perelman to Sandra) reaches out to his father for help and wins the law suit.
In the process, Sandra falls in love with the younger Perelman and they marry. She begins to decorate their home for a few years and they have a child they name Gastón (Eloy Burman), who is a quite charming young boy. 
Ariel's university building is shut down for a month because it had collapsed, and he is given some time off. However, he doesn't share this news with his wife. During this time his father starts spending some quality time with Ariel, which makes him think something must be wrong. Ariel is asked by the Swiss kindergarten school Gastón attends to participate in a play and swim classes with the other fathers. Ariel first rebels but gives in.
The film ends with his father's death and burial and a long introspective look at Ariel Perelman's life in his 30s.
Background.
"Derecho de familia" is part of a loose trilogy of films. The other two are: "Esperando al mesías" (2000) and "El abrazo partido" (2004). All were written and directed by Burman and star Daniel Hendler. They are largely autobiographical, dealing with the life of a young Jew in contemporary Buenos Aires.
Like the characters in the film, Burman's own father was a lawyer and he also went to law school.
Eloy Burman who plays Gastón Perelman is the young son of director Daniel Burman.
Distribution.
The film was first presented at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 10, 2006. It was first screened in Argentina on March 16, 2006 at the Mar del Plata Film Festival. It opened wide in Argentina on March 23, 2006.
The film was shown at various film festivals, including: the Toulouse Latin America Film Festival, France; the Moscow Film Festival, Russia; the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Czech Republic; the Edinburgh Film Festival, Scotland; the Helsinki International Film Festival, Finland; Films From The South Festival, Norway; the Chicago International Film Festival, USA; the Warsaw Film Festival, Poland; and others.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Family Law" garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 73% "Certified Fresh" approval rating based on 41 reviews, with a rating average of 6.7 out of 10. The site's consensus is: "What "Family Law" lacks in overt drama and conflict, it more than makes us with warm performances and smart, sharp dialogue." At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 66 based on 18 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film.
Jonathon Holland, film critic of "Variety" magazine, liked the film's story and wrote, "A deft, witty and emotionally rewarding study of a thirtysomething man in his roles as father and son, Daniel Burman's intensely personal "Family Law" completes his fatherhood trilogy. The second installment, "Lost Embrace", won the Silver Bear at Berlin in 2004. Again featuring an outstanding Daniel Hendler (best actor in 2004) and a script that fuses sharp observation with the intimacy of a lightly rewritten autobiography, pic effortlessly takes the viewer through a range of thoughts and moods. Fans of "Embrace" might lament the relative absence of social context this time, but pic's multiple merits should consolidate helmer's burgeoning offshore reputation."
The senior film writer at the "San Francisco Chronicle", Ruthe Stein, liked the comedy-drama's screenplay, the direction and acting, writing, ""Family Law"—a subtly perceptive charmer that was Argentina's entry for a best foreign film Oscar and might have been nominated in a less competitive year—is in no particular hurry to get where it's going...Although Hendler and Goetz don't really look alike, they manage to convey a family resemblance in their mannerisms, particularly the erect way they carry themselves, as if they're somebody...Aizemberg works wonders. You get the sense from her radiance that the secretary has always had a thing for her boss. His wife's death allowed her to finally express it physically, and she's overjoyed by their intimacy...Ultimately this is a movie about a son's discovery of the man he knows mostly as a father. It's a serious subject handled with humor—not the ha-ha kind, but the hard laughter that comes from recognizing parts of yourself in the Perelmans."
Critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, of the website "Spirituality and Practice" like the film and wrote, "Family Law explores in a realistic and touching way the emotional barriers that often block intimate conversation between fathers and sons...It's easy today to send e-mails and faxes anywhere in the world, yet we rarely speak to those who live in our neighborhood. We have cellular telephones and pagers, yet we spend very little time in deep conversation with those in our immediate family. This strange phenomenon is depicted very poignantly in this snappy and satisfying film from Argentina written and directed by Daniel Burman. We were very impressed with his "Lost Embrace" about a father and son reunion after years apart. This one also deals with a father and son relationship."

The Artists' Studio

The Artists' Studio, frequently abbreviated TAS, was founded by David and Joellyn Young in January 2003 as an independent for-profit community theatre. The couple each have experience on Broadway with David being a musical director and voice teacher who has traveled with Broadway shows such as Camelot, South Pacific, and The Music Man while Joellyn has most notably been Eva Perón in Evita. The theatre, located in Fishers, Indiana is primitively based as it was renovated from a night club and a stage was added. Despite being in Fishers, Noblesville considers TAS to be one of its own places of interest. The proscenium stage is made of classic design and allows for a variety of different trims to be placed around as well as the movement of the back wall, though there is no fly space. The remaining space allows for a 220-seat house complete with sound and lighting systems, office space, and classrooms. Cast, crew, and various other members are volunteers with few employed within the productions themselves.
History.
The First Years.
The seasons of The Artists' Studio have thus far consisted of 8 shows, including a holiday show, and for the first several years, a "young artists production" for aspiring actors and actresses ages 13–25. Of the several years the young artists' production took place, the first and last were Grease. The seasons normally end at the start of summer, picking up again shortly after. Sometime in the summer, the theatre holds General Auditions, that is, auditions for the entire season, though each show normally gets its own as well. Audition notices tend to get notoriety in many papers, such as the Indianapolis Star. Several shows became traditional over the years, primarily due to popularity, and The Artists' Studio began to further embrace them. Ironically, the two major influencing shows within the Artists' Studio's early years were in stark contrast to each other. Each of the two was actually closely linked to different holidays, as Annie was traditionally used as a Christmas show and The Rocky Horror Show was used around Halloween, usually boasting a midnight performance on or around Halloween itself.
Annie and The Rocky Horror Show.
The Rocky Horror Show was arguably the first big hit for the theatre, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter being played by Brent Marty. Rocky Horror was the first of the two prominently recurring shows in the theatre's early lifetime having been held three times in four years (though it would continue to emerge in later seasons), with a season going by between the second and third incarnations. The first incarnation The Rocky Horror Show at TAS was considered one of the best shows of 2003 in Indiana.
Annie was used as the annual Holiday show until 2006, though it would periodically return in later years. Daddy Warbucks, the lead male character of Annie, was played by Jay Meisenhelder for several incarnations until he was not taken back as a result of controversy stemming from the show itself. Annie was the first show at The Artists' Studio to have 2 casts, a Cast A and B, though it was only for the children involved in the show. This became common practice for all the later productions of Annie and set the precedent for future shows requiring a children's cast.
Shift into Family Theatre.
Annie sold better as a whole than any previous production, despite the first Halloween showing of Rocky Horror marking the first show to sell out. After Annie continued as a success for several years, the theatre began casting more and more children in shows that required a children's cast. This included adding more children into shows that didn't necessarily ask for them, such as being urchins in Aladdin, a Disney production that did not necessarily call for children actors. Soon shows requiring far more children, and several casts of children began to be commonplace at TAS. Shows involving many children, such as Wizard of Oz, Oliver, Seussical, The Music Man, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, became popular starting in the 2004-2005 season and the trend continued onward into many later seasons.
TAS Kids.
In addition to classes and camps, TAS began producing shows exclusively for kids, beginning with "Bye Bye Birdie" in November 2007, continuing on with "Grease" in the spring, and many other productions from thereon. Performance in these productions has cost upward of $100 for the interested children, something unique of mainstage productions and other theatres in the area.
Beyond the Stage.
The Artists' Studio is especially unique in that it acts as much more than just a performing theatre. It also offers a wide variety of classes in dancing, acting and singing. It also hosts other unique services, such as hosting themed children's birthday parties. The extra services are likely more a reflection on the fact that, unlike most community theatres in Indiana, The Artists' Studio is a for-profit organization. This has kept the Encore Association, which provides an award ceremony for community theatres in Indiana, from recognizing any of The Artists' Studios productions, as one of the stipulations is that no one be paid in a nominated production; it must be produced by a not-for-profit theatre group.

Carter Brown

Born in England, Alan Geoffrey Yates (aka Carter Brown) married and settled in Australia in 1948. He began his working life as a film technician, a salesman and in public relations for Qantas before taking up writing full-time.
Yates soon became a literary phenomenon. He wrote westerns under the pseudonym Todd Conway; romances under Caroline Farr and science fiction under Paul Valdez. He even found the time to write books under various versions of his own name as well as other pseudonyms, Dennis Sinclair and Sinclair MacKellar. But it was his pseudonym Peter Carter Brown then later, Carter Brown (‘Peter’ was dropped for the US market) who was to become the international bestselling pulp fiction author.
The extraordinary early success of Carter Brown in the 1950s meant that Yates was contracted to produce one short novel and two long novels each month. In reality, Yates was truly prolific with 322 published Carter Brown novels. Yet despite the enormity of his output, a 1963 profile in "Pix" magazine revealed he approached deadlines ‘with the reluctance of a long-distance swimmer shivering on the brink of a cold, grey English Channel. In the manic depressive moments of the third night without sleep – when the deadline is long past and the mental block has set solid as concrete, the writer inevitably descends into self-analysis. He knows, of course, that it will be no more help than the last Dexedrine tablet but still clings to the naïve hope that, somehow, sometime, he will find a way of avoiding the recurrence of his present hopeless situation.’
His books, originally published by Horwitz and Signet, were set in the United States and published throughout the Anglo-phone world. In its obituary for Yates in 1985, The New York Times noted that he had written "some 30 detective novels with American backgrounds before ever having visited the United States ... He said he chose American settings because Australians preferred them."
A rumour spread at the height of his popularity that Yates was one of John F. Kennedy’s favourite authors – a rumour which helped propel his sales even further in the North American market.
The novels were also popular in Europe where they were translated into French, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Finnish, German, Portuguese, Romanian, Dutch. In Asia, some of the novels were translated into Thai and Japanese.
Carter Brown's huge international success saw reportedly 120 million books in print, second only to The Bible in terms of the number of languages into which they were translated. The success of the books also spawned a comic book series, the ‘Carter Brown Murder Mystery Hour’ on radio, three French films, a Japanese TV series, and a French literary award for ‘The most whiskies drunk in a single novel’.
In the early 1980s, Yates and Richard O'Brien of "The Rocky Horror Show" fame wrote a musical of "The Stripper", described in classic Carter Brown terminology as ‘the girl who says it all from the neck down’.
Yates died of a heart attack in 1985 in Sydney. In 1997, he was posthumously awarded a Ned Kelly, Australia’s leading literary award for crime writing, for his lifelong contribution to the art.

<doc id="9701472" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9701472" title="Timema">
Timema

Timema is a genus of relatively short-bodied, stout stick insects native to the far western United States. The genus was first described in 1895 by Samuel Hubbard Scudder, based on observations of the species "Timema californicum".
Compared to other stick insects (order Phasmatodea), the genus "Timema" is considered basal; that is, the earliest "branch" to diverge from the phylogenetic tree that includes all Phasmatodea. To emphasize this outgroup status, all stick insects not included in "Timema" are sometimes described as "Euphasmatodea."
Five of the twenty-one species of "Timema" are parthenogenetic, including two species that have not engaged in sexual reproduction for one million years, the longest known asexual period for any insect.
Description.
"Timema" spp. differ from other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three segments rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout bodies, so that they look somewhat like earwigs (order Dermaptera).
Cryptic coloration and camouflage.
"Timema" walking sticks are night-feeders who spend daytime resting on the leaves or bark of the plants they feed on. "Timema" colors (primarily green, gray, or brown) and patterns (which may be stripes, scales, or dots) match their typical background, a form of crypsis. 
In 2008, researchers studying the presence or absence of a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in "Timema" species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight "Timema" species with a dorsal stripe have at least one host plant with needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four ("T. ritensis", "T. podura", "T. genevieve", and "T. coffmani") rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species ("T. nakipa" and "T. boharti") have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts.
The species "Timema cristinae" exhibits both striped and unstriped populations depending on the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera "Adenostoma" and "Ceanothus". They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on "Adenostoma" while the other ecotype prefers to feed on "Ceanothus". The "Adenostoma" ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation to blend in with the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the "Ceanothus" ecotype does not ("Ceanothus" spp. have broad leaves). The "Adenostoma" ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.
These characteristics are genetically inherited and has been interpreted as the early stages of the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation is achieved. At the moment, both ecotypes are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered a single species.
Life cycle and reproduction.
"Timema" eggs are soft, ellipsoidal, and about two mm long, with a lid-like structure at one end (the operculum) through which the nymph will emerge. "Timema" females use particles of dirt, which they have previously ingested, to coat their eggs. 
The eggs of many stick insects, including "Timema", are attractive to ants, who carry them away to their burrows to feed on the egg's capitulum, while leaving the rest of the egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.
"Timema" males, in sexual species of "Timema", show a consistent pattern of courting behavior. The male climbs onto the back of the female and, after a short display of vibrating and waving, they proceed to mate. (Rejection by the female is possible but uncommon.) The male then rides on the female's back for up to five days, a behavior often referred to as "guarding" the female.
Several species of "Timema" are parthenogenetic: that is, females can reproduce asexually, producing viable eggs without male participation.
According to Tanja Schwander of Simon Fraser University, ""Timema" are indeed the oldest insects for which there is good evidence that they have been asexual for long periods of time." She heads a team of researchers who found that five "Timema" species ("T. douglasi", "T. monikensis", "T. shepardi", "T. tahoe" and "T. genevieve") have used only asexual reproduction for more than 500,000 years, with "T. tahoe" and "T. genevieve" reproducing asexually for over one million years.
Habitat.
The geographic range of "Timema" is limited to mountainous regions of western North America between 30° and 42° N. They are found primarily in California, as well as in a few other neighboring states (Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) and in northern Mexico. All are herbivores, primarily feeding on host plants found in chapparal.
Host plants of the different "Timema" species include "Pseudotsuga menziesii" (Douglas fir), "Sequoia sempervirens" (Californian redwood), "Arctostaphylos" spp. (manzanita), "Ceanothus" spp., "Adenostoma fasciculatum" (chamise), "Abies concolor" (white fir), "Quercus" spp. (oak), "Heteromeles arbutifolia" (toyon), "Cercocarpus" spp. (mountain-mahogany), "Eriogonum" sp. (buckwheat), and "Juniperus" spp. (juniper).
Phylogeny.
General phylogenetic relationships within "Timema" (Law & Crespi, 2002). Species marked with ♀ are parthenogenetic (female only).
Classification.
"Timema" is the only member of the family Timematidae and the suborder Timematodea. Their clade is considered considered basal to the order Phasmatodea; that is, many scientists believe that Timema-type stick insects represent the earliest "branch" to diverge from the phylogenetic tree that gave rise to all the stick insects of Phasmatodea. This primal distinction is referenced by the name "Euphasmatodea", which is given to all the clades of Phasmatodea other than the suborder Timematodea. 
Twenty-one species have been described; in addition there is at least one undescribed species known to exist:

Alaskan Hotel and Bar

The Alaskan Hotel and Bar is a historic establishment and oldest operating hotel in Juneau, Alaska. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in October 1978.
It was opened as "The Alaskan" on September 16, 1913. Its owners, three miners who struck it rich in the nearby Coast Range, tied the hotel's keys to a helium balloon and released it, signifying that the hotel would never close. The building was briefly condemned in the 1970s, but was rehabilitated by new owners.
In 2003 the Food Network show "Food Finds" filmed a segment at the establishment. In September 2013, the Travel Channel program "Hotel Impossible" filmed an episode at the hotel.

Gerolamo Marquese d' Andrea (1812–1868) was an Italian Cardinal. He was born at Naples, educated at the Collège of La Flèche, France, and was early appointed Archbishop of Mytilene "in partibus infidelium". 
In 1852 he was appointed Cardinal-abbot of Subiaco, and Prefect of the Congregation of the Index, and in 1860 Bishop of Sabina. 
He took sides with the Patriotic party in 1859 on the question of the national unity of Italy, and at the same time counseled extensive liberal reforms in Church policy. He was suspended from his diocese and abbacy and threatened with permanent deposition from office. He ultimately submitted, and in 1868 was rehabilitated, without, however, being restored to his diocese and the abbacy of Subiaco.

Nob End

Nob End is the site of a former waste tip which is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Local Nature Reserve near Little Lever and Kearsley, in Greater Manchester, England.
History.
Standing at the confluence of the River Irwell and River Croal the site was used around 1850-70 as a tip for alkaline waste from the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash) by the Leblanc process.
The waste, known as 'galligu', was a blue sludge (from reduced iron compounds) dominated by calcium sulphide and smelling of bad eggs. The surface of the waste has since weathered down to calcium carbonate and calcicolous vegetation has colonised the site.
The 8.8 hectare site became a SSSI in 1988 and a LNR in 2000.
In 1936 a major breach in the now defunct Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal occurred east of the Nob End locks and was never repaired.
Habitats.
There are a number of different habitats on the site, the creation of which were dependent upon: the type of waste deposited, the pattern of deposition and the nature of the underlying substrate:
Flora.
The flora found on the site includes: many types of Orchid, Bloomrape, Twayblade, Blue fleabane and Carline thistle.

Raxibacumab

Raxibacumab is a human monoclonal antibody intended for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhaled anthrax. Its efficacy has been proven in rabbits and monkeys. In December 2012 raxibacumab was approved for the treatment of inhalational anthrax due to "Bacillus anthracis" in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate.Approval Letter
The antibody was discovered in a joint venture between Cambridge Antibody Technology and Human Genome Sciences. Cambridge Antibody Technology discovered the antibody to Human Genome Sciences's target and, in 2012, HGS were purchased by GlaxoSmithKline.
According to GSK "Raxibacumab injection is a monoclonal antibody targeting the protective antigen (PA) component of the lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis and is being developed for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. The most commonly observed adverse events were headaches, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, pain in extremity (pain in limbs) and pruritus (skin itching). Local skin reaction in one study has led to the recommendation that an anti-histamine be administered prior to infusion."
GSK go on to say "Raxibacumab was developed by Human Genome Sciences (HGS) in conjunction with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under contract number HHS010020050006C. It is now part of GSK’s portfolio, following GSK’s acquisition of HGS in July 2012. The development of raxibacumab is the result of a coordinated response to a recognised public health threat and the US government’s request for new medical countermeasures in the event of an anthrax attack against the civilian population."
At the 2 November 2012 meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) members "voted 16 to 1 in support of the clinical benefit of raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, with one abstention. In addition, the committee voted 18 – 0 in favour of the risk-benefit profile of raxibacumab".
In 2009, support from the FDA was denied after it "expressed doubt on the agent's added benefit over the antibiotic levofloxacin (Levaquin) alone".
On Dec. 14, 2012, FDA approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax, a form of the infectious disease caused by breathing in the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Raxibacumab also is approved to prevent inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate.

Trevor Birch

Trevor Birch (born 16 February 1958) is an English football executive and former football player, currently serving as Partner in the Football Industry Group at accountancy firm PKF International. 
Birch started out as a footballer and was on the books of Liverpool – he was the last player signed by Bill Shankly – but only played for the reserves and by 1979 had left the club altogether. He also had brief spells with Shrewsbury Town and Chester City, after which he retired from playing professionally and became a chartered accountant, playing non-league football with clubs including Marine, Runcorn, Northwich Victoria and Skelmersdale United. Birch failed to score a league goal in his season with Chester but did find the net in the FA Cup against Barnsley.
Specialising in insolvency, Birch became chief executive of Chelsea, a club with a debt burden of around £80m, in February 2002, and attempted to restructure their finances. He also helped put together the £140m Roman Abramovich takeover during June and July 2003. The takeover wiped out most of the club's debts, making Birch's role no longer necessary, and he was replaced by Peter Kenyon. Birch was offered another role, but instead resigned. 
In October 2003, Birch was appointed chief executive of Leeds United, another club with high debts, and was briefly chairman following Professor John McKenzie's resignation. He helped the club avoid administration, and oversaw the takeover of Leeds by Gerald Krasner's consortium, before moving on to Everton in June 2004 to become their chief executive. Birch was given the task of overhauling the Merseyside club's finances, but resigned just six weeks later. 
In June 2007 he became chief executive officer of Derby County, replacing Mike Horton's previous role as managing director. Horton remained on the board as vice-chairman. 
In October 2007 Birch left Derby County. He was lined up to be the new Southampton Chairman heading the new regime if the proposed takeover from Daniel Williams had materialised.
On 20 November 2009, Sheffield United announced Birch as their new chief executive, replacing Terry Robinson.
On 17 February 2012, Birch was appointed – in his capacity as a Partner of PKF(UK)LLP (part of the PKF International group) – as administrator at financially troubled Portsmouth F.C.

International.
Prior to coming to America, Ackah played for the U-21 Ghana national team.
Career with the Wave.
He joined the Milwaukee Wave for the 1999-2000 season. In his first year in the league, he was named to the NPSL’s All-Rookie First Team. With his great defensive game, he also brought a knack for scoring - putting in 4 goals over the year, including a nicely placed game-winner on New Year's Eve.
In his second season with the wave, he was one of only four Wave players to play all 40 games. He was a key to the Wave's 2nd consecutive title, with 10 blocks in the 2001 playoffs.
Ackah was selected to his first All-Star game during the 2001-02 season.
In the 2002-03 season, Ackah made his 200th career block. He was also selected to his 2nd career All-Star game. His streak of playing in 122 consecutive games was broken in early January due to a game suspension from receiving a red card. That streak still stands as the fourth longest in the Wave's history.
He played at least the 2004 season with the Milwaukee Wave United of the USL A-League.2004 Wave United Stats
Ackah continued his success during the 2003-04 season; he had 67 blocks in 34 games. He also contributed 5 goals and 4 assists. He had 6 blocks in the All-Star game that year, more than any other player there.
The 2004-05 season was one of milestones for Ackah. He made his 300th block in March. He also put a goal in to help celebrate his 200th career game for the Wave in early December.
Although receiving the honor of being the league's Defense Player of the Week in November, Ackah missed most of the 2005-06 season due to a foot injury.
The MISL disbanded after the 2007-08 season, and the Wave joined the newly founded Xtreme Soccer League. Ackah resigned with the Wave on November 6, 2008, allowing him to play a 10th season with the club.
In 1999, he played for the Milwaukee Rampage of the USL A-League.
Personal life.
Ackah has two sons, Lovelace Jr. and Vince with his wife, Jael, and lives in New Berlin, Wisconsin.

Spanish Fly (instrumental)

"Spanish Fly" is an instrumental solo played on a nylon string acoustic guitar by Eddie Van Halen. It was featured on his band Van Halen's 1979 album "Van Halen II". The track was viewed by many as a follow up to the electric guitar instrumental "Eruption" from the band's first album "Van Halen" released in 1978.
The track is played in one take with a pick, rather than fingerstyle. It expands on many of the techniques used in "Eruption" such as tremolo picking and finger tapping. It is believed by many guitar players to be a more difficult piece than "Eruption". Guitarist Steve Vai has been known to say "Spanish Fly" is his favorite Van Halen song.

Washington State Route 823

State Route 823 is a state highway in Yakima County in the U.S. state of Washington. It runs for from a junction with Interstate 82, through the streets of Selah northward to a junction with State Route 821, which is also known as Canyon Road and Firing Center Road. Although not signed as such, SR 823 effectively functions as a Business-82 loop through Selah.
Route description.
State Route 823 begins at Exit 30 from I-82 a short distance southeast of Selah, one mile (1.6 km) north of the junction of U.S. Route 12 and I-82. Exit 30 is the Rest Haven Road/South Selah exit. SR 823 then crosses the Yakima River and follows Rest Haven Road NNW about , where its name changes to South Selah Road as it enters the town of Selah. At the southern edge of Selah, the road turns due north and becomes South First Street, the main street of Selah. First Street continues north until the intersection with Naches Avenue at the center of downtown Selah. SR 823 turns right (east) onto East Naches Avenue, continues one-tenth of a mile to the intersection with North Wenas Road, then turns NNE onto North Wenas Road. SR 823 continues on North Wenas Road to the junction with Harrison Road, where the highway then turns northeast. SR 823 follows Harrison Road as it runs northeast and then east, re-crosses the Yakima River, and continues to its terminus at State Route 821, known locally as Firing Center Road to the east and Canyon Road to the north. Firing Center Road is so named because it is the entrance to the Yakima Training Center, a large U.S. Army center for weapons training in the hills east of Yakima.
History.
State Route 823 was formerly a section of U.S. Route 97, the major north–south highway in Washington east of the Cascades. US 97 ran northward through Yakima, through the center of Selah, and continued north through the Ellensburg Canyon on what is now SR 821. In the 1970s I-82 was constructed east of old US 97 over Manastash Ridge, bypassing central Selah and Yakima. When I-82 was opened US 97 was rerouted to be concurrent with I-82 between Ellensburg and the Yakima River Valley. This left the old US 97 as a local road. In 1984 the legislature defined the old highway as Route 823 from I-82 Exits 30/30A into downtown Selah. In 1992, SR 823 was redefined northward to the junction with SR 821/Firing Center Road.
Planned improvements.
As of February 2007, the Washington State Department of Transportation is planning improvements and rerouting of SR 823 in Selah to alleviate congestion on the streets of Selah. The new road will be moved from First Avenue a few blocks east to South Wenas Avenue to bypass the direct center of Selah. The new road is planned to begin construction in 2009 and to open in 2011. According to WSDOT:
The Washington State code that was established for the definition of SR 823 contains a clause requiring the sharing of costs for highway improvement between the state and local governments. This clause was added because SR 823 is used chiefly by local traffic within Selah.

Strahov Monastery

Strahov Monastery () is a Premonstratensian abbey founded in 1143 by Bishop Jindřich Zdík, Bishop John of Prague, and Duke Vladislav II. It is located in Strahov, Prague, Czech Republic.
History.
The founding of a monastery.
After his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1138 the bishop of Olomouc Jindřich Zdík took hold of the idea of founding a monastery of regular canons in Prague, having the support of the bishops of Prague and the Duke of Bohemia Soběslav I and after his death, Vladislav II. After his first unsuccessful attempt to found a Czech variant of the canons' order at the place called Strahov in 1140, an invitation was issued to the Premonstratensians whose first representatives arrived from Steinfeld in the Rhine valley (Germany). Thus a monastery originated which has inscribed itself in the Czech political, cultural and religious history for all time.
The religious began to build their monastery first of wood, as well as a Romanesque basilica as the center of all spiritual events in Strahov. The building was gradually completed and the construction of the monastery stone buildings continued in order to replace the provisional wooden living quarters with permanent stone. In 1258 the monastery was heavily damaged by fire and later renewed.
During the Hussite Wars.
The monastery continued functioning until the period of the Hussite movement when it was attacked and plundered by the citizens of Prague in 1420. Books, articles of worship and furnishings of both the church and the convent were burned. Although the building did not sustain great damage from the architectural viewpoint, the monastery took a long time to recover from this disaster.
The period of the Hussite wars, the years of the reign of George of Poděbrady and the time up to the end of the 16th century meant vegetation rather than life for the monastery. During that time endeavours were made once again to renew the original monastery and life in it, but that did not prove successful.
It was not until the arrival of the abbot Jan Lohelius that a turn came about. This cleric, originally of Teplá Abbey, became the abbot of Strahov in 1586 and all his abilities were devoted to the renewal of Strahov. He tried to raise the spiritual life of the monastery and, as a visitator circarie, also of the Premonstratensian order as a whole in Bohemia, he also devoted attention to the material aspect of things. He reconstructed the church, renewed the abbey buildings, established workshops, built a new dormitory and refectory and had the monastery gardens newly laid out. He regained many of the monastery estates and thus built up the material base of the monastery, so necessary for its maintenance and further development. Proof of his enormous endeavours and untiring activity also lies in the fact that already in 1594 a twelve-member community of religious could live in the monastery.
During the Thirty Years' War.
In 1612 Jan Lohelius became the archbishop of Prague, his work at Strahov then being continued by the new abbot, Kašpar Questenberg. He continued in the expensive work started by Lohelius, completed the lower cloisters and prelature and even erected a new building in the form of St. Elizabeth's Hospital as well as out-buildings and a brewery. Furthermore, he founded the Norbertine seminary in the New Town, which was intended for the theological studies of members of the order. All this was achieved during the Thirty Years' War, when Kašpar Questenberg himself was forced by the violence to flee from Prague. The financial account of the costs incurred by his building activities amounted to about 100,000 tolars, which at that time was a very respectable sum for any building work. In this respect Kašpar Questenberg could calmly compete with such builders as his contemporary Albrecht of Wallenstein.
One of the biggest events in the history of the Premonstratensian order was the transfer of the remains of St. Norbert, the founder of the order, from Magdeburg took place under Questenberg's abbacy. This came about in 1627, and since then the remains of the saintly founder have laid at rest in the abbey church. During Questenberg's time the Church of St. Roch was also completed. Originally it was a votive church whose construction was started by the Emperor Rudolph II in 1602 as an expression of thanks for the end of the plague in 1599. After numerous changes of fortune the church was completed, including its interior, by 1630.
When Kašpar Questenberg died in 1640 his successor was Kryšpin Fuk, who continued in his work. Moreover, he gained renown for himself through his participation in the making of the river Vltava navigable in the sector called St. John's Rapids ("Svatojánské proudy"). During this period the abbey was plundered by Swedish troops towards the end of the Thirty Years' War. The church and the library were looted. After the departure of the Swedes, Kryšpin Fuk had the damaged abbey repaired again, his work being continued by the Abbots Ameluxen, Sutor and Franck. The last-mentioned had the prelature reconstructed and a new St. Elizabeth's Hospital built, because the original one built by Kašpar Questenberg was demolished during the construction of Baroque fortifications in Prague.
The Theological Hall.
In 1670 Jeroným Hirnheim, a philosopher and theologian became the abbot of Strahov. His greatest work, which has survived to the present days, was the building of the new library, so-called Theological Hall ("Teologický sál") completed in 1679. During the 17th and the early 18th century other abbots continued in the reconstruction of the monastery. They also cared for the church, which was repaired and decorated several times during the given period. The monastery experienced other great building activity namely after the assault of French and Bavarian troops in 1742, when whole Prague was bombarded and seriously damaged. After this destruction of the monastery the abbot organized building works again in the course of which the church was rebuilt along with the monastery area.
The Philosophical Hall.
In 1779 Václav Mayer occupied the abbot's throne and was the last to carry out great building activities. His most outstanding work was the building of the new library, now in Classical style. Today it is called the Philosophical Hall ("Filosofický sál"). This work brought the extensive building activity at Strahov Monastery to an end and the following generations of abbots devoted their attention merely to minor architectural repairs, all under the influence of contemporary fashion, and to maintenance of the area as a whole.
The monastery survived in this way until 1950, when it was taken over by the communist regime, the religious being interned and placed in civil employment, very few of them being able to work in the clerical administration as priests of the diocese. The monastery was subjected to thorough archeological research and transformed into the Memorial of National Literature. In the course of the said archeological research the long since forgotten Romanesque form of the monastery was revealed and reconstructed in a sensitive way.
After the Velvet Revolution.
After the shackles of communism were thrown off in 1989 the monastery was returned to the Premonstratensian Order, which began to realize a costly reconstruction of the building. By 1994 the church had been restored, a new technical network constructed, the Strahov picture gallery newly built, and the Strahov library renewed. Other architectural restorations were also carried out.

Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe

Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe than m,n,k-games are. Instead of the goal being limited to "in a row" constructions, the goal can be any polyomino (Note that when this generalization is made diagonal constructions are not considered a win). It was devised by Frank Harary in March 1977.
Like many other games, the second player cannot win (the reason is detailed on the m,n,k-game page). All that is left to study then is to determine if the first player can win, on what board sizes he may do so, and in how many moves it will take.
Results.
Square boards.
Let "b" be the smallest size square board on which the first player can win, and let "m" be the smallest number of moves in which the first player can force a win, assuming perfect play by both sides.

The Sørensen–Dice index, also known by other names (see Names, below), is a statistic used for comparing the similarity of two samples. It was independently developed by the botanists Thorvald Sørensen and Lee Raymond Dice, who published in 1948 and 1945 respectively.
Name.
The index is known by several other names, usually Sørensen index or Dice's coefficient. Both names also see "similarity coefficient", "index", and other such variations. Common alternate spellings for Sørensen are Sorenson, Soerenson index and Sörenson index, and all three can also be seen with the –sen ending.
Other names include:
Quantitative version.
The expression is easily extended to abundance instead of presence/absence of species. This quantitative version is known by several names:
Formula.
Sørensen's original formula was intended to be applied to presence/absence data, and is
where "A" and "B" are the number of species in samples A and B, respectively, and "C" is the number of species shared by the two samples; QS is the quotient of similarity and ranges from 0 to 1. which is always in [0, 1] range. 
It can be viewed as a similarity measure over sets:
Similarly to Jaccard, the set operations can be expressed in terms of vector operations over binary vectors "A" and "B":
formula_3
is not a proper distance metric as it does not possess the property of triangle inequality. The simplest counterexample of this is given by the three sets {a}, {b}, and {a,b}, the distance between the first two being 1, and the difference between the third and each of the others being one-third. To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of "any" two of these three sides must be greater than the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1.
Applications.
The Sørensen–Dice coefficient is mainly useful for ecological community data (e.g. Looman & Campbell, 1960). Justification for its use is primarily empirical rather than theoretical (although it can be justified theoretically as the intersection of two fuzzy sets). As compared to Euclidean distance, Sørensen distance retains sensitivity in more heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers.

Spencer Butte

Spencer Butte is a prominent landmark in Lane County, Oregon, United States, on the southern edge of Eugene, with an elevation of . Spencer Butte is accessible from Spencer Butte Park and has several hiking trails to the summit. The tree cover on the butte is predominantly Douglas-fir, however the butte is treeless at its summit. The butte is the tallest point visible when looking south from downtown Eugene.
Name.
The butte was called Champ-a te or Cham-o-tee by the native Kalapuya, meaning rattlesnake.
One popular theory is that Spencer Butte was named for a young Englishman of the Hudson's Bay Company named Spencer, who was said to have been killed by the Kalapuya after climbing the hill alone. Another, less popular theory holds that the butte was named after Secretary of War John C. Spencer in July 1845 by Elijah White. Spencer was no longer Secretary of War by 1845, however.

SC Waldgirmes

SC Waldgirmes is a German association football club from Waldgirmes, Hesse. The 700 member club is best known for its football team, but also has departments for table tennis, women's gymnastics, alpine gymnastics, and cycling.
History.
The association was founded in 1929 as "SG Waldgirmes". As a worker's side the club was banned for political reasons when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and a number of the footballers left for "TV 05 Waldgirmes" where they formed a football department. After World War II occupying Allied authorities banned all organizations in the country including sports and football associations. "SG Waldgirmes" was re-established in the summer of 1945 as a general community sports association. In 1948 the football side went its own way as the independent club "FC Waldgirmes" until being re-united with its parent in 1952 to form "SC Waldgirmes".
The footballers were promoted to Landesliga Hessen-Mitte in 1970 and played at that level over the next three decades with the exception of single season demotions in 1975 and 1993. In 2002 "Waldgirmes" earned promotion to the Oberliga Hessen (IV) after capturing their first Landesliga (V) title. They were relegated after a last place finish but immediately won their way back to fourth tier Oberliga play the next season, where they archived good results in the following season. In 2008–09, the club won the Oberliga but decided not to apply for a Regionalliga licence and remained at this level. In 2012-13 the club finished 14th in the league and was relegated after coming last in the relegation/promotion round.
The club's reserve team, the SC Waldgirmes II, plays only one level below the first team, in the "Verbandsliga".

Manhattan Beach Boulevard

Manhattan Beach Boulevard is a major east-west thoroughfare in western Los Angeles County. It begins at a T-intersection with Van Ness Avenue in Gardena and terminates at the Manhattan Beach pier, feet from the Pacific Ocean. It passes under Interstate 405, but cars cannot enter or exit the freeway at that point (the closest onramp is a block north on Inglewood Boulevard). 
The boulevard is one of the five principal roadways in Manhattan Beach (the other four being Rosecrans Avenue, Sepulveda Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and Aviation Boulevard), and the intersection between it and Sepulveda is one of the busiest in the city. As implied by its name, Manhattan Beach Boulevard consists of at least six lanes for its entire length, with the exception of between Pacific Avenue and The Strand, where it is reduced to two lanes.
Manhattan Beach Boulevard provides service with Metro Local line 126.

Barnum's American Museum

Barnum's American Museum was located at the corner of Broadway and Ann Street in New York City, USA, from 1841 to 1865. The museum was owned by famous showman P.T. Barnum, who purchased Scudder's American Museum in 1841. The museum offered both strange and educational attractions. It burned to the ground in 1865. The museum is also referenced in the broadway musical "Barnum". It was relaunched on the Internet in July 2000.
History.
In 1841 Barnum bought Scudder’s American Museum located across from St. Paul’s on the southeast corner of Broadway and Ann Street. He transformed the five-story exterior into a giant, gaudy advertisement for itself, with painted animals, illuminated panels, banners and flags, then lit it all up with limelight, a recent invention. He hired the worst musicians he could find to play on a balcony above the entrance, on the theory that their terrible noise would drive customers inside. 
Barnum opened his museum on January 1, 1842 to create a place where families could go for wholesome, affordable entertainment, but his success drew from the fact that he knew how to entice an audience. Its attractions made it a combination zoo, museum, lecture hall, wax museum, theater and freak show, that was, at the same time, a central site in the development of American popular culture. Barnum filled the American Museum with dioramas, panoramas, “cosmoramas,” scientific instruments, modern appliances, a flea circus, a loom run by a dog, the trunk of a tree under which Jesus’ disciples sat, a hat worn by Ulysses S. Grant, an oyster bar, a rifle range, waxworks, glass blowers, taxidermists, phrenologists, pretty-baby contests, Ned the learned seal, the Feejee Mermaid (a mummified monkey’s torso with a fish’s tail), midgets, Chang and Eng the Siamese twins, a menagerie of exotic animals that included beluga whales in an aquarium, giants, Grizzly Adams’s trained bears and performances ranging from magicians, ventriloquists and blackface minstrels to adaptations of biblical tales and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” 
At its peak, the museum was open fifteen hours a day and had as many as 15,000 visitors a day. Some 38 million customers paid the 25 cents admission to attend the museum between 1841 and 1865. The total population of the United States in 1860 was under 32 million.
On July 13, 1865, the American Museum burned to the ground in one of the most spectacular fires New York has ever seen. Animals at the museum were seen jumping from the burning building, only to be shot by police officers. Barnum tried to open another museum soon after that, but that also burned down in a mysterious fire in 1868. It was after this time that Barnum moved on to politics and the circus industry. Barnum's American Museum was one of the most popular attractions of its time.
In July 2000 a virtual museum version opened on the Internet, supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The CUNY Graduate Center rebuilt the five-story museum on a Web site with the aim to provide students and history buffs with a full archive of information about the museum and relevant 19th-century subjects.
Attractions.
The museum's collection included items collected throughout the world over a period of 25 years. The museum offered many attractions which grew to great fame. One of the most famous was General Tom Thumb a 25-inch tall dwarf. Thumb wasn't the only physical oddity there, there was also the Fiji Mermaid and Josephine Boisdechene, who had a large beard, which had grown to the length of two inches when she was only eight years old. As if to supplement Tom Thumb, another famous attraction of the museum was William Henry Johnson, who was one of Barnum's longest running attractions.
Another one of the famous attractions at the museum were Chang and Eng, Siamese twins who were extremely argumentative, both with each other and Barnum himself.
The museum also boasted an elegant theatre, called the "Lecture Room," and characterized in the popular "Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion" of 1853, "one of the most elegant and recherche halls of its class to be found anywhere," which would offer "every species of entertainment" "'from grave to gay, from lively to severe,' and "judiciously purged of every semblance of immorality." 
At one point, Barnum noticed that people were lingering too long at his exhibits. He posted signs indicating "This Way to the Egress". Not knowing that "Egress" was another word for "Exit", people followed the signs to what they assumed was a fascinating exhibit...and ended up outside.
The five story building also served great educational value. Aside from the different attractions, the Museum also promoted educational ends, including natural history in its menageries, aquarium (which featured a large white whale), and taxidermy exhibits; history in its paintings, wax figures, and memorabilia; and temperance reform and Shakespearean dramas in the above described "Lecture Room" or theater.

Paul Chalifoux

Paul Chalifoux is a politician and the former mayor of St. Albert, Alberta, He has served two terms as mayor, first one having taken place from 1998 to 2001 and the second from 2004 to 2007.
Chalifoux's first attempt at winning elected office was in the 1968 federal election, when he ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the riding of Pembina. He finished a distant second to Progressive Conservative Jack Bigg.
Before serving as mayor, Chalifoux was a city alderman and the assistant principal of St. Albert Catholic High School. In 1998, he defeated three-term incumbent Anita Ratchinsky in an election whose major issue was the alignment of the proposed West Regional Road. Ratchinsky favoured a road that would bypass the developed portion of the city to the west by crossing the Sturgeon River close to the mouth of Big Lake, while Chalifoux supported an alignment that would cross the river further upstream.
During Chalifoux's time as mayor, the road remained St. Albert's most contentious political issue. City Council approved Chalifoux's preferred alignment, by this time named Ray Gibbon Drive. However, an aggressive public relations campaign by the Riel Park Business Association, which did not like the way the proposed road would pass through Riel Business Park, and a group calling itself S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice, attacked the alignment. In the 2001 election, Chalifoux was defeated by former mayor Dr. Richard Plain, who favoured the same alignment as Ratchinsky and proposed a plebiscite on the subject.
Chalifoux challenged Plain again in 2004, campaigning this time on issues other than the road, saying that "it time to move on". He won narrowly. On May 22, 2007, Chalifoux announced that he would not seek re-election (and, in so doing, provoke a third consecutive electoral battle against Plain) and would instead seek the nomination for the Progressive Conservatives in the next provincial election. Some perceived this as ironic given his past candidacy for the federal Liberals and given that he had inadvertently implicated the City of St. Albert in a minor scandal when he attended a fundraiser for the Alberta Liberal Party at the city's expense, which violated provincial law. Chalifoux acknowledges that he has been a member of the Liberal Party at both the provincial and federal levels at various points in his life, but claims that it has been more than a decade since his last provincial membership expired. He was defeated on the first ballot by former aldermanic colleague Ken Allred.
Chalifoux is a member of the Rotary Club and is a practising Catholic. His late son, Rick Chalifoux, was a prominent educator and advocate on HIV/AIDS issues.

Bob's Stores

Bob's Stores is a chain of 35 retail stores in the northeastern United States owned by Versa Capital Management. Founded as Bob's Surplus in Middletown, Connecticut, by Bob Lapidus in 1954, the chain expanded gradually until it was acquired by TJX in 2003. The chain targets moderate to high-income customers with a selection of footwear, workwear, teamwear, and activewear.
History.
In 1954, Bob Lapidus opened Bob's Surplus on Main Street in Middletown, Connecticut. His original business strategy was to "Treat all customers with respect and dignity and they will return again and again". As Bob's Surplus increased in popularity, its location was hindering its growth; in 1962, Lapidus moved the store to a larger building across the street. In 1967, the store was forced to move again after a fire destroyed the building.
In 1975, the second Bob's Surplus was opened in Enfield, Connecticut; the third store was opened in Hamden, Connecticut, in 1981. The chain renamed itself to simply "Bob's" in 1985, and began changing its marketing strategy by emphasizing quality and adding casual activewear to its list of products. In 1990, the chain had expanded to five stores; that year, it was acquired by the Melville Corporation (now CVS Corporation). Bob's expanded rapidly under the corporation; by March 1, 1996, the chain had grown to 34 stores across the northeastern United States. During this period, Melville considered Bob's Stores a key company, stating that they were spending time to "lay a solid base for rapid expansion Bob's Stores in the years ahead". Despite the growth, Bob's Stores remained most popular in its origin state of Connecticut.
In 1997, Melville sold all of its chains except CVS Pharmacy; Bob's Stores was sold to the chain's management and Citicorp Venture Capital. In 1999, the upper executive level of the chain experienced numerous changes in personnel while many in the company became concerned with competition from stores like Kohl's. However, Bob's focus on sports team-related apparel was considered a strength during this period; one Bob's executive stated that the lack of a consistent national sports champion in the late 1990s hurt larger chains more than they hurt Bob's Stores, because consumers were more interested in regional teams (which the chain supplies). In 2000, Bob's Stores created its first website.
In 2003, Bob's Stores went bankrupt. In late 2003, Dick's Sporting Goods outbid companies such as TJX Companies and tried to buy the chain for over $113 million. Dick's had intended to close most of the Bob's Stores locations. TJX felt that that this was unfair to the employees and TJX brought it to court in Maine. The courts sided with TJX to save the thousands of jobs that would have been lost and TJX was allowed to purchase the chain for $113 million. TJX Companies expressed interest in Bob's Stores because it shared similar characteristics to other TJX chains, including large stores and similar brands. Although there were also numerous differences between Bob's Stores and TJX's other chains, one expert felt that this would help diversify TJX's lineup.
On August 19, 2008, TJX announced they would sell Bob's to private equity firms Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.
Bob's Stores launched an online store June 1, 2012.

Soldier settlement (Australia)

Soldier settlement refers to the occupation and settlement of land throughout parts of Australia by returning discharged soldiers under schemes administered by the State Governments after World Wars I and II.
World War I.
Such settlement plans initially began during World War I, with South Australia first enacting legislation in 1915 but the whole of Australia gaining significant impetus to also move in that direction when in February 1916 a conference of representatives of both the Commonwealth and the States was held in Melbourne to consider a report prepared by the Federal Parliamentary War Committee regarding the settlement of returned soldiers on the land. The report focused specifically on a Commonwealth-State cooperative process of selling or leasing Crown land to soldiers who had been demobilised following the end of their service in this first global conflict. The meeting agreed that it was the Commonwealth Government's role to select and acquire land whilst the State government authorities would process applications and grant land allotments.
Crown land was used where possible, but much land was acquired. By 1924, just over 24 million acres (97,000 km²) had been acquired or allocated. Of this nearly 6.3 million acres (25,000 km²) was purchased and 18 million acres (73,000 km²) was crown land set aside. 23.2 million acres (93,900 km²) had been allotted 23,367 farms across Australia.
Other than supporting soldiers and sailors that were returning from those wars the various governments also saw the opportunity of attracting both Australians and specific groups of allied 
service personnel to some of the otherwise little inhabited, remote areas of Australia. Although the Commonwealth held responsibility for defence, and thus might have taken responsibility for demobilised soldiers, it was the States which took responsibility for land settlement and thus enacted separate soldier settlement schemes. The States also wished to take an active role in recognising the contribution of soldiers.
Areas that gained such settlement included places such as:
By 30 June 1924 a total of 23,367 returned soldiers and sailors had taken up settlement farms on 23,275,380 acres (94,192 km²) across Australia as per the following breakdown:
World War II.
The procedure of supporting such soldiers was repeated after World War II with all Australian state governments using the previous and amended forms of such acts of parliament to reinvigorate the program for this new generation of returned soldiers.
Rules of holding soldier settlement land.
In most cases Crown land was set apart for returning soldiers who in order to buy or lease such a block were required to be certified as qualified and to remain in residence on that land for 5 years. In this way remote rural areas set aside for such settlement were guaranteed a population expansion which remained to increase infrastructure in the area.
Soldiers who were successful in gaining such a block of land had the opportunity to start a farming life in a number of rural activities including as wool, dairy, cattle, pigs, fruit, fodder and grain. These initial land allotments resulted in triumph for some and despair for others. Indeed specifically following World War I, in some cases these new farmers, unable to cope with the climatic variances of Australia and devoid of the capital to increase stock or quality of life, simply walked off the land back to the large towns and cities from whence they had come.
The success of the program increased after World War II when the infrastructure required for these new farmers was improved as a direct result of learning from the mistakes that came during and after the first attempts at such settlement.
Settlement by state.
South Australia.
Following World War I, soldiers who had previously worked on irrigation activities along the Murray River during the years leading up to the war returned to find that their previous jobs were no longer available.
The South Australian government responded as early as 1915 with the first of the acts of parliament designed to both repatriate and compensate returning servicemen, and to meet the political and economic need to 'sponsor' the development of intensively productive agriculture pursuits. Soldiers were informed of the availability of the scheme via the media and in the material provided in both recruitment packages and general information forwarded to men serving overseas.
Settlement schemes during and after the conclusion of World War I saw properties specialising in dairy, grapes, vegetables, grains, and grazing develop along the River in Cobdogla, Waikerie, Berri, Cadell, Chaffey and near Renmark.
Following a number of acts that dealt with Soldier Settlement the South Australian government introduced the "Discharged Soldier Settlement Act 1934" which consolidated acts such as the "Crown Lands Act 1929" and the "Irrigation Act 1930" for the benefit of any discharged soldier who had served in connection with the Great War and had been a member of the British Army or Navy or of the Australian Imperial Force or of any other naval or military force raised in any part of the British Empire for service in that War, or to the widow (who had children) of any such who had died or dies from wounds inflicted, accident occurring, or disease contracted whilst on service.
Settlement schemes after World War II expanded to include the Loxton Irrigation Area, which became the largest such scheme in South Australia, and to another part of the previously developed area of Chaffey. The Returned Services League (RSL) lobbied the state government to open up more land for returned soldiers at Loxton, and returning soldiers were informed of the scheme at the RSL through handout material. Settlement schemes after World War II also led to the establishment of the new towns of Parndana on Kangaroo Island and Padthaway in the south east of the state.
However whilst the first world war settlers had achieved only a modicum of success the benefit of that previous experience helped the second world war veterans, particularly in Loxton, to avoid some past mistakes and with the assistance of the Department of Lands, the community worked together in order to survive and prosper. Irrigation schemes that eventually arrived saw the advent of the productive orchard and vineyard concerns that became so important to the overall region as it exists today.
New South Wales.
The State Government of New South introduced the Returned Soldiers Settlement Act, 1916 shortly after the combined Commonwealth and State meeting held in Melbourne earlier that year (see above). Soldiers who had served outside of Australia either as a part of the Australian Imperial Forces or as a part of the British Defence Service and who had been honourably discharged were eligible to apply for Crown Lands. This was land that the Commonwealth Government had acquired under either the Closer Settlement Acts, Murrumbidgee Irrigation Act, or was available as a part of general disposal under the Crown Lands Consolidation Act.
Ex-servicemen were required to apply for such land via completion of appropriate paperwork and if successful a soldier could gain additional financial assistance for the purpose of clearing, fencing, drainage, water supply and other improvement of the land as well as for the erection of buildings and the purchase of stock, seeds, implements, plants and similar material necessary for the occupation and development of the land. 
By 1917 the state government saw fit to enact the Returned Soldiers Settlement (Amendment) Act, which broadened the definition of returned soldiers to include those who had not enlisted in Australia and those who had not served overseas, as well as providing for potential further categories of soldiers. 
In the period October 1917 – June 1917, twelve soldier settlement projects were commenced. Projects areas included Bankstown and Seven Hills in the outer metropolitan area and rural Glen Innes, Hillston, and Batlow. Industries commenced included poultry, horticulture, pig, fruit, and market gardening.
New South Wales also repeated the process following World War II with settlements commencing in areas including Dareton.
Victoria.
The "Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Act" of 1917 established the scheme. Between 1918 and 1934, 11,639 returned servicemen were allocated blocks under the soldier settlement scheme. Most settled in the Mallee, South Gippsland, the Western District and the irrigation areas of the North West, Central Gippsland near Maffra and Sale and in the Goulburn Valley.
During the 1920s soldier settlers struggled and of those allocated blocks under the scheme, only sixty-one per cent were on blocks in 1934. By 1939 60% had left their blocks. The scheme was criticised by a Victorian Royal Commission in 1925 and a later Commonwealth inquiry. The Royal Commission identified four main reasons for the failure of soldier settlers:
It was also claimed that returned soldiers were allocated blocks of land without having established their ability to manage a farm.
After World War II, the Soldier Settlement Scheme was refined in the light of past failures. Blocks were bigger, were more carefully selected and roads, housing and fences were supplied to prospective settlers.
The Heytesbury Settlement Scheme was one of the last large scale soldier settlement schemes in Victoria
Western Australia.
In Western Australia, the War Service Settlement program settled hundreds of soldiers, mostly in the Wheatbelt. Initially, fully and partially developed farms were bought, improved and subdivided by the government, then sold to returned soldiers. In 1949, the price of land rose sharply, so the government began to develop virgin crown land in the south of the state. By 1958, demand for land by ex-servicemen had declined, but the scheme had been so successful that the government was reluctant to end it, so it instead opened it up to all civilians. This continued until 1969, when a wheat glut forced the government to impose quotas on wheat planting.

The family eventually moved back to the UK during his teens. He was involved with many local bands including Medusa where he met then bassist Andy Merz. CJ's first notable success was during the late 1980s as the guitarist of London-based hair rockers Tattooed Love Boys who released their "Bleeding Hearts and Needle Marks" album in 1988.
He left the same year and formed The Wildhearts with ex-The Quireboys guitarist Ginger (David Walls). Despite being plagued by widely reported drug and alcohol problems, the band enjoyed considerable mainstream success during the early 90s, including 2 UK top 20 hits. In 1994, at their commercial peak, CJ was unexpectedly kicked out during the recording of the "P.H.U.Q." album due to personal differences between himself and Ginger.
He soon went on to enjoy further success with ex-Wildhearts keyboard player Willie Dowling in Honeycrack, before eventually forming his own band, The Jellys, with ex-Wildhearts drummer Stidi. The Jellys disbanded when CJ and Stidi both re-joined The Wildhearts in 2001 and recorded The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed, both staying in the band until they split again in 2005. The Wildhearts reformed again in 2006 with a new line-up including CJ, but he also formed his own band, 'CJ & The Satellites', releasing one album ("Thirteen") in 2007. He went on to record the eponymous album "The Wildhearts" in 2007 and "Chutzpah!" in 2009, with the Wildhearts. 
He appeared on bandmate Ginger's 555% triple album in 2012, recording vocals and guitars, and also performed with Ginger at his birthday gigs in December 2011, 2012 and 2013 (the latter two both with The Wildhearts).
CJ announced in early 2014 that he would be releasing a solo album, called 'Mable', as part of a Pledge Campaign, and also reissuing the 'Thirteen' album from 2007. 
He has also created a line of hot sauces with Chilli Devil Sauces.

Kate Brown (politician)

Kate Brown (born June 21, 1960) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party. She currently serves as the Oregon Secretary of State and was elected to that office in the 2008 elections. She was re-elected to a second term in 2012.
Prior to becoming Secretary of State, Brown served in the Oregon State Senate representing Oregon's 21st senate district, which includes portions of Northeast and Southeast Portland and Milwaukie. As Oregon does not have a lieutenant governor, Brown is first in line to succeed to the office of governor if the governor should become unable to perform the duties of the office.
Early life.
Brown was born in Torrejón de Ardoz, Spain where her father was serving in the United States Air Force, but was raised mostly in Minnesota. She earned a B.A. in Environmental Conservation with a certificate in Women’s Studies from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and a law degree and Certificate in Environmental Law from the Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College.
Career.
Law.
Brown has taught at Portland State University, and practiced family and juvenile law. She was a family attorney with the Juvenile Rights Project, a non-profit corporation in Portland, providing legal services to children and families with both defense and advocacy programs.
Politics.
She began her legislative career in 1991 in the Oregon House of Representatives, where she was reelected to a second term before being elected to the Senate in 1996. Two years later, she was elected Senate Democratic Leader and in 2004, senators made her the first woman to serve as Oregon's Senate Majority Leader.
In July 2007, Brown announced that she would give up her seat in the Oregon Senate to be a candidate for Oregon Secretary of State in 2008. On May 20, 2008, Brown won the election for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of State, and on November 5 she won the general election by a 51-46% margin against Republican candidate Rick Dancer.
In 2009, the Aspen Institute named Brown as one of 24 "Rising Stars" in American politics and awarded her with a Rodel Fellowship. The program is a two-year fellowship designed to break down partisan barriers and explore the responsibilities of public leadership and good governance.
Oregon Secretary of State.
Audits Division.
Coming into office, one of Brown’s priorities was to perform rigorous performance audits to help balance the budget. In 2008 for every dollar the state spent on performance audits returned $8 in cost savings. In 2010, Brown reported she delivered $64 in cost savings and efficiencies for every dollar invested in the division.
Corporation Division.
The Corporation Division is the first place where businesses go. Brown is implementing Governor Vic Atiyeh's vision of a one-stop-shop for businesses, where they can get everything they need in one place, at the same time. In 2012, Brown launched Oregon's business portal to make it easier for business to start, expand, and access the services they need like loans and licensing.
Elections Division.
In 2009, Brown introduced and passed House Bill 2005 to crack down on fraud and abuse in the initiative and referendum system. It gave the Secretary of State more power to prosecute fraud and enforce the constitutional ban on paying per signature on initiatives. 
The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center released its annual report card in August 2011 to assess the level of accountability, transparency, and integrity in the 24 states where citizens are able to place measures on the ballot. Because of the reforms Brown helped pass, Oregon received the highest grade in the nation. 
Brown also implemented online voter registration. On March 1, 2010, online voter registration celebrated its one-year anniversary. Oregon Public Broadcasting noted nearly 87,000 Oregonians had already registered to vote online.
In 2012, the Military Voter Protection Project awarded Brown for her "extraordinary efforts" after eliminating barriers to military voter participation.
StateTech Magazine featured Brown in October 2012 for her innovative use of iPad and tablet technology to increase accessibility for voters with disabilities. In 2011, Oregon became the first jurisdiction in the country to use this technology to help voters with disabilities mark their ballots.
Personal life.
Brown lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband Dan. She has two stepchildren Dylan and Jessie. She identifies as bisexual and was America's first openly bisexual statewide officeholder.

Diana von Solange

Diana von Solange is an opera by the German prince Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, an amateur composer. It was premiered in 1858. In 1859, Franz Liszt wrote an orchestral "Festmarsch nach Motiven von E. H. z. S-C-G", S.116, based on themes from "Diana von Solange" (E. H. z. S-C-G was short for Ernst Herzog zu Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha).
It is now best remembered for its brief appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1891. The opera was one of three novelties introduced for the 1890–91 season by the Metropolitan's general manager, Edmund C. Stanton; the others were "Asrael" by Alberto Franchetti, which opened the season on November 26, and Antonio Smareglia's "Il vassallo di Szigeth". Both were poorly received. "Diana von Solange", the last of the three, was first shown on January 9, 1891; the performance marked its American premiere. Pauline Schöller-Haag sang the title role to the Armand of Andreas Dippel. Marie Jahn, Conrad Behrens, Juan Luria, Edmund Müller, and Bruno Lurgenstein rounded out the cast, under the direction of Anton Seidl. The opera also contained a ballet, which was singled out for praise by the "New York World".
Reviews of the opera were almost all negative; one writer described the piece as "simply rubbish", while others derisively referred to it as "Diana von So-Langweilig" (so boring). Another critic predicted that the work would not last three performances in the house; in the event, it lasted two. When it was discovered that a third outing was intended on January 12, a petition, bearing three hundred signatures and demanding that the opera be removed from the repertory, was delivered to the management, who hastily replaced it with "Fidelio". "Diana von Solange" marked the final blow against Stanton; two days after the cancelled third performance, on January 14, it was announced that he was to be replaced by Henry Eugene Abbey for the following season.
Many critics wondered why, given its pedigree, its age, and its relative obscurity, "Diana von Solange" was even considered for performance by the Metropolitan. Although it was never proven, many critics suspected that Stanton and others in the company were motivated by the Duke's known "lavishness ... in the distribution of orders, especially among musicians". The general manager and other executives were believed to have in fact received such decorations, but were reportedly too ashamed of the whole debacle to be seen in public wearing them. However, Louis Auchincloss, Stanton's grand-nephew, suggests Stanton wanted to honor the Duke as a fellow admirer of Richard Wagner, to whom Ernest II had considered dedicating the opera. 
Despite the opera's poor reception, Andreas Dippel was singled out for praise by numerous critics; this, coupled with his other successes during the season, led to his being retained on the company's roster for the following year.

History of far-right movements in France

The far-right tradition in France finds its origins in the Third Republic with Boulangism and the Dreyfus Affair.
Third Republic (1871-1914).
The Dreyfus Affair was a turning point in the political history of France and in the Third Republic (1871–1940), established after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and the 1871 Paris Commune. The modern "far right" or radical right, grew out of two separate events of 1889.
The Socialist International was formed at the Paris Conference, which imposed doctrinal orthodoxy on socialists and demanded their allegiance to the international working class rather than their nation. This forced patriotic socialists to choose either their nation or the international workers' movement. Many chose their nation and fell into violent conflict with their former socialist comrades. Those who chose the nation and retained the strategy of violence, then used most often against their former comrades, formed much of the base of the radical right. Many of those people also proved susceptible to the blandishments of anti-Semitism, which has long been a hallmark of the radical right. This would include (socialist) Maurice Barrès, (communardes) Henri Rochefort and Gustave Cluseret, (Blanquists) Charles Bernard and Antoine Jourde, among others.
The second event of 1889 was the culmination of the "Boulanger Affair" which championed the vague demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger had attracted the support of many socialists by ordering lenient treatment of strikers when the army was called upon to suppress strikes. He also rattled his saber against Germany which pleased French patriots intent on taking revenge against the German Empire. But his saber-rattling scared the other ministers who dumped Boulanger from the government. When his champions mounted an electoral campaign to have him elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the government reacted by forcing him out of the Army. His backers then elected him to the Chamber again from Paris, where he gained the support of both conservatives, who loathed the Republic, and socialists with their own ideas about how the Republic should be remade. This joining of the left and right against the center formed the foundation upon which the radical right was built in subsequent years. Violent agitation in Paris on the election night in 1889 convinced the government to prosecute Boulanger in order to remove him from the political scene. Instead of facing trumped up charges, Boulanger fled to Belgium. His supporters, "Boulangists" afterward nursed an intense grievance against the Republic and reunited during the Dreyfus Affair to oppose the Republic and "back the army" once again.;;
The Dreyfus Affair and the foundation of the Action française.
However, in 1894, a Jewish officer, Alfred Dreyfus, was arrested on accusations of treason and of intelligence with the German Empire. The Dreyfus Affair provided one of the political division line of France. Nationalism, which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right.
Émile Zola entered the political scene as the first "intellectual" of history, while left and right wings opposed themselves, mainly over the questions of militarism, nationalism, justice and human rights. Until then, nationalism was a Republican, left-wing ideology, related to the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars. It was a liberal nationalism, formulated by Ernest Renan's definition of the nation as a "daily plebiscite" and as formed by the subjective "will to live together." Related to "revanchism", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of Alsace-Lorraine, nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to imperialism. In the 1880s, a debate thus opposed those who opposed the "colonial lobby", such as Georges Clemenceau (Radical), who declared that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the Vosges" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), Jean Jaurès (Socialist) and Maurice Barrès (nationalist), against Jules Ferry (moderate republican), Léon Gambetta (republican) and Eugène Etienne, the president of the parliamentary colonial group.
But in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, a new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of ethnic nationalism, itself blended with anti-Semitism, xenophobia, anti-Protestantism and anti-Masonry. Charles Maurras (1868–1952), founder of "integralism" (or "integral nationalism"), created the term "Anti-France" to stigmatize "internal foreigners", or the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the far less polite "métèques"). A few years later, Maurras would join the monarchist "Action française", created by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois in 1898. Maurras, who was an agnostic, spearheaded a monarchist and Catholic revival. He pragmatically conceived of religion as an ideology useful to unify the nation. Most French Catholics were conservatives, a trait that continues today. On the other hand, most Protestants, Jews and atheists belonged to the left-wing. Henceforth, the Republicans' conception was, to the contrary, that only state secularism could pacifically gather the diversity of religious and philosophial tendencies, and avoid any return to the Wars of Religion. Furthermore, Catholic priests were seen as a major, reactionary force by the Republicans, among which anti-clericalism became a common spread. The Ferry laws on public education had been a first step for the Republic in rooting out the clerics' influence; they would be completed by the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State.
The Action française, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. The Action française was quite influent in the 1930s, in particular through its youth organization, the Camelots du Roi, founded in 1908, and which engaged in many street brawls, etc. The Camelots du Roi included such figures as Catholic writer Georges Bernanos or Jean de Barrau, member of the directing committee of the National Federation, and particular secretary of the duc d'Orléans (1869–1926), the son of the Orleanist count of Paris (1838–1894) and hence Orleanist heir to the throne of France. Many members of the OAS terrorist group during the Algerian War (1954–62) were part of the monarchist movement. Jean Ousset, Maurras' personal secretary, created the Cité catholique Catholic fundamentalist organization, which would include OAS members and founded a branch in Argentina in the 1960s.
Apart from the Action française, several far-right leagues were created during the Dreyfus Affair. Mostly anti-Semitic, they also represented a new right-wing tendency, sharing common traits such as anti-parliamentarism, militarism, nationalism, and often engaged in street brawls. Thus, the nationalist poet Paul Déroulède created in 1882 the anti-semitic Ligue des patriotes (Patriot's League), which at first focused on advocating 'revanche' (revenge) for the French defeat during the Franco-Prussian War. Along with Jules Guérin, the journalist Edouard Drumont created the Antisemitic League of France in 1889. Also anti-masonry, the League became at the start of the 20th century the "Grand Occident de France", a name chosen in reaction against the masonic lodge of the "Grand Orient de France".
Between the wars.
During the interwar period, the "Action française" (AF) and its youth militia, the "Camelots du Roi", were very active, in particular in the Quartier Latin of Paris. Apart from the AF, various far-right leagues were formed and opposed both "Cartel des gauches" (Left-wings coalition) governments. Pierre Taittinger thus formed the "Jeunesses Patriotes" in 1924, which imitated Fascism style although it remained a more traditional authoritarian movement. The following year, Georges Valois created "Le Faisceau", heavily inspired by Benito Mussolini's Fascism. Finally, in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler gained power in Germany, the wealthy perfumer François Coty founded "Solidarité française" and Marcel Bucard formed the "Francisme", which was subsided by Mussolini. Another important league was François de la Rocque's "Croix de Feu", which formed the base for the "Parti Social Français" (PSF), the first mass party of the French right-wing.
Apart from the leagues, a group of Neosocialists (Marcel Déat, Pierre Renaudel, etc.) were excluded in November 1933 from the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, socialist party) because of their revisionist stances and admiration for fascism. Déat would become one of the most ardent Collaborationists during World War II.
Others important figures of the 1930s include Xavier Vallat, who would become General Commissionner for Jewish Affairs under Vichy, members of the "Cagoule" terrorist group (Eugène Deloncle, Eugène Schueller, the founder of "L'Oréal" cosmetic firm, Jacques Corrèze, Joseph Darnand, latter founded of the "Service d'ordre légionnaire" militia during Vichy, etc.). To obtain arms from fascist Italy, the group assassinated two Italian antifascists, the Rosselli brothers, on June 9, 1937, and sabotaged airplanes clandestinely supplied by the French government to the Second Spanish Republic. They also attempted a coup against the Popular Front government, elected in 1936, leading to arrests in 1937, ordered by Interior Minister Marx Dormoy, during which the police seized explosives and military weapons, including anti-tank guns.
6 February 1934.
Far right leagues organized these riots that led to the fall of the Second Cartel des gauches. The leagues were dissolved on 18 January 1936 by the Popular Front.
Fourth Republic and the Algerian War.
The Organisation de l'armée secrète (OAS) was created in Madrid by French military opposed to the independence of Algeria. Many of its members would later join various anti-communist struggles around the world. Some, for example, joined the Cité catholique fundamentalist group and going to Argentina, where they were in contact with the Argentine Armed Forces. Jean Pierre Cherid, former OAS member, took part in the 1976 Montejurra massacre against left-wing Carlists. He was then part of the Spanish GAL death squad, and participated in the 1978 assassination of Argala, one of the "etarra" who had killed Franco's Prime minister, Luis Carrero Blanco, in 1973.
Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour was the far-right candidate at the 1965 presidential election. His campaign was organized by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Charles de Gaulle said of Tixier-Vignancourt: "Tixier-Vignancour, that is Vichy, the Collaboration proud of itself, the Militia, the OAS".
Fifth Republic.
Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the Front National (FN) party in 1972, along with former Organisation de l'armée secrète (OAS) member Jacques Bompard, former Collaborationist Roland Gaucher, François Duprat, who introduced the negationist thesis to France, and others nostalgics of Vichy France, Catholic fundamentalists, etc. Le Pen presented himself for the first time in the 1974 presidential election, obtaining 0.74%. The electoral rise of the FN did not start until Jean-Pierre Stirbois's victory, in 1983, in Dreux. The FN became stronger throughout the 1980s, managing to unite most far-right tendencies, passing electoral alliances with the right-wing Rally for the Republic (RPR), while some FN members quit the party to join the RPR or the Union for a French Democracy (UDF). At the 1986 legislative elections, the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes.
Meanwhile, other far-right tendencies gathered in Alain de Benoist's "Nouvelle Droite" think-tank, heading a pro-European line. Some radical members of the "national revolutionary" tendency quit the FN to form other minor parties (Party of New Forces, PFN, and French and European Nationalist Party, PNFE).
The French Third Position's relations with the National Front.
Mark Frederiksen, a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a Neo-Nazi group, the FANE ("Fédération d'action nationaliste et européenne", Nationalist and European Federation of Action). The FANE boasted at most a hundred activists, including members such as Luc Michel, now leader of the "Parti communautaire national-européen" (National European Communautary Party), Jacques Bastide, Michel Faci, Michel Caignet and Henri-Robert Petit, a journalist and former Collaborationist who directed under the Vichy regime the newspaper "Le Pilori". The FANE maintained international contacts with the British group the League of Saint George.
The FANE rallyed Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in 1974, gathered around François Duprat and Alain Renault's Revolutionary Nationalist Groups (GNR), which represented the nationalist revolutionary tendency of the FN.
But in 1978, Neo-nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN, taking with them parts of the FNJ members (youth organization of the FN). On the other hand, GNR activists closer to the Third Position (Jacques Bastide and Patrick Gorre ) joined Jean-Gilles Malliarakis to found, on February 11, 1979, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement ("Mouvement nationaliste révolutionnaire"), which became in 1985 Third Way ("Troisième Voie").
After this brief passage at the National Front, Mark Fredriksen created the "Faisceaux nationalistes européens" (FANE) in July 1980. These would eventually merge with the "Mouvement national et social ethniste" in 1987, and then with the PNFE (French and European Nationalist Party) in January 1994, which also gathered former National Front members.
Dissolved first in September 1980 by Raymond Barre's government, Fredriksen's group was recreated, and dissolved again in 1985 by Laurent Fabius's government. Finally, it was dissolved a third time in 1987 by Jacques Chirac's government, on charges of "violent demonstrations organized by this movement, which has as one of its expressed objective the establishment of a new Nazi regime," the "paramilitary organisation of this association and its incitations to racial discrimination."
Alain de Benoist's "Nouvelle Droite" and the "Club de l'Horloge".
In the 1980s, Alain de Benoist theorized the "Nouvelle Droite" movement, creating the GRECE in 1968 with the Club de l'Horloge. They advocated an ethno-nationalism stance focused on European culture, which advocated a return of paganism. Members of the GRECE quit the think tank in the 1980s, such as Pierre Vial who joined the FN, or Guillaume Faye who quit the organization along with others members in 1986. Faye participated in 2006 in a conference in the US organized by the American Renaissance white separatist magazine published by the New Century Foundation.
On the other hand, Alain Benoist occasionally contributed to the "Mankind Quarterly" review, which insists on hereditarianism and associated with the US think tank Pioneer Fund, headed by J. Philippe Rushton, author of "Race, Evolution and Behavior" (1995), which argues in favour of a biological conception of "race." GRECE, as well as the Pioneer Fund, are actively involved in the race and intelligence debate, postulating that there is an identifiable link between levels of intelligence and distinct ethnic groups.
The Club de l'horloge itself had been founded by Henry de Lesquen, a former member of the conservative Rally for the Republic, which he quit in 1984. Others members of the Club de l'horloge, such as Bruno Mégret, later joined the FN after a short time in the RPR.
Rise of the National Front in the 1980s and Mégret's split.
During the 1980s, the National Front managed to gather, under Jean-Marie Le Pen's leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.
Party of New Forces.
One of those party, the Party of New Forces (PFN, "Parti des forces nouvelles"), was an offshoot of the National Front, issued from a 1973 split headed by Alain Robert and François Brigneau who first organized the "Comité faire front" before merging in the PFN.
The PFN was formed mainly by former members of New Order ("Ordre nouveau", 1969–1973), who had refused to merge in the FN at its 1972 creation. New Order, dissolved by Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin in 1973, was itself a successor to Occident (1964–1968) and of the Union Defense Group (GUD, "Groupe union défense").
Close to the Third Position and "national-revolutionary" thesis, this tendency maintained links with the FN, despite some tensions. The GUD, in particular, had published the satiric monthly "Alternative" with the Youth Front ("Front de la jeunesse"), youth organization of the FN. They also had attempted alliances with other far-right parties in Europe, with New Order organizing the alliance "A Fatherland for Tomorrow" ("Une patrie pour demain") with the Spanish Falange, the Italian Social Movement (MSI) and the German National Democratic Party.
This European strategy was continued by the PFN, who launched the Euroright alliance, with the MSI, the Spanish New Force and the Belgian PFN, for the 1979 European elections. Headed by Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, the PFN won 1.3% of the vote. This electoral failure prompted Roland Gaucher and François Brigneau to quit the party and join Le Pen's National Front.
1981 Presidential election.
The French far-right went divided to the 1981 presidential election, with both Pascal Gauchon (PFN) and Le Pen (FN) attempting, without success, to secure from mayors the 500 signatures necessary to present themselves as candidates. François Mitterrand (Socialist Party) won those elections, competing against Jacques Chirac (Rally for the Republic, RPR).
1983 elections and rise.
These succeeding electoral defeats prompted the far-right to unify itself. In 1983, the FN managed to make its first electoral breakthrough, taking control of the town of Dreux. Jean-Pierre Stirbois, obtained 17% of the votes at the first round, for the FN municipal list. At the second round, he merged his list with Chirac's RPR list (headed by Jean Hieaux), enabling the right a victory against the left. Chirac supported the alliance with the far-right, claiming the Socialist Party, allied with the Communist Party in government, had no lessons to give.
This first electoral success was confirmed at the 1984 European elections, the FN obtaining 10% of the votes. Two years later, the FN gained 35 deputies (nearly 10% of the votes) at the 1986 legislative elections, under the appellation of ""Rassemblement national"." These included the monarchist Georges-Paul Wagner.
Internal disputes continued however to divise the far-right. Following the 1986 elections, which brought Jacques Chirac as Prime minister, some hardliners inside the FN spin-off to create the French and European Nationalist Party (PNFE, Parti Nationaliste Français et Européen), along with members of Mark Frederiksen's Third Position FANE. Three former members of the PNFE were charged of having profanated, in 1990, a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras.
Mégret's split, Le Pen's 2002 score and subsequent electoral fall.
The most important split, however, was headed by Bruno Mégret in 1999. Taking with him many elected members of the FN and electoral troops, he then created the National Republican Movement (MNR). However, in view of the 2007 legislative elections, he accepted to support Le Pen's candidacy for the presidential election.
During these presidential elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen only made 10.4%, compared to his stunning 16.9% finish in 2002, during which he reached the second round, achieving 17.79% against 82.21% for Jacques Chirac (Rally for the Republic, RPR).
With only 1.85% at the second round of the 2002 legislative elections, the FN failed to gain any seat in the National Assembly. At the 2007 presidential election, Le Pen arrived fourth, with 10,4% of the votes at the first round, behind Nicolas Sarkozy, Ségolène Royal and François Bayrou. Philippe de Villiers, Catholic traditionalist candidate of the Movement for France (especially present in the traditionalist Vendée region), arrived sixth, obtaining 2,23% of the vote.
This electoral downfall of the FN was confirmed at the 2007 legislative elections, the FN obtaining only 0.08% of the votes at the second round, and therefore no seats.
Le Pen's succession.
These electoral defeats, which contrasted with the high score obtained at the 2002 presidential elections, have caused financial problems to the FN, who was forced to sell its headquarters, the "Paquebot", in Saint-Cloud. Le Pen then announced, in 2008, that he would not compete again in presidential elections, leaving the way for the competition for the control of the FN between his daughter, Marine Le Pen, whom he favored, and Bruno Gollnisch. The latter had been condemned in January 2007 for Holocaust denial, while Marine Le Pen attempted to follow a smoother strategy to give the FN a more "respectable" image.

Tragedy (Thomas Wayne song)

"Tragedy" is a song by Gerald H. Nelson and Fred B. Burch. A recording of the song by Thomas Wayne and the DeLons rose to #5 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1959. A 1961 cover version by The Fleetwoods rose to #10 on the charts. Brian Hyland also recorded it in 1969, but it only made it to #56.
Wayne's hit version was released on Memphis, Tennessee-based Fernwood Records, which was owned by Ronald "Slim" Wallace (1957–1965). The single was made with a trio of girls recruited from the local high school. Wayne was a one hit wonder who cut around 20 songs including a remake of his hit for the reactivated Sun label which sounds similar to the original. Some of his other songs were hits for others such as "This Time" (Troy Shondell) and "Girl Next Door Went a Walkin'" (Elvis Presley). Despite all of his recordings for 3 different labels before his death in a car crash on August 15, 1971, he never cut an album and there has never been any CD been issued of his songs.
Paul McCartney and Wings also recorded a version of the song for the planned 2 LP set "Red Rose Speedway". The idea for the 2 LP set was later abandoned and instead they released a single LP with the same title, but without "Tragedy". The Wings' version has not yet been released on any official records.
Brenda Lee recorded a version of the song on her 1961 album "All the Way".

Scyllaeum

Scyllaeum (Greek: ) was a promontory, and ancient town or fortress, on the west coast of Bruttium (modern Calabria), about 25 km north of Rhegium (Reggio di Calabria), and almost exactly at the entrance of the Sicilian strait. 
The promontory is well described by Strabo as a projecting rocky headland, jutting out boldly into the sea, and united to the mainland by a narrow neck or isthmus, so as to form two small but well sheltered bays, one on each side. There can be no doubt that this rocky promontory was the one which became the subject of so many fables, and which was represented by Homer and other poets as the abode of the monster Scylla. But the dangers of the rock of Scylla were far more fabulous than those of its neighbor Charybdis, and it is difficult to understand how, even in the infancy of navigation, it could have offered any obstacle more formidable than a hundred other headlands whose names are unknown to fame. 
At a later period Anaxilas, the despot of Rhegium, being struck with the natural strength of the position, fortified the rock, and established a naval station there, for the purpose of checking the incursions of the Tyrrhenian pirates. In consequence of this a small town grew up on the spot; and hence Pliny speaks of an "oppidum Scyllaeum"; but it was probably always a small place, and other writers speak only of the promontory. At the present day the rock is still occupied by a fort, which is a post of considerable strength, while a small town (modern Scilla) stretches down the slopes towards the two bays. The distance from the castle to the opposite point of the Sicilian coast, marked by the Torre del Faro, is stated by William Henry Smyth at 6047 yards (c. 5.5 km), or rather less than 3.5 English miles, but the strait afterwards contracts considerably, so that its width between the Punta Pezzo and the nearest point of Sicily does not exceed 3971 yards (c. 3.6 km).

Zoom H4 Handy Recorder

The H4 Handy Recorder is a handheld digital audio recorder from Zoom, featuring built-in condenser microphones in an pattern, priced from around US$280 depending upon memory capacity .
Recordings are stored on an SD card (128 MB supplied), or via a USB cable to a computer running digital audio workstation software (Cubase LE supplied).
Applications and recording formats.
The H4 can record in stereo or 4-track mode. In stereo mode WAV or compressed (MP3) files may be made. A 2GB card will store 95 hours of speech-quality or 3 hours of CD-quality recording. With device firmware from version 2.0, SDHC cards up to 32GB in size are supported, storing 16 hours at the highest quality setting (uncompressed PCM WAV, 24 bit, 96 kHz, stereo).
Basic 4-track recordings can be made in the field with the built-in microphones and two additional input ports which accept external signal sources via XLR or 1/4-inch connectors.
Stereo mode.
In stereo mode, the user has a wide choice of sound quality, with lower quality requiring less storage space. Only 44.1 kHz 16-bit recordings can be imported into 4-track mode. All stereo recordings share a single folder, and on playback are sequenced as one continuous output stream with no pause between files. 
Stereo recording can use the built-in microphones or external input via 1/4-inch or XLR plugs.
4-track mode.
Four-track recordings can be made of one or two tracks at a time. When recording in stereo, only tracks 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, can be chosen. Four-track recordings are limited to 16-bit/44.1 kHz WAV files. WAV recordings made in stereo mode can be imported into a project folder.
When recording on one or two tracks, the other tracks may be played back simultaneously (see multi-track recording). Each track can be individually panned, to create a stereo image.
Any or all tracks can be mixed down to a stereo bounce file. This can be the last step in mixing, or an intermediate step to free up other tracks.
Effects.
The H4 incorporates a 32-bit DSP processor that provides various effects as well as modelling of different types of microphone and guitar amplifiers. Up to 60 effects patches can be stored.
Internal clock issue.
It has been reported that all H4 recorders have a serious flaw: the internal clock is not precise, with a typical error of a few seconds per hour. As a result, recorded audio is out of sync with other devices (e.g., camcorders) and has to be stretched in order to achieve synchronization.[http://videomaker.com/community/forums/topic/audio-sync-1

George W. Webber

George Washington Webber (November 25, 1825 – January 15, 1900) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.
Webber was born in Newbury, Vermont. His father, Andrew Webber, moved his family to Steuben County, New York in 1828 and engaged in farming. George Webber attended the common schools there and the academy at Alfred, New York. He engaged in business as a lumber-dealer and general merchant. On July 18, 1850, he married Miss Antoinette C. Abbey of Ulster County, New York. in 1852, Webber moved to Manistee County where he engaged in farming, lumbering, manufacturing, and mercantile pursuits. In the election of 1856, Webber was instrumental in promoting the newly formed Republican Party and the candidacy of John C. Fremont for President, such that only three votes in the entire county went to the Democratic Party candidate. 
In 1858, Webber moved to Ionia County, and engaged in mercantile business with his brother, S. W. Webber, at Lyons. After five years, he sold his interest to his brother and moved to Ionia, where he engaged in business with H. J. Wilson, as Webber & Wilson for five years. During the same period, he also engaged in lumbering on the Little Muskegon River with Fred Hall under the name Hall & Webber. After three years, Hall's interest in the enterprise was purchased by A. J Webber, and the firm took the name Webber Brothers. The brothers also established a prosperous farm and founded the village of Mecosta on their land. In 1870, he began a private banking enterprise in Muir with his brother S. W. Webber, to whom he sold his interest after four years. He was one of the most prominent organizers of the Second National Bank of Ionia, where he served first as vice-president and then as president, a position he continued to hold until his death. 
Webber was one of the village trustees of Ionia at the time it incorporated as a city and he assisted in drafting the charter. He was twice elected mayor of Ionia, in 1874 and 1875. He was responsible for construction of the Webber Block in 1879 at a cost of $15,000 and the Webber brownstone block in 1880 at a cost of $30,000. Rooms in the latter block were fitted for the use of the Ladies Library Association and donated to their use for as long as Webber or his wife was alive. Webber was also the principal owner of the Second National Bank Block. During his term as mayor, a bridge was built over the Grand River. 
Webber was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 5th congressional district to the 47th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1881 to March 3, 1883. He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1882.
George W. Webber resumed his former business activities and was a Michigan delegate to Republican National Convention in 1884. His first wife died on April 11, 1890. He married Miss E. Gertrude Brown of Boston on November 2, 1890. He died in Ionia and is interred there in Highland Park Cemetery.

<doc id="9702214" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702214" title="Tournament theory">
Tournament theory

Tournament theory is the theory in personnel economics used to describe certain situations where wage differences are based not on marginal productivity but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.   • Edward Lazear, 2008. "personnel economics," "The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics", 2nd Edition, v. 6, pp. 380-84. Abstract.</ref> This theory was invented by economists Edward Lazear and Sherwin Rosen.
The theory has been applied to professional sports and to the practice of law. Tournament theory also was applied to writing - one writer may be fractionally better at writing than another (and therefore have a better book), but because people allocate small amounts of time to reading, the writer with the marginally better book will sell far more copies.
Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labour Contracts.
This paper, which proposed tournament theory, looks at performance related pay. Under conventional systems workers are paid a piece rate - an amount of money that relates to their output, rather than the time they input. Tournament theory suggests that workers can be rewarded by their rank in an organization, suggesting why large salaries are given to senior executives: to provide a 'prize' to those who put in enough effort to garner one of the top positions.
The paper invites the reader to consider the lifetime output of a worker at a firm. This output is dictated by two things - chance and skill. The worker can control his lifetime output by investing in skills early on in life,like studying hard at school and getting good qualifications, but a part of that output will be determined by chance. Participants in the tournament commit their investment early on in life and are unlikely to know each other previously, within the firm they work in, and may not even know each other within the firm. This prevents collusion or cheating in the tournament.
Looking at the tournament in its simplest form, a two player tournament, where there is a prize for the winner and a smaller consolation for the loser. The incentive to win increases as the difference between the losing and winning prize increases, and therefore the investment of the worker is increased as the difference between the winning and losing prizes is increased. It is in the interest of the firm to increase the spread of prizes. However there is a drawback for the firms. As the workers invest more their costs rise. Competing firms could offer a tournament with a lower spread and attract more workers because they would have to invest less. Therefore, there is an optimal prize spread that firms set, high enough to induce investment but low enough so that the investment is not too expensive for the worker. The prize may take the form of extra cash or a promotion - which means more money, as well as entering a higher level of tournament, where the stakes may be higher.
The idea that the prize may be in the form of a promotion explains why presidents are paid significantly more than vice presidents. In one day a Vice-President may be promoted to President of a company and have his pay tripled. Considering piece rates this seems illogical - his output is unlikely to have tripled in one day. But looking at it using tournament theory it seems logical - he has won the tournament and received his prize - presidency.
Tournament theory is an efficient way of labour compensation when quantifying output is difficult or expensive, but ranking workers is easy. It is also effective as it provides goals for workers and incentivises hard work so that they may one day attain one of the coveted positions at the top. An advantage to workers over a piece rate would be that in the event of a natural disaster they would preserve their wage as their output would go down in absolute terms but stay the same relative to their colleagues. This means that in times of disaster workers could maintain their wage.

Shanghai Centre

Shanghai Centre () is located on West Nanjing Road, Jing'an District, Shanghai. It is a comprehensive building complex consisting of three towers rising from an eight-storey base. Designed by John C. Portman, Jr., the Shanghai Centre was one of the very first contemporary skyscrapers to be built in Shanghai. It occupies a prestige location, across West Nanjing Road from the Russian neo-classical style Shanghai Exhibition Centre complex, with whose central axis the Shanghai Centre's central axis is aligned.
The whole complex hosts 472 apartment units, 30,000 sq. meters of high-end office area, a supermarket, three stories of luxury department stores, the Shanghai Centre Theatre, a Trading Exhibition Centre, and a 5-star hotel (The Portman Ritz Carlton Shanghai, named after the architect). 
The complex opened in April, 1990, and it consists of three towers and several accessory buildings. The eight-storey pedestal building fronts onto West Nanjing Road. The building's frontage is not aligned with the street: in order to align the central axis with that of the Shanghai Exhibition Centre on the other side of West Nanjing Road (the main frontage of which in turn faces, and therefore is aligned with, Yan'an Road), the Shanghai Centre was built at an angle to West Nanjing Road. The three towers are arranged symmetrically "rising" out of the pedestal: one at the centre and towards the back, and two symmetrically to the left and right, further to the front. The three towers have similar profiles, with a memorable feature being a slight widening of the long side of each tower towards the top, giving each tower a profile reminiscent of traditional Chinese monumental stelae or towers. 
Tenants.
The building also hosts a number of foreign consulates or their delegate offices, including the United States, Ireland, Brazil, Canada, Philippine, Australia, and United Kingdom. The Consulate-General of the United States in Shanghai has some satellite offices in the Shanghai Centre.
At one point Northwest Airlines operated a ticket office in Suite 207. Delta Air Lines, which merged with Northwest, moved the ticket office to the Kerry Centre.

Malu

Malu is a word in the Samoan language for a female-specific tattoo of cultural significance. The malu covers the legs from just below the knee to the upper thighs, and is typically finer and delicate in design compared to the "pe'a", the equivalent tattoo for males. The "malu" was traditionally applied to young women in the years following puberty.

Alabama State Route 10

State Route 10 (SR-10) is a west–east state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. It is the lowest even-numbered route in the state that is not an unsigned partner route assigned to a U.S. Highway. It is also the only signed state route that extends from the Mississippi state line to the Georgia state line. The western terminus of the route is in northwestern Choctaw County near the community of Yantley, where it serves as a continuation of Mississippi Highway 19. The eastern terminus of the route is in Henry County near Shorterville. Once in Georgia, the route is designated as Georgia State Route 37.
Route description.
SR-10 travels . West of its interchange with Interstate 65 (I-65) in Greenville, the route passes through the Black Belt, traditionally one of the poorer areas of the state. Among the cities and towns the route passes through west of I-65 are Butler and Camden. SR-10 passes through Luverne, Troy, and Abbeville, before reaching the Chattahoochee River at the Georgia state line.

Gaston VI, Viscount of Béarn

Gaston VI (1173–1214), called the Good, was the French Viscount of Béarn, Gabardan, and Brulhois from 1173. He was also Count of Bigorre and Viscount of Marsan through his marriage in 1196 to Petronilla, the daughter of Countess Stephanie of Bigorre.
Gaston was the son of ruling Viscountess Mary and William I of Béarn. He was the elder of twins, his younger brother being the later viscount William Raymond. After their birth, in light of the conflict in Béarn over the succession, Mary fled with them to the monastery of Santa Cruz de Volvestre. A Bearnese delegation reached the monastery in 1173 seeking one of the boys to be their viscount. Mary gave them Gaston, who was taken back to Béarn to rule.
During his minority, a council of regents from Aragon governed on his behalf. The council was led by Pelegrino de Castellarzuelo, lord of Barbastro. The period of the regency, however, is poorly documented. In 1187, when fourteen years old, Gaston was declared of age and paid homage to Alfonso II of Aragon at Huesca.
Like most of the baronage of southern France, Gaston did not participate in the Third Crusade, because of the grand conflict between the crown of Aragon on the one hand and the county of Toulouse on the other. Gaston was firmly in the Aragonese camp.
In 1194, a territorial dispute with the viscounty of Dax was resolved with the exchange of Mixe and Ostabarret, Ostabat, in return for the city of Orthez from Dax. In 1196, peace was also made with Soule. In that same year, he married Petronilla of Bigorre and thus made peace with all his neighbours.
In 1208, Pope Innocent III ordered the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France. Innocent ordered Gaston not to interevene against the crusaders, but Gaston took part in the relief of Toulouse from Simon IV de Montfort's besieging army in 1211. He also took part in the disastrous attack on Castelnaudary. However, neither of these acts were religiously based, as neither Béarn nor Bigorre had many Cathars, but grounded rather in his loyalty to Peter II of Aragon, who was forced to come to the protection of his other vassals attacked by the crusaders. However, he was attacked by the crusade nevertheless. Gaston lost Brulhois and was excommunicated by the Council of Vabres and his territories declared forfeit by the pope.
On 15 January 1213, Gaston did homage to Peter II of Aragon along with Bernard IV of Comminges, (circa 1150 - Count 1175 - 22 February 1225), Raimond-Roger of Foix, and Raymond VI of Toulouse. Peter II thus intended to create a vast transpyrenean empire, however it was all undone at the Battle of Muret on 12 September. There Peter died in a losing cause because he had overconfidently neglected to summon his vassals with enough time for them all to arrive. Gaston was one of those which did not participate. Soon after the battle, however, Innocent III publicly pardoned the lords of Béarn and Comminges. The only penance imposed upon Gaston was to give to the bishop two of the districts of the city of Oloron. In return, he also received back Brulhois.
His loyalty to the king of Aragon, however, remained clearly expressed in the "Llibre dels fets" (chapt. 37). There he appears along with his brother at the side of the young king James I at the siege of Tamarite de Litera.
Gaston died without issue in 1214 and was succeeded by his brother William Raymond. Bigorre remained with his wife.

Andrew Kleinfeld

Andrew Jay Kleinfeld (born June 12, 1945) is a senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska.
He is married to Professor Judith Kleinfeld.
Education and professional career.
Kleinfeld attended Wesleyan University (B.A. 1966) and Harvard Law School (J.D., 1969). After law school, he clerked for two years for Justice Jay Rabinowitz of the Supreme Court of Alaska. He served as Fairbanks's part-time magistrate for a short time, but was generally in private practice in Fairbanks until his elevation to the bench.
Federal judicial service.
After completing his clerkship, Kleinfeld served for three years as a part-time magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska.
He was nominated for a full judgeship by president Ronald Reagan on March 26, 1986, confirmed by the United States Senate on May 14, 1986, and received his commission on May 15, 1986.
On May 23, 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated Kleinfeld to a seat on the Ninth Circuit, vacated by Alfred T. Goodwin. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 12, 1991, and received his commission on September 16, 1991.
Judicial philosophy.
Kleinfeld is generally considered a conservative judge, in contrast with the more liberal circuit he sits on. But his background in private practice as a civil and sometimes criminal defense lawyer gives him a more libertarian bent, as evidenced in his opinion in "Calabretta v. Floyd" and his dissent in "U.S. v. Gourde" 
Involvement in Wal-Mart discrimination case.
In 2007, a Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the class action certification in "Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.", a lawsuit initiated by female employees of Wal-Mart against the company for gender discrimination. Kleinfeld wrote a sharply worded dissent, saying "this case poses a considerable risk of enriching undeserving class members and counsel, but depriving thousands of women actually injured by sex discrimination of their just due."
Free speech.
Kleinfeld was the author of the unanimous panel decision of "Morse v. Frederick", holding that a student who put up a banner supposedly supporting drug legalization was exercising his freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, and the school principal acted unconstitutionally in suspending him. The school board appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which heard the case on March 19, 2007.
The Supreme Court, in a 2007 majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, reversed Kleinfeld's ruling and ruled that the First Amendment does not protect in-school student speech advocating illegal drug use. One key point of disagreement between Judge Kleinfeld's opinion and Chief Justice Roberts' was whether the speech was at or during school. As the banner was displayed across the street from the school (which had been let out for the day), Judge Kleinfeld's panel held that it was an "out of school" activity. Chief Justice Roberts' majority disagreed.

<doc id="9702296" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702296" title="Altavista petroglyph complex">
Altavista petroglyph complex

The Altavista petroglyph complex is located near the village and beach-town of Chacala, south of the Compostela Municipality, in Nayarit Mexico.
The area is known as "La Pila del Rey", "Chacalán", "El Santuario", "The Petroglyphs” or "the Altavista petroglyphs", near the Jaltemba Bay, in the Pacific Ocean of Nayarit.
This region was originally home to the largely unstudied Tecoxquin (Tequectequi) native culture dating from approximately 2000 BC to 2300 BCE. It contains 56 petroglyphs whose antiquity cannot be accurately determined. Aside from its cultural and archeological importance, the site remains an important religious center for the Huicholes who still leave offerings and perform ceremonies here.
In prehispanic times, the Compostela municipality area was inhabited by the Mazatán peoples, tributary of Xalisco-Zacualpan Kingdom.
Petroglyphs.
The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) engraved images in volcanic stone over two thousand years ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings might have been meant as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things.
There are fifteen signs (Spanish & English posted along entrance path, a brief summary is provided below:
Sign 1 - Altavista.
Altavista petroglyphs archaeological site, located along the sides of a creek on the slopes the Copo volcano. Covers an area of approximately 80 hectares, with a large concentration of petroglyphs. (More than 2000 engravings identified)
Sign 2 - The Tecoxquin (Throat-Cutters).
Original Altavista inhabitants. This native group inhabited a vast region covering the South coast of Nayarit, neighbouring coasts, and mountainous regions of Jalisco, Mexico. They were mainly farmers, fishermen, salt producers and traders of cocoa and cotton. The Tecoxquines were organized in a number of villages under the control of Teuzacualpan Chila Valley (modern city of Zacualpan). Business links allowed them to develop an intensive trade, reached Sinaloa to the north and Colima and Michoacán to the South and East.
Sign 3 - Religious Life (Tecoxquines).
No doubt, many religious ceremonies at this site were based on nahualism. Nahualism or Shamanism as former religious practices whereby people communicated with their gods and spirits during altered states of consciousness. This tradition has deep roots in the region; the Nayarit word derives from the word "nahualli". The Tecoxquines used psychotropic plants and tobacco plants to achieve states of ecstasy and communicate with their gods.
Sign 4 - The Last of The Tecoxquines.
After the Spanish conquest, the Tecoxquines completely annihilated by epidemics and forced labor. Today native cities of the region still talk about "white Indians," ghosts appearing from the mountains to honor their ancient gods.
Sign 5 – The Tecuales.
The Tecoxquin ancient villages, as far as the Ixtapa salt producers, were populated by Tecuales, ancestors of the current Huichol.
Sign 6 - The Water Cycle.
Nayarit State is characterized by heavy rainfall. Rainfall is concentrated between May and October. The Altavista mountains attract heavy rains leaving drier areas to the East (desert weather at the opposite side). Perhaps because of this abundance of water, Altavista was considered a special place.
Sign 7 - Tomoanchan (or Tamoanchan).
Tamoanchan is a mythical paradisiac location known to the Mesoamerican cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassical period, is a central part of the ancient Mesoamerican cosmology. Tamoanchan is the cosmic tree that connects life and supports the world. Its roots are underground in the water and fertility field. Its trunk is between human beings above ground and heavens. The Crown of the tree is in heaven, the kingdom of gods and rain. Tamoanchan was represented by the Ceiba tree.
Sign 8 - Warfare: Trophy Heads.
The "Guerra Florida " (flower war) was one of the main religious practices associated with the Tecoxquines. The aim was not to conquer. Rather, get warriors prisoners for ritual sacrifice, and whose heads were cut and then offered to the gods. These wars were usually produced locally, but also conducted in places as far away as the Talpa ans Mascota Valleys and Mochitiltic Canyon in Jalisco.
Sign 9 – Tlalocan.
water was thought to be underground in ancient Mesoamerica, hence the underworld was considered a fertile place. Tlalocan was the "water"paradise underground. It was inhabited by the “Chanes”, or water spirits, as well as the spirits of people drowned or whose death was water related. Tlalocan also was the site of the legendary crocodile Cipactli, a "earth monster", symbolizing fertility.
Sign 10 – The Devoted Christ.
The first historical references of the archaeological site of Altavista date from 1612. These describe many crosses, and above all, a devout Christ that local people venerates. This is possibly a reference to the "corn man", a figure that symbolizes fertility and growth. Local farmers leave offerings of candles and gourd bowls of salt to this figure in order to obtain fertility for their coffee and tobacco crops.
Sign 11 – The Apostle Matthew.
During the early 17TH century, Spaniards believed that the Apostle Matthew traveled to the new world in prehispanic times to evangelize natives. This is thought to explain the crosses engraved in the Altavista rocks.
Sign 12 – The Cross.
For Tecoxquines, as well as for most ancient Mesoamerican, the cross actually was a mental map of the cosmos. Symbolizes five sacred directions: the four cardinal points and the center. Each is associated with certain gods, colors, and sacred kingdoms, as well as each of the four trees that formed the tamoanchan kingdoms. The idea of the universe of four corners is still present among native Mexico today, symbolized by crosses, diamonds and other similar forms.
Sign 13 – Communication With The Gods.
The Altavista rocks were probably associated with the mythical Tamoanchan trees connecting the underworld, earth and heaven. The prayers of the people went up through the sap of the trunks into the realm of the gods. In turn, the gifts of the gods, rain, fertility and good health returned to land the same way. For the Tecoxquines the Altavista rocks would have served the same purpose, a means of communication between the people and their gods.
Sign 14 – Tecoxquin Symbolism.
Spirals, wavy lines, and other symbols carved in the Altavista rocks probably constitute a ritual prayer language for the gods. As an agricultural culture, the Tocoxquines would have been concerned with rain, fertility of the land and the continuity of the seasonal rhythms that they relied on. While the exact meaning of symbols will never be known, spirals have been interpreted as the Sun, storm, the wind, the spiral snake, or as a symbol of the natural cycle of station rainy and dry.
Sign 15 –Huichol Offerings.
Huichol natives occasionally visit Altavista originally lived in the Nayar mountains, recently a group moved to the Las Varas area. They present offerings and perform ceremonies for Nakahue, "our fertility grandmother" and Tatevari, "our grandfather of fire". Some Huicholes also travel to the nearby Chacala Port, where ancient petroglyphs are present and leave offerings for Tatei Aramara “our mother Ocean”.

Saturn C-4

The Saturn C-4 was the fourth rocket in the Saturn C series studied from 1959 to 1962. The C-4 design was proposed in 1960 for a three-stage launch vehicle that could launch 99,000 kg (218,000 lb) to Low Earth Orbit and send 32,000 kg (70,000 lb) to the Moon via Trans-Lunar Injection. It met the initial requirements for a Lunar orbit rendezvous and lunar landing mission.
It would have consisted of three stages; an S-IB-4 first stage, a S-II-4 second stage and a S-IVB third stage. The first and second stages were essentially four engine variants of the stages that would be used on the Saturn V, while the IVB stage was actually used on both the Saturn V and the Saturn IB.
It would have been capable of sending the 30,000 kg (67,000 lb) Apollo Command/Service Module into lunar orbit, but it would not have been able to carry the 15,000 kg (32,000 lb) Lunar Module as well. Although NASA eventually used the Lunar orbit rendezvous method to go to the Moon, it decided to use the larger Saturn V which would provide a reserve payload capacity.
Variants and Derivatives.
Variants or Derivatives of the Saturn C-4 design have been studied, proposed, and funded.
See Space Launch System
<br> The Space Launch System (SLS) Block 0 and 1 launch vehicles have similar payload lifting capacities as the Saturn C-4 for low earth orbit and trans-lunar missions.

<doc id="9702340" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702340" title="Salt fingering">
Salt fingering

Salt fingering is a mixing process that occurs when relatively warm, salty water overlies relatively colder, fresher water. It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further. Paradoxically, the fact that salinity diffuses less readily than temperature means that salinity mixes more efficiently than temperature due to the turbulence caused by salt fingers.
Salt fingering was first described mathematically by Professor Melvin Stern of Florida State University in 1960 and important field measurements of the process have been made by Raymond Schmitt of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Mike Gregg and Eric Kunze of the University of Washington, Seattle. A particularly interesting area for salt fingering is found in the Caribbean Sea, where it is responsible for producing a "staircase" of well-mixed layers a few metres in thickness that extend for hundreds of kilometres.
Pre-dating the work of Stern, a paper by the American oceanographer Henry Stommel discussed the creation of a large-scale salt finger in which a column of water would be surrounded by a membrane that would allow diffusion of temperature but not salinity. Once primed by the upward movement of the colder and fresher intermediate water, the resultant "perpetual salt fountain" would be able to draw energy (heat) from the local ocean water stratification.

Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice

The Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice (CNPD) is a fantasy stamp producer founded by British artist/musician Jimmy Cauty.
It produces parodies of Royal Mail stamps, some of which are collected by enthusiasts. The Aquarium online explains the history of the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice and the subjects it has chosen for its stamps as follows:
"Exploiting the decidedly low-brow tradition of stamp collecting, the CNPD (Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice) first day covers, prints and books – marketed as low-priced limited editions – comment pointedly on the absurdities of national identity, art and iconography. Past provocations include images of the queen in a gas mask, and burning Houses of Parliament with the legend ‘5/11’; now supplemented with the ‘America Shut Up’ series and the Angel of the North upside down with its head in bedrock, ridiculing the “we’ve never had it so good” cultural triumphalism of the Sage, Baltic, et al."
Stamps issued by the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice may not be used legally for postage.
Since 2002 and the invasion of Afghanistan, James Cauty has been designing and making stamps as artworks in response to world events. On 9 September 2007 he handed over the position of chief stamp designer for the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice (C.N.P.D.) to East European art labourer Filip Filkovic (artist and graphic designer, founder of CNPD inspired Kunstterrorist Organisation) and declared “War Is Over!.

Rispetti e strambotti

Rispetti e strambotti is a work for string quartet composed in 1920 by Gian Francesco Malipiero. The piece was first performed on September 25, 1920 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; it won the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Award. The piece takes its title from two early forms of Italian poetry; "rispetti" were love messages from men to ladies, while "strambotti" were roundelays. The piece is a single, coherent work meant to depict various aspects of the Renaissance, and is built up of numerous episodic melodic subjects. Among the most significant are those depicting the clergy and peasantry; the former is a sort of plainchant, while the latter is a robust theme with astringent harmonies.

<doc id="9702370" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702370" title="Motocycle">
Motocycle

]
Motocycle (note spelling) was the word adopted by the United States in the later part of the nineteenth century to indicate the horseless carriage, because it was short and easier to understand than the other possibilities, such as "automobile carriage", "motor carriage", "motor vehicle", or "auto carriage". It is now archaic and rarely used. Today, a four-wheeled self-powered vehicle, especially one designed to carry a small number of people, is generally known as an automobile or car. The term "motor vehicle" is currently used in legal, transportation planning and academic terminology.
First Uses.
One of the first publications of the word "motocycle" in the United States was when The Chicago Times-Herald reported on November 29, 1895, of America's first automobile race the day before 
It turns out that Herman H. Kohlsaat, owner of the "Times-Herald", and Frederick Upham Adams, a local writer with a mechanical engineering interest, ran a public contest for someone to come up with a unique name to replace "horseless carriage" that represented the new motorized transport. The $500 prize for the new name went to the general manager of the New York Telephone Company for the name "motocycle" in 1895. He suggested the name "motocycle" as being as close to a correct definition as sounding good to defining exactly what it was. He is credited as the first to coin this name that would replace "horseless carriage." It was used then for reports on "The Times-Herald's" first automobile race. The name received little public enthusiasm and by the end of the nineteenth century went into discontinuance.
Later uses.
Starting in the twentieth century the name "automobile" became popular instead of motocycle in the United States and in Great Britain the motocycle became "motorcar" or "autocar".
Charles Brady King intended to enter a "horseless carriage" in the 1895 "Times-Herald" race, however didn't have his motocycle ready yet and had to withdraw. He wrote Adams that although he intended to enter a motocycle with four wheels and a 4 horsepower 100 pound engine, it wasn't quite ready and he would have to withdraw. His motocycle could carry four persons, but for the race there would have been only two in the vehicle to reduce the weight and gain speed. His light weight motocycle came in at 675 pounds, could seat four people plus cargo, and would probably sell for about $600 in a large quantity production. His motocycle dream however did not flourish and was realized by Ford and Olds instead.
In 1898 "Modern machinery" magazine pointed out the merits of gasoline, electric and steam propelled 4 wheeled motocycles (automobiles).
Legal.
The term "motor vehicle" is defined in legal terms as most self-powered vehicles (i.e. automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, recreational vehicles) on public highways, no matter how many wheels it has or how many passengers it can carry or how much freight it can transport. In the United States these "motor vehicles" are registered with the local state Department of Motor Vehicles or Secretary of State.

Michael Wigler

Michael Howard Wigler (born September 3, 1947 in New York) is an American molecular biologist who has directed a laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory since 1978 and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He is best known for his contributions to the development of gene transfection methods, and for being one of the first scientists to identify and clone human oncogenes.
Wigler graduated from Princeton University in 1970, majoring in mathematics, and in 1978 received his PhD from Columbia University in microbiology .
Beginning in the late 1970s, at Columbia University, Wigler, Richard Axel and Saul Silverstein developed methods for engineering animal cells. These methods are the basis for many discoveries in mammalian genetics, and the means for producing medicines used to treat heart disease, cancer and strokes.
After moving to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Wigler continued his studies of gene transfer into mammalian cells, exploring the integration of foreign DNA and its stability of expression in host cells, demonstrating the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns, and isolating the first vertebrate genes, and first human oncogenes, using DNA transfer and genetic selection. His laboratory was among the group that first showed the involvement of members of the RAS gene family in human cancer, and that point mutations can activate the oncogenic potential of cellular genes.
Wigler’s laboratory was the first to demonstrate that some regulatory pathways have been so conserved in evolution that yeast can be used as a host to study the function of mammalian genes (31, 36), in particular genes involved in signal transduction pathways and cancer. This led to deep insights into RAS function, eventually solving the RAS biochemical pathway in yeasts and humans, and demonstrating the multifunctional nature of this important oncogene.
In the early 90’s, Wigler and collaborator W. Clark Still at Columbia University developed the first method for encoded combinatorial chemical synthesis, a method for building vast libraries of chemical compounds. This approach is still used today for drug discovery.
During the same period, Wigler and Nikolai Lisitsyn developed the concept and applications of representational difference analysis, which led to the identification of new cancer genes, including the tumor suppressor PTEN, and the cancer virus causing Kaposi's sarcoma, KSHV. In the late 90’s, Drs. Wigler and Robert Lucito and combined genome representations with array hybridization leading to a technique called ROMA used to detect copy number variation and with minor changes to perform genetic typing.
In the current decade, Wigler and Jim Hicks of Cold Spring Harbor, and Anders Zetterberg of the Karolinska Institute, applied ROMA to the analysis of breast cancer, which will perhaps lead to useful tests directing cancer treatment. At the same time, Drs. Wigler, Jonathan Sebat and Lakshmi Muthuswamy began copy number analysis of healthy individuals, leading to the discovery of a new source of genetic variability, copy number variation or CNVs. The abundance of CNVs in the human genome is strong evidence for our continuing evolution and a major source of individual variation.
The team led by Wigler at CSHL then continued this line of work to demonstrate that spontaneous germ-line mutation is likely to be a common cause for autism. Their observations and theories about autism provide an alternative approach and explanation for understanding other human mental and physical abnormalities.
For his contributions to biomedical research, Wigler is a recipient of numerous awards and honors and is a member of the National Academy of Science (since 1989), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1998), and is American Cancer Society Lifetime Research Professorship (since 1986).

He played nine seasons with four different teams, jumping around the league after playing his first six years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He also played for the Oakland Raiders, the Washington Redskins, and the Kansas City Chiefs. He retired after the 2002 season.
Michael’s consistency on field goals and power on kickoffs won him the job as an undrafted rookie. Michael went on to have a successful rookie season where he was named to Football Digest’s All Rookie team.
During his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Michael established several records including:
Michael attended the University of Virginia. During his time with the Cavaliers, he was the kick off specialist during his freshman and sophomore seasons. He then handled all kicking duties his junior and senior seasons.
During his senior campaign, he connected on 13-16 field goals and was named a Lou Groza semi finalist. Michael also had a total of 95 touchbacks during his college career, the most in UVA history.
In high school at Hampton High School in Virginia, Michael played in three state championship games, winning two with the Crabbers. Michael earned several awards during his high school career:
After his NFL career, Michael was involved in an online start up, iPlayers.net in 2005. This innovated site at the time took high school recruiting from “snail mail” to the internet. In 2007, the company was acquired by the Active Network in San Diego, CA. After working in the “corporate” world for a couple of years, Michael realized that one of his passions was helping athletes to leverage their sport for a college education.
Since that time, Michael founded the National Camp Series. The National Camp Series is a series of kicking camps around the country with use an objective evaluation platform that is hosted by a network of expert kicking coaches. The National Camp Series (NCS) KIX Player Ratings System utilizes several years of historical event data to determine a kickers rankings by cross-referencing player data to determine how the athletes stack up against others, both presently and historically.
The NCS offers regional kicking camps and an annual Super Camp that provide instruction and evaluations. Collectively, our coaches are the most respected in the world with NFL, and College level playing experience. The National Camp Series, through its kicking camps, helps student-athletes to gain experience, prove consistency, and provide exposure to colleges and universities.
The NCS platform offers specialists multiple events to help them:
The National Camp series offers kickers, punters and long snappers a unique opportunity to showcase their talents in five separate divisions based on graduation year.

Hannes Messemer (19 May 1924 – 2 November 1991) was a German actor. Born in Dillingen an der Donau, Bavaria, Messemer served on the Eastern Front of World War II and was eventually captured by Soviet soldiers. He managed to escape and make it back to Germany on foot. After the war, Messemer tried his hand at several jobs, before falling into acting in 1946. With only his natural talent and no training, he successfully secured roles with several major theatre companes in Tübingen, Hamburg, Munich and Berlin in the following ten years.
His big break in films came with a role in "Rose Bernd" in 1956. He was then cast in the major role of Colonel Rossdorf in the production of "Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam" the following year - a role which saw him awarded a Best Actor accolade. A series of successful roles followed, including "The Doctor of Stalingrad", "Der Transport" (Destination Death), "Die Brücke des Schicksals" and the comedy "Babette Goes to War" with Brigitte Bardot. He achieved critical international acclaim for his role as Colonel Muller in the Roberto Rossellini production of "General della Rovere" (1959), with the film winning the Golden Lion at Cannes that year.
Messemer is probably best known for his role as the commandant in "The Great Escape" (1963). The film had a star-studded cast, but it was Messemer, relatively unknown outside Europe, who uttered the film's most famous line (to Steve McQueen/Capt. Hilts): "It looks, after all, as if you will see Berlin before I do."
He continued to star in TV and theatre productions, becoming a familiar face to German television audiences for over 20 years. Some of his roles included major TV productions such as "Union der festen Hand" and "Die Dämonen", as well as two years as Commissioner Deeds in the TV drama series "Sergeant Berry". He also lent his distinctive voice to radio and recorded works, including the writings of Mao, and a reading of the four books of the Gospels.
A heavy lifelong smoker, Messemer suffered throat cancer during the 1980s, and surgery left his voice at only a whisper. Forced to retire from acting, he appeared on German television for the last time in 1989, in a production with Agnes Fink.
Hannes Messemer died of a heart attack in Aachen. He was married four times, and was survived by two daughters.

Jar of Fools

Jar of Fools is a once-weekly comic strip by Jason Lutes that was compiled, first into a two-part anthology, and then a graphic novel. The work has received praise from the New York Times book review, Spin Magazine, Wired Magazine, and acclaimed comics creator Chris Ware 
"Jar of Fools" is the story of a tormented magician named Ernie Weiss (likely based on Harry Houdini, whose name was originally Ehrich Weiss). His brother, Howard, has died and he has become estranged from his girlfriend, Esther O'Dea. The story of the comic retells Ernie's struggles to get himself back on track and find himself, in part through the guidance of Al Flosso (likely also based on a real magician of the same name).
The strip first ran weekly in "The Stranger", a weekly Seattle alternative newspaper. Jason Lutes self-published a collection of strips at first, but in 1994, Black Eye Productions released the series in a two-part collected anthology. The book was then published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2003, where Jason Lutes also released his "Berlin" series.
"Jar of Fools" was one of Jason Lutes's first mainstream successes, earning him praise from many publications. Chris Ware, one of the most popular alternative comics writers, said of "Jar of Fools": "Reading Jar of Fools is like getting a slow motion punch in the face. There’s plenty of time to get out of the way, but something compels you to wait and find out if it’s actually going to hurt as much when it hits. And, of course, it does." Will Shetterly and Emma Bull picked "Jar" as one of the two best graphic novels of 1994, describing it as "an astonishingly mature work."
The success of "Jar of Fools" came as something of a surprise to Lutes. On that subject he says: "I think it was well-received partly because I set out specifically to tell a story that could be picked up and read by people who did not usually read comics, and partly because the reader could in some way participate in the same process of discovery I went through in its creation."

1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + · · ·

In mathematics, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· is the infinite series whose terms are the successive positive integers, given alternating signs. Using sigma summation notation the sum of the first "m" terms of the series can be expressed as
The infinite series diverges, meaning that its sequence of partial sums, , does not tend towards any finite limit. Nonetheless, in the mid-18th century, Leonhard Euler wrote what he admitted to be a paradoxical equation:
A rigorous explanation of this equation would not arrive until much later. Starting in 1890, Ernesto Cesàro, Émile Borel and others investigated well-defined methods to assign generalized sums to divergent series—including new interpretations of Euler's attempts. Many of these summability methods easily assign to a "sum" of after all. Cesàro summation is one of the few methods that do not sum , so the series is an example where a slightly stronger method, such as Abel summation, is required.
The series 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is closely related to Grandi's series . Euler treated these two as special cases of for arbitrary "n", a line of research extending his work on the Basel problem and leading towards the functional equations of what are now known as the Dirichlet eta function and the Riemann zeta function.
Divergence.
The series' terms (1, −2, 3, −4, ...) do not approach 0; therefore diverges by the term test. For later reference, it will also be useful to see the divergence on a fundamental level. By definition, the convergence or divergence of an infinite series is determined by the convergence or divergence of its sequence of partial sums, and the partial sums of are:
This sequence is notable for including every integer exactly once—even 0 if one counts the empty partial sum—and thereby establishing the countability of the set formula_3 of integers. The sequence of partial sums clearly shows that the series does not converge to a particular number (for any proposed limit "x", we can find a point beyond which the subsequent partial sums are all outside of the interval ["x"-1, "x"+1]), so diverges.
Heuristics for summation.
Stability and linearity.
Since the terms 1, −2, 3, −4, 5, −6, ... follow a simple pattern, the series can be manipulated by shifting and term-by-term addition to yield a numerical value. If it can make sense to write for some ordinary number "s", the following manipulations argue for 
Although 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... does not have a sum in the usual sense, the equation can be supported as the most natural answer if such a sum is to be defined. A generalized definition of the "sum" of a divergent series is called a summation method or summability method, which sums some subset of all possible series. There are many different methods (some of which are described below) that are characterized by the properties that they share with ordinary summation. What the above manipulations actually prove is the following: Given any summability method that is linear and stable and sums the series , the sum it produces is . Furthermore, since
such a method must also sum Grandi's series as 
Cauchy product.
In 1891, Ernesto Cesàro expressed hope that divergent series would be rigorously brought into calculus, pointing out, "One already writes and asserts that both the sides are equal to ." For Cesàro, this equation was an application of a theorem he had published the previous year, one that may be identified as the first theorem in the history of summable divergent series. The details on his summation method are below; the central idea is that is the Cauchy product of with .
The Cauchy product of two infinite series is defined even when both of them are divergent. In the case where Σ"a""n" = Σ"b""n" = Σ(−1)"n", the terms of the Cauchy product are given by the finite diagonal sums
The product series is then
Thus a summation method that respects the Cauchy product of two series and sums will also sum . With the result of the previous section, this implies an equivalence between summability of and with methods that are linear, stable, and respect the Cauchy product.
Cesàro's theorem is a subtle example. The series is Cesàro-summable in the weakest sense, called while requires a stronger form of Cesàro's theorem, being Since all forms of Cesàro's theorem are linear and stable, the values of the sums are as we have calculated.
Specific methods.
Cesàro and Hölder.
To find the (C, 1) Cesàro sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ..., if it exists, one needs to compute the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the series.
The partial sums are:
and the arithmetic means of these partial sums are:
This sequence of means does not converge, so 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is not Cesàro summable.
There are two well-known generalizations of Cesàro summation: the conceptually simpler of these is the sequence of (H, "n") methods for natural numbers "n". The (H, 1) sum is Cesàro summation, and higher methods repeat the computation of means. Above, the even means converge to , while the odd means are all equal to 0, so the means "of the means" converge to the average of 0 and , namely . So is (H, 2) summable to .
The "H" stands for Otto Hölder, who first proved in 1882 what mathematicians now think of as the connection between Abel summation and (H, "n") summation; was his first example. The fact that is the (H, 2) sum of guarantees that it is the Abel sum as well; this will also be proved directly below.
The other commonly formulated generalization of Cesàro summation is the sequence of (C, "n") methods. It has been proven that (C, "n") summation and (H, "n") summation always give the same results, but they have different historical backgrounds. In 1887, Cesàro came close to stating the definition of (C, "n") summation, but he gave only a few examples. In particular, he summed to by a method that may be rephrased as (C, "n") but was not justified as such at the time. He formally defined the (C, n) methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the Cauchy product of a (C, "n")-summable series and a (C, "m")-summable series is (C, "m" + "n" + 1)-summable.
Abel summation.
In a 1749 report, Leonhard Euler admits that the series diverges but prepares to sum it anyway:
Euler proposed a generalization of the word "sum" several times; see "Euler on infinite series". In the case of his ideas are similar to what is now known as Abel summation:
There are many ways to see that, at least for absolute values |"x"| < 1, Euler is right in that
One can take the Taylor expansion of the right-hand side, or apply the formal long division process for polynomials. Starting from the left-hand side, one can follow the general heuristics above and try multiplying by (1+"x") twice or squaring the geometric series Euler also seems to suggest differentiating the latter series term by term.
In the modern view, the series 1 − 2"x" + 3"x"2 − 4"x"3 + ... does not define a function at so that value cannot simply be substituted into the resulting expression. Since the function is defined for all one can still take the limit as "x" approaches 1, and this is the definition of the Abel sum:
Euler and Borel.
Euler applied another technique to the series: the Euler transform, one of his own inventions. To compute the Euler transform, one begins with the sequence of positive terms that makes up the alternating series—in this case The first element of this sequence is labeled "a"0.
Next one needs the sequence of forward differences among ; this is just The first element of "this" sequence is labeled Δ"a"0. The Euler transform also depends on differences of differences, and higher iterations, but all the forward differences among are 0. The Euler transform of is then defined as
In modern terminology, one says that is Euler summable to .
The Euler summability implies another kind of summability as well. Representing as
one has the related everywhere-convergent series
The Borel sum of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... is therefore
Separation of scales.
Saichev and Woyczyński arrive at by applying only two physical principles: "infinitesimal relaxation" and "separation of scales". To be precise, these principles lead them to define a broad family of ""φ"-summation methods", all of which sum the series to :
This result generalizes Abel summation, which is recovered by letting "φ"("x") = exp(−"x"). The general statement can be proved by pairing up the terms in the series over "m" and converting the expression into a Riemann integral. For the latter step, the corresponding proof for applies the mean value theorem, but here one needs the stronger Lagrange form of Taylor's theorem.
Generalization.
The threefold Cauchy product of is the alternating series of triangular numbers; its Abel and Euler sum is . The fourfold Cauchy product of is the alternating series of tetrahedral numbers, whose Abel sum is .
Another generalization of 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ... in a slightly different direction is the series for other values of "n". For positive integers "n", these series have the following Abel sums:
where "B""n" are the Bernoulli numbers. For even "n", this reduces to
This last sum became an object of particular ridicule by Niels Henrik Abel in 1826:
"Divergent series are on the whole devil's work, and it is a shame that one dares to found any proof on them. One can get out of them what one wants if one uses them, and it is they which have made so much unhappiness and so many paradoxes. Can one think of anything more appalling than to say that
where "n" is a positive number. Here's something to laugh at, friends."
Cesàro's teacher, Eugène Charles Catalan, also disparaged divergent series. Under Catalan's influence, Cesàro initially referred to the "conventional formulas" for as "absurd equalities", and in 1883 Cesàro expressed a typical view of the time that the formulas were false but still somehow formally useful. Finally, in his 1890 "Sur la multiplication des séries", Cesàro took a modern approach starting from definitions.
The series are also studied for non-integer values of "n"; these make up the Dirichlet eta function. Part of Euler's motivation for studying series related to was the functional equation of the eta function, which leads directly to the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function. Euler had already become famous for finding the values of these functions at positive even integers (including the Basel problem), and he was attempting to find the values at the positive odd integers (including Apéry's constant) as well, a problem that remains elusive today. The eta function in particular is easier to deal with by Euler's methods because its Dirichlet series is Abel summable everywhere; the zeta function's Dirichlet series is much harder to sum where it diverges. For example, the counterpart of in the zeta function is the non-alternating series , which has deep applications in modern physics but requires much stronger methods to sum.

The following tables list the winners of the special awards given to candidates at the Miss USA pageant.
Current awards.
Miss Congeniality.
The first "Miss Congeniality" award specific to the Miss USA pageant was given out in 1965. Prior to this year, the award could be won by either a Miss USA or Miss Universe contestant because both pageants were held jointly. This is the only award voted on by the delegates themselves. The name of the award has changed a number of times over the years, and has been known as ""Miss Unity"" and ""Miss Amity"". The current definition of the award is that it "reflects the respect and admiration of the delegate's peers, who voted for her as the most congenial, charismatic and inspirational participant."
As of 2011, Vermont has received the most awards with five. Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming follow with three awards. 
Only one Miss USA winner would be voted Miss Congeniality: Chelsi Smith (1995). She would also be crowned Miss Universe 1995, becoming the only Miss USA titleholder and special award winner in history to capture the Miss Universe crown.
Miss Photogenic.
Like Miss Congeniality, the first "Miss Photogenic" award specific to the Miss USA pageant was given out in 1965. Prior to this year, the award could be won by either a Miss USA or Miss Universe contestant. The winner of the award was initially chosen by the press, however this was changed to an internet vote in 1996. The most recent definition of the Miss Photogenic award is that it defines "beauty behind the lens of a camera". 
The most successful state as of 2011 is Virginia, with six awards. The next most successful states are Louisiana and Texas, each tied with four, followed by Alabama and California with three.
Coincidentally, California and Louisiana both have two Miss USA winners who have also been voted Miss Photogenic, the most from any state to win the award and the title: Maria Remenyi (1966) and Shannon Marketic (1992) from California; Sharon Brown (1961) and Ali Landry (1996) from Louisiana. Virginia has the only other Miss USA and Photogenic award winner: Debbie Shelton (1970).
Former awards.
Best State Costume.
The first "Best State Costume" award was given out in 1962. It's not awarded since 1994.
The most successful state was Alaska, with four awards. The next most successful states were Arizona, Illinois and Texas, each tied with three; followed by Ohio, Oregon and South Carolina with two.
Best in Swimsuit.
This prize was first awarded in 1992 by Catalina until 1993. In 1994-1998 by Jantzen. In 1999-2000 by Speedo. In 2001 by "Pieces from Bikini.com", and in 2002 by "Bluepoint". Not awarded since 2003.

Owen Frederick Morton Tudor

Owen Frederick Morton Tudor, (1900–1987), was an officer in 3rd The King's Own Hussars and the husband of Larissa Tudor, a woman some claimed could have been Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia.
Early life and education.
Born on 21 Oct 1900 in Twickenham, Tudor was the son of Admiral Henry Morton Tudor and Evelyn Laura (née Toulmin) Tudor and a nephew of Admiral Sir Frederick Tudor. The original family name was Jones, but it was changed to Tudor in 1890. Tudor attended the junior school at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, and then joined the Royal Navy in 1915 and served as a midshipman aboard the HMS Repulse. After he suffered an eye injury, he was forced to leave the navy in December 1917. He attended St Lawrence College in 1918 and was involved in the school's sports programs. Tudor won the Saddle at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, which well qualified him for the British Army's cavalry.
First marriage and later career.
He entered the 20th Hussars, but later transferred to the 3rd King's Own Hussars in 1921. The regiment was stationed in Constantinople, where Tudor reportedly met Larissa Haouk, who was reportedly working as a belly dancer in a Constantinople nightclub, and married her in 1923 against the wishes of the colonel of his regiment. He reportedly was forced to leave his regiment after he married Larissa and transferred to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, based at Lydd, Kent.
Tudor was devastated by Larissa's death in 1926 and took flowers or arranged for flowers to be delivered to her grave each 10 June until a few years before his own death. However, he remarried quickly. His second wife was a daughter of Lord Hothfield. Tudor was readmitted to his former regiment in 1927 and was quickly promoted. He retired from the army in 1950 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He refused to answer letters inquiring about Larissa's past.

Seale Harris

Seale Harris (March 13, 1870–March 17, 1957) was an American physician and researcher born in Cedartown, Georgia. He was nicknamed "the Benjamin Franklin of Medicine" by contemporaries for his leadership and writing on a wide range of medical and political topics. Dr. Harris' most celebrated accomplishments were his 1924 hypothesis of hyperinsulinism as a cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia.
Life.
Harris received a medical degree from the University of Virginia in 1894 and established a medical practice in Union Springs, Alabama. After the completion of postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Harris accepted the position of Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Medical College of Alabama in Mobile. During World War I, Harris was commissioned as a major in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and served with distinction. 
Returning to private practice in Birmingham, Dr. Harris was instrumental in building the 50-bed Gorgas Hospital Hotel which later became Montclair Baptist Medical Center. A prolific author and contributor to medical literature, in 1949 Harris was awarded the American Medical Association's Distinguished Service Medal for his research in hyperinsulinism. He was instrumental in establishing a camp near Mobile for children with diabetes. In tribute to his life and work, it was later designated Camp Seale Harris.
He opened the Seale Harris Clinic in Birmingham in 1922. The clinic and name are perpetuated by his successors. Shortly after the discovery of insulin in 1922, Harris visited Canada to study diabetes cases with the scientists who discovered the hormone. These studies led to research on the effects in nondiabetic patients of an excessive secretion of insulin and his recognition that hyperinsulinism could cause hypoglycemia, a deficiency of sugar in the blood. His research on hyperinsulinism and its control brought international recognition to Harris, including the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest scientific award of the American Medical Association.
While serving in the Army during World War I, he edited the journal "War Medicine", published in Paris. For 12 years he was the owner and editor of the "Southern Medical Journal". His writings include more than 100 contributions to the medical literature and books in such diverse fields as clinical practice, biography and politics. Widely respected among doctors, Harris served at as president of the Southern Medical Association, Medical Association of the State of Alabama, and the American Medical Editors Association.
Harris' syndrome.
Harris' syndrome is a historical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, such as that caused by insulin-producing tumors of the pancreas (insulinoma). The syndrome is characterized by the symptoms of low blood sugar: weakness, hunger, shakiness, increasing nervousness, mild mental confusion or even personality alterations with erratic behaviour, and the adrenergic responses of tachycardia, pallor, and sweating. The concept of the syndrome was postulated by Harris, in 1924, after he observed hypoglycemia produced during treatment of diabetic patients with the newly discovered insulin.
Military career.
With the advent of World War I, and with a commission of major in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army, Dr. Harris was assigned to the staff of general William Crawford Gorgas. While serving overseas he was decorated for meritorious service by general John J. Pershing.
Alabama Hall of Fame.
The Alabama Hall of Fame was established by Act of Alabama No. 646 (1951) to recognize "worthy citizens of the state who rendered outstanding service or who won fame on account of their achievements as to make them exceptional in the history of Alabama." Harris was posthumously elected in 1965 to the Alabama Hall of Fame.
Seale Harris Award.
This award, named in honor of Seale Harris and established in 1958 at the Southern Medical Association meeting in New Orleans, is presented annually to a member of the Southern Medical Association in recognition of important research accomplishments in the broad field of metabolism, endocrinology, or nutrition, or for significant accomplishments contributing to a better understanding of the chemical changes occurring in disease.

Harrison West

Harrison West is a historic, urban neighborhood located north and near west of downtown Columbus, Ohio. The neighborhood character is similar to the better-known Victorian Village just to the east. The area is bounded by Harrison Avenue on the east (which runs parallel to Neil Avenue), Goodale on the South, 5th Avenue on the North, and Olentangy River Road to the west (including "Gowdy Field"). In January 2008, the neighborhood expanded to include all of "Thurber Village" to the south east.
Developed from the Neil Farm in the early 20th century, Harrison West is characterized by Victorian and Edwardian-style homes, although the housing stock is generally more modest than the grand homes found in Victorian Village proper. Frame houses are more common than brick.
The Harrison West neighborhood area experienced urban decline throughout much of the late 20th century. Just south of Harrison West, the similar "Flytown" was destroyed during "slum clearance" in the 1960s and replaced by Interstate 670 and the "James Thurber Village" apartment and business area. Redevelopment and gentrification spreading from Victorian Village closer to downtown has transformed the area in the last two decades, accelerating with the demolition of industrial sites along the Olentangy River.
Today some of the homes have been split into rented apartments, while others remain as historical landmarks. Still others have since been purchased and restored to their original style. Numerous original houses of poor quality have been demolished and replaced with new construction in the same urban style. The Battelle Memorial Institute, a major employer, at one time owned numerous rental properties and, concerned about urban blight on its doorstep, became actively involved in area redevelopment in the 1980s.
Conversion of a former factory site into a complex of single-family homes, flats and lofts is completing the improvement of the neighborhood into a desirable location. Life in the neighborhood centers on commercial properties along 3rd Avenue, which roughly bisects the neighborhood. Included in the development is a clubhouse that serves as the new home for the Carpe Diem String Quartet's performances.
The neighborhood was not originally intended as a separate district, but was constituted from the urban area excluded from the "Victorian Village Architectural Review" in 1974. A neighborhood association founded in 1976, like others in Columbus, advocates for city services and community projects. Current projects include water quality issues in the Olentangy River and maintenance of the Olentangy bike trail and the neighborhood parks, including a new river Park.

<doc id="9702677" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702677" title="Amarante, Portugal">
Amarante, Portugal

Amarante is a town in the Amarante Municipality, Portugal.
The settlement of Amarante is believed to have existed since the 4th century BC. Its name comes from "amar", the Portuguese verb "to love". Amarante is situated in the rich northern agricultural lands of the Minho region, and belongs to the Porto district, region North and sub-region Támega. It is the seat of a municipality with and 56,264 inhabitants (2011), subdivided into 40 parishes called freguesia in Portuguese. 
The city itself has a population of 11,261 inhabitants. The Tâmega River runs through the town and is crossed by a large arched bridge, the Ponte São Gonçalo. It is reputed to have assisted local forces fend off a French attack in the early 19th century. Nowadays the older centre of town is dominated by a multitude of cafés and restaurants dotted along the steep banks of the southern side of the Tâmega river. Amarante is also associated with the tale of Saint Gonzalo/Gonçalo de Amarante
Architecture.
The architecture of the Amarante region is mainly in the Romanesque style, and there are a number of Romanesque monuments (colonnades, arches, tympana and columns) distributed throughout the region. They were built in deserted areas or on crossroads on the outskirts of inhabited areas, serving as meeting places, accommodation and defensive positions. Amarante became part of the Sousa Valley Romanesque Route (Rota do Românico) project on the 12 March 2010. The most notable buildings in the area are generally places of worship and include:
The grandest religious buildings in Amarante can be found to the north of the Tâmega, and include the Travanca monastery, the Mancelos church, the Telões church, the Freixo de Baixo monastery and the Gatão church. On the southern side of the river, which has historically had fewer economic resources and raw materials, can be found the Jazente church, the Lufrei church and the Gondar monastery which are in a more modest style.
Tourism.
During festivities phallus-shaped St Gonçalo cakes are sold in Amarante as a fertility symbol. This custom is claimed to have originated with the Celts.
Transport.
Amarante was once linked to the rest of Portugal by train, but it now lies around half a kilometre from the A4 Motorway. There is also a bus station, served principally by Rodonorte, to the south of the Támega river.
Cycling (Ecopista).
Built on the abandoned Támega railway line between Amarante and Chapa 'stations' the Council of Amarante built the ˝Ecopista˝ pathway for bicycles and pedestrians. The Tâmega Line Ecotrack is long and wide. The route enables users to view the region’s natural landscape: characterized by preserved green zones and complemented by dense forestry cover for shade, it runs very close to the Támega river. Public lighting is installed in the section between the Amarante and Gatão stations, giving it a more urban feel, and making it appropriate for jogging. Benches and rubbish bins can be found in strategic points along the route and signs and information panels for location and direction identify certain highlights of the local landscape.
Amarante Golf Course.
The Amarante Golf Course, designed by Portuguese architect Jorge Santana da Silva, lies in Quinta da Deveza and was founded in 1997. It is an 18-hole, par 68 course with total length of 5.030 metres and is located in the Fregim parish around from the town of Amarante. It is unique for its view of the surrounding landscape north of the Douro, created by the river Tâmega, where the highlight is the view to the Marão and Aboboreira mountain ranges. The course is located at an approximate height of 600 meters and occupies about and has 7 par 3 holes, 8 par 4 holes and 3 par 5 holes, with a variety of lakes and sand bunkers along the course.
Other sporting activities.
Because of its link with the Tâmega River and mountains Marão and Aboboreira, Amarante offers opportunities for outdoor activities such as camping, swimming, mountaineering, golf, hunting, fishing or adventure sports like rock climbing, canoeing and mountain biking.
Famous people of Amarante.
Teixeira de Pascoaes.
Teixeira was born in Amarante on November 8, 1877. He was a representative of the movement called Portuguese Renaissance, famous for both his poetry and prose. His name is also connected with ”Saudosismo”, a movement that promulgated “saudade” as a national spiritual value that could have transformative power. Saudade means “longing, nostalgia, yearning” for something absent, but it is a feeling fraught with more emotional weight and affective intensity than corresponding words from English and other languages convey. The house where Teixeira spent his childhood is located in the centre of Amarante. The working and living place of the adult poet can be found three kilometers from Amarante in Gatão, available for visiting and also to spend a night or two in this unique place surrendered by the Marão mountains.
Saint Gonzalo/Gonçalo de Amarante.
Priest, Pilgrim, Hermit & Friar, Gonçalo de Amarante is reported to have been solely responsible for the building of the principal bridge in Amarante. A large church, the Igreja de Sâo Gonçalo, lies to the north of this bridge. He was canonized in 1560.

Mortgage revenue bond loan

A Mortgage Revenue Bond Loan or bond loan is a type of mortgage loan where the cost of borrowing is partially subsidized by a mortgage revenue bond. Although details differ between programs, mortgage revenue bond loan programs are in general designed to lower the cost of homeownership for low to medium income borrowers, sometimes for targeted occupations or neighborhoods. In the United States, mortgage revenue bond loans have supported an average of 100,000 home purchases for low-income buyers between 1986 and 2006. Example mortgage revenue bond loan programs include the Los Angeles Housing Department's mortgage revenue bond program, the Arizona Housing Finance Authority Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, and the Texas State Affordable Housing Corporation Professional Educators Single Family Mortgage Revenue Bond Program.

HNoMS Otra (1939)

Otra and "Rauma" were two purpose-built minesweepers constructed at Nylands Verksted in Oslo. Both ships were completed and commissioned only a short time before the German invasion of Norway. The Otra class vessels used the Oropesa system of mine sweeping. As the threat of war in Europe became ever more clear the decision was made to improve the Royal Norwegian Navy's mine warfare capabilities. At first a number of 2. class gunboats were rebuilt into minelayers and mine sweepers, but with war looming it soon became clear that more capable vessels were required.
The invasion.
Prelude.
Shortly before the German invasion the UK announced that the Royal Navy had laid a number of minefields along the coast of Norway to interfere with the German import of Swedish iron ore through the North Norwegian port of Narvik. The British government claimed to have mined three areas; off Stad, Hustadvika, and Landegode north of Bodø. In response to this report, the Norwegian government ordered the minesweepers "Otra" and "Rauma" to sail north from their base in Horten and sweep the minefields on 9 April 1940.
"Otra" spots the invasion force.
Before the order to go north could be carried out, however, the German invasion of Norway took place in the early hours of 9 April. As reports of intruding warships started coming in "Otra" was sent out to investigate, and at 0410hrs report that the intruders were Germans. The invasion flotilla blocked "Otra"'s return to Horten.
Capture.
While her sister ship, HNoMS "Rauma", was fighting the German naval forces in Horten "Otra" was cut off and isolated from the action. The next morning, 10 April, she was captured while at anchor in Filtvet.
German service as "Togo".
After capture "Otra" was renamed Togo and put in service as a Vorpostenboot and minelayer for the rest of the war. First "Togo" served in as part of Hafenschutzflotille Tromsø guarding that northern city's harbour. Later she was transferred to Hafenschutzflottille Oslo. In 1941 "Togo" was part of 59th Vorpostenflottille as V 5908, where she served until April 1944 when she transferred to 65th Vorpostenflottille as V 6512. After the German surrender she was part of the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GM-SA).
Post-war service.
On 18 January 1946 "Togo" was returned to the Royal Norwegian Navy at Bogen and on 30 October 1946 was renamed HNoMS Otra. In April 1949 she was rebuilt as a minelayer training ship. 21 August 1959 saw her decommissioning and she was laid up at Horten until put out of service and sold in April 1963.

Ateneo de Manila University ROTC

The Ateneo de Manila University ROTC Unit, also known as the Ateneo de Manila University Corps of Cadets is designated as the 131st Department of Air Science and Tactics, and is the official ROTC unit of the Ateneo de Manila University. The 131st DAST is located at the Blue Eagle Gym.
History.
The Ateneo Reserve Officers Training Corps was first established in 1918 by American Jesuit, Fr. Raymond Goggin, SJ. They were instructed by Major Morrisey and Lieutenant William A. Knapp of the 27th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, and Colonel Robert Hill, Chief of Staff of the Philippine Department.
On October of that year, the Corps made its appearance in the Liberty Loan Parade and won the coveted Carnival Cup. This achievement marked the first of many accolades that the Corps was to receive. 
During the years 1924 to 1925, the Ateneo Corps made its first public appearance on the Fourth of July Parade, where they bested the University of the Philippines and National University Corps. This led to more invites to numerous other competitive drills.
Among the people impressed by the Ateneo Corps was Governor-General Leonard Wood, who hailed the Ateneo ROTC as the "West Point of the Philippines", and General Douglas MacArthur, who arranged materials such as tables, chairs, and ammunition for the Corps during their summer trainings in Baguio camps. MacArthur further spurred military training in the Philippines when he served as an adviser to President Manuel L. Quezon during the Commonwealth Government of 1935.
During the outbreak of World War II in 1941, President Quezon ordered that all ROTC units in the country to disband. However, 34 cadets and officers decided to stay and fight for their country, 15 of whom perished in the war.
June 15, 1946 saw Major General Calixto Duque, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, officially designating the Ateneo Corps as the Ateneo de Manila Air Reserve Officers Training Corps.
Officership.
The Ateneo Corps of Cadet Officers (ACCO) are upperclassmen who have finished Cadet Officers Candidacy Course (COCC) training and hold various staff and field designations within the Ateneo ROTC. The current echelon of the ACCO is as follows:
Training.
Officership in the Ateneo ROTC begins with Cadet Officers Candidacy Course (COCC). This holistic training encapsulates all aspects of Special Flights training, in addition to training in leadership and administration. COCC training lasts all throughout the first semester and culminates in the Cadet Officer Candidates (COC) graduation towards the end of the semester. After graduation, they are recognized as Cadet 2nd Lieutenants (C/2Lt) and as official junior members of the ACCO.
COCC Training comes in two forms: Regular and Summer. Regular COCC takes place during the first semester of the student's second year in the Loyola Schools, while Summer COCC takes place in the summer between the student's second and third year. Summer COCC is only open to regular and Special Flight cadets who have finished basic ROTC in their sophomore year. Graduates of summer COCC skip Third Classmanship, but graduate one rank lower than their batchmates who underwent Regular COCC.
Classes.
Officers are divided into classes based on seniority and rank, with First Class (1Cl) officers (fourth year college students) being the most senior, followed by Second Class (2Cl) officers (third Year college students), and Third Class (3Cl) officers (second year college students who have recently finished COCC training).
Special Flights.
The Special Flights are the various units under the HQHQ program led by the HQHQ commander. Along with their basic cadet training, flights under HQHQ also specialize in different areas such as first aid, security, advanced ceremonial drills, weapons care, and journalism. The Special Flights are: Medics, Air Police, Honor Guards, Armorers, and Press Corps.
Special Flights cadets are deemed as "aspirants" all throughout their basic training in the first semester before their recognition towards the end of the semester. During the second semester, they are recognized as bona fide Special Flight cadets and undergo more advanced training in their respective fields of expertise.
Collectively, the Special Flights are recognized as the Headquarters and Headquarters company (HQHQ), led by the HQHQ Commander.
Medics.
The Medical Corps is in charge of the health and safety of all the cadets in the Ateneo ROTC. They are trained in basic and advanced first aid, and provide assistance to any and all cadets in need, earning them the nickname “The Heart of the Corps”.
The Medics are led by the Medics Commander.
Air Police.
Regarded as the Sentinels of the Corps, the Air Police is in charge of safety, security, law enforcement, and discipline within the Ateneo ROTC. Under the Provost Marshal and the Air Police Commander, they are the sinew and muscle of the Corps.
The Air Police is led by the Air Police Commander, who is also the deputy of the Provost Marshal.
Honor Guards.
The Honor Guards are the model cadets of the Ateneo ROTC. They’re the representatives of the Corps in ceremonial duties and thus are some of the snappiest and most disciplined cadets in the Ateneo ROTC. Their most celebrated duty is performing silent rifle drills and sequences.
The Honor Guards are led by the Honor Guards Commander.
Armorers.
The Armorers specialize in the care, maintenance, and inventory of different weapons and armaments used by the Ateneo ROTC. Among their primary responsibilities is overseeing the armory of the 131st DAST.
The Armorers are led by the Armorers Commander.
Press Corps.
The Press Corps is in charge of archiving, promoting, and providing visual and written documentation for the events of the Ateneo ROTC. They are also in charge of maintaining the various online pages of the Corps.
The Press Corps is led by the Press Corps Commander.

<doc id="9702754" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702754" title="Motion ratio">
Motion ratio

The motion ratio of a mechanism is the ratio of the displacement of the point of interest to that of another point.
The most common example is in a vehicle's suspension, where it is used to describe the displacement and forces in the springs and shock absorbers. The force in the spring is (roughly) the vertical force at the contact patch divided by the motion ratio, and the wheel rate is the spring rate divided by the motion ratio squared.
This is described as the Installation Ratio in the reference. Motion Ratio is the more common term in the industry, but sometimes is used to mean the inverse of the above definition.
Motion ratio in suspension of a vehicle describes the amount of shock travel for a given amount of wheel travel. Mathematically it is the ratio of shock travel and wheel travel. The amount of force transmitted to the vehicle chassis reduces with increase in motion ratio. A motion ratio close to one is desired in vehicle for better ride and comfort. One should know the desired wheel travel of the vehicle before calculating motion ratio which depends much on the type of track the vehicle will run upon.
How to decide the motion ratio?
It basically depends on 3 factors
a)Bending Moment: 
To reduce the bending moment the strut point should be near to the wheel.
b)Suspension Stiffness: 
The suspension tends to get stiff when its inclination of the shock absorber to horizontal tends to 90 deg.
c)Half Shafts: 
In Rear suspension the wheel travel is constrained by the angle limitations of the universal joints of the half shafts. Design the motion ratio such that at maximum bounce and rebound shocks are the first components that bottom out by hitting bump stops.

October Mountain State Forest

October Mountain State Forest is a state forest in the town of Lee, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The forest, the largest state forest in Massachusetts, is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.
History.
Herman Melville is reputed as having anointed the area as "October Mountain." His home in Pittsfield overlooks some of the hills. The forest came to state ownership via the estate of William C. Whitney, President Grover Cleveland's Secretary of the Navy. The purchase of the initial was made in 1915 for a total of $60,000, part of which came through the pledge of a group of Berkshire residents. The area was opened to the public that year.

E. Doctor Smith

E. Doctor Smith (born December 2, 1956, Naples, Italy), is an American musician, record producer and recording artist with Edgetone Records, who has variously worked with Brian Eno, Madonna, Warren Zevon and John Scofield. He is also the inventor of the musical instrument, the Drummstick. 
Life and career.
Smith began his musical journey as a teenager, playing percussion in the District of Columbia Youth Orchestra and in Maryland's Montgomery County Youth Orchestra. Inspired by the Miles Davis fusion bands of the mid-1970s, he continued his studies with Paul Sears, drummer of The Muffins. His first group, Oranus Rey, featured guitarist Paul Bollenback, bassist Ed Howard, and saxophonist Tim Chambers.
In 1980, Smith moved to New York where he met fellow Music Building tenants Madonna and her co-writer, Stephen Bray. With Bray, Smith performed in the Breakfast Club and The Same. The Same was produced by Brian Eno and featured keyboardist Carter Burwell, guitarist Chip Johannsen, singer Cloda Simmons, bassist Stanley Adler, and the motto "Semper Mutants."
Following Bray and Madonna to Los Angeles, Smith assisted on many of Madonna's biggest albums as well as other of Bray's projects including Nick Kamen, Gladys Knight, The Breakfast Club, Bryan Ferry, and Steel Pulse. In Los Angeles, Smith's audio engineering was used in sessions working alongside Michael Verdick and Tony Shepperd. Back on the East Coast, Smith performed with the New England groups K2, Flash to Bangtime, and Feat of Clay, using a Simmons kit he called the “Beast." Inspired by the drumkit of British drummer Bill Bruford, Smith’s 12-piece kit was the first embodiment of his love of digital drums. 
In 1995, as a member of the trio Between The Lines, and influenced by the work of Roy "Future Man" Wooten, Smith designed and built the Drummstick, a percussion controller consisting of a 2x6 inch piece of wood with 16 finger-pads. Borne of a desire to walk on stage, plug in and play like a guitarist, while accessing digital sounds, Smith's Drummstick was further developed. 
In 2000, Smith became the front of house engineer for the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia, mixing and working with Warren Zevon, Dave Mason, David S. Ware, Mickey Hart, Bill Bruford, John Mayall, Little Feat, John Scofield, and several more local acts. The same year, Smith released his debut album, "The Drummstick", with his band of the same name, which featured core members Jack Wright on guitar, Neil Mezebish on horns, and Celia DuBose on bass. That year he also performed using the Drummstick with Ben Lozago of Gong, Tom Principato, Bill Kirchen, Paul Bollenback, John Wubbenhorst, Sandip Burman, and Howard Levy. 
Now living in San Francisco, Smith performed at the Edgetone New Music Summit of 2006 with horn player Eric Dahlman. In March 2007, Smith released the "Drummstick 2" album, a collaboration with the original Drummstick band and other musical friends on Edgetone Records.
Smith also produced and performed on an Edgetone release entitled "Robert Anbian and UFQ: the Unidentified Flying Quartet". It featured jazz and poetry with contributions from Robert Anbian, saxophonist Charles Unger, keyboardist Sam Peoples, and bassist Mike Shea.
In 2008, the makers of the Zendrum, a MIDI percussion controller, built a custom Zendrum for Smith that he has been using exclusively. This Zendrum is black, modeled after Jimi Hendrix's black Fender Stratocaster and is played vertically like the Drummstick.
In 2009, Smith had been asked to perform at Oakland's Rooz Cafe which led to him meeting Edo Castro. Like Manring before him, Castro was another master of the "E-Bow". Their live album, "Live with Edo Castro", featured the music of Smith's earlier "Drummstick 2", K2, Robert Anbian and the Unidentified Flying Quartet CDs, and was culled from performances recorded at the Sheba Lounge in San Francisco and Mill Valley's 142 Throckmorton Theatre.
"Quantum" is the latest work by Smith and his sixth on Edgetone Records. The work reunited Smith with his former Drummstick band mate, guitarist Jack Wright and featured Quantum Kids' bassist, Tom Shiben, and Smith's Feat of Clay co-founder, trumpeter Eric Dahlman. In this collaboration, Smith's fusion approach with the Zendrum EXP MIDI percussion controller, blended with the other musician's work. "Quantum" was released on October 29, 2013.

Blast Off (Transformers)

Blast Off is the name of several fictional characters in the Transformers universes.
Transformers: Generation 1.
Although Blast Off appears to be a cruel and ruthless opponent to the Autobots and a snob to his fellow Combaticons, he is in reality somewhat lonely, as his missions in space shuttle mode leave him feeling isolated. Combines with fellow Combaticons to form Bruticus.
Marvel Comics.
Blast Off debuted in issue #24, "Afterdeath". In this issue, Megatron and the Combaticons are battling Optimus Prime and Protectobots near a computer lab. A human named Ethan Zachary convinces the robots to settle their dispute in a video game. They agreed on the condition that whichever side lost, their leader was destroyed in the real world. The object of the game was to destroy the leader of the group. The Combaticons and Protectobots were sent to different levels of the game. In each scenario, the Combaticons would lose and the Protectobots would win. This allowed them to merge into Defensor and destroy the virtual Megatron. However, Megatron uses a cheat code to reenter the game. Optimus defeats Megatron again, but this time he allows innocent lives to perish. Feeling guilty, Optimus forfeits the game and orders himself destroyed.
Later on, Blast Off is knocked unconscious during a battle between the Combaticons and the Protectobots. The Protectobots had been attempting to apprehend the "renegade" Autobot, Blaster. Together the Autobots defeat the Combaticons. Blaster and several earth kids use an unconscious and mode locked Blast Off to escape into space.
Blast Off made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel "Generation 2" comic series, in a story called "New Dawn." Megatron lead his Decepticons against Jhiaxus' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.
Animated series.
Blast Off debuted in the second season episode, "Starscream's Brigade". In the episode, Starscream is banished from Decepticon Headquarters after his latest attempt on Megatron's life. He is sent to the island of Guadalcanal where he discovers old World War II vehicles. Starscream decides to use these to build his own army. He raids a Decepticon detention center on Cybertron and steals the personality components of several renegade Decepticons. Blast Off is placed in an old WWII bomber and the body is reformatted into a space shuttle.
Blast Off's personality shows him being aristocratic. He speaks with sort of a British accent. His ionic blaster disrupts the electrical system's on his targets. In the series, Blast Off often became the right arm of Bruticus, with his wings becoming the chest plate. On the toy, however, the chest was a separate piece.
After Bruticus is defeated by Menasor, Megatron banished Starscream and the Combaticons from Earth and sent to a distant asteroid. Starscream abandons the Combaticons on the asteroid and flies off into space. Blast Off later tows the entire asteroid to Cybertron, where the Combaticons defeat Shockwave and take over the planet. The Combaticons attempt to exact revenge on Megatron by using the space bridge to alter Earth's orbit, sending it towards the Sun. The plot fails and Megatron captures and reprograms the Combaticons to obey him.
Blast Off was later involved in a Decepticon plot to capture the Middle East oil fields. Early in the episode, Blast Off shoots down Slingshot forcing the Autobots to retreat. In order to prove that the Decepticons were stealing planes for their operation, Slingshot and Skydive remain in a hangar in their jet modes. The Arabian planenappers disassemble the two Aerialbots and store their parts in laundry trucks. Blast Off opens the truck to inspect the parts, but orders them scrapped when Slingshot fakes a short circuit. Later on, the Aerialbots arrive on the scene and the Decepticons use their new jet drones to attack them. Blast Off is assigned three of these jets. However, these drones proved to be no match for the Aerialbots and are destroyed.
Later in the third season, Blast Off comes into contact with a Scuxxoid, who was seen shooting a weird weapon. The alien tells him that the weapon uses Death Crystals, a powerful energy source that grows on a monster names Chaos. Blast Off and Runamuck decide to test the weapon on the Autobot Sky Lynx, punching holes into his armor, forcing the Autobots to retreat.
Blast Off made various other appearances as a member of the Combaticons, throughout the remainder of the series, as well as in the Japanese series 
Dreamwave Productions.
Dreamwave Productions' 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 universe took its inspiration for the Combaticons from the original animated series, casting them as Decepticon prisoners who were reduced to protoform stasis because they were too dangerous to be released.
Onslaught, Brawl, Blast Off and Vortex originally appeared as part of Shockwave's attack on Iacon in the first War Within series. At the same time Swindle was with Starscream, Motormaster, Runabout and Runamuck after Starscream head sent Megatron and Optimus Prime down further into the depths of Cybertron.
Later, when Optimus Prime led a rebellion against Shockwave's domination of Cybertron in 2003, Starscream took the opportunity to form a power base, taking the protoform Combaticons to Earth and outfitting them with new alternate modes taken from an abandoned military base, then leading them in an attack on the Ark in order to acquire parts to make the Decepticon space cruiser, the Nemesis, space worthy. Confronted in battle by Brawn, Bruticus was caught in an explosion as Ratchet self-destructed the Ark, but he survived the conflagration, only to be knocked out by artillery fire from an incoming Autobot shuttle. After a battle with the evil clone, Sunstorm, Brawn opted to work out some of his stress on Bruticus's unconscious body, punching the gestalt about the head until his comrades yelled at him to stop. Bruticus would return, battling Sky Lynx for Starscream's amusement - until the Predacons appeared in their combined form of Predaking. The two gestalts battled as Starscream fled and Bruticus lost. The ultimate fate of the Combaticons in the Dreamwave universe was not revealed, due to the company's closure.
IDW Publishing.
Banzai-Tron, Gutcruncher, Axer and the Combaticons help Arcee attempt to recapture Monstructor.
Fun Publications.
Nine million years in the past on Cybertron, Blast Off is assigned to the Autobot Elite Guard Combaticon unit, designed to seek out and stop the leadership of the Decepticon forces.
The Elite Guard Alpha Team and Strike Team did battle against a horde of ferrovorous bugs in one of Cybertron's city-states. Magnum then ordered the Strike Team to escort the Alpha Team to Space Port Bravo for their next mission. The Strike Team then reported to Magnum and Sentinel Major, who introduced them to the new Elite Guard Special-Ops Team, also called the Combaticons.
While on patrol Onslaught told Metalhawk the story of how his Elite Guard team captured Thunderwing. Metalhawk then told Onslaught about how his team captured Blue Bacchus. The teams of Elite Guardsmen then came across a Decepticon who was separated from his group. Brawl was able to get the location of a Decepticon base from the captive before he went offline. The Guard teams fround the base and were able to kill Shadowcaster, the base's leader. Metalhawk's team reported to Magnum, but the Combaticons stayed to investigate, Onslaught thinking their victory was too easy. They were captured by Decepticons.
He later became a Decepticon.
Metalhawk and his Strike Team were searching for Decepticons when they ran into a crazy "empty" who ranted about the coming of the "brute". They received a distress signal from Sentinel Major ordering all Elite Guard units to return base. When Metalhawk's team arrived at the base Ricochet told them of a Decepticon attack. Among the attackers are the Combaticions, but when Sentinel Major orders them to surrender, they combine into Bruticus and crush Sentinel Major.
When most of the members of the Autobot Elite Guard confronted Bruticus they were nearly wiped out, with Bruticus killing most of the Guard. Dion was able to blind Bruticus, forcing it to separate into the Combaticons, but the Combaticons finished off most of the remaining Guard, including Metalhawk, who was killed by Onslaught. This left only Dion alive, buried in the rubble, and Thunderclash's team, which was off planet at the time.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise.
Movor transforms into a combat space-shuttle, and is capable of achieving planetary orbit under his own power. He carries detection equipment so he can search for Autobots from orbit, and is equipped with a powerful, long-range x-ray laser that allows him to attack them from that distance. At one point he fired twice on Scourage. He is somewhat pompous about his abilities, something which irritates his teammates. Movor has excellent heat-resistance. He combines with his fellow Combiners to form the giant robot Ruination.
Animated series.
Movor was one of five Transformers that actually began life as Autobots, sent to Earth along with a sixth to lead them in a mission to reactivate the legendary Autobot battle station known as Fortress Maximus. However, their craft malfunctioned and crashed, and the six Autobots were entombed in protoform state, joining Fortress Maximus in slumber until their ship was unearthed by Megatron and his Predacons. Absconding with the Autobot protoforms right under Optimus Prime's nose, Megatron took them to a nearby military base, intending to scan alternate modes for them. Mega-Octane was the first to be reactivated, infused with a portion of Megatron's own spark energy to create the first of a new breed of Transformer that Megatron dubbed the "Decepticons." The other four members of the team followed, and eventually the sixth, Scourge, who took leadership of the team from Mega-Octane with a show of force.
Simply referred to as the Commandos, they soon demonstrated their skills by blowing up dams across the country, debuting their combining abilities against Rail Racer and later attempting to harness the energies of a volcano on Montrose Island. As part of a string of failed attempts to locate the Autobots' hidden base, Movor was launched into orbit to track Side Burn from space, and the Decepticons then pretended to have reverted to their original Autobot selves in an effort to make the Autobots take them in. Later, Decepticon corruption of the Autobots' global spacebridge led Ruination into conflict with Landfill.
It soon became apparent that Scourge sought to overthrow Megatron's leadership, and the discovery of Fortress Maximus, buried beneath the Earth's surface accelerated the process as exposure to his energies, and those of the O-Parts - the keys to Maximus's resurrection - awoke memories of Scourge's original mission. His new Decepticon programming turned it on its head, however, as he now wished to command Maximus's power for his own, and soon had the other Decepticons thinking the same way, conspiring with Mega-Octane to get Cerebros, the power key of Fortress Maximus, under his control. As a series of chases to acquire control of Maximus began, Scourge eventually revealed his treachery by trying to have the giant attack Galvatron (Megatron, in a new form), only for the plan to fail. In retribution, Galvatron again brainwashed the Decepticons, turning them back into his loyal servants, who followed him so completely that they were even willing to take his orders after he attempted to kill them as a belated punishment. With Galvatron's defeat, the Decepticons and Predacons were all taken back to Cybertron for imprisonment.
3H Enterprises.
His only appearance in the official storyline of "Transformers: Universe" was as a member of the Ruination combiner team in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, where he was commanded by Reptilion.
Transformers: Energon.
Blast Off was the Japanese name for "Energon" Blackout, who transformed into an attack helicopter.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.

Secret and Whisper

Secret and Whisper (often typeset as Secret & Whisper) was a post-hardcore band from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. Secret and Whisper formed after the band Stutterfly replaced their departed vocalist and decided on a new name. Their first album, "Great White Whale" was released on February 12, 2008. The band's first single was "XOXOXO" followed by "Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)". Their second album, "Teenage Fantasy", was released on April 6, 2010.
History.
Formations and "Great White Whale" (2007-2010).
The band, consisting of five members, was called Stutterfly until a key member, Chris Stickney, decided to leave shortly after they were dropped from Maverick Records. Stickney soon moved to a band called Oceans Apart.
The rest of the band, Bradyn Byron, Jason Ciolli, Jordan Chase and Ryan Loerke, approached Charles Finn (then named Charles Furney), a friend and former member of thebleedingalarm, who used to tour with them, to be their new lead singer. The new line-up became Secret and Whisper on February 24, 2007. They decided to think of a new band name because of the completely different sound that Charles' voice brought to the band.
"Teenage Fantasy, "hiatus and recent events (2010-present).
On September 15, 2009 in a MySpace blog, Charles announced the official departure of Bradyn Byron. The band has since recruited David Ecker as guitarist. David Ecker previously played guitar for Oceans Apart with former Stutterfly member Chris Stickney.
The band has mentioned a new website with the release of the new album 'Teenage Fantasy', a music video for one of the songs, and a video update on many occasions but have yet to produce on any of these.
Teenage Fantasy's first single was "Warrior (Southern Arrowwood)". The album was released on April 6, 2010. No music video was released off the album.
On November 25, 2010, strikegently.com reported that Charles had been recruited to fill Cove Reber's abandoned vocalist spot in Saosin. One day later, on November 26, Saosin themselves denied these claims on their Facebook page:
On February 4, 2011, they released B-Side track on Myspace titled "Pixie".
It was announced on July 12, 2011 via Facebook note that the band was going on a hiatus.
Members of S&W Jordan Chase, Ryan Loerke and David Ecker have since gone on to form the band Shreddy Krueger.
Charles Finn released a teaser for the solo album on his official YouTube account. Pantherman Records, a record company started by Finn in July 2012, announced on the official Facebook page that 'Don't Be Sad' will be released on October 9, 2012, and that Finn has started another project called Faux Fur that hoped to release an EP in 2013. Since that time two songs off the album 'Don't Be Sad' were uploaded to Finn's YouTube ("Church Youth" and "100 Friends Living in My Mouth"), but Facebook pages of Charles Finn, Faux Fur and Pantherman Records were deleted.
In 2012 Jason Ciolli joined the band Scissorkick.

Jason Lutes

Jason Lutes (born December 7, 1967) is an American comics creator. His work is mainly historical fiction, but he also works in traditional fiction. His work includes the "Berlin" series and "Jar of Fools", as well as "The Fall" (with Ed Brubaker), and many short pieces for anthologies and compilations.
Lutes was born in New Jersey, but his family soon relocated to Missoula, Montana. In his early years, Lutes liked superhero comics, but a trip to France exposed him to European comics like "The Adventures of Tintin" and "Asterix", which he says greatly affected his style of drawing.
Lutes went to college at the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1991. He moved to Seattle after graduation, where he found work for the alternative comics publisher Fantagraphics, and eventually became art director of the alternative weekly "The Stranger".
During this period, Lutes began writing and self-publishing his own comic work with Penny Dreadful Press. In 1993 Lutes began serializing a strip for "The Stranger", which was collected in 1996 in the critically acclaimed graphic novel "Jar of Fools". After two years of research, Lutes embarked on the ambitious comic book series "Berlin", an ongoing 24-chapter story set in the twilight years of Germany's Weimar Republic. When "Berlin"'s original publisher Black Eye Productions closed in 1998, Drawn & Quarterly took over the series.
Lutes subsequently moved to Asheville, North Carolina, in October 2002; this move forms the subject of his autobiographical "Rules to Live By," collected in "AutobioGraphix" by Dark Horse Comics.
In 2007, Hyperion published the graphic novel "Houdini: The Handcuff King," written by Lutes and illustrated by Nick Bertozzi.
Lutes has two children, Clementine (born 2006) and Max, with his partner Becka Warren.
Starting in the spring of 2008, he became part of the faculty of the Center for Cartoon Studies; he is now an adjunct professor there.
Other work.
Lutes also contributed unit portraits for the open-source video game Battle for Wesnoth, and illustrations for the New York Times article "How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?" by Paul Krugman.

<doc id="9702893" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9702893" title="Harvard–MIT Mathematics Tournament">
Harvard–MIT Mathematics Tournament

The Harvard–MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT) is an annual high school math competition started in 1998. The location of the tournament, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, alternates between Harvard University (even years) and MIT (odd years). The contest is written and staffed entirely by Harvard and MIT students, and is considered to be one of the most prestigious high school math competitions in the world.
Tournament Format.
HMMT February is attended by teams of eight students each. Teams can represent a single school, or a regional math team as large as a state. In recent years, teams have represented over 20 states, as well as Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.
HMMT February consists of three rounds: the Individual Round, the Team Round, and the Guts Round. No calculator or computational aids of any kind are allowed during the contest.
Individual Round.
The Individual Round consists of exams in Algebra, Combinatorics, and Geometry. Each of the three exams is 50 minutes in length and contains 10 questions. The exams are open-answer; that is, the answers given will be numbers such as 7 or 11/20.
Team Round.
For the Team Round, the eight-person teams compete together on a 60-minute long test. The Team Round is a collaborative event with proof-style problems, sometimes arranged into groups of several problems on the same theme. Thorough justifications are required for full credit. The Team Round is worth a total of 400 points, and problems are weighted according to difficulty. The event is similar to an ARML Power Round, but the problems are much harder and less numerous. This round is targeted at teams comfortable with rigorous mathematical proofs.
Guts Round.
The Guts Round is an 80-minute team event with 36 short-answer questions on an assortment of subjects, of varying difficulty and point values. Each team is seated in a predetermined spot, and the questions are divided into groups of four. At the starting signal, each team sends a runner to an assigned problem station to pick up copies of the first set of four problems for each team member. As soon as a team has answers for one problem set, the runner may bring the answers to the problem station and pick up the next set. It is not expected that students will finish all the problems. Grading is immediate and scores are posted in real time, resulting in an exciting atmosphere for the competitors. The Guts round is worth a total of approximately 400 points.
Other Events.
HMMT February also features events on the Friday evening prior to the tournament. Some of these events include a dinner and social for students and coaches, and Mini-Events such as math talks about famous problems and math-related games.
The top 50 competitors at HMMT February are also invited to compete in the Harvard MIT Invitational Competition (HMIC) which is a five question four hour proof contest started in 2013. The grading scheme for this has changed in the two years that it has been running but the problems both years have been quite difficult with competitors fully solving three problems being extremely highly ranked.
Scoring and Awards.
HMMT February uses a unique scoring algorithm to score the competitors on the Individual Rounds. While the problems on these tests are weighted according to difficulty, they are done so "after" the testing has completed. As explained here, this helps create a very fair method for weighting problems according to their actual difficulty (as determined by how often and by whom they were solved) as opposed to their perceived difficulty prior to the tournament. The weights assigned to each problem are calculated using a scoring algorithm that takes into account which problems were solved by which students. The weights of the problems on the Team and Guts Rounds are given on the tests.
Prizes are given to the ten highest-scoring individuals overall, the top ten scorers on each of the subject rounds, the ten highest-scoring teams on the Team Round (A and B), and the ten highest-scoring teams on the Guts Round. The top ten teams overall will be named the Sweepstakes winners. The calculation of Sweepstakes scores is roughly half individual round performance and half collaborative round performance.
Difficulty.
The difficulty of the competition is compared to that of ARML, the AIME, or the Mandelbrot Competition, though it is considered to be a bit harder than these contests. The contest organizers state that, "HMMT, arguably one of the most difficult math competitions in the United States, is geared toward students who can comfortably and confidently solve 6 to 8 problems correctly on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)." As with most high school competitions, knowledge of calculus is not required; however, calculus may be necessary to solve a select few of the more difficult problems on the Individual Rounds.
Results.
The results of HMMT February can be seen below:
HMMT November.
HMMT November has been held since 2008, alternately at MIT and Harvard, for teams of six students. Students are required to come from the United States to participate, and no student may compete in both November and February in a given school year. The tournament is similar in style to HMMT February, and is organized by the same Harvard and MIT students. Instead of three topic tests, HMMT November has two Individual Rounds: a General Test (ten questions from Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics) and a Theme Test (ten questions, many of which are tied together by a common theme). Additionally, the Team Round is entirely short answer, instead of proof-based. HMMT November is considered to be an easier alternative to HMMT February. The results of HMMT November can be seen below:
Sponsors.
HMMT is currently sponsored by the MIT Mathematics Department, the Harvard Mathematics Department, and Jane Street Capital.

Ebriid

The Ebridea is a group of phagotrophic flagellate protist present in marine coastal plankton communities worldwide. Ebria tripartita is one of two (possibly four) described extant species in the Ebridea.
Members of this group are named for their idiosyncratic method of movement ("ebrius", "drunk").
Ebriids are usually encountered in low abundance and have a peculiar combination of ultrastructural characters including a large nucleus with permanently condensed chromosomes and an internal skeleton composed of siliceous rods.
The taxonomic history of the group has been tumultuous and has included a variety of affiliations, such as silicoflagellates, dinoflagellates, 'radiolarians' and 'neomonads'.
Recently the Ebridea is treated as a eukaryotic taxon with an unclear phylogenetic position, but last molecular studies (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) place of ebriids within the Cercozoa.

History.
William Carter was the founder of William Carter Company in 1865. William Carter (1830–1918) was born in Alfreton, Derbyshire, England. He arrived in America on January 28, 1857. He married Martha Lee. They had four children.: William Henry Carter (1864–1955), Horace A. Carter (1869-?), Mary Elizabeth Carter (?-?), and John J. Carter (?-?).
In 2012, Carter's, Inc. announced that Braselton, Georgia would receive their one-million-square-foot, $50 million distribution center that will support their e-commerce, retail, and wholesale businesses. The company hopes to create 1,000 jobs at the facility by 2015.
Headquarters.
The company has its headquarters in Suite 900 in The Proscenium, in Midtown Atlanta.
In October 2012 the "Atlanta Business Chronicle" reported that Carter's Inc. was likely to lease in the Phipps Tower in Buckhead for its headquarters. In December 2012 Carter's Inc. announced that it was moving its headquarters from Midtown Atlanta. The lease of of space is one if the largest headquarters leases to have occurred to date. The estimated value of the lease, except for concessions and escalation, was $70 million. The lease in Midtown is scheduled to be terminated on December 31, 2013.
The company consolidated its out of state jobs into the new facility, with 200 additional jobs going to Buckhead. Manulife Financial Corp owns both the Proscenium and the Phipps Tower so Carter's terminated its lease early in one building and moved to the other.

Annexin A1

Annexin A1 also known as lipocortin I is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "ANXA1" gene.
Function.
Annexin I belongs to the annexin family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins that have a molecular weight of approximately 35,000 to 40,000 and are preferentially located on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. Annexin I protein has an apparent relative molecular mass of 40 kDa, with phospholipase A2 inhibitory activity.
Clinical significance.
Effect on innate and adaptive immunity.
Glucocorticoids (such as budesonide, cortisol, beclomethasone) are a class of endogenous or synthetic anti-inflammatory steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. They are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. But because they suppress inflammatory pathways, long-term use of glucocorticoid drugs can lead to side-effects such as immunodeficiency and adrenal insufficiency. 
The main mechanism of glucocorticoids' anti-inflammatory effects is to increase the synthesis and function of annexin A1. Annexin A1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis at the level of phospholipase A2 as well as at the level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.
In resting conditions, human and mouse immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages contain high levels of annexin A1 in their cytoplasm. Following cell activation (for example, by neutrophil adhesion to endothelial-cell monolayers), annexin A1 is promptly mobilized to the cell surface and secreted. Annexin A1 promotes neutrophil detachment and apoptosis, and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages. On the other hand, it reduces the tendency of neutrophils to penetrate the endothelium of blood vessels."In vitro" and "in vivo" analyses show that exogenous and endogenous annexin A1 counter-regulate the activities of innate immune cells, in particular extravasation and the generation of proinflammatory mediators, and this ensures that a sufficient level of activation is reached but not exceeded.
Annexin A1 has important opposing properties during innate and adaptive immune responses, as it inhibits innate immune cells and promotes T-cell activation. Activation of T cells results in the release of annexin A1 and the expression of its receptor. This pathway seems to fine-tune the strength of TCR signalling. Higher expression of annexin A1 during pathological conditions could increase the strength of TCR signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway, thereby causing a state of hyperactivation of T cells.
Inflammation.
Since phospholipase A2 is required for the biosynthesis of the potent mediators of inflammation, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, annexin I may have potential anti-inflammatory activity.
Glucocorticoids stimulate production of lipocortin. In this way, synthesis of eicosanoids are inhibited.
Cancer.
Annexin I has been of interest for use as a potential anticancer drug. Upon induction by modified NSAIDS and other potent anti-inflammatory drugs, annexin I inhibits the NF-κB signal transduction pathway, which is exploited by cancerous cells to proliferate and avoid apoptosis. ANXA1 inhibits the activation of NF-κB by binding to the p65 subunit.
Leukemia.
The gene for annexin A1 (ANXA1) is upregulated in hairy cell leukemia. ANXA1 protein expression is specific to hairy cell leukemia. Detection of ANXA1 (by immunocytochemical means) reportedly provides a simple, highly sensitive and specific assay for the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.
Breast cancer.
Exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to high physiological levels (up to 100 nM) of estrogen lead to an up-regulation of annexin-1 expression partially through the activation of CREB, and dependent on activation of the estrogen receptor alpha. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with physiological levels of estrogen (1 nM) induced proliferation while high pregnancy levels of estrogen (100 nM) induced a growth arrest of MCF-7 cells. Silencing of ANXA1 with specific siRNA reverses the estrogen-dependent proliferation as well as growth arrest. ANXA1 is lost in clinical breast cancer, indicating that the anti-proliferative protective function of ANXA1 against high levels of estrogen may be lost in breast cancer. This data suggests that ANXA1 may act as a tumor suppressor gene and modulate the proliferative functions of estrogens.
Annexin-A1 has also been shown to be protective against DNA damage induced by heat in breast cancer cells, adding to the evidence that it has tumor suppressive and protective activities. When ANXA1 is silenced or lost in cancer, cells are more prone to DNA damage, indicating its unidentified diverse role in genome maintenance or integrity.

Annexin A2

Annexin A2 also known as annexin II is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "ANXA2" gene.
Annexin 2 is involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell motility (especially that of the epithelial cells), linkage of membrane-associated protein complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, fibrinolysis, ion channel formation, and cell matrix interactions.
It is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein whose function is to help organize exocytosis of intracellular proteins to the extracellular domain. Annexin II is a pleiotropic protein meaning that its function is dependent on place and time in the body.
Gene.
The ANXA2 gene, located at 15q22.2, has three pseudogenes located on chromosomes 4, 9 and 10, respectively. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Function.
This protein is a member of the annexin family. Members of this calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways. This protein functions as an autocrine factor which heightens osteoclast formation and bone resorption.
Annexin A2 has been proposed to function inside the cell in sorting of endosomes and outside the cell in anticoagulant reactions.
Interactions.
Annexin A2 has been shown to interact with Prohibitin, CEACAM1, S100A10, PCNA and complement Factor H

Annexin A5

Annexin A5 (or annexin V) is a cellular protein in the annexin group. The function of the protein is unknown; however, annexin A5 has been proposed to play a role in the inhibition of blood coagulation by competing for phosphatidylserine binding sites with prothrombin and also to inhibit the activity of phospholipase A1. These properties have been found by in vitro experiments.
Annexin A5 in pathology.
Antibodies directed against annexin A5 are found in patients with a disease called the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a thrombophilic disease associated with autoantibodies against phospholipid compounds.
Annexin A5 forms a shield around negatively-charged phospholipid molecules. The formation of an annexin A5 shield blocks the entry of phospholipids into coagulation (clotting) reactions. In the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the formation of the shield is disrupted by antibodies. Without the shield, there is an increased quantity of phospholipid molecules on cell membranes, speeding up coagulation reactions and causing the blood-clotting characteristic of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
Annexin A5 showed upregulation in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Laboratory use of annexin A5.
Annexin A5 is used as a non-quantitative probe to detect cells that have expressed phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the cell surface, an event found in apoptosis as well as other forms of cell death. Platelets also expose PS and PE on their surface when activated, which serves as binding site for various coagulation factors.
The annexin A5 affinity assay typically uses a conjugate of annexin V and a fluorescent or enzymatic label, biotin or other tags, or a radioelement, in a suitable buffer (annexin V binding to aminophospholipids is Ca2+ dependent). The assay combines annexin V staining of PS and PE membrane events with the staining of cell nucleus with PI or AAD-7 distinguish viable cells from apoptotic cells and necrotic cells. Detection occurs by flow cytometry or a fluorescence microscope.
Interactions.
Annexin A5 has been shown to interact with Kinase insert domain receptor and Integrin, beta 5.

Eddie Tabash

Edward (Eddie) Tabash is an American lawyer and political and social activist. An atheist and a proponent of the Establishment Clause. He chairs the Board of Directors for the Center for Inquiry. Tabash has represented the atheist position in debates against several world-renowned religious philosophers, including William Lane Craig, Peter van Inwagen, J.P. Moreland, Greg Bahnsen and Richard Swinburne.
Early life.
Tabash graduated magna cum laude from UCLA in 1973 and obtained a law degree from Loyola Law School of Los Angeles in 1976. His father was an orthodox rabbi from Lithuania and his mother was an Auschwitz survivor from Hungary.
Tabash told D.J. Grothe in a 2007 interview when asked if he could sympathize with people's search for God, Tabash states, "I was a new age spiritual seeker for 25 years... I'm sympathetic with the yearning for some kind of immortality... But that does not mean its true, and it doesn't mean that God beliefs are harmless." He remembers the stories his rabbi father used to tell at Passover about the miracles God performed in order to get Pharaoh to allow the Jews their freedom. In turn, his mother told him Auschwitz stories, and Tabash even as a boy could not understand why God would perform astounding miracles to rescue their people from a lesser tyrant, but be unwilling to perform miracles to rescue them from a far more murderous tyrant.
Career.
Tabash is a member of the California State Bar, the American Bar Association, the Los Angeles County Bar Association, and the Beverly Hills Bar Association. He also chairs the First Amendment Task Force for the Council for Secular Humanism. Tabash has written "amicus" briefs urging the separation of church and state, in cases before the Supreme Court of the United States and the California State Supreme Court and the California Court of Appeal. Tabash works in the Los Angeles area.
Tabash believes in personal freedom. His views include advocacy of the decriminalization of prostitution, free speech, "Blasphemy is a human right", abortion rights, and the separation of church and state. He also supports the International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture and Education (ISWFACE), and the Internet Infidels, He currently chairs the Legal Committee of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. In November 2012 he was chosen as chair of the boards of directors of the Center for Inquiry, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and the Council for Secular Humanism.
From 1981 through 1998, Tabash actively debated numerous professional anti abortion opponents in the abortion rights movement in California. He was, during that time, the primary public speaker and debater for the Southern California branch of the California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
In 1994, Tabash finished second out of six in the Democratic primary for the California State Assembly in the 41st Assembly District. In 2000, Tabash finished second out of four in the Democratic Primary for the California State Assembly in the 55th Assembly District.
Tabash is a firm supporter of equal rights for all people, religious or non religious, "No American can officially be valued more or less than anyone else because of either adhering to or rejecting a tenet of religion belief or nonbelief... The separation of church and state is one of those magnificent issues that can help to unify a very severe breach in our country because its aim is to protect both believers and nonbelievers equally... "My ultimate aim is to persuade overwhelming majorities of people to abandon any prejudices they harbor against atheists and to view nonbelief as just one more respectable alternative among existing viewpoints on matters of religion."
He has been concerned about how religious fundamentalist beliefs of all kinds have been used, throughout human history, to deny women their rightful equality, "No person should lose her or his freedom because of someone else's religious beliefs. Only those actions that can be demonstrated by empirical evidence to warrant sanctions, independently of religious dogma, should be punished." He also believes that this same mode of religious fundamentalism has been used to deny equal rights to members of the LGBT community. "There is not one proposed piece of legislation that would deny gays and lesbians equal rights that is not grounded in religious dogma". "The most precious freedom of conscience, the most precious and valued... right to determine one's own ideas about how the universe was formed should not be touched at all by the heavy oppressive hand of government, but should be left to the realm of individual freedom. All of these are in jeopardy because of the religious right wing." "Americans have to understand that there is a difference between one's personal view as to whether there is a supreme being--and what such a being requires of us--and what the law of the land should be."

Stephen V Báthory

Stephen Báthory of Ecsed (, ; ; 1430–1493) was a Hungarian commander, 'dapiferorum regalium magister' (1458–?), judge royal (1471–1493) and voivode of Transylvania (1479–1493). He rose to power under King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and after the king's death sided with Vladislav Jagiellon of Bohemia and later together with Pál Kinizsi defeated Prince John Corvin in the Battle of Csonthegy (1493). As a result of his cruelty in Transylvania, especially against the Székelys, he was deposed by the King in 1493 and died shortly afterwards.
Family history.
The Báthory family was a powerful and influential Hungarian noble family from the 14th to 17th century. The two branches of the family produced many voivodes, Transylvanian princes and a king, (Stefan Batory of Poland). Báthory belonged to the powerful family of Gutkeled, of the Ecsed branch. The name Báthory and the family coat-of-arms were granted in 1325.
Career.
In 1467, he took part in Matthias' bitter defeat against Moldavia at the Battle of Baia. In 1476, Corvinus decided to support Vlad III Dracula in reclaiming his Wallachian throne from Basarab Laiotă. He therefore made Báthory supreme commander over an army of 8,000 infantry and 13,000 cavalry, but since Báthory was rather inexperienced in military leadership, "the actual leadership was shared by Dracula and the Serbian despot Vuk Brancovic. Before this, Dracula and Báthory had waged war in Bosnia, where Báthory was sent by Corvinus to free a certain Bosnian king whose name was also Matthias. The new campaign would involve Hungarian, Moldavian, and Wallachian troops, with the assistance of a small Serbian contingent. Dracula wrote to his cousin, Prince Stephen III of Moldavia, to wait for him so that the two could merge their armies, but the merging failed due to delayment in movement of the Hungarian troops, which resulted in Stephen's defeat at the Battle of Valea Albă on July 26, 1476. On August 18, the two armies merged and helped Stephen get rid of the Turks in Moldavia. After a consultation that took place in the city of Braşov, Dracula, Báthory, and Brancovic invaded Wallachia from southern Transylvania with an army of 35,000, whereas Stephen would aid them by attacking eastern Wallachia with 15,000 men. Dracula's offensive began in early November 1476 and defeated Laiotă's 18,000 strong army at Rucăr, at the Wallachian-Transylvanian border. Both armies lost around 10,000 men.
On November 8, Dracula captured the capital of Târgovişte where he met with Stephen. The two swore eternal allegiance to one another and when at the presence of Báthory, the two pledged as well to pursue a great crusade against the Turks. By November 11, Báthory reported to the town officials of Sibiu that most of Wallachia was in Dracula's hands and added that "all the boyars aside from two are with us" and "even the latter will soon join us."
On November 16, Bucharest fell to Báthory's army and on November 26, Dracula was reestablished as Prince of Wallachia for his third time. After Stephen and Báthory retreated from Wallachia, Laiotă would return to Wallachia with an army to reclaim his throne. In December, Laiota and Dracula met each other in battle. Dracula possessed only a small army and was killed in battle.
Battle of Bread Field.
In 1479, Báthory was made governor of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania with a force of 43,000 men. The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it, giving Báthory little time to gather his militia at Sibiu. Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory. As Báthory approached Sebeş, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş, totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him.
On the early morning of October 13, Báthory appeared on the "heights beyond the brook." Ali was forced to stand ground in order to secure an eventual redrawl and evacuate his booty." Báthory ordered his army to prepare for battle: his 3,000 Transylvanian Saxons, supported by a second line of Transylvanian Wallachians, comprised the right flank on the Mureş River, while the Hungarians comprised the left flank—he and his heavy cavalry were placed in the middle. The Ottoman leaders were in disagreement and had their preparations for the battle delayed; after "three hours of idle waiting, Báthory, confident that Pál Kinizsi would arrive any minute, gave the order to attack." The Transylvanian Saxons opened the attack, but were routed; the Transylvanian Wallachians followed their fate, with many being wounded or killed; and later, the Hungarian line would be pressured to retreat to the centre. Báthory then charged with his heavy cavalry, but fell off his horse; this alerted his companions who interpreted it as a bad omen and advised him to either turn back or retreat to the mountains. He ignored their advice and as head of his cavalry, charged the first Ottoman line with a great force, routing them. Ali then charged with his cavalry and a fierce battle took place that lasted for three hours. Báthory was seriously injured, as he bled from six wounds; "his horse had been killed under him." Surrounded by a "wall of corpses" and barely holding onto his life, he was about to lose the battle when Kinizsi's army appeared on the hill, with drums and trumpets making their noise. Some 900 Serbs under a Demeter Jakšić assisted by "numerous courtiers of the king", charged against the Turks. The Turks, who were taken by surprise, were slaughtered by the furious Kinizsi and after a renewed attack, he managed to save Báthory.
The few Turks who survived the massacre fled into the mountains, where the majority were killed by the local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their troops, with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.
Aftermath.
Báthory was accused of using excessive cruelty against the Székely in Transylvania and was disposed by Vladislaus II in 1493. He died shortly afterwards. His family would return to rule as Voivodes and then Princes of Transylvania.

Battle of Breadfield

The Battle of Breadfield ( ) was the most tremendous conflict fought in Transylvania up to that time in the Hungarian-Turkish Wars taking place on October 13, 1479, on the Breadfield Zsibód (Şibot) near the Mureş River. The Hungarian army was led by Pál Kinizsi, István Báthory, Vuk Branković, and Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân.<br>
The result of the battle was an important victory for the Kingdom of Hungary.
Background.
Turkish marauders attacked Transylvania and Vojvodina several times between 1474 and 1475. The attacks led to the depopulation of some areas with a number of villages abandoned by their inhabitants.
After the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79) in the spring of 1479, a major Turkish army convened under Szendrő, above all Akıncıs. When King Matthias was alerted, he ordered Stephen Báthory, the Voivode of Transylvania and his general Pál Kinizsi to mobilize.
The Turkish army entered Transylvania on October 9, near Kelnek (Câlnic), led by Ali Kodsha bey. The Akıncıs attacked a few villages, homesteads and market towns, taking a number of Hungarians, Vlachs and Saxons captive. On October 13, Kodsha bey set up his camp in the Breadfield "(Kenyérmező)," near Zsibót. Kodsha bey was obliged into the campaign by the insistence of Basarab cel Tânăr, a Wallachian prince, who himself brought 1,000–2,000 footmen to the cause.
The Turks continued pillaging and taking prisoners, while Báthory and Kinizsi made preparations to set forth against the Turks.
The Hungarian and the Ottoman army.
The numerical strength of the Turkish army is under debate; one estimate judged them to be a 60,000, while Hungarian sources placed them closer to 30,000. Jan Długosz, the famous Polish chronicler, estimated the Ottoman forces to have been 100 thousand men-at-arms, but Matthias Corvinus estimated there were 43-45,000 Ottoman and Wallachian soldiers in his letters. A more probable number for Ottoman forces was between 6-20 thousand soldiers, and 1,000-2,000 Wallachians. The Ottoman army was almost entirely made up of Akıncıs, rumelian Spakhs and Azaps, with some Janissaries and possibly some cannon. The Turkish enterprise was not full-fledged war effort, but rather a very substantial raiding one - the largest expedition Transylvania encountered during a century's worth of Hungarian-Turkish conflicts.
Kinizsi's army consisted of Hungarian, Szekler, Serbian, Transylvanian Saxon forces, and some Vlach volunteers. The latter were commanded by Basarab cel Bătrân, quondam ruler of Wallachia and archrival to cel Tânăr. Accordingly, cel Tânăr insisted on equality with cel Bătrân, with only one being tenable to the Wallachian throne. The combined Christian forces totaled approximated 12,000 to 15,000 men. In the judgement of some, Poles, Moldavians, Russians, Lithuanians, Germans and Bohemians were privy in part to the battle, but rather difficult to substantiate.
The battle.
Both armies were composed of three columns. The right flank of the Hungarian army was led by Kinizsi, the left was the Serbian light cavalry under Vuk Branković and Demeter Jakšić with the Saxons and Báthory's forces in the center. On the Ottoman side, Kodsha bey took the left flank, Isa bey the center and Malkoch Oglu the right flank.
The battle commenced in the afternoon, Báthory fell from his horse and the Ottomans nearly captured him, but a valiant Antal Nagy whisked the voivode away. Having joined battle, the Ottomans were in ascendancy early on, but Kinizsi charged against the Turks with the Hungarian heavy cavalry and 900 Serbs under a Jakšić assisted by ""numerous courtiers of the king"". Ali bey was forced to retreat. Kinizsi moved laterally to vigorously smash the Turkish center and before long Isa bey also withdrew. The few Turks who survived the massacre fled into the mountains, where the majority were killed by the local population. The hero of the battle was Pál Kinizsi, the legendary Hungarian general and a man of Herculean bodily strength in the service of Matthias Corvinus' Black Army of Hungary.
Aftermath.
Turkish casualties were extremely high with several thousand men killed, among them Malkoçoğlu and Isa bey along with together with two beys and a thousand of their Wallachian allies. Hungarian forces lost approximately 3,000 men in the battle. A few prisoners were liberated and their ransom was immense.
In 1480 Kinizsi raided Serbia and several times defeated Ali Kodsha bey. The Breadfield battle was a great psychological victory for the Hungarians, and as a result the Ottoman Turks did not attack southern Hungary and Transylvania for many years thereafter.

The Brain Eaters

The Brain Eaters is a 1958 science fiction-horror film about alien parasites who invade the small Illinois town of Riverdale and are able to take over any living thing, mind and body, by attaching themselves to their host's back and inserting two mandibles into the base of their spines. The film was directed by Bruno VeSota and stars Ed Nelson, Alan Jay Factor, Joanna Lee, with a brief appearance by Leonard Nimoy (name misspelled in 10th place in the credits as "Leonard Nemoy").
Plot.
A team of local scientists discover alien parasites when they investigate a mysterious, three-story-tall, cone-like object that has appeared outside of town. It becomes obvious that the parasites' first victims, whose minds have been taken over, are the town's leading citizens.
Production.
Actor Bruno VeSota wanted to direct. He approached Roger Corman with the script and Corman helped him raise the low budget and arranged distribution through AIP. The film was shot in six days.
The movie was known during production as "The Keepers", "The Keepers of the Earth", "Attack of the Blood Leeches" and "Battle of the Brain Eaters".
After the film was released, it was clear that writer Gordon Urqhart had based his screenplay on the novel "The Puppet Masters" by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein sued for plagiarism, asking for $150,000. Roger Corman vowed he was unfamiliar with Heinlein's work when presented with the script and during production. He did, however, see the obvious references once he read the story, so he settled out of court for $5,000. Heinlein also demanded that he himself receive no screen credit, as he found the film based on his story "wanting".

Marysville High School (Marysville, Michigan)

Marysville High School is a public high school in Marysville, Michigan. The school building was constructed in 2010. The previous school, which stood one block west, was in service from 1942 until its demolition in 2010. 
The high school has an enrollment of 811, and is a class B school. Marysville High School is in the Macomb Area Conference of the Michigan High School Athletic Association. Its mascot is the Viking, and its colors are navy blue and white with silver accents.
History.
The original Marysville High School was constructed in the 1920s and taught grades 6 to 12. It was located at the corner of Huron Blvd. and Michigan Ave. in what was downtown Marysville. In the 1940s, the relatively small school could not accommodate the growing population of the city, caused in part by the opening of the Wills Sainte Claire automobile factory. A new school was necessary, but since this was during World War II, the school board had to petition the U.S. War Department to build the new school. Pictures of the entire student body crammed into a hallway of the old school were sent with the petition. In 1942, permission was granted to construct a new school.
The new Marysville High was built adjacent to the original building, which was later known as "the annex". During construction, the basement of the school was reinforced with steel and concrete support beams so it could double as an air raid shelter. The completed school included a gymnasium and auditorium. In later years, the Detroit Pistons held summer practices in Marysville High's gym. In the 1950s and 1960s, a swimming pool, commercial arts, and home economics wing were added.
Over the years, Marysville High School underwent more upgrades and renovations, including an addition to the south side of the school in 1979. The property was the former home of the 575-square-foot "annex", which served as the public library until it burned down in 1975. The addition contained 14 classrooms, a band room, and a choir room.
In 2007, a bond proposal to demolish the existing school and build a new one passed by a slight majority, and work began to build the next Marysville High School. The New Marysville High, located on Huron Blvd. a block east of the existing school, opened for the 2010-11 school year.
The football team plays at Walt Braun Viking Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Collard.
Community.
Marysville High School's pool is shared with the city's recreation department. The auditorium serves as a stage for Marysville Public Schools, and for community events. The school's football field, track, weight room, and locker rooms also serve as facilities open to the public when not being used for school functions.
Extracurricular activities.
Television.
Marysville High School operates a community television station broadcasting to residents within the district on Comcast Cable Channel 6. The station, branded on the air as "M6, Your Hometown Station", is part of an audio/visual communication arts class. Programs aired include school and community news, school sporting events, band and choir concerts, community activities, and talk shows. Nearly all of the programs are produced by Marysville High School students, with the exception of segments distributed by St. Clair County RESA or local politicians. 
The studio for M6 is located inside Marysville High School. The school television station shares Comcast Channel 6 with the City of Marysville, which airs city council meetings live on the channel. School closings and community announcements are also broadcast to the community via M6. M6 also has a YouTube channel where student programs are displayed. M6 Television YouTube Channel
Athletics.
Marysville High School's athletics teams are affiliated with the Michigan High School Athletic Association and compete in the Macomb Area Conference. 
Softball.
The softball team won the MHSAA Class B State Championship in 1983 and were the Class B runner-up in 1991. 
Tennis.
In the fall of 2010 the boys' tennis team went undefeated in the MAC gold division and then placee second at the regional competition, qualifying for state competition.
Volleyball.
The volleyball team has won nine MHSAA Class B State Championships, including an MHSAA record eight consecutive titles between 1997 and 2004. Their ninth championship came in 2006. The volleyball team also holds a national record for the longest winning streak, in any sport. From 1996 to 2000, the Marysville Viking volleyball team won 192 consecutive games. 
Cheerleading.
The cheer team was named first in the MCCA State Championship in 2003. one of two Michigan state championships for high school cheerleading conducted in different formats.
Football.
The football team has won three state championships: 1992 (MHSAA Class B); 1986 (MHSAA Class B); 1961 (AP Class B). Marysville holds the Michigan record for consecutive winning seasons with 39, running from 1965 to 2003. The Marysville Vikings play football at Walt Braun Stadium named after two time State championship winning coach Walt Braun. Braun's Tenure in Marysville was marked by unprecedented success that eventually culminated in the coach being inducted into the State of Michigan Coach's Hall of Fame. 
The 1983 Marysville Vikings are the only team in the history of the MHSAA to be ranked #1 in the AP Poll at the end of the regular season, remain undefeated throughout the course of the playoffs, yet not win the state championship. As a result, the team is referred to as the "Mythical State Champions".
Marysville Viking Regiment.
The Marysville Viking Regiment is the high school's band program, which involves sophomores, juniors and seniors. A freshmen band competes as a separate entity, the "Marysville Freshmen Marching Band". The Viking Regiment competes both in the Michigan Competing Band Association (MCBA) and the Michigan School Band and Orchestra Association (MSBOA). For the better part of the past decade, the band has competed in state finals at Ford Field in Detroit, taking second place in 2009. The band has also received straight Division I (excellent) ratings in both marching and symphonic band since 1996. 
The bands march together during parades, including Walt Disney World, America's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, local parades, festivals, and football games. The band program has jazz band available to students in addition to concert band. Every three years, The Marysville Viking Regiment travels to Walt Disney World to perform in Disney's Magic Music Days, which includes a workshop on professional musicianship, and a parade in Magic Kingdom. 2013 will mark the 9th year for this tour.

Good Book Press

The Good Book Press was a fine press book publisher, founded in 1977 by Peter and Donna Thomas of Santa Cruz, California. The proprietors produced the books by hand. Peter R. Thomas (aka Peter Papermaker) made the paper and Donna Thomas illustrated the books predominately with linoleum cuts. The Thomases handset the type, letterpress printed the books, and bound the books by hand. Many of their works were sold at the California Renaissance Fair.
The Good Book Press specialized in miniature books, often fairy tales or fables. Many were original texts by Peter Thomas. The Good Book Press’s final work was their 1987 edition of poet William Everson’s eulogy for the death of Robinson Jeffers, titled “The Poet is Dead.”
The introduction of personal computers revolutionized production of fine press books. Artists from different media began to explore the books as art. In 1988, declaring that they were no longer publishers, but rather artists working in the medium of the book, Peter and Donna dropped the Good Book Press imprint and began creating their books under their new imprint: Peter and Donna Thomas: Santa Cruz.

National Evangelical Church of Beirut

The National Evangelical Church of Beirut (NEC) is the first native Arabic Protestant congregation in the Middle East. 
History.
Established in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, in 1848 by Congregational and Presbyterian American missionaries, the NEC is the oldest and the largest of nine congregations situated outside Beirut in the towns of Abeih, Aramoun, Khaldeh, Kafarshima, Hadath, Dbayyeh, Jdeideh and Dhour el-Shweir.
The National Evangelical Church of Beirut is the headquarters and administrative centre of these nine churches which operate under the name of the National Evangelical Union of Lebanon (NEUL).
In 1870, the first Evangelical Church was built to house the Arabic and English speaking congregations. During the next hundred years, the church was the centre for all the activities and celebrations of both communities. Then during the Lebanese civil war (1975–1990) it was totally destroyed except for the bell tower and its congregation consequently scattered.
Since its reconstruction in 1998, the National Evangelical Church of Beirut has been standing again in the heart of Beirut's Central District, re-gathering its people with its worship services presided by Rev. Dr. Habib Badr as well as with its many socio-cultural and educational activities.
Today, the NEC runs two schools in Beirut and the Johann Ludwig Schneller School in the Western Beqaa District. It is also involved in the ecumenical movement and theological education at the Near East School of Theology situated likewise in Beirut. Together with the Ecumenical Committee, it plays a leading role in assisting Sudanese refugees in Lebanon.

White Flint Mall

White Flint Mall is a shopping mall located along Rockville Pike in Montgomery County, Maryland due for closing and demolition in 2014.
History.
The mall opened in 1977 and was initially anchored by Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, and I. Magnin. Borders Books and Music took over the I. Magnin location in 1992; it closed in 2011. The inside of the mall was made up of themed districts; the faux city streets of "Georgetown" and an Italian marketplace known as "Via Rialto" which ran beneath I. Magnin from the main entrance to the center court where Bertucci's and Cheesecake Factory later stood. Many restaurants and fast food vendors populated the mall including the food court "The Eatery" which went through multiple changes as well as the third floor loft overlooking the center court. White Flint was the first mall to issues its own credit card to frequent shoppers. The fountain under the mirrored escalators in the Via Rialto was removed after the closing of I. Magnin. The last two fountains, which were located in front of the Otis inground glass hydraulic elevators, were removed during a 2004 center court facelift. One oddity about the closure of Borders is the sign left in front of the escalator leading to its shuttered entrance warning mall patrons "Temporarily Out of Service" although it is obviously permanent. Over the years major celebrities have appeared at the mall like Donna Karan and Elizabeth Taylor, the cast of MTV's , Brigitte Burdine, Andrea Mitchell and Paula Marshall. 
Since 1984, the mall has been served by the White Flint station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.
In November 2011, Lerner Enterprises announced plans to deconstruct the 850,000-square-foot mall and its large parking deck and replace it with four office buildings, a 300-room hotel, 1 million square feet of retail and restaurant space, and 12 apartment buildings consisting of a total of 2,500 residences. The developers expected construction to begin two years following approval. The project would take approximately 25 years to be fully completed.
On January 5, 2012, Macy's Inc. announced that the mall's Bloomingdale's store would close in March 2012. Bloomingdale's closed on March 14 2012, and the building it occupied was demolished in 2013 prior to the mall's closure.
Lerner Enterprises revived its plans for redevelopment in late 2013. By year's end, the mall had lost more than three-fourths of its stores. 
On December 24, 2013, WJLA-TV reported that White Flint Mall will permanently close after nearly 37 years. As of June 2014, Lord & Taylor, Dave & Busters, a jewelry store and P. F. Chang's China Bistro remain open.

Paschal trikirion

[[File:Cross Procession in Novosibirsk 06.jpg|thumb|left|Russian Orthodox 
archpriest holding a paschal trikirion during a procession in Novosibirsk]]
The Paschal Trikirion () is a liturgical triple-candlestick used at Easter time in the Eastern Orthodox/Byzantine Catholic tradition.
Liturgical Use.
The paschal trikirion is not mentioned in the liturgical books of the Orthodox Church; indeed, both the Pentecostarion and the Typicon dictate the celebrant carry a cross in his left hand when, in contemporary practice, the paschal trikirion is also carried.
The paschal trikirion is held by the serving priest (whether a bishop or a presbyter) in contrast to the bishop's trikirion which the bishop uses for blessing and is held or carried alongside the bishop. It is used from the commencement of the celebration of the Resurrection during the Paschal Vigil through the end of Bright Week, and also on the Apodosis of Pascha, when it is used at sundry times, in particular, while chanting the paschal verses at the beginning of Vespers, Matins and the Divine Liturgy, while censing, during the Little Entrance, and when giving the paschal greeting.
Styles.
The paschal trikirion is fashioned in various styles in various regions. The Greek form of the paschal trikirion generally has a flat base allowing it to stand upright, and above this base is a vertical shaft terminating in three candleholders; sometimes this base has an icon of the Resurrection. The candleholders may be mounted at an angle so that the candles cross each other, as in a bishop's trikirion. Often the candles are tied together with ribbons at the point of intersection. Sometimes, among the Greeks, the priest simply holds a large single candle. Another form, more commonly seen in the Slavic churches, has the three candleholders attached to a large blessing crucifix with a vertical handle. This form cannot stand upright while the candles are lit. The candles may be white or each candle may be a different color and fresh flowers often decorate the candleholder.
The trikirion holds three candles, representing the Resurrection of Christ on the third day, and also representing the three persons of the Holy Trinity, all three of whom, according to Orthodox theology, were actively involved in the salvation of man.
Deacon's Candle.
As specified in the liturgical books the Pentecostarion and the Typicon, deacons also carry a candle throughout the paschal services. The deacon's candle is a single large candle which he carries in his left hand while reciting ektenias (litanies), while censing, and at other times when his hands are not otherwise occupied. It is also often decorated with fresh flowers. In the Slavic tradition, this candle may be red.

History of multitrack recording

Although General Electric researcher Charles A. Hoxie invented the pallophotophone (a machine that used 35mm film to optically record multiple tracks of sound) in ca. 1922, modern multitrack recording began in 1943 with the invention of stereo sound, which divided the recording head into two tracks.
Overview.
Multitrack recording is a process where the tape is divided into multiple tracks parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation. The first development in multitracking was stereo sound, which divided the recording head into two tracks. First developed by German audio engineers ca. 1943, 2-track recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently. (The first stereo recordings, on disks, had been made in the 1930s, but were never issued commercially.) Stereo (either true, two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the mid-1960s.
Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician Les Paul, who also helped design the famous electric guitar that bears his name. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer Mary Ford, were the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them.
Multitrack recording was immediately taken up in a limited way by Ampex, who soon produced a commercial 3-track recorder. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of Phil Spector's so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early Motown hits — were taped on Ampex 3-track recorders.
The next important development was 4-track recording. The advent of this improved system gave recording engineers and musicians vastly greater flexibility for recording and overdubbing, and 4-track was the studio standard for most of the later 1960s. Engineer Tom Dowd was among the first to utilize 4-track recording for popular music production while working for Atlantic Records during the 1950s. Many of the most famous recordings by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's Abbey Road Studios became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.
All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums "Revolver" and "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.
4-track tape also led to a related development, quadraphonic sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the surround sound technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.
In a professional audio setting today, such as a recording studio, audio engineers may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.
The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of magnetic tape as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on magnetic tape, then transferred to disc, with Bing Crosby leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.
Ampex's original 8-track recorder.
The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with 8-track tape endless-loop cassette players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project. It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics. It stood over tall and weighed . 8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of recording tracks with guard tracks that would fit on a recording tape, the widest tape available at the time. These are the track widths used in all professional analog multitrack recorders except 24-track recorders
The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to Les Paul for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by David Sarser. It became known as the "Octopus".
The second Ampex model 5258 8-track 3 was sold to Atlantic Records at Tom Dowd's insistence in early 1958. Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track recorder in their studio.
Multi-channel recorders.
Multi-track recording differs from overdubbing and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks. Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.
Multi-track recorders also differs from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks. The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.
The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. Elvis Presley was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as RCA's engineers were testing their new machines. Buddy Holly's last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.
Other early multi-track recorders.
Frank Zappa experimented in the early 1960s with a multi-track recorder built by recording engineer Paul Buff in his Pal Recording Studio in Rancho Cucamonga, California. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer Joe Meek produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic recorders. EMI house producer George Martin was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; Abbey Road Studios installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but The Beatles would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (1964) were made on two-track machines.
Impact on popular music.
The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.
The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP "Pet Sounds" relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. Brian Wilson pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then 'dubbed down' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.
3M introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format. It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London. Both Pete Townshend and John Lennon had 3M 8-track machines in their home project studios c. 1969-1970. Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967. One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by Scully Recording Instruments of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967. The debut album by Steppenwolf was recorded there and was released in January 1968.
Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used vari-speed (also called pitch shift) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the Automatic Double Tracking (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer Ken Townsend in 1966.
Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with the Music Machine (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and Pink Floyd collaborating with former Beatles recording engineer Norman "Hurricane" Smith, who produced their first albums.
The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's Advision Studios in early 1968. Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single "Dogs" by The Who and the album "My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows" by the band Tyrannosaurus Rex. Trident Studios obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward. It was during The Beatles' recording of their "White Album" sessions of late 1968 that EMI's Abbey Road Studios finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks. The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of the "White Album", the single "Hey Jude" and the later "Abbey Road".
Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in Australia, the largest local recording label, Festival Records, did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s;
Large Format Professional Analog Recorders.
In 1967 Ampex built its first prototype 16-track professional audio recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City. This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built for video recording. In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine. Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain. Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars. "Crimson And Clover" by Tommy James and the Shondells was released in November 1968 and was among the first 16-track recordings.
One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in New York City where it was used to record the second album by "Blood, Sweat & Tears" released in December 1968. The Grateful Dead released their first 16-track recordings "Aoxomoxoa" in June 1969 and "Live/Dead" in November 1969. TTG Studios in Los Angeles built its own 16-track machine in 1968. This was used on Frank Zappa's album "Hot Rats" released in October 1969. "Volunteers" by Jefferson Airplane was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.
Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines. Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the Van der Graaf Generator album "The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other", was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971. By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with Dolby noise reduction. Groups using Trident at this time also included Genesis and David Bowie as well as Queen who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums Queen II and "A Night at the Opera".
Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at Armstrong's Studios in Melbourne in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974. During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08 cm - 7.62 cm) wide. The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using hard disk drives instead of tape. Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.
Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by MCI in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though Otari made a 32 track 2" MX-80. A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format. Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available. New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.
Home Multitrack Systems.
In 1972 TEAC marketed their consumer 4-channel quadraphonic tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders. The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models. Both used ¼ inch tape. The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15 inches per second and used 10½ inch reels. The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.
The advent of the compact audio cassette (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the Tascam Portastudio which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as reel-to-reel machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making song demos. Bruce Springsteen's 1982 album "Nebraska" was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.
The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, effects are added where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).
Digital multitracking.
By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of pulse code modulation a.k.a. PCM digital recording, for high fidelity purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, Enrico Caruso. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up these scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in " real time " as the early computers were not very powerful or fast. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape. And then it had to be able to be played back, in real time. Though the actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. It was only the computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches that took the early computers of the day, quite some time to process.
By the late 1970s, 3M, introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1 inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an electronically controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". Unfortunately, the only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So 2 were cascaded/daisychained to create the necessary 16-bit word for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up till that time at 50,000 times per second a.k.a. 50 kHz. It was known to be the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video. The accepted world standard was created by Sony along with Philips. Then, Sony created a 24 track digital recorder where the Mitsubishi Corporation created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already come into being. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response,whereas the bit depth dictates the dynamic range and signal to noise ratios.
Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, who made digital drum machines and inexpensive analog audio mixers introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was christened the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape) based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based upon VHS videotape recorder technology. 8 separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record your favorite TV shows on your home video recorder. Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function remote control was also available. The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8 mm video format tapes. Those recorded 4, duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for overdubbing purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 & 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders of any kind started to fade into oblivion with the introduction of the Macintosh and Windows operating systems in the computers we use today. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US & Fairlight, from Australia.
Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as ADAT), or in some cases Minidiscs. 
Some of the leading providers of multitrackers was Tascam (hard drive or cassette based), Alesis (ADAT digital tape based), Roland/Boss (hard drive based), Fostex (hard drive based), Yamaha (hard drive based), and Korg.
A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.
Computer-based recording.
The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company. They formed the platform upon which Pro Tools was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of Cubase Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to MIDI sequencing capabilities. 
While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that today, an average home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, using inexpensive hardware and software. In 2012 the multitracking software GarageBand is included in all of Apple's new computers. This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.

The unit was reconfigured as a 182 man military police company, received other members of the 2d Battalion, 111th Field Artillery, and moved to Fort Dix for post mobilization training on 14 October 2004. 
Bravo Battery completed training 30 days ahead of schedule and arrived in Kuwait at Camp Virginia on 30 December 2004 and moved on to Camp Bucca in Iraq on 7 January 2005. Bravo sent two platoons, led by 1LT Michael Belforti, to Abu Ghraib. Two platoons and the battery headquarters remained at Camp Bucca. While at Camp Bucca, Bravo Battery operated Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4. The unit was also tasked with detainee transfers between Camp Bucca and northern bases. The platoons at Abu Ghraib also performed detainee operations and participated in the Battle of Abu Ghraib.
Bravo Battery was relieved in place and a battle hand off was completed on 1 December 2005 with the 116th FA, Florida National Guard, and the unit and its men redeployed to Camp Victory South in Kuwait. 
While in Iraq, Bravo Battery completed all detainee transfers without loss of life to any detainee or coalition forces. The unit was awarded the Air Force Meritorious Unit Award and has been recommended for the Army's Meritorious Unit Award. Fourteen members of Bravo Battery received the Bronze Star in Iraq and the unit completed over 80 theater wide detainee movements without incident. 
While in Iraq, the unit initially reported to LTC Tim Houser of the 105th MP Battalion and COL James Brown of the 18th Military Police Brigade. Later they reported to the 785th MP Battalion and the 43d Military Police Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Kevin R. McBride.
The unit was reflagged as an infantry unit upon coming home from Iraq. In April 2009 the regiment's 1st Battalion received 16 new M119 howitzers.

Wilhelm Philippe Schimper

Wilhelm Philippe Schimper (January 12, 1808 - March 20, 1880) was a French botanist born in Dossenheim-sur-Zinsel, Bas-Rhin, a town near the River Rhine in Alsace. He was the father of botanist Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper (1856-1901), and a cousin to naturalist Karl Friedrich Schimper (1803-1867) and botanist Georg Heinrich Wilhelm Schimper (1804-1878).
Following graduation from the University of Strasbourg, he worked as a curator at the Natural History Museum in Strasbourg, becoming director of the museum in 1839. The museum has a bust of Schimper at the top of the stairs.
From 1862 until 1879, he was a professor of geology and natural history at the University of Strasbourg.
Schimper's contributions to biology were primarily in the specialized fields of bryology (study of mosses) and paleobotany (study of plant fossils). He spent considerable time collecting botanical specimens in his travels throughout Europe. Among his writings was the six-volume "Bryologia Europaea", an epic work that was published between 1836 and 1855. It was co-written with Philipp Bruch (1781-1847), and it described every species of European moss known at the time.
Schimper also made significant contributions in geology. In 1874 he proposed a new scientific subdivision of geological time. He called the new epoch the "Paleocene Era", of which he based on paleobotanical findings from the Paris Basin.
A street bears his name in the Orangerie quarter of Strasbourg.

Gunnie

Gunnie is a term used in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) when referring to an armourer or aircraft tradesperson who loads or maintains aircraft ordnance, weapons, ejection seats, or any other device that contains explosive material. A second major function of their trade is Explosive Ordnance Demolition (EOD) the safe removal of unexploded bombs (UXB's) and the disposal/recovery of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's). Armourers are also responsible for the maintenance of all small arms used by the RAAF and generally run the maintenance workshops in all RAAF base armouries.
Alternative names include "Gun Plumber" and "Cracker Stacker"
Fiercely independent of the other aircraft trades, their motto has been "Without armament there is no need for an airforce" since Lord Trenchard uttered those famous words prior to World War I, although armourers didn't actually exist then. 
In the early nineties the armament mustering (along with other RAAF aircraft technical trades) was disbanded and all were rolled into two musterings (Avionics and Aircraft). Engine fitters and Airframe fitters became Aircraft Technicians while Instrument Fitters, Electrical Fitters and Radio Technicians became Avionics Technicians. The only mustering which could not fit neatly into either (due to the multi disciplinary nature of their work) the gunnies were given the choice of going to either mustering. Of the 400 or so in the whole of the RAAF only a handful elected to become Aircraft Technicians. The bulk of them were rolled into the Avionics Technician category. This was, at the time, considered a controversial decision given the highly specialised skills required to be an armourer. 
In the late 2000s the RAAF saw the error of its ways and re-established the Armament mustering with the first class graduating from RAAF Wagga Wagga in around 2008/09.

8th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment

The 8th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment, also known as the 37th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, was an infantry regiment of the northern Union Army during the American Civil War.
History.
The regiment was organized at Camp Wilkins near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with George S. Hays as colonel, S. D. Oliphant as lieutenant colonel, and J. B. Gardner as major. After training, it was sent to Washington, D.C. in late July, where it was assigned to the 1st Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves division, which became the Second Division, I Corps, Army of the Potomac. In May, it followed the rest of the division to the Peninsula, where the division became the Third Division, V Corps. On May 23, Gardner resigned and Captain S. M. Baily of company I was promoted to major in his place.
The regiment first came under fire at the Battle of Mechanicsville, where it lost nearly 100 men. When the rest of the army withdrew, Company F of the 8th Reserve, which had been sent forward as skirmishers, was not informed of the retreat and was left behind and captured by the Confederates. It also fought at the battles of Charles City Cross Roads and Glendale, losing over 200 additional men. After the regiment arrived at Harrison's Landing, both Hays and Oliphant resigned due to illness. Baily was promoted to colonel, Captain Lemon to lieutenant colonel, and Captain Robert E. Johnston to major.
The Pennsylvania Reserves Division was sent to the Army of Virginia in August as part of the III Corps. The 8th Reserve fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run, where it lost 52 out of 100 men, and again at South Mountain, where it lost another 54 men. At the Battle of Antietam, it fought on the Union right in the Cornfield, losing twelve killed and forty three wounded. It played a part in the Union breakthrough on the Confederate right at the Battle of Fredericksburg but lost heavily, especially in officers. Twenty-eight were killed, eighty-six wounded, and twenty-two captured. Baily, five captains, and five lieutenants were among the wounded. In February 1863, the regiment was ordered to Washington, where it was rested and brought back up to strength.
In the spring of 1864, the 8th Reserve, along with the rest of the division, was sent back to the army, as the Third Division, V Corps. It fought in the initial battles of the Overland Campaign, losing thirty three men at the Battle of the Wilderness and another nineteen at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. On May 17, it was relieved from duty since its term of service had expired. Those whose enlistments had not expired yet were transferred to the 191st Pennsylvania Infantry. The remainder of the regiment was sent back to Pittsburgh, where on May 24, it was mustered out of service.
Casualties.
The 8th Pennsylvania Reserves suffered 5 officers and 153 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded in battle, and 68 enlisted men dead from disease, for a total of 226 fatalities.

The Velvet Underground discography

The discography of the American rock band The Velvet Underground consists of five studio albums, five live albums, thirteen compilation albums, two box sets and seven singles.
The first line-up was formed in New York City consisting of Lou Reed on vocals and guitar, John Cale on several instruments, Sterling Morrison on guitar and Angus MacLise on percussion (later replaced by Maureen Tucker). On March 12, 1967 they released the debut album "The Velvet Underground & Nico" featuring German singer Nico. The album charted in the United States and originally peaked at number 171 on the "Billboard" album charts and produced two singles, "All Tomorrow's Parties" and "Sunday Morning", which did not chart anywhere. The album, produced by artist Andy Warhol, recharted in 2013 peaking at number 129.
VU released their second studio album "White Light/White Heat", which peaked at number 199 of the "Billboard" charts. The album was more experimental than their first album, featuring a loud and aggressive musical style. The album was produced without Warhol and Nico for the first time. On March 1969 they released the third studio album "The Velvet Underground". It did not chart upon its original release. However, when reissued in 1985 it peaked at number 197 in the "Billboard" chart. One year later, "Loaded" was released by Atlantic Records, the first time by a major label. Compared with VU first releases, Loaded was produced for the mainstream, without thematize sex and drugs. Although the songs were successful and popular in several music radios, neither singles, nor the album itself peaked in any music chart. It was the last album featuring Lou Reed, the founder of VU. After his departure, Doug Yule became the new frontman of The Velvet Underground and released together with Willie Alexander (keyboard), Walter Powers (bass guitar) and Maureen Tucker (drums) their fifth and last album, "Squeeze". After their break-off, several compilation albums were released, some of which feature outtakes from their previous studio sessions, most notably "VU", which peaked at number 85 on "Billboard" and 47 on the UK Albums Chart.

Peter and Donna Thomas

Peter and Donna Thomas are American papermakers, book artists, and authors.
They are co-authors of three commercially published books and produced over 100 limited edition books.
Early lives.
Peter R. Thomas was born January 5, 1954 in Los Angeles, California, United States. He studied the book arts with William Everson at Lime Kiln Press and graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a BA degree in Aesthetic Studies in 1978. Donna (Millar) Thomas was born March 31, 1957 in San Francisco, California. She graduated from the School of Expressive Arts at Sonoma State University in 1979.
Career.
From 1974-1989 Peter and Donna Thomas made and sold books and paper at the Living History Center’s Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California. In 1977 Peter and Donna Thomas established a private press in 1976 and have worked individually and collaboratively on creating books, making paper, letterpress printing and book binding. Their books have been shown in the United States and abroad and purchased for collections. In 1977 Peter and Donna Thomas founded the Good Book Press and in 1978 they printed their first book. It was their aim to create books in the tradition of the great private presses: limited editions, made of the finest materials and produced to the highest standards of quality. They spent the next ten years producing "fine press" books in both full size and miniature format, making the paper, printing, and binding the books themselves.
In the late 1980s Peter and Donna began working in new formats made possible by access to personal computer technology, exploring non-traditional book structures and shaped book objects, as both limited editions and one-of-a-kind books. In 1988 they reorganized under the imprint Peter and Donna Thomas: Santa Cruz. In 1992 they printed Good Books, a bibliography of their work, listing over fifty titles representing many authors and a wide range of subjects. They lectured and taught workshops internationally and published articles on papermaking and other aspects of the book arts.
Beginning in the 1990s, they focused their energy on documenting the history and techniques of hand papermaking as a contribution to the renaissance of the craft—through lectures, video productions about the ergonomics and techniques of traditional vat mill hand papermakers in Europe and a traveling exhibition based around "A Collection of Paper Samples Handmade in the USA" (1993). This book features individual papermakers’ statements about the papers they make, each printed letterpress on a sample of that person’s paper. "Paper from Plants" followed in 1999.
They co-authored "More Making Books by Hand" (2004), "The Muir Ramble Route" (2010), and "1000 Artists' Books" (2012).
In 2005 the Thomases published "The History of Papermaking in the Philippines". It began with Peter attending a one-day papermaking workshop in Santa Cruz, California taught by Nida Dumsang from the Philippines. Upon learning that there was no written history of papermaking in the Philippines, the idea of writing the first history of Filipino papermaking was born. He first visited the Philippines in February 1990 and gathered information over the following ten years. The book includes discussions of the pre-historic precursors to paper, including Philippine bark cloth. It contains a survey of the first printed books made in the Philippines and the paper they were printed on. It ends with a chronological history of both commercial and hand paper making in the Philippines up to 2000.
In 2012 they placed their collection of books and other materials on the subject of papermaking in the library at the University of Iowa.
Conceptual artwork.
In 2009 Peter and Donna Thomas began a conceptual art project. They created a traveling artists’ book that was structurally based on a British Reading "gypsy" wagon or vardo, and functioned as a home, a physical artwork and as a metaphoric embodiment of their ideas about the changing nature of the physical book in the digital age.
In 2010-2013, the Thomases took their sculptural artists' book on two cross country trips. As “Wandering Book Artists” they presented their traveling artists' book to both academic and community based audiences. While traveling, Peter Thomas began to theorize a typology for all physical artists' books. He classified all physical artists' books by structure, dividing them into four distinct categories: codex, folded, single-sheet, sculptural. Within this typology, the wagon was a sculptural artists’ book that contained the other three book types.
Their work has been exhibited and collected at universities, libraries, galleries, and museums throughout the world, including National Museum of Women in the Arts, New York Public Library, Scripps College, University of Virginia, Smith College, Yale University, Rutgers University, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Santa Cruz, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin, San Francisco Center for the Book, Victoria and Albert Museum, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Columbia University, Harvard University, Art Institute of Chicago, The Huntington Library, J. Paul Getty Museum, and Koninklijke Bibliotheek.
Education and advocacy.
In 2004 Quarry Books published their "More Making Books by Hand", providing instructions for constructing 12 different binding structures pioneered or developed by the Thomases developed. In 2010 Poetic Matrix Press published their "Muir Ramble Route", a guide book for walking from San Francisco, California to Yosemite National Park following the route of John Muir's first trip to Yosemite taken in 1868. In 2012 Quarry published their "1,000 Artists' Books: Exploring the Book as Art", which they co-authored with Sandra Solomay, grouping the images into the four structural categories Peter had earlier defined.
Awards and recognition.
In 1997 their binding was given special mention for innovative design in the Helen DeGolyer Triennial Exhibition. A Collection of Paper Samples Handmade in the USA was featured by the
Guild of Bookworkers as the set book for a national traveling show titled Paper Bound during 1997-1998. In 1997 the Miniature Book Society presented them with the Norman Forgue Award for promoting miniature books. In 1998 and 1999, one of their books was chosen for the Distinguished Book Award. In 2001 their binding of James Joyce's "Ulysses" was awarded the Judges Distinction for Innovation in the Helen DeGolyer Triennial for American Bookbinding. In 2001, the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History featured their work in a show titled "Art Undercover," and in 2010 in a show titled "It’s in the Pulp: The Art of Papermaking in Santa Cruz".

P25 ISSI

The Project 25 Inter RF Subsystem Interface (P25 ISSI) is a non-proprietary interface that enables RF subsystems (RFSSs) built by different manufacturers to be connected together into wide area networks so that users on different networks can talk with each other. The wide area network connections using the ISSI provide an extended coverage area for subscriber units (SUs) that are roaming. The extended coverage area is important for public safety first responders that provide assistance in other jurisdictions during an emergency. 
The ISSI supports the messaging, and procedures necessary to enable RFSSs to track and locate SUs, set up and teardown calls and transfer voice information to the SUs. The ISSI uses SIP and RTP protocols (standardized protocols) to provide the messaging between RFSSs. 
The modern Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system includes many features in addition to voice communication. Many features will not work acrosss systems connected using the ISSI. Whether a particular feature will work is determined by the systems and the particular ISSI implementation. 
Overview of P25 ISSI Documentation Suite.
The documentation suite which defines Scope One of the P25 ISSI consists of five standards. 
A brief overview of each of these standards is provided in the subsections that follow. 
ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services.
Scope One of the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services specifies the functional services of mobility management, call control and transmission control to provide trunked voice services for SU-to-SU and Group PTT calls involving multiple RFSSs. 
Mobility management uses the SIP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to perform registration, and affiliation across the ISSI for roaming SUs. 
Call control also uses the SIP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to set up and tear down a call, and manage RTP resources. 
Transmission control uses the RTP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to convey voice information, and manage voice call requests. 
The functional service responsibilities of an RFSS in a call are dependent upon the type of call and also on the role of the RFSS in a call. 
The specifications developed in the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services standard provide the fundamental starting point for the remaining standards in the ISSI suite of standards. 
ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services.
The ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services is based on the functional services and protocols defined in the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services standard. 
Scope One of the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services provides detailed measurement procedures to measure the ISSI Voice Service (IVS) Call Set-Up Delay (CSD) and IVS Message Transfer Delay (MTD) performance for SU-to-SU and Group calls. 
IVS-CSD and IVS-MTD performance parameters are used to evaluate the delay associated with successful packet transfers across RFSSs and across the IP backbone connections that link adjacent RFSSs. 
ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services.
The ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services is a companion standard to the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services standard. Scope One of the ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services provides agreed upon (by manufacturers and end users) average and maximum values for the IVS-CSD and IVS-MTD performance parameters described in the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services standard. 
ISSI Conformance Testing for Voice Services.
The ISSI Conformance testing for Voice Services defines a set of procedures to test the conformance between two RF Sub-systems using an IP backbone network. The procedures define reference-signaling sequences for SU-to-SU and Group call scenarios.
ISSI Interoperability Testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems.
The ISSI Interoperability testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems defines procedures to test the interoperability of SUs, and RFSSs from different manufacturers while performing trunked voice operations in configurations that use the ISSI. 
The trunked voice operations include registration of subscriber units, affiliation of subscriber units to the Subscriber Group Home, initiation of an SU-to-SU call, and initiation of a Group call.

Hillcrest High School (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)

Hillcrest High School is public high school near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA. The school is located in the unincorporated suburban area south of Tuscaloosa informally known as Taylorville. The school is administered by the Tuscaloosa County School System under the authority of the Alabama State Department of Education. The school currently enrolls around 1250 students in grades 9-12 and has a faculty of 75 teachers.
History.
The school was opened in 1981 as a grade 7-12 high school when grade 10-12 students from the south Tuscaloosa County area were transferred from Holt High School to the already existing Hillcrest Junior High School in anticipation of growth in the area. The building that housed the school had opened in 1968 as a black elementary school and was later converted to an integrated junior high school.
In 1991, the current campus was opened for grades 9-12 (the former campus added grade 6 from feeder elementary schools to become Hillcrest Middle School). An expansion wing was added in 2002.
Athletics.
Hillcrest participates in interscholastic athletics in Class 6A of the Alabama High School Athletic Association. The school's athletic squads are nicknamed the Patriots. The school's original nickname was the Red Devils but this nickname was changed after criticism and pressure from local church groups.
17 varsity sports are sponsored: 7 for boys (baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling), 6 for girls (women's basketball, golf, women's soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball) and 4 coed (cheerleading, cross country, track and field, and swimming).
In 2007, the baseball team won the 6A state championship. The following year the men's basketball team won the 6A state championship, which was Hillcrest's first 6A basketball championship. The 2010-2011 Varsity Basketball team conquered the state of Alabama again with another 6A state championship. Hillcrest defeated Murphy 48-46 on March 5, 2011 at the BJCC in Birmingham, Alabama to claim the 6A state title in basketball. This victory was Coach Scott Suttles' 400th career win in coaching 14 seasons as a high school basketball coach.
Fine arts.
In the 2008-2009 school year, the Hillcrest High School Wind Ensemble was accepted to the Music For All National Concert Band Festival in April 2009. The wind ensemble traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana and a program which included "Symphonic Metamorphoses on Themes of Weber" by Paul Hindemith, "Give Us This Day" by David Maslanka, and Joseph Schwanter's "...and the mountains rising nowhere". In the summer of 2009, the Hillcrest Wind Ensemble was accepted to perform in the 2009 Midwest Clinic in Chicago, Illinois, making Hillcrest High the third group to attend the Midwest Clinic from the state. In May 2011, the Hillcrest High School Wind Ensemble traveled to China and performed a series of concerts in several different cities.

Feldmarschall-Lieutenant and Commander of the Order of Maria Theresa. He played a major role in several battles against the French Army of Italy led by Napoleon during the French Revolutionary Wars.
Early years.
Petar Vid Gvozdanović was born in Žumberak (Sichelburg) in modern-day Croatia, and joined the "Varaždin" Grenz Hussar Regiment # 41 in 1752. He fought in the Seven Years' War. He distinguished himself in the War of the Bavarian Succession of 1778-9. He was promoted to colonel of the Slavonian Hussar regiment and decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. He fought during the Austro–Turkish War (1787–1791), becoming a General-Major and taking over the command of Alt Gradisca.
Wars with France.
During the War of the First Coalition Quosdanovich first commanded a brigade, then a division. At the crucial defeat at Fleurus he commanded the second column. On 24 September 1795, while leading a division, he scored an impressive victory over two French divisions at the Battle of Handschuhsheim (now a district of Heidelberg). In July 1796 he transferred to Italy, where he led a corps under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and József Alvinczi in four attempts to break the French Siege of Mantua. In the first, he lost the Battle of Lonato after a complicated series of maneuvers between 29 July and 4 August 1796. During the second relief, he participated in the Battle of Bassano on 8 September, but avoided being trapped in Mantua with Wurmser. In the third relief of Mantua he led the Friaul Corps in the Second Battle of Bassano and the Battle of Arcole. He led two brigades at the crucial Battle of Rivoli. He retired from the army in 1797 and died at Vienna on 13 August 1802.

The Mellomen

The Mellomen were a popular singing quartet active from the late 1940s through the mid-1970s. The group was founded by Thurl Ravenscroft and Max Smith in 1948. The Mellomen recorded under a variety of names, including Big John & The Buzzards, The Crackerjacks, The Lee Brothers, and The Ravenscroft Quartet. They were sometimes credited as The Mellowmen, The Mello Men, or The Mellow Men. They sang backup to some of the best-known artists of the day, including Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Arlo Guthrie, Frankie Laine, Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley, and Jo Stafford.
In addition to backing up popular singers, their solo work is part of many Disney films such as "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "Lady and the Tramp" and "The Jungle Book" as well as numerous animated shorts, including "Trick or Treat" (1952), "Pigs is Pigs" (1954), "Paul Bunyan" (1958), and "Noah's Ark" (1959). Their work for Disney also led to numerous television appearances, beginning with the "Disneyland" television show episode "Cavalcade of Songs", originally broadcast February 16, 1955. The Mellomen were also featured frequently on Disneyland Records, which released their 1957 album "Meet Me Down on Main Street". They also sang "The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh" theme and the introduction of "Zorro". Henry Calvin, who portrayed Sergeant Garcia on that television series, also sang and released a version of the "Zorro" theme song. (A longer version of the "Zorro Theme", recorded by the female trio, The Chordettes, became a Top Ten hit). This quartet performed singing voices for the elephants along with James Patrick O'Malley in "The Jungle Book".
They sang on several films with Elvis Presley, beginning with "It Happened at the World's Fair". Elvis wanted the Jordanaires to perform for the film but they were unavailable, so The Mellomen were called in to sing "One Broken Heart For Sale" and "Cotton Candy Land". The Mellomen later backed up Elvis on the title song for the film "Roustabout" as well as on most of the sound track for "Paradise, Hawaiian Style". In 1969, The Mellomen appeared with Elvis in the film "The Trouble with Girls", as a gospel group called The Bible Singers.

Lent Event

Lent Event is a community based Christian social justice movement begun in Australia in the early 2000s by Sarah White of Sydney. It began in the West Epping Uniting Church.
White perceived a need to help people in underdeveloped countries and, to raise money, proposed a variation on the Christian habit of giving up luxuries for Lent by asking people to donate the value of their forgone luxury. Lent Event is thus promoted as not just a fundraising venture, but a spiritual journey.
Lent Event is partnered with Uniting Church Overseas Aid (UCOA), an arm of the Uniting Church in Australia, and is supported by UnitingCare Australia.
In 2009, Lent Event will have programs helping needy people in:

Dakar Department

Dakar Department is one of the departments of Senegal, located in the Dakar Region. 
The "département" of Dakar is one of the four "départements" of the Dakar "région", which is one of the 11 "régions of Senegal". The Dakar "région" encompasses the city of Dakar and all its suburbs along the Cape Verde Peninsula. Its territory is thus roughly the same as the territory of the metropolitan area of Dakar. Since the administrative reforms of 1996, the "régions" of Senegal, which until then were merely local administrative structures of the central state, have been turned into full-fledged political units, with democratically elected regional councils, and regional presidents. They were given extensive powers, and manage economic development, transportation, or environmental protection issues at the regional level, thus coordinating the actions of the communes below them.
The "département" of Dakar is divided into four arrondissements: Almadies, Grand Dakar, Parcelles Assainies (which literally means "drained lots"; this is the most populous arrondissement of Dakar), and Plateau/Gorée (downtown Dakar). These arrondissements are quite different from the arrondissements of Paris, being merely local administrative structures of the central state, like the Senegalese "départements", and are thus more comparable to French departmental arrondissements.
In 1996, a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, whose population approached 1 million inhabitants, was deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, and so on August 30, 1996 Dakar was divided into 19 "communes d'arrondissement".
These "communes d'arrondissement" were given extensive powers, and are very much like regular communes. They have more powers than the arrondissements of Paris, and are more akin to the London boroughs. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19 "communes d'arrondissement", and it coordinates the activities of the "communes d'arrondissement", much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs.
The 19 "communes d'arrondissement" belong to either of the four arrondissements of Dakar, and the "sous-préfet" of each arrondissement is in charge of controlling the activities of the "communes d'arrondissement" in his arrondissement.
Dakar Department includes the "commune d'arrondissement" of Dakar-Plateau (34,626 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gorée, is the historical heart of the city, and most ministries and public administrations are located there. The densest and most populous "commune d'arrondissement" is Médina (136,697 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gorée. The smallest one is the "commune d'arrondissement" of Île de Gorée (1,034 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of
Plateau/Gorée.

1976–77 British Home Championship

The 1976-77 British Home Championship exemplified a new era in Home Nations football during its final game, when jubilant Scottish fans invaded the pitch at Wembley Stadium following their team's surprise victory. Unlike a similar occasion in the 1967 British Home Championship, family football had given way to hooliganism and extensive damage was done to the stadium and riots in London throughout the night followed the occasion. It was events like this which eventually led to the tournament's cancellation in 1984. 
The tournament itself was an open affair, with an opening victory for England cancelled out by a Scottish win over Northern Ireland and English defeat to Wales. The Welsh stood a good chance of winning the tournament outright for the first time since 1937, but could not beat the Irish in their final match, and ended up in a rare second place position. The Scots and English thus faced each other in the final match knowing the winner would take the trophy, the Scots achieving a victory on England's home ground to take the trophy for the second year in a row and demonstrate their dominance in British football. The match was followed by a mass pitch invasion by Scottish supporters.

Hugh Buggy

Edward Hugh Buggy (9 June 1896 – 18 June 1974) was a leading journalist well known as an Australian rules football writer covering the Victorian Football League (later renamed to Australian Football League).
Born at Seymour, Victoria in 1896, Buggy attended school there before moving to Melbourne with his mother after the death of his father. He commenced his journalism career at the "South Melbourne Record", and joined the Melbourne "Argus" in 1917. He studied for the diploma of journalism at the university in 1921.
Journalist.
Although he was deputy news editor of the "Sydney Sun" for five years, Buggy preferred the role of reporter. He was closely involved in reporting many of the dramatic events of his time such as the fatal shoot-out between Squizzy Taylor and 'Snowy' Cutmore in 1927 and the arrival in Brisbane of Kingsford-Smith and the Southern Cross in 1928. In 1932, following the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, he was the only reporter to gain an interview with Captain Francis de Groot.
Buggy was much travelled during his journalism career, working for several Sydney and Melbourne based newspapers. Leaving the "Argus" during 1923, Buggy worked for the new "Melbourne Evening Sun" in 1923-25, then moved to the "Sydney Sun" in 1925-27, 1928–31 and 1937–42, the "Sun News-Pictorial" in 1927 and the Melbourne "Herald" in 1932-37. In 1950 he rejoined the "Argus", and became its chief football-writer in 1951. After the "Argus" ceased publication in 1957, he worked for various Melbourne suburban newspapers and contributed to the Catholic newspaper, the "Advocate", and as chief court reporter for "The Truth" for three years.
Censor.
During World War II he was chief operational censor at General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in 1942-46. From 1946 to 1950 he was an editor with Radio Australia.
Author.
He ghost wrote for Kingsford-Smith and C. T. P. Ulm the "Story of the Southern Cross Trans-Pacific Flight" in 1928, and for Joe Maxwell V.C., M.C. & Bar, D.C.M the World War One recounting of his experiences "Hells Bells and Mademoiselles" in 1932, then in 1946 he wrote "Pacific Victory".
In 1977 his book "The Real John Wren" was published.
Sport journalism.
Buggy was also a highly respected writer on sport, particularly Australian rules football, although he covered a variety of sports. He had a flair for the picturesque sporting phrase: he was widely believed to have coined the term 'bodyline' during the 1932/33 Ashes Test cricket series, but this claim was never settled conclusively.[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070480b.htm]
He became chief football-writer at the "Argus" in 1951 until it ceased publication in 1957.
Death.
Buggy married twice, but both marriages ended in divorce and were childless. He died following a heart seizure on 18 June 1974 and was buried in Seymour.
Hall of Fame.
Buggy was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, with his citation reading:

Gibson Dove

The Gibson Dove is a flattop Steel-string acoustic guitar made by Gibson Guitar Corporation. First made in 1962 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, it was Gibson's second square-shouldered dreadnought (based on the Martin D-style dreadnought), after the introduction of the Gibson Hummingbird in 1960.
Both guitars have solid spruce tops and engraved pickguards. The Dove has solid maple back and sides instead of the solid mahogany used for the Hummingbird, and the Dove has a longer scale length (25.5" vs 24.75"). The Dove's longer scale length and maple back and sides make it a louder, brighter guitar than the Hummingbird. 
The double parallelogram fingerboard inlays, the two doves on the bridge, and the dove on the pick-guard are mother of pearl. The Dove has factory installed LR Baggs active electronics powered by a 9-volt battery. The original Doves had Gibson's tune-o-matic bridge. While the tune-o-matic bridge seemed like a technological improvement at the time, the metal bridge had negative effects on tone and volume. 
The Scotty Moore web site has photos of several different Dove bridge types; tune-o-matic, adjustable, and fixed. In 1968 the internal bracing of the Dove was made heavier; while this made a sturdier guitar that was less likely to be returned to Gibson for warranty work, the volume of the guitar was reduced and the tone suffered. 
In 1985 Gibson's new owners began to address the quality issues that were affecting the company's products and reputation. By 1992 production of Gibson acoustic guitars was shifted to Bozeman, Montana. While until recently Gibson said the Dove was the "Legendary 1962 model with all the original details!", in 2007 the Dove became one of Gibson's Modern Classics. 
Among the features of the Modern Classics are "Big Sky" radiused fingerboard edge, bone nut, and Tusq saddle. Since it's been stated that“'The Modern Classics are designed for the contemporary player...we are convinced these are also the most playable acoustic guitars available today'...have The industry’s lowest action and finest playability ”, 
these new model Doves will be easier to play but have a bit less volume and projection than the older models (although the improved nut and saddle materials may offset that somewhat). For a number of years the Dove has been a Custom Shop instrument available in special limited runs. 
Special models include the Dove Performer (with a Fishman Prefix T Pickup), the Dove Quilt (limited to 20 made with quilted maple back and sides), the Doves in Flight (with extra ornaments), and the Elvis Presley Dove, based on the 1969 custom Dove that Elvis used in the early 1970s, For those seeking the Ebony finish of the Elvis Dove, the Dove Performer has a similar look. 
Epiphone versions.
Epiphone also made a Dove. It is available in natural and black, and at one time cherry, and was manufactured in China. Epiphone reintroduced their version of Gibson's Dove in 2012. Called the Dove Pro, it features a solid spruce top (instead of a laminate top), a maple body & neck, Fishman Sonitone/Sonicore pickup system, and a violinburst finish. The Dove Pros are made in Indonesia.

Craig McEwan (boxer)

Craig McEwan (born 13 April 1982) is a Scottish boxer raised in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, Scotland. He began attending boxing classes at Clovenstone Amateur Boxing Club, aged seven, coached by his father Rab. McEwan turned professional in 2006 and is currently fighting at middleweight. He holds a career record of 21 wins with 10 by way of knockout, and four losses.
Amateur career.
McEwan had his first competitive bout aged eleven. During his teenage years McEwan developed into one of Scotland's top amateur boxers. In his thirteen years as an amateur boxer he fought three hundred and seventy-six matches, won ten gold medals in international tournaments, and regularly captained the Scottish International Team. On several occasions he was crowned Scottish champion at both junior and senior level, as well as being European Junior Champion and Senior British & Irish Four Nations Champion. He has twice represented Scotland in the Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze medal in 2002. In 2005, McEwan broke Scotland's amateur boxing record by winning three gold medals at the international level.
Professional career.
McEwan is a highly touted prospect and his talent and skills were enough to be signed by promoter Oscar De La Hoya as Golden Boy Promotions' first Scottish fighter. McEwan previously fought out of The Wild Card gym in Hollywood, where he was trained by world renowned trainer Freddie Roach.
In a fight on March 12, 2011 against Irish boxer Andy Lee billed "The Celtic War", McEwan, after an almost perfect boxing performance, was convincingly knocked out in the 10th round by a left hook. Two of the fight's judges had the match scored even while one had McEwan with a slight edge.
On November 5, 2011, McEwan was knocked out by Peter Quillin in the sixth round of their fight in Cancún, Mexico. McEwan protested the decision, claiming referee Manolo Alcocer stopped the fight too early.
In early 2012 his contract was not renewed by Golden Boy and he returned to the UK.
On November 3, 2012, McEwan suffered the third loss of his professional career when he lost a split decision in the quarter final of a prizefighter tournament to a decorated Nigerian amateur boxing champion who went by the name of Larry Ekundayo (5-0). Ekundayo went on to win the tournament.
In April 2013 he signed a four-fight deal with New York based promoter, Lou DiBella.
In December 2013 he lost a Unanimous Decision to American Dashon Johnson in New York. McEwan cited lack of support from his promoter & proper preparation following an extended absence from the ring, even struggling to organise sparring partners prior to the fight.

John de Winchester

John de Winchester (died 1460) was a 15th-century English cleric who distinguished himself as an administrator and bishop in Scotland. Winchester was a student of canon law from 1418, graduating with a bachelorate in 1421.
He appears to have entered Scotland in 1424 after King James I of Scotland returned from his eighteen-year period as a hostage in England; it is notable and certainly relevant that James' queen, Joan Beaufort, was the niece of Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester. 
After entering Scotland, James was chaplain and secretary to the king, who bestowed on Winchester Alyth in Angus and helped him become Chancellor of Dunkeld. Winchester was out of Scotland in 1432, attending the Council of Basel on behalf of King James; he was also Clerk of the Register in this year.
He was Dean of Aberdeen in 1431, and was provided as Treasurer of the diocese of Glasgow sometime in 1431, but was not able to take up this position. However, he did become Provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden between 1434 and 1436. 
Winchester's services to the king were rewarded further in November 1435 when, after the death of Columba de Dunbar, he was elected as Bishop of Moray. He was not, however, consecrated until 9 May 1437, a few months after the death of King James; his consecration took place at Cambuskenneth Abbey.
After becoming bishop, Winchester continued in the service of Queen Joan through the minority of James II of Scotland. James II later rewarded WInchester by creating Spynie as a burgh of Barony on 24 July 1451; after James II murdered the ex-regent William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas in 1452, Spynie's status was raised to that of burgh of regality.
Bishop Winchester died April, 1460, probably at Spynie Castle and was buried in St Mary's Aisle within Elgin Cathedral.

LDL-receptor-related protein-associated protein

Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 also known as LRPAP1 or RAP is a chaperone protein which in humans is encoded by the LRPAP1 gene.
Function.
LRPAP1 is involved with trafficking of certain members of the LDL receptor family including LRP1 and LRP2. It is a glycoprotein that binds to the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor, as well as to other members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. It acts to inhibit the binding of all know ligands for these receptors, and may prevent receptor aggregation and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby acting as a molecular chaperone. It may be under the regulatory control of calmodulin, since it is able to bind calmodulin and be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent kinase II.
Interactions.
LDL-receptor-related protein-associated protein has been shown to interact with LRP2.

Fimbria (bacteriology)

In bacteriology, a fimbria [(plural fimbriae); also referred to as "attachment pili" by some scientists] is an appendage composed of curlin proteins that can be found on many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria that is thinner and shorter than a flagellum. This appendage ranges from 3-10 nanometers in diameter and can be up to several micrometers long. Fimbriae are used by bacteria to adhere to one another and to adhere to animal cells and some inanimate objects. A bacterium can have as many as 1,000 fimbriae. Fimbriae are only visible with the use of an electron microscope. They may be straight or flexible.
Fimbriae carry adhesins which attach them to the substratum (E.coli uses them to attach to mannose receptors) so that the bacteria can withstand shear forces and obtain nutrients.
Some aerobic bacteria form a thin layer at the surface of a broth culture. This layer, called a pellicle, consists of many aerobic bacteria that adhere to the surface by their fimbriae or "attachment pili". Thus, fimbriae allow the aerobic bacteria to remain on the broth, from which they take nutrients, while they congregate near the air.
Virulence.
Fimbriae are one of the primary mechanisms of virulence for "E. coli", "Bordetella pertussis", "Staphylococcus" and "Streptococcus" bacteria. Their presence greatly enhances the bacteria's ability to attach to the host and cause disease.

<doc id="9704012" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9704012" title="Tropical cyclone basins">
Tropical cyclone basins

Traditionally, areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).
__TOC__
North Atlantic Ocean.
This region includes the North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year, ranging from one to over twenty-five per year. Most Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30. The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports, watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres for tropical cyclones as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. On average, 11 named storms (of tropical storm or higher strength) occur each season, with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes. The climatological peak of activity is around September 10 each season.
The United States Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and Bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin. Venezuela, the 4 provinces of Atlantic Canada, and Atlantic Macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected. Many of the more intense Atlantic storms are Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which form off the west coast of Africa near the Cape Verde islands. Occasionally, a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western Europe, including Hurricane Gordon, which spread high winds across Spain and the British Isles in September 2006. Hurricane Vince, which made landfall on the southwestern coast of Spain as a tropical depression in October 2005, is the only known system to impact mainland Europe as a tropical cyclone.
Northeast Pacific Ocean.
The Northeastern Pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area. The hurricane season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region. In the 1971–2005 period, there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes (storms of Category 3 intensity or greater) annually in the basin.
Storms that form here often affect western Mexico, and less commonly the Continental United States (in particular California), or northern Central America. No hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in California; however, historical records from 1858 speak of a storm that brought San Diego winds over 75 mph/65 kts (marginal hurricane force), though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall. Tropical storms in 1939, 1976 and 1997 brought gale-force winds to California.
The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (AOR) begins at the boundary with the National Hurricane Center' AOR (at 140 °W), and ends at the International Date Line, where the Northwestern Pacific begins. The hurricane season in the North Central Pacific runs annually from June 1 to November 30; The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility. The CPHC previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the Joint Hurricane Warning Center; today it is called the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
Central Pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually. As there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.
Northwestern Pacific Ocean.
The Northwest Pacific Ocean is the most active basin on the planet. Annually, an average of 25.7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater; also, an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968–1989 period. The basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the International Date Line, including the South China Sea. The basin sees activity year-round; however, tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March.
Tropical storms in this region often affect China, Hong Kong, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, plus numerous Oceanian islands such as Guam, the Northern Marianas and Palau. Sometimes, tropical storms in this region affect Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and even Singapore. This is by far the most active basin, accounting for one-third of all tropical cyclone activity. The coast of China sees the most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide. The Philippines archipelago receives an average of 6-7 tropical cyclone landfalls per year.
North Indian Ocean.
This basin is divided into two areas: the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, with the Bay of Bengal dominating (5 to 6 times more activity). Still, this basin is the most inactive worldwide, with only 4 to 6 storms per year. This basin's season has a double peak: one in April and May, before the onset of the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. Although it is an inactive basin, the deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.
South-West Indian Ocean.
The South-West Indian Ocean is currently located within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa's east coast and 90°E and is primarily monitored by the Meteo France's La Reunion RSMC, while the Mauritian, Australian Indonesian, and Madagascan weather services also monitor parts of it. Until the start of the 1985-86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80°E, with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90E considered to be a part of the Australian region. On average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms, while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon. The tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various Indian Ocean island nations and or various countries along Africa's east coast.
Australian region.
Through the middle of 1985, this basin extended westward to 80E. Since then, its western boundary has been 90E. Tropical activity in this region affects Australia and Indonesia. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the most frequently hit portion of Australia is between Exmouth and Broome in Western Australia. The basin sees an average of about seven cyclones each year, although more can form or come in from other basins, like the South Pacific. The tropical cyclone Cyclone Vance in 1999 produced the highest recorded speed winds in an Australian town or city at around 267 km/h.
South Pacific Ocean.
The South Pacific Ocean basin starts at 160°E and extends to 120°W with cyclones developing in it officially monitored by Fiji and New Zealand's Meteorological Services. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to the west of the dateline, though during El Nino's cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about 1/2 of them becoming severe tropical cyclones.
Other areas.
South Atlantic Ocean.
Cyclones form rarely or never in other tropical ocean areas, which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins. Tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the South Atlantic, and the only full-blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004's Cyclone Catarina, which made landfall in Brazil, 2010's Tropical Storm Anita, which formed off the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, and 2011's Subtropical Storm Arani, which formed off Brazil.
Mediterranean Sea.
On rare occasions, tropical-like systems, that can reach the intensity of hurricanes, occur over the Mediterranean Sea. Such a phenomenon is called a Medicane (mediterranean-hurricane). Although the geographical dimensions of tropical oceans and the Mediterranean Sea are clearly different, the precursor mechanisms of these perturbations, based on the air-sea thermodynamic imbalance, are similar. Their origins are typically non-tropical, and develop over open waters under strong, initially cold-core cyclones, similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin, like Karl (1980), Vince (2005), Grace (2009) or Chris (2012). Sea surface temperatures in late-August and early-September are quite high over the basin (+24/+28°C), though research indicates water temperatures of 20 °C/68 °F are normally required for development.
Meteorological literature document that such systems occurred in September 1947, September 1969, January 1982, September 1983, January 1995, October 1996, September 2006, and November 2011. The 1995 system developed a well-defined eye, and a ship recorded 85 mph (140 km/h) winds, along with an atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar. Although it had the structure of a tropical cyclone, it occurred over water temperatures, suggesting it could have been a polar low.
