Karakai told the BBC that he thinks his character is suited to both Stephanie (Carla Bonner) and Felicity (Holly Valance) and that Marc wants both of them. However, he picked Felicity as the girl for Marc and said "Probably because he's immature, he just wants a younger girl." Karakai said that he is nothing like his character and that he would never do what Marc did to anybody. He added that he has not had any bad reactions from the public over his storyline. Of the moment when Steph realises that Marc is having an affair with her sister Felicity, "The Age" said the reveal "was effected by a single look between Marc, at the altar but unable to complete his vows, and Felicity, a bridesmaid. Steph knew the import of that glance in a second and with it, her heart, and viewers' hearts, shattered. It was Steph's wordless realisation, her moment of clarity, that made us weep." In May 2002, Karakai, Valance and Blair McDonough went to Sydney to film a number of scenes. Felicity runs away to the city and Marc and Stuart Parker follow her. Stuart tries to persuade them both to return home. Karakai and Valance filmed scenes together on a water taxi.

When she finally meets Marc, she is shocked as she had begun to develop feelings for him. Marc and Felicity end up kissing and Felicity tries to avoid Marc, so she does not ruin Steph's happiness.
Marc realises that his feelings for Felicity are stronger than his feelings for Steph. Weeks before the wedding, Felicity tells Marc that she is in love with him. Felicity decides to leave, but her mother, Lyn (Janet Andrewartha) convinces her to stay for the wedding. Steph announces that she is pregnant and Marc decides that he has no choice but to stand by her. He rejects Felicity, but shortly before the ceremony, he and Steph learn that the pregnancy is a false alarm. Marc hesitates during the wedding and when he glances in Felicity's direction, Steph realises that he loves her sister. Marc then tells her that he cannot marry her.

The evidence is against her as she offered to help Karl get some jewellery valued days before and Connor comes forward with what he saw. Ruby is arrested, but it emerges that Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety) was the culprit and everyone apologises to Ruby. When Ruby shows Harold a statue in the window of a shop that she had put by and was gradually buying back, Harold buys it for her. Ruby is moved by the gesture, but she realises that she will not be able to stand on her own two feet with Harold there and she decides to go and stay with Derek. She says a tearful goodbye to Harold.
The BBC said Ruby's most notable moment was "organising to have Harold's house robbed to fund her gambling habit."
Daniel Clohesy.
Daniel Clohesy, played by Thomas Blackburne, is a friend of Boyd Hoyland. He made his first on-screen appearance on 11 November 2002. Daniel's domestic abuse storyline formed part of a campaign by the BBC called "Hitting Home", which aimed to "break the taboos and myths surrounding domestic violence."
In February 2003, the BBC began a season of programmes on television, radio and online about the subject of domestic violence. The BBC Press Office explained "Hitting Home features in primetime and daytime BBC ONE programming, storylines in "Casualty" and "Neighbours", a powerful intimate documentary, "Dangerous Love: Tales of Domestic Violence", an "Eastenders" special and a "Panorama" report." "Neighbours" used the character of Daniel to form a storyline about violence within the family. Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) discovers that Daniel is being beaten by his father when he notices a bruise on his face. Daniel later leaves his home and comes to Boyd asking for help. The head of BBC Lifeskills, Seetha Kumar, said "The storyline in "Neighbours" is more about the support friends can provide."
Daniel is a friend of Boyd Hoyland from Erinsborough High. They were almost enemies when Daniel started winding Boyd up about his new girlfriend, Heather Green (Megan Harrington). However, Daniel is just jealous of Boyd's luck with the girls and when he asks Boyd for advice, they become friends. Heather dumps Boyd when she hears that he has been called the school stud, but Daniel decides to help Boyd win her back. They attempt to steal a sign from Heather Street in a bid to impress her. Boyd notices a bruise on Daniel's face and he claims that some older boys had attacked him. When Boyd and Daniel see them, they turn around and run away with the stolen street sign. Max Hoyland (Stephen Lovatt) finds out about the stolen sign and tells the boys to put it back. He then arranges for a friend to make one for them. Boyd becomes suspicious about the bruise on Daniel's face and Daniel admits that his father had hit him. Boyd is concerned, but does not know what to do. One night, Daniel turns up at Boyd's home looking for a place to stay for the night. Max goes with Daniel to pick up some things from his house and he tells Daniel's father, Edward (Terry Brittingham), what is happening. He also mentions that he should get some help. Daniel and Boyd spy on the Scully bathroom and when Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) catches them, they tell him they are bird-watching and Harold shows them his ornithology books. Max later grounds them. Boyd's sister, Summer (Marisa Siketa) likes Daniel and she is devastated when he returns home. Edward was attending counselling sessions and tried to change his ways. Boyd and Daniel spread a rumour that Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne) had slept with Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Daniel teases Boyd about his relationship with Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), which does not impress her, but Boyd decides that it is time they took their relationship further.
Lori Lee.
Lori Lee, played by Michelle Ang, made her first on-screen appearance on 20 November 2002. Ang was nineteen when she joined the cast of "Neighbours" as Lori and she had to move to Melbourne for filming. Ang became one of the first Asian actors to receive a prominent role in the show. Lori is described as being a "rebel."
Taj Coppin.
Taj Coppin, played by Jaime Robbie Reyne, made his first on-screen appearance on 27 November 2002. Taj is the brother of Tahnee Coppin and he became in involved in a love quadrangle. Reyne left "Neighbours" in 2004 and he said "I don't regret doing "Neighbours", but the main reason I did leave was because everyone had warned me I'd be known as that character for life."
Taj attends Erinsborough High and becomes the captain of the football team. He catches Nina Tucker's (Delta Goodrem) attention after she begins receiving mysterious text messages. When Nina receives a text message minutes after seeing Taj, she confronts him. However, Taj denies sending the messages. He and Nina decide to go out on a date though. When Nina gets a message asking to meet her at the rotunda, Taj tells her that he will go with her and hide in the bushes. Nina is surprised to see Taj with a picnic hamper and he reveals that he did send the messages. They go away to the beach and Nina asks if he has a girlfriend, because Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie) told her that he did. Taj explains that he was dating a girl called Allie, but she moved away. Taj gets involved in the community play building props and fails to notice the romantic tension between Nina and Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). Allie (Jessica Monaghan) comes to stay with Taj's family for a while, which worries Nina. However, she meets Allie and realises that she has nothing to worry about and Taj tells Allie that they will always be friends. Taj then tells Jack that he really loves Nina.
Taj believes his relationship with Nina is going well and he buys her a ring, but he is surprised when she does not accept it. Taj is shocked when Nina suddenly breaks up with him. He relies on Lori Lee (Michelle Ang) for support. While they are messing around at the local swimming pool, Lori slips and hits her head, resulting in her becoming paralysed. Taj feels guilty about the incident and begins to avoid his old friends. Taj goes to the pub with a fake ID, but is caught by student teacher Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Libby suggests that Taj get some counselling. He starts to talk to Nina again and gets a job at Lassiter's. Taj makes up with Lori and Jack, who he starts coaching the junior girls soccer team with. Taj turns to Libby for some tutoring as his grades had slipped. They spend a lot of time together and when Libby gets some teaching work at Erinsborough High, it becomes clear that Taj sees her more than just a tutor. While Taj and Libby are editing his media work, Taj leans over and kisses her. Libby makes it clear that their relationship could never be more than teacher and student, but Taj does not listen.
On his 18th birthday, he drags Jack to a club after discovering Libby would be there. Taj walks Libby home and she kisses him. They later sleep together. Taj is upset when Libby avoids him and when the news about them is spread around Erinsborough, Libby leaves town. Taj goes to the country to see Libby, but when he sees her playing with her son, he realises that he needs to move on. Taj starts dating Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk), but when she admits that she slept with Jack, Taj ends things between them. He begins listening to Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough) and attending a group called Life Mechanics. After a while he starts to question the ideas behind Life Mechanics and walks out on a meeting. He tries to convince Stuart to leave the group too and Stuart throws him out of Number 30, where he had been staying since his parents moved away. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) offers him a room at the Kennedy house. Taj and Jack decide to get copies of exam papers, but they tell each other that they did not use them. Weeks later, the "Erinsborough News" reports on the stolen exam papers and when Taj scores in the top three percent of the school, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) becomes suspicious. Toadie confronts Taj, who admits that he cheated. He then withdraws from the film school that he had got into. When film-maker Sam Tinselman (Sylvia Petrice) comes to town, Toadie and Stuart make her watch Taj's film and Sam gives him a job as a runner on her next film. Taj then leaves Erinsborough.
The BBC said Taj's most notable moment was "His reaction to the news that Jack and Nina were having an affair." Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture said Taj was a character nobody cared about.

Chepni people

The Chepni were an ancient Turkic "boy" or "oymak" (clan).
In the "legend of Oghuz Qaghan", the Chepni was stated as one of the clans of the tribe of "G√∂k Han" that consists of Pecheneg ("Be√ßenek "), Bayandur ("Bayƒ±ndƒ±r "), Chavuldur ("√áavuldur" ) and Chepni, a part of "√ú√ß-Oklar" branch of Oghuz Turks. According to Mahmud al-Kashgari's "Diwan Lugat at-Turk " (Arabic: ÿØŸäŸàÿßŸÜ ŸÑÿ∫ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ŸÉ, "Compendium of Turkic Dialects"), it was 21st tribe of the 22 tribes.
Their religion was Islam (Sunni and Alevi). According to a Turkish historian, Faruk S√ºmer, the first murids of Hajji Bektash may be the Chepni residents of Suluca Kara √úy√ºk (now a town of Nev≈üehir Province in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey) and some Turkish historians claim that Hajj Bektash may be of Chepni origin. Chepni people had an important role in the conquest of Trebizond during the 15th century whereas they had already started to conquer the provinces of Samsun and Sinop in 13th centuries. Most of Turkish people who settle in Trabzon, Giresun, Ordu and Samsun descend from Chepni people.

Hsromega

The developmentally active and heat shock inducible hsromega gene in "Drosophila" produces multiple long non-coding RNA transcripts. This gene is transcriptionally active in almost all cell types of "Drosophila" and is the most actively induced following heat shock. A unique feature of the hsromega gene, which led to discovery of the 93D puff in 1970, is its singular inducibility with benzamide and a variety of other amides.
The multiple transcripts of this gene include a nuclear >10kb long nuclear transcript, hsromega-n, and a 1.9kb nuclear transcript which after splicing produces a 1.2kb cytoplasmic transcript. The >10kb nuclear hsromega-n transcript organizes the nucleoplasmic omega speckles with which heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding proteins (hnRNPs) and certain other proteins co-localize. The omega speckles are suggested to act as storage sites for hnRNPs etc. which are not actively engaged at a given time.
The genomic architecture of this gene and hnRNP-binding properties of its large nuclear transcript are conserved in different species although the primary base sequence has diverged rapidly. Heat shock causes the omega speckles to disappear and all the omega speckle associated proteins and the hsrœâ-n transcript to accumulate at the 93D locus. The hsrœâ-n transcript directly or indirectly affects the localization/stability/activity of a variety of proteins including hnRNPs, Sxl, Hsp83, cAMP response element binding binding protein (CBP), "Drosophila" inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1), JNK-signalling members, proteasome constituents, lamin C, ISWI, HP1 and poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase. In view of the interactions of this large nuclear non-coding RNA with diverse regulatory proteins, it appears to act as a hub that integrates multiple regulatory networks in cell.

Dash (spaniel)

Dash (1830‚Äì1840) was a King Charles spaniel owned by Queen Victoria. Victoria's biographer Elizabeth Longford, called him "the Queen's closest childhood companion", and in the words of the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", he "was the first in a long line of beloved little dogs".
He was given to Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, on 14 January 1833 by Sir John Conroy, the Comptroller of the Duchess's household. By the end of April 1833, he had become Victoria's companion, and by Christmas that year she was doting on him, giving him a set of rubber balls and two pieces of gingerbread as presents. In return, the dog was loyal to Victoria; on one occasion she went sailing on a yacht, and Dash leapt from the coastline into the sea and swam after her.
Victoria, who was 13 when given Dash, had few if any childhood friends as she was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called "Kensington System", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and Conroy. The only girl of a similar age with whom she had regular contact was Conroy's youngest daughter, Victoire, but they seemed to have had only a formal acquaintanceship. In her diary, Victoria refers to Victoire as "Miss Conroy" but the dog is showered with endearments: "dear sweet little Dash" and "dear Dashy".
In November 1834, Victoria and her mother took a holiday at St Leonards-on-Sea. They, with Dash, Lady Flora Hastings and Baroness Louise Lehzen, were driving in a landau drawn by two horses when the horses got caught in the traces and fell. With the horses struggling on the ground, there was a danger the carriage would overturn, injuring the women. Victoria scrambled out with Dash in her arms, and, as she recalled, "ran on with him in my arms calling Mama to follow, Lehzen and Lady Flora followed us also." While two passing gentleman cut the horses free, the ladies, and Dash, took shelter behind a wall.
Dash remained with Victoria after her accession as queen in 1837. Following her coronation on 28 June 1838, Victoria returned to Buckingham Palace and ran up to her rooms to give Dash his usual bath.
Dash died at the end of 1840, and was buried at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park. A marble effigy was erected over the grave, bearing the inscription:

ECPAT

ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) is a non-governmental organization and the only global network of civil society organizations exclusively dedicated to ending the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC). ECPAT undertakes essential work to ensure the protection of children worldwide. It contributes substantially to the prevention and the fight against all forms of sexual exploitation. It focuses on ending four main manifestations of CSEC: child pornography (child sex abuse materials), the exploitation of children in prostitution, the trafficking of children for sexual purposes and the sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism. 
The ECPAT International network consists of a Secretariat, together with 81 national member organisations in 74 countries. The Bangkok based International Secretariat, provides technical support to member groups and coordinates research, advocacy and action to protect the rights of all children to live free from commercial sexual exploitation.
Mission.
ECPAT seeks to encourage the world community to ensure that children everywhere enjoy their fundamental rights free and secure from all forms of commercial sexual exploitation.
History.
In 1990, a conference sponsored by the Ecumenical Coalition on Third world Tourism exposed the degree to which the prostitution of children was growing in parts of Asia. The consultation ended with a commitment to take action and ECPAT was established as a three-year campaign focused on ending the ‚Äòcommercial‚Äô aspect of child sexual exploitation. In 1996, in partnership with UNICEF and the NGO Group for the Rights of the Child (now known as Child Rights Connect), ECPAT co-organised the First World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Stockholm, Sweden. The Congress was hosted by the Government of Sweden, which also played a major role in attracting support and participation from concerned governments all over the world. It was clear that the commercial sexual exploitation of children was growing in other regions of the world. As a result of the Congress, ECPAT grew from a regional campaign into a global non-governmental organisation (NGO). ECPAT is man¬≠dated to mon¬≠i¬≠tor the com¬≠mit¬≠ments of gov¬≠ern¬≠ments around the world in their legal obligations to pro¬≠tect chil¬≠dren from sex¬≠ual exploita¬≠tion. ECPAT has since been the central force behind the Second and Third World Congresses against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (Yokohama, Japan ‚Äì 2001, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ‚Äì 2008).
CSEC.
The commercial sexual exploitation of children is a fundamental violation of human rights and children‚Äôs rights. The key elements that this violation of children and their rights arises through a commercial transaction of some sort. That is, there is an exchange in which one or more parties gain a benefit ‚Äì cash, goods or in-kind ‚Äì from the exploitation for sexual purposes of someone under the age of 18.
The significance of defining in-kind transactions as commercial in nature should not be underestimated, not only because they are very common, but also because there is a tendency to view some such transactions as entailing consent on the part of a child. This includes cases where sexual exploitation occurs in exchange for protection, a place to sleep, or access to higher grades and/or promotion. The sexual exploitation of the child may profit a much wider range of people than the immediate beneficiary of the transaction. The remuneration factor distinguishes the concept of commercial sexual exploitation of children from the sexual abuse of a child where commercial gain is apparently absent, although sexual exploitation is also abuse. At the same time, it must be noted that there is a clear link between noncommercial sexual abuse of a child and the increased vulnerability of an abused child to commercial sexual exploitation.
AREAS OF WORK 
End child prostitution.
Child Prostitution occurs when someone benefits from a commercial transaction in which a child is made available for sexual purposes. Children are also involved in prostitution when they engage in sex in return for basic needs such as food, shelter or safety, or pocket money to purchase consumer goods. A child cannot consent to being prostituted and in all instances, abusers are exploiting the vulnerabilities of the child for their own gratification.
End trafficking of children for sexual purposes.
The trafficking of children for sexual purposes refers to the cross-border or internal, recruitment, transportation, harbouring, transfer or receipt of children for the purpose of sexual exploitation. This crime happens in every country in the world and affects children from walks of life . ECPAT works to stop child sex trafficking. 
End child pornography.
Child pornography means any representation of a child engaged in real or simulated sexual activities or any representation of a child for primarily sexual purposes. Since the rise of the Internet, the sheer scale of child pornography online has become overwhelming. ECPAT wants to eliminate child pornography and the exploitation of children online.
End the sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism.
Children are the victims of traveler and tourists, either within their own country or internationally, who seek out and engages in sexual acts with them. Some offenders engage in sexual acts with children out of experimentation often fuelled by opportunity or a feeling of anonymity as a result of being away from their home. 
Agenda for Action country reports.
ECPAT produces its Agenda for Action monitoring reports to examine countries around the world and their policies and laws to protect against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Currently in their 2nd edition, these are the only country specific reports produced on action to stopthe commercial sexual exploitation of children.
Network membership.
The ECPAT network currently consists of 81 member groups in 75 countries. These member groups (National andAffiliate) are independent civil society organisations consisting of grassrootsNGOs and coalitions of NGOs focused on a range of child rights violations.
ECPAT holds anInternational Assembly every three years to strengthen solidarity within thenetwork, share good practices and recent developments in the fight to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children, and to explore further opportunities for collaboration.
The Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from SexualExploitation in Travel and Tourism.
The Code was developed by ECPAT Sweden after the First World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in 1996. It was implemented for the first time in 1998 by the three principal tour operators in Sweden with much success. This led to the initiative being adopted by the international ECPAT network resulting in reaching over 1,300 signatories across 42 countries around the world. Since 2004, The Code has operated as an independent non-profit organisation. With board members coming from the tourism industry and non-industry sectors, the organisation is guided by a group of diverse, committed leaders. Today, The Code has become an essential responsible tourism tool for the industry to integrate child protection into its corporate social responsibility or sustainable tourism initiatives.
Protecting children online.
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are now an integral and positive component of modern life. They are as important to the educational and social development of children and young people as they are to the overall global economy. Yet their emergence as mass consumer products has also generated a number of unforeseen and unintended consequences. ICTs are enabling and promoting new forms of violence againstchildren and young people.
Around the world the rapidly expanding Internet space is making more children vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse. As Internet up-take rates climb in many parts of the developing world, the potential negative impact of ICTs on children could be disproportionately severe because: (i) parents, policymakers and children have less awareness of the related risks, and (ii) laws, law enforcement and social services may be lacking or scarce in comparison to more developed countries. Moreover the nature of the Internet means that a growth in online child sexual abuse material (CSAM) anywhere can have an impact everywhere. All countries thus have a stake in controlling this spread.
ECPAT International has identified, and is working to address, the following threats facilitated by ICT expansion and innovations: 
‚Ä¢ Greater circulation of child pornography, increasingly through peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing platforms
‚Ä¢ Increased use of mobile devices by child predators
‚Ä¢ Use of cloud-based services to store and share Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)
‚Ä¢ Increase in lives streaming of child sexual abuse
‚Ä¢ Growth in the production of self-generated (‚Äúsexting‚Äù and ‚Äúsextortion‚Äù) child sexual abuse materials
‚Ä¢ Growing trend in sexual abuse materials of young children, including infants
‚Ä¢ Use of the virtual currency Bitcoins to purchase CSAM
ECPAT International works with a wide range of partners to prevent the exploitation of children through the misuse of the Internet and information and communication technologies (ICTs). In addition to relying on the work in the field done by some of the members of its network, the Secretariat contributes and engages with other child rights organisations, for example, through it involvement at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and also collaborates with international law enforcement agencies. Its active participation as a member of the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) is an illustration of it. Mid-2014, ECPAT has been formally accepted as a member of the European Financial Coalition against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online (EFC) that brings together key actors from law enforcement, the private sector and civil society in Europe with the common goal of fighting the commercial sexual exploitation of children online by joining forces to take action on the payment and ICT systems that are used to run these illegal operations. It is also part of the International Telecommunication Union¬¥s (ITU) Child Online Protection initiative (COP). ECPAT has signed agreements with major players such as the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and Child Helpline International (CHI). It also articulates specific initiatives with industry partners ranging from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to online game providers, content and cloud providers, seeking to promote the development and the use of technological tools that will disrupt or reduce the availability of images of sexual abuse online. 
ECPAT actively advocates at national, regional and global levels for the ratification of international and regional legal instruments such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention of the rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and the Council of Europe‚Äôs Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (Lanzarote convention), in addition to the harmonisation of national laws with these instruments.
Campaigns.
The Stop Sex Trafficking of Children and Young People campaign, launched by ECPATInternational and The Body Shop (2009‚Äì2012), engaged the public as advocates and called on governments to safeguard the rights of children and adolescents to protect them from sex trafficking. During the three-year campaign 7,044,278 petition signatures were collected worldwide. The petitions were presented to government officials around the world and to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2012.
Resources.
ECPAT International produces a variety of research publications, resources and manuals for use by its network members, other NGOs, UN agencies, and researchers. These include studies on specific forms of commercial sexual exploitation, good practice models, and journals.

Sangaia

Sangaia is an extinct genus of rhytidosteid temnospondyl from the early Triassic period of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Paleorrota). It is known from the holotype UMVT 4302, the left half of a partial skull, a partial palate, from the paratype UMVT 4303, a partial right palatal fragment and from the referred specimens PV 0497 T and MCN PV 2606, skull fragments, recovered from the Sanga do Cabral Formation in the Ro≈õario do Sul Group. 
This taxon originally was named "Cabralia lavinai" by S√©rgio Dias-da-Silva, Claudia Marsicano and Cesar Leandro Schultz in 2006 but this name was preoccupied by the Brazilian butterfly "Cabralia" (Moore, 1882). Thus, Dias-da-Silva and Marsicano proposed "Sangaia" as a replacement generic name later in 2006.

GAMER Manpack

Saab‚Äôs GAMER Manpack is used in smaller military exercises when the instructor wants to have control of the exercise and at the same time be able to be near the action. The actual GAMER Manpack consists of a miniaturised radio base station and a laptop with an exercise-command-and-control system. These are small enough to be carried around in a backpack.
The instructor decides through the system what is to happen in the exercise, this is communicated through the radio. Information about what is happening during the exercise is sent back to the system through specific vests the soldiers are wearing (Personnel Detection Devices (PDD‚Äôs)). In this way it is possible to control simulated minefields, indirect fires and simulated bombs. 
The instructor then follows how each soldier acts as an individual and a member of the group. This movement is also saved and the information is then saved to be used in the evaluation of the exercise.
GAMER Manpack can also be used in civil training. For example, in 2009 the UK Ministry of Defence Police purchased three GAMER Manpacks and related products to be used in their training.

Operaci√≥n N√©cora

Operation Necora (, lit. Velvet Crab) was a major Spanish police operation against drug traffickers in Galicia, Spain. It led to the arrest of 54 people.
Background.
The 1970s saw fishermen from declining fishing towns along the Galician coastline turn to the more lucrative occupation of importing contraband cigarettes from the United States; At that time the sole manufacturer of cigarettes in Spain was Tabacalera, a monopolistic state-owned company.
The topography of the arousan coastline, with its coves and inlets, allowed these to bring in the contraband under the cover of darkness and from there distribute it throughout Spain. In the 1980s, the Medell√≠n cartel, under pressure from the US authorities and a saturated North American cocaine market turned to Europe, the smugglers utilized the methods developed in the previous decade to import hashish, and later cocaine for the cartels. From the town of Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa - the main distribution point for the smugglers - Colombian traffickers from Madrid would collect the drugs and distribute it throughout the rest of Spain.
Investigation.
The investigation into the international trafficking of drugs through Galicia was prompted by a letter sent in August 1989 by Ricardo Portabales Rodr√≠guez, a drug dealer serving a prison sentence, to Luciano Varela, an investigating magistrate of Pontevedra's provincial court. The inquisitorial system used in Spanish civil law required further investigation by an investigating magistrate. Varela deemed the case to be too big for a provincial court to investigate so it was transferred to the "Audiencia Nacional", Spain's highest criminal court. A 35 year-old magistrate in Baltasar Garz√≥n was charged with carrying out the investigation. The investigation was carried out with the assistance of Section IV of the Central Narcotics Department (). Garz√≥n used testimony from two informants known in the media as (The penitents): the aforementioned Ricardo Portabales Rodr√≠guez and Manuel Fern√°ndez Pad√≠n, an actual member of one of the "clans", to build the case against the traffickers.
Operation Mago.
On the morning of June 12, 1990 a hundred vehicles containing 350 officers from the Central Narcotics Department, flown in specifically from Madrid to prevent any possible leaks from the local police force, left the main police station in the Galician capital, Santiago de Compostela, heading for the "comarca" of O Saln√©s. From there, each vehicle went on to their pre-assigned targets in different towns throughout the "comarca". The operation was initially known as "Operaci√≥n Mago" (Operation Magi) - Garz√≥n was told that they had named it after himself; however, he rejected this name and they settled on "Operaci√≥n Necora". 
The base of operations was Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa's police station, the former local party headquarters of the Falange. It was carried out under the judicial supervision of Baltsar Garz√≥n, Luciano Varela and Javier Zaragoza, the deputy anti-drug prosecutor.
Trial.
On September 6, 1990 the Anti-drug prosecutor presented an indictment against 49 of those arrested (Indictment 13/90). Of the remaining five, the prosecutor's office started a separate proceeding against three: Marcial Dorado Ba√∫nde "Marcial de la Isla", Michel Haengi and Miguel Rivero Gonz√°lez on the grounds of money-laundering - something that would delay the start of the main trial. Luis Falcon P√©rez "Falconetti" and Tom√°s Leis Carl√©s were released on bail, however, they remained imprisoned on unrelated charges.

Punishment in Australia

The Australian prison system is a part of the Australian criminal justice system.
Life imprisonment in Australia.
In Australia, life imprisonment is of indeterminate length. The sentencing judge usually sets a non-parole period after which the prisoner can apply for release under parole conditions, or in the case of a criminal who has committed particularly heinous crimes, the sentencing judge may order that the person is "never to be released".
Capital punishment in Australia.
Capital punishment had been part of the legal system of Australia since British settlement and during the 19th century, crimes that could carry a death sentence included burglary, sheep stealing, forgery, sexual assaults, murder and manslaughter and there is one reported case of someone being executed for "being illegally at large" and during the 19th century, these crimes saw about 80 people hanged each year throughout Australia.
The death penalty was abolished in Queensland in 1922, Tasmania in 1968, the Commonwealth in 1973, Northern Territory in 1973, Victoria in 1975, South Australia in 1976, ACT in 1983, Western Australia in 1984, and New South Wales in 1985. It was finally abolished through federal law in 1973 with the '"Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973" of the Commonwealth abolished the death penalty for federal offences. It provided in Section 3 that the Act applied to any offence against a law of the Commonwealth, the Territories or under an Imperial Act, and in s. 4 that " person is not liable to the punishment of death for any offence".
No executions were carried out under the bridge of the federal government and the passage of the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 saw the death penalty replaced with life imprisonment as their maximum punishment.

Giacomo Di Chirico

Giacomo Ernesto Eduardo Di Chirico (27 January 1844 ‚Äì 26 December 1883) was an Italian painter. Together with Domenico Morelli and Filippo Palizzi, he was one of the most elite Neapolitan artists of the 19th century. He received the official title ‚ÄúKnight of Italy‚Äù from King Victor Emmanuel II.
Biography.
Giacomo Di Chirico was born in Venosa into a carpenter's family, the younger son of Luigi and Caterina Savino. In 1847, when Di Chirico was barely 3 years old, his father Luigi died, leaving the family impoverished. He attended a private school for boys from deprived families under the supervision of priest Giuseppe Gianturco, the brother of politician Emanuele Gianturco. He began working at a barbershop in order to support his family economically but had become passionate about his painting hobby, after learning basic art techniques from his older brother, Nicola, a sculptor.
Di Chirico had begun to create portraits of his customers, who expressed admiration for his work, and local citizens who saw his portraits began to request them. Feeling stimulated from such interest and their appreciation, Di Chirico decided to become a professional painter. He obtained a subsidy salary from the municipality of Venosa, was enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples and graduated after he had demonstrated optimal results from the studies.
In 1865, Di Chirico became a disciple of Francesco de Sanctis, who taught him lessons in literature for two years.
Between 1868 and 1871, Di Chirico refined his artistic technique while living in Rome, further strengthening his friendship with Domenico Morelli and Filippo Palizzi. He returned to Naples in order to open an art studio.
During his career, Di Chirico created masterpieces such as "Buoso da Duera", "Quinto Orazio Flacco", "Corteggiamento" and "Donna lucana". "Sposalizio in Basilicata", one of his best known paintings, was exposed in Paris (1877), Vienna (1879) and Munich (1882). It was purchased by the French merchant Adolphe Goupil. Di Chirico's works were exposed at the Goupil & Cie in Paris. He received the title Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy from Victor Emmanuel II.
Between 1877 and 1878, Di Chirico was made an honorary professor at the Academy of Art in Naples. He spent August (Ferragosto) in Maiori, where he met his wife Emilia D‚ÄôAmato. He remained with her for the rest of his life and they had a daughter named Maria. One of his pupils was Pietro Scoppetta.
As his artistic career continued to reach new heights, so did the rise of his activity until 1882, when Di Chirico began to exhibit symptoms of mania, sleep deprivation and cachexia, a pattern of ailments that overlapped with the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh's illness. Di Chirico was confined to the Provincial lunatic asylum for his mental illness. In the asylum, his physical health continued to deteriorate, and he died during treatment in Naples in 1883 at age 39.

Torino Lingotto railway station

Torino Lingotto railway station () is one of the main stations serving the city and "comune" of Turin, capital of the region of Piedmont, northwestern Italy. It should not be confused with the Torino Lingotto metro station which is located nearby, and opened on March 6, 2011.
Opened in 1960, the station is the third most important in Turin, after Torino Porta Nuova and Torino Porta Susa. It forms part of the Turin‚ÄìGenoa main line, and is also a stop on three secondary railways, which link Turin with Pinerolo, Cuneo and Savona, respectively.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Most train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The remaining train services are operated by GTT, a public benefit corporation responsible for public transportation in the provinces of Turin, Alessandria, Cuneo and Asti, and Arenaways, an open-access railway operator that began passenger operations in November 2010.
Location.
Torino Lingotto railway station is situated in Via Mario Pannunzio, in the district of Lingotto, to the south east of Turin's city centre. It is near the well known former FIAT car factory also named Lingotto, and the Arco olimpico, symbol of the 2006 Winter Olympics.
History.
The station was founded in 1960 as a railway stop without a passenger building. The facility was later transformed into a station equipped with a building suitable for accommodating both departing and arriving passengers.
With the increase in the number of trains passing through daily (from 240 to 270 in just a few years), it was decided in 1970 to extend the double-track section from Lingotto to Trofarello railway station, on the Turin-Genoa railway.
The 1960 passenger building was demolished in 1980 to make way for the current passenger building, which was opened in 1984.
Facilities.
Today, the station has eleven through tracks and seven platform tracks, divided into two groups: northern section (four tracks) and southern section (three tracks).
A station on the Metropolitana di Torino (Turin Metro) was opened in 6 March 2011.
Future.
The station is presently the subject of local government studies, given its growing importance to the southern part of the city.
The assumed reduction in future capacity of Torino Porta Nuova may further increase the station's importance. Local governments are currently working on the possible integration and synergy with the former Lingotto factory complex.
On 20 November 2007, the architect Massimiliano Fuksas submitted a preliminary project commissioned by the Piedmont Region for the redevelopment of the Via Nizza area, which previously housed the now demolished factories of Fiat Aviazione. Within this study is a redesign of the Lingotto station including the construction of a building to the east of the railway lines to integrate this area into the renovations.
<br clear=left>
Services.
Long distance.
Trains stopping at the station include InterCity and night trains, which operate via Genoa. There are direct long distance connections with Genoa, Pisa, Livorno, Rome, Naples und Salerno.
Regional.
Torino Lingotto railway station is served by the lines 1, 2 and 4 of the Turin metropolitan railway service.
Interchange and connections.
The station offers interchange with urban bus lines 14, 18, 41, 63 and 74. It also offers a connection to the "Lingotto" metro station.

Tell Sabi Abyad () is an archaeological site in the Balikh River valley in northern Syria. The site consists of four prehistoric mounds that are numbered Tell Sabi Abyad I to IV. Since 1986, archaeologist Peter Akkermans has led extensive excavations at Tell Sabi Abyad I, II and III. Surveys were conducted at the fourth mound, but excavations were not possible because of its use as a local cemetery.
Tell Sabi Abyad I.
Tell Sabi Abyad I was first occupied between 5200 and 5100 BC during the Neolithic. It showed a later phase of occupation, termed ""transitional"" by Akkermans, between 5200 and 5100 BC, which was followed by an early Halaf period between 5100 and 5000 BC. Architecture of the 6th-millennium settlement featured multi-room rectangular buildings with round structures called tholoi that were suggested to have been used for storage.
Later remains of a massive structure called the ""Fortress"" were dated to the Middle Assyrian period (Late Bronze Age) between 1550 and 1250 BC. Domestic buildings were also found, suggesting that the settlement was an Assyrian border town where a garrison was stationed. The Fortress structure contained eight rooms with walls constructed of mud bricks and featured a staircase that led to a second floor.
Zooarchaeology and archaeobotany.
In the Halaf period, Tell Sabi Abyad had a fully developed farming economy with animal domestication of predominantly goats, but also sheep, cattle and pigs. A small number of gazelle were also hunted, although evidence for hunting and fishing is not well attested at the site.
Trees that would have grown at the time included poplar, willow and ash.
Domesticated emmer wheat was the primary crop grown, along with domesticated einkorn, barley and flax. A low number of peas and lentils were found compared to similar sites.
Pottery.
Pottery found at the site included Dark Faced Burnished Ware and a Fine Ware that resembled Hassuna Ware and Samarra Ware. Bowls and jars often had angled necks and ornate geometric designs, some featuring horned animals. Only around six percent of the pottery found was produced locally.
Clay tokens.
The site has also revealed the largest collection of clay tokens and sealings yet found at any site, with over two hundred and seventy-five, made by a minimum of sixty-one stamp seals. Such exchange devices were first found in level III of Mureybet during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and are well known to have developed in the Neolithic.
Tell Sabi Abyad II.
Tell Sabi Abyad II was started as an offshoot of Sabi Abyad I and measured by by high. Artefacts found evidenced a very early occupation not long after the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B horizon with calibrated dates of around 7550 and 6850 BC.

Zdravo (band)

Zdravo (Serbian Cyrillic: –ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤–æ; trans. "Hello") was a former Yugoslav disco group from Belgrade.
Band history.
The group was formed in 1976 by the disk jockey Boban Petroviƒá. Having gathered several teenagers and several Belgrade musicians, Petroviƒá intended to form a band which would perform communicative disco music with funk influences. In order to attract media attention, Popoviƒá chose the name Zdravo after the youth magazine "Zdravo", which Politika Newspapers and Magazines started publishing at about the same time. The first lineup consisted of Boban Petroviƒá (vocals, keyboards), Dragan Jovanoviƒá (guitar, later a member of the hard rock band Generacija 5), Branko Kojiƒá (bass guitar, later a member of the new wave band Grupa I), Vlastimir Cvetkoviƒá (drums), and vocalists and dancers Bo≈æa Jeremiƒá, Vladislav Kukolj, and Branko Popoviƒá. The band also performed with female dancers, African girls from Zaire.
The band's only big hit was the song "Vikend fobija" ("Weekend Phobia"), released in 1977. Although the song became a hit, it was generally disliked by the critics. Soon after, Jovanoviƒá left the band to form Generacija 5, so Popoviƒá invited at the time unknown guitarist Momƒçilo Bajagiƒá to join the band. However, Bajagiƒá refused the invitation, and the new member of the band became a former Innamorata member Branko Pe≈°iƒá "Amerikanac".
In August 1977, Zdravo performed as one of the opening bands on Bijelo Dugme concert at Hajduƒçka ƒçesma, at the end of the same year, they performed as an opening band on Indexi Yugoslav tour. As Petroviƒá was at the time in a relationship with singer Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá, the band played on her debut single "Au au", and Milo≈°eviƒá often performed with the band. In 1978, the original Zdravo lineup disbanded, and Petroviƒá continued performing under the name Zdravo with various musicians, also performing with the band Orion. After releasing the single "≈Ωalba" ("Complaint"), Popoviƒá disbanded the band, and released the following two singles under the name Boban Petroviƒá & Zdravo, also recording the single "Moram" ("I Have To") with Gordana Ivandiƒá in 1979.
Post-breakup.
Petroviƒá dedicated himself to his solo career, releasing studio album "≈Ωur" ("Party") in 1981, and "Zora" ("Dawn") in 1984. The albums, however, did not see the big success. In 1986, he published the novel "Rokanje" ("Rocking"), which dealt with Belgrade nightlife in the 1980s. After that, he withdrew from the scene. He moved abroad, where he started working as businessman, for a certain time being an owner of the Spanish football club CA Marbella. In 2006, his song "Prepad" ("Raid") from the album "≈Ωur" was ranked No. 82 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list.

History of Parkinson's disease

The history of Parkinson's disease expands from 1817, when British apothecary James Parkinson published "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy", to modern times. Prior to Parkinson's descriptions, others had already described features of the disease that would bear his name, while the 20th century greatly improved knowledge of the disease and its treatments. PD was then known as "paralysis agitans" (shaking palsy in English). The term "Parkinson's disease" was coined several decades later by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot.
Early descriptions.
Several early sources describe symptoms resembling those of PD. An Egyptian papyrus from the 12th century B.C. mentions a king drooling with age and the Bible contains a number of references to tremor. An Ayurvedic medical treatise from the 10th century B.C. describes a disease that evolves with tremor, lack of movement, drooling and other symptoms of PD. Moreover, this disease was treated with remedies derived from the mucuna family, which is rich in L-DOPA. Galen wrote about a disease that almost certainly was PD, describing tremors that occur only at rest, postural changes and paralysis.
After Galen there are no references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century. In this and the following century several authors wrote about elements of the disease, preceding the description by Parkinson. Franciscus Sylvius, like Galen, distinguished tremor at rest from other tremors, while Johannes Baptiste Sagar and Hieronymus David Gaubius described festination, a term for the James Parkinson characteristic of PD. John Hunter provided a thorough description of the disease, which may have given Parkinson the idea of collecting and describing patients with "paralysis agitans". Finally, Auguste Fran√ßois Chomel in his pathology treatise, which was contemporary to Parkinson's essay, included several descriptions of abnormal movements and rigidity matching those seen in PD.
19th century.
In 1817 James Parkinson published his essay reporting 6 cases of paralysis agitans. "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, and the way that the disease progresses over time. He also acknowledged the contributions of many of the previously mentioned authors to the understanding of PD. Although the article was later considered the seminal work on the disease, it received little attention over the forty years that followed. Nevertheless, early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.
20th century.
The first speculations concerning the anatomical substrate of PD were made 80 years after Parkinson's essay, when √âdouard Brissaud proposed that it had its origin in the subthalamus or cerebral peduncle and might be caused by an ischemic lesion. In 1912 Frederic Lewy described a pathologic finding in affected brains, later named "Lewy bodies". In 1919 Konstantin Tretiakoff reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by Rolf Hassler in 1938. The underlying biochemical changes in the brain were identified in the 1950s, due largely to the work of Arvid Carlsson on the neurotransmitter dopamine and Oleh Hornykiewicz on its role on PD. Carlsson was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize for this work.
Alice Lazzarini "et al" pinpointed a genetic component to PD in 1994. Years earlier, the neurology clinic at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) had located a family of Italian origin that encompassed at least five generations of more than 400 individuals and at least 60 members with PD, and traced their ancestors to the small village of Contursi, Italy. In 1995, the RWJMS team joined with the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health to take advantage of the laboratory resources available from the NIH in an effort to locate the gene causing PD in the Contursi family. The team reported the first Parkinson disease-causing mutation (PARK1) in the brain protein, alpha-synuclein. Within days of the publication of the PARK1 findings, alpha-synuclein was discovered to be the major component of Lewy bodies within brain cells of PD patients; according to the UMDNJ magazine, "This discovery changed the direction of research into PD by providing scientists with an entirely new protein whose manufacture, function or breakdown could be the key to the disease." Synuclein proteins being the main component of Lewy bodies was discovered in 1997.
History of treatments.
The positive albeit modest effects on tremor of anticholinergic alkaloids obtained from the plant of the belladona were described during 19th century by Charcot, Erb and others. Modern surgery for tremor, consisting of the lesioning of some of the basal ganglia structures was first tried in 1939 and was improved over the following 20 years. Before this date surgery consisted in lesioning the corticospinal pathway with paralysis instead of tremor as result. Anticholinergics and surgery were the only treaments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967, and the first large study reporting improvements in people with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with levodopa was published in 1968. Levodopa brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation emerged as a possible treatment and it was approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1997.

Richard Cook (artist 1784‚Äì1857)

Richard Cook (1784‚Äì11 March 1857) was an English artist.
Life.
He was born in London in 1784, and entered the schools of the Royal Academy in 1800. He was a constant contributor to the exhibitions from 1808 to 1822, during which time he painted several landscapes, scenes from "The Lady of the Lake", and in 1817, having been elected an Associate in the preceding year, a more ambitious work, entitled "Ceres, Disconsolate for the Loss of Proserpine". It is now in the collection of the Royal Academy. A contemporary critic described it as "an elegant and well painted illustration of this well known subject", adding that "the architectural accessories are better than English painters are in the habits of using, and are in themselves correct and appropriate"
In 1822 he became a Royal Academician, and almost from that time forward, and certainly for many years preceding his death, he seems to have abandoned painting, and ceased to contribute to the annual exhibitions of the Academy, his private fortune enabling him to live independently of his art. He died in London in 1857.
He illustrated editions of "The Lady of the Lake" and "Gertrude of Wyoming".

Nurdin Halid

Nurdin Halid (born November 17, 1958) is an Indonesian businessman and politician. He was the Chairman of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) from 2004 to 2011. Nurdin is infamous for being involved in many criminal cases and jailed numerous times.
Career and criminal cases.
Born in Watampone, South Sulawesi, Halid is known to be involved in various criminal cases, mostly corruption and public duping about FIFA statutes.
Clove monopoly and fund corruption.
Halid was the chairman of Hasanuddin Village Cooperative Center (Puskud) in Ujung Pandang, from 1992 to 1998. During his leadership, Hasanuddin Puskud earned the reputation as the Best Puskud in Indonesia. The rapid development of Hasanuddin Puskud was due to clove trades. Halid's family (his mother, brothers and brother-in-laws) were alleged to dominate at least 90 percent of clove purchases in Bone, Ujung Pandang. Another 10 percent was for Village Cooperative Units (KUD) to buy. According to the 1992 Ministry of Trade Act, only KUDs are entitled to buy cloves from farmers. In the case of purchasing clove, they were accused of cutting prices. In 1992, the price of cloves which were supposed to cost 7900 rupiahs per kilogram, were just bought for 2200 to 3000 rupiahs.
In December 1995, a total of 20 farmers, representing 300 clove farmers in Bone, demonstrated about the frauds, embezzlements and economic crimes that had been practiced by the Halid family in Bone.
Later, Halid family's monopoly in the purchase of cloves in Bone ended. Three years later, Halid was charged with corrupting South Sulawesian clove farmers saving funds (SWKP) totalling 115,7 billion rupiahs. However, Ujung Pandang District Court acquitted Halid from corruption charge in 1999. In the injunction the council of judges ordered beside the release of Halid, also the release of confiscated evidence, like Halid's luxurious home and a deposit of 8 billion rupiahs in the name of Hasanuddin Puskud after reading of the acquittal. According to the Judge, the four charges concerned irregularities in the clove buy-up, irregularities in the release of clove farmer funds, irregularities in work capital and irregularities of funding. The judge concluded however, that the case only involved one charge entailing four subjects. The judge was of the opinion that cloves from farmers had been bought up by village cooperatives and sold further to the Puskud under various pretenses. As to payment, everything has been settled, including all funds of the clove farmers and village cooperatives. The acquittance of Halid was followed by stone throwings to the court house by university students and various protests and demonstrations around Ujung Pandang.
Illegal sugar import case.
On July 16, 2004, Halid, who the day before had been appointed as the Chairman of National Federation of Rural Cooperatives (Dekopin) for 2004‚Äì2009, was arrested and detained by the police after he was named as a suspect in the case of illegally importing 73.520 tons of sugar.
Cooking oil distribution fund corruption.
On November 2, 2004, Halid was investigated by the Indonesian National Police for his involvement in the cooking oil distribution fund corruption case which cost the state 169 billion rupiahs. He was acquitted by the South Jakarta District Court on June 16, 2005, thus making him free of 20-year imprisonment demand from the prosecutors.
Later, the prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia and on August 13, 2007, Halid was convicted guilty and was sentenced to 2 years prison.
Vietnam rice import customs violation.
On August 9, 2005, Halid, who at the time was the Chairman of Village Cooperative Unit Center (Inkud), was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months by the North Jakarta District Court, after he was pronounced guilty of violating customs on imports of rice from Vietnam. On August 17, 2006, Halid was released after receiving an Indonesian Independence Day remission.
FIFA ban.
In March 2011, FIFA banned chairman Halid from running as the third term candidate in PSSI. "FIFA upholds the statutes that states a convict cannot lead a football organization".
FIFA's emergency committee met on April 1, 2011 and announced on April 4, 2011 that control of the PSSI would pass to a normalisation committee made up of personalities in Indonesian football to oversee presidential elections by May 21, 2011. It also barred Halid from standing, along with three other candidates, George Toisutta, Arifin Panigoro and Nirwan Bakrie.

St Andrew's Church, Redbourne

St Andrew's Church, Redbourne, is a redundant Anglican church in the village of Redbourne, Lincolnshire, England. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade¬†I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the centre of the village, which is to the east of the A15 road, and some south of Brigg.
History.
The church dates from the 14th‚Äì15th¬†century. Rebuilding took place in the later part of the 18th¬†century; this included new north and south chapels in the 1770s by William and Thomas Lumby of Lincoln. The plaster ceilings date from 1775‚Äì77, and the top two stages were added to the tower in 1785. A new west door, partial rebuilding of the aisles, the chancel, and the clerestory, probably also date from this period. The south chapel was rebuilt in early 19th¬†century as a mausoleum for the Dukes of St¬†Albans. The church was restored in 1888 by the local architect W.¬†W.¬†Goodhand. The restorations included removing the gallery, reordering the seating, and the addition of a new south porch. The church was declared redundant in May 1978. A vestry door was inserted and east side windows were removed in about 1985.
Architecture.
Exterior.
St Andrew's is constructed in limestone with some rendering. The nave, aisles and clerestory have lead roofs; the mausoleum, vestry and porch are slated. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a single-bay chancel with a vestry and organ chamber to the north, and the mausoleum to the south, and a west tower. The tower has a rectangular staircase projection to the southeast. It is in four stages, divided by string courses, on a moulded plinth. In the bottom stage on the west side is a blocked doorway, an arched three-light window, and a square-headed two-light window. On the north and south sides are lighting slits. In the staircase turret are three slits, and a sundial. The second stage contains two-light windows, and in the third stage is a clock face on the west side. In the top stage are two-light bell openings, and the parapet is embattled. The aisles have pointed two-light windows and along the clerestory are square-headed two-light windows. In the south aisle there is a blocked doorway to the west, a blocked lancet window to the east, blocked circular windows to the east and west, and a blocked pointed south window. A carved stone dating from the 10th‚Äì11th¬†century has been re-set in the west wall. The chancel has an east window. In the vestry are two two-light windows, and the mausoleum has a south door. All the parapets are embattled, some with crocketted pinnacles.
Interior.
The arcades are carried on octagonal piers. The ceilings are plastered, the nave ceiling being decorated with foliate bosses. The floors are flagged. The baluster-shaped font was made in 1775 by Richard Hayward. The east window contains painted glass by William Collins dating from about 1840. This is a copy of "The Opening of the Sixth Seal" (part of the Last Judgment) by Francis Danby. Also by Collins are twelve stained glass windows depicting the Apostles. The organ is no longer present. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast in 1774 by Henry Harrison¬†II, and the undated sixth bell is by James Harrison¬†III.
Memorials.
In the north wall of the chancel is a niche containing a black marble graveslab depicting a knight and angels, and is dated 1410. On the south side of the chancel are marble wall tablets to members of the Carter family with dates in the 18th¬†century, and to the 8th¬†Duke of St¬†Albans, who died in 1825, and his wife. On the north side of the chancel is a memorial to the 9th¬†Duke of St¬†Albans who died in 1851 by J. G. Lough, and to his wife, Harriet, who died in 1837, by Chantrey, and a memorial to Charlotte, Lady Beauclerk, dating from about 1825. In the mausoleum are two tiers of tombs of the St¬†Albans family.
External features.
In the churchyard is a gravestone dated 1737 to Rev¬†Josias Morgan, vicar of the parish, It is listed at Grade¬†II. There are also the war graves of a soldier of World War I, and another of World War II.

Hunterian transliteration

The Hunterian transliteration system is the ""national system of romanization in India"" and the one officially adopted by the Government of India. Hunterian transliteration was sometimes also called the "Jonesian transliteration system" because it derived closely from a previous transliteration method developed by William Jones (1746-1794 CE). Upon its establishment, the Sahitya Akademi (India's National Academy of Letters) also adopted the Hunterian method, with additional adaptations, as its standard method of maintaining its bibliography of Indian-language works.
History.
The original precursor to the Hunterian system was a transliteration method developed by Charles Wilkins, who is sometimes called the ""father of Devanagari typography"" because he was also the creator of the first Devanagari typeface. William Jones, who also founded the Asiatic Society, further developed the transliteration method. It was given a more complete form in the late nineteenth century by William Wilson Hunter, then Surveyor General of India. When it was proposed, it immediately met with opposition from supporters of the phonetic Dowler system, which climaxed in a dramatic showdown in an India Council meeting on 28 May 1872 where the new Hunterian method carried the day. The Hunterian method was inherently simpler and extensible to several Indic scripts because it systematized grapheme transliteration, and it came to prevail and gain government and academic acceptance. Opponents of the grapheme transliteration model continued to mount unsuccessful attempts at reversing government policy until the turn of the century, with one critic calling appealing to """the Indian Government to give up the whole attempt at scientific (i.e. Hunterian) transliteration, and decide once and for all in favour of a return to the old phonetic spelling"."
Additional languages and adaptations.
Over time, the Hunterian method extended in reach to cover several Indic scripts, including Burmese and Tibetan. The Hunterian system was used to establish writing systems that used the Latin alphabet for some Indian languages that were previously not associated with a written script, such as Mizo. In the case of Mizo, the Hunterian-based writing system ""has proved hugely successful"." Provisions for schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages were also made where applicable, e.g. the Hindi ‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡§™‡•Å‡§∞ is transliterated as "kƒÅnpur" (and not "kƒÅnapura") but the Sanskrit ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ is transliterated as "krama" (and not "kram"). The system has undergone some evolution over time. For instance, long vowels were marked with an accent diacritic in the original version, but this was later replaced in the 1954 Government of India update with a macron. Thus, ‡§ú‡§æ‡§® ("life") was previously romanized as "j√°n" but began to be romanized as "jƒÅn". Additional diacritics have been proposed for various purposes, such as disambiguating letters of PersoArabic that map to a single Devanagari grapheme (e.g. ÿ´, ÿ≥ and ÿµ which all map to ‡§∏). Some languages of the region are tonal, such as Mizo and Punjabi, and accent marks over vowels have been repurposed to indicate tone for some of them.
Vowels.
The main vowels used by Hindi in Devanagari are represented as -
Consonants.
In the Hunterian system, implicit schwas are denoted by the transliterated schwa vowel in Devanagari, "a" (‡§Ö), and excluded as necessary under schwa deletion rules. Aspirations are represented by "h". Retroflex graphemes are often represented by a diacritic dot under the Latin consonant that represents the equivalent dental graphemes in proposals (some of which predate even the Hunterian method), though this has not officially been accepted by the Indian government. Halants are indicated by either leaving out a vowel after the transliterated consonant or, in new proposals (not formally approved by the Indian government), with a period after the applicable consonant (e.g. ‡§ú‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä - "jal.di"). Initially, italics were sometimes used to differentiate consonants such as ‡§ñ ("kh") and ‡§ñ‡§º (""kh""), but later macrons and diacritics began to be used more extensively.

Criticism.
The Hunterian system has faced criticism over the years for not producing phonetically-accurate results and being "unashamedly geared towards an English-language receiver audience." Specifically, the lack of differentiation between retroflex and dental consonants (e.g. ‡§¶ and ‡§° are both represented by "d") has come in for repeated criticism and inspired several proposed modifications of Hunterian, including using a diacritic below retroflexes (e.g. making ‡§¶="d" and ‡§°="·∏ç", which is more readable but requires diacritic printing) or capitalizing them (e.g. making ‡§¶="d" and ‡§°="D", which requires no diacritic printing but is less readable because it mixes small and capital letters in words).

Ludwig Engl√§nder

Ludwig Engl√§nder (October 20, 1853 Vienna, Austria ‚Äì September 13, 1914) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American composer of more than 30 musicals.
He was born in Vienna, Austria. According to his obituary in the New York Times he had studied with Jacques Offenbach. He immigrated to New York City on October 13, 1882, and became a naturalized American citizen on February 13, 1891.
By the 1890s Engl√§nder was composing prolifically, either for the New York stage, or popular songs (many of which were interpolated into various other productions, such as "A Trip to Chinatown". Already by 1903 he had come in for criticism of his Teutonic sound. Perhaps for that reason he occasionally returned to Vienna near the end of his life to write musicals for that audience. The year before he died he is listed as having residence in Vienna.
At the time of his death he was living in Far Rockaway, Queens with his sister.
Works.
Additionally he wrote many popular songs written with lyricists such as Sydney Rosenfeld, J. Cheever Goodwin, Harry B. Smith, and others.

David Jesson

David Frederick St John Jesson is a Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of York. He is a recognised expert on specialist schools and value-added performance (CVA).
Early life.
He was born in London in 1935, the son of Frederick John and Florence Jesson and attended the University of Manchester and the University of Cambridge. He became a Maths teacher, teaching in several schools, state and independent.
In 1965 he married Catherine Whitehead; they had three children.
University.
He started working at universities when he joined the University of Sheffield. At Sheffield he developed the value-added system of school performance measurement. This involves looking at the relative improvement of pupils, not their absolute performance - how much 'value' has been 'added'.
In 1995 he joined the University of York as Professor in the Economics department. He works in the CPERM department, in the Department of Economics and Related studies, under Professor David Mayston.
His research.
His work on 'value-added' performance came from the belief that working from absolute exam grades was too crude a measurement, as pupils from different backgrounds and schools found it much more of a challenge to gain the same grades as someone from a more privileged background. It was like comparing apples with pears.
Science education.
In 2007 he found that 68% of all comprehensive schools - around 2,020 - do not offer the three separate science courses at GCSE, and that only one in 20 pupils at state schools take physics, chemistry and biology at GCSE.
Academically bright children.
In a report in April 2008 for the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, he found that academically bright children at comprehensive schools were likely to do better when there were more academically bright children at the same school. This was from data of more than 150,000 children, and involved his 'value-added' measurements. The higher the proportion of 'able' pupils, the better the value-added performance.
In November 2005, he reported at the Birmingham annual conference of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (which represented around 2,400 secondary schools) that pupils at private school in the top academic 5% were almost guaranteed to get three A-grades at A-level, yet for state schools only a third of the top 5% would get three A-grades. He called this a 'severe talent drain' in the state school system. In the same speech he said that Britain's future economic success depended on identifying and nurturing this top 5% of pupils. It had been calculated by tracking performance of pupils from 1999 to 2004.

Skopos theory

Skopos theory () is a concept from the field of translation studies. It provides an insight into the nature of translation as a purposeful activity, which is directly applicable to every translation project.
It was established by the German linguist Hans Vermeer and comprises the idea that translating and interpreting should primarily take into account the function of both the source and target text.
Aim and audience.
Skopos theory focuses on translation as an activity with an aim or purpose, and on the intended addressee or audience of the translation. To translate means to produce a target text in a target setting for a target purpose and target addressees in target circumstances. In skopos theory, the status of the source text is lower than it is in equivalence-based theories of translation. The source is an "offer of information", which the translator turns into an "offer of information" for the target audience. 
Paul Kussmaul writes about this theory: "the functional approach has a great affinity with "Skopos theory". The function of a translation is dependent on the knowledge, expectations, values and norms of the target readers, who are again influenced by the situation they are in and by the culture. These factors determine whether the function of the source text or passages in the source text can be preserved or have to be modified or even changed.

32nd Armoured Reconnaissance Group

32nd Armoured Reconnaissance Group "(pl: 32 Dywizjon Pancerny)" - polish reconnaissance unit in the Polish September Campaign. 
The 32nd Armoured Reconnaissance Group was mobilised in August 1939 by the 7th Armoured Battalion stationed in Grodno, for the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade. Mjr Stanislaw Szostak was given the command of the group. The group consisted of one tankette squadron with 13 TKS tankettes armed with heavy machine guns, 1 armoured car squadron with 8 type 34-II armoured cars armed with a 37 mm cannon and 2 machine guns and one transport squadron with a repair vehicle, tankers and lorries. On 2 September the tankette squadron supported the 9th Mounted Rifle Regiment to capture Gross Brzosken in East Prussia defended by German border guards and units of the Landwehr. As there were no major German units in the area Polish forces withdrew back into Poland. On 3/4 September Germans broke through the Polish defence lines West of the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade. The brigade was ordered to slow down the German advance. From that day the armoured squadrons of the group gave mobile machine gun and cannon support to the units of the brigade, fighting Panzer Division Kempf and Wehrmacht. The group suffered losses both in armour and men. On 13 September, covering the fighting retreat of the brigade, the group found itself behind German lines near Wyliny-Rus, which was burnt by the Germans as a reprisal for a successful attack by the group.In the village there are graves of two Polish soldiers killed in 1939. The group managed to break through the German lines suffering further losses and, on 14 September, rejoined the brigade, in the Pietkowo forest near Lapy . Gen. Kmicic ‚ÄìSkrzynski,C O of the brigade, decided to withdraw to Bialowieza forest and allowed the group to cross the Narew and proceed to Wolkowysk (Vavkavysk). The river was crossed on 15 September over a railway bridge near Strabla. It reached the town on 16 September having lost the remnants of its armour. On 17 September the Soviets attacked Poland and Mjr Szostak was ordered to drive to Wilno to join the defence of the town. As Wilno was captured by the Soviets, a new order was issued, on 19 September, for the Polish troops to cross the Lithuanian border. Mjr Szostak refused to cross the border and decided to drive to Grodno to fight the Soviets with his men having been joined by a platoon of anti-aircraft artillery(Bofors, 40 mm gun) of the 94th Anti-aircraft Battery commanded by 2nd Lt. Musial. In the morning of 20 September they reached Grodno which was under attack by Soviet forces. 
In the morning of 21 September, from the barracks of the 7th Armoured Battalion, they machine gunned advancing Soviet infantry who found[ themselves in the cross fire and retreated suffering heavy losses. Later in the day, on the orders of Gen. Przezdziecki, the group started to withdraw towards the Lithuanian Border. On 22 September Mjr Szostak organised the defence of Giby but having not received requested anti-tank weapons and explosives decided to continue the withdrawal to Lithuania. On 24 September, Mjr Szostak and his men crossed the border near Szypliszki. About an hour later, Soviet tanks arrived at the Lithuanian border. 
Subsequently, the officers and soldiers of the 32nd Armoured Reconnaissance Group served in the 2nd Polish Corps of the 8th British Army. Lt. Strokowski was killed by a Lithuanian internment camp guard.

The Sunset Limited (film)

The Sunset Limited is a 2011 television film based on the play written by Cormac McCarthy. The film stars Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.
Plot.
Two men with opposing beliefs confront each other in an apartment.
The film starts out with Black (Samuel L. Jackson) and White (Tommy Lee Jones) conversing about White's attempted suicide. White feels as though everything ends up in death, and that his life is minuscule in the throes of time.
From White's point of view, no matter how great someone or something is, all that is created eventually fades away. This is the opposite of what Black believes. He believes that there is a God and that we all must go through the troubles of life to get to paradise (Heaven). By his own account, his story is that of a man who has committed murder and was far away from God, but has now changed.
Black feels that he can persuade White from committing suicide. With Black stopping White right before he was about to kill himself, Black feels that this is destiny. In the end, Black is not able to persuade White from suicide; he lets him leave the apartment. When White leaves, Black is left pondering why God would put him in a position to save this man's life knowing that there is nothing that he can do to stop White from going through with the suicide.
Reception.
The film received generally favourable reviews [http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-sunset-limited]. However, describing the film as a "dorm-room argument masquerading as a drama," "The New York Times" panned the film. The characters are deemed empty vessels for the author's language and notions, "so purely rhetorical and dramatically inert that you never feel as if you are in the room with them."

Murder 2

Murder 2 is a 2011 Bollywood psychological thriller film and the quasi-sequel to the 2004 film, "Murder" and the second film in the "Murder film series". It stars Emraan Hashmi, Jacqueline Fernandez and Prashant Narayanan in leading roles, with Sulagna Panigrahi featuring in a pivotal role. Directed by Mohit Suri and produced by Mukesh Bhatt, the film released on 8 July 2011. The theatrical trailer of the film was revealed on 1 June 2011 and also in cinemas with "Ready". It was the second film in a series of quasi-sequels released under the Bhatt Banner including "Raaz ‚Äì The Mystery Continues", "Jannat 2", "Jism 2", "Raaz 3D" and "", each of which had nothing to do with their respective prequels, but somehow fell into the same genre following a similar story. "Murder 2" takes the same plot elements from South Korean film "The Chaser" (2008). The film did well in the box office and was declared a 'blockbuster' by Box Office India. It is one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of 2011.
Plot.
Arjun Bhagwat (Emraan Hashmi) is an ex-police officer who is hungry for money and earns his bread by doing wrong things. He is an atheist (Nastik) but regularly visits church to donate money to orphans. Priya (Jacqueline Fernandez), a model, is in a passionate but confused relationship with Arjun. Whilst Priya is in love with Arjun, Arjun merely lusts for her and he forces upon her in the beginning of movie but she too enjoys his company.
Arjun meets a gangster, Sameer, who has been going through a slump in his business due to an unexplained disappearance of his hookers. Sameer offers him a huge amount of money to locate the missing girls, which Arjun accepts. During his investigation, Arjun finds a phone number linked to the missing girls. He tells Sameer to send a prostitute to the number. Sameer decides to send Reshma (Sulagna Panigrahi), a 17-year-old college newcomer in the business, who has entered prostitution to feed her family, though keeps this a secret from them. Reshma is sent to the house of Dheeraj Pandey (Prashant Narayanan), who is actually a psychopath murderer responsible for torturing and killing the missing hookers. He decides to do the same with Reshma and throws her in a dark well, with the intention of torturing her till her death.
Arjun finds out that Dheeraj is the murderer and tells the police. While Dheeraj is held in jail, the commissioner calls a psychiatrist to extract his confession. Dheeraj tells the doctor that he kills women because he thinks they take advantage of men. He also reveals that he castrated himself and became an eunuch to get rid of his sex addiction, with the help of a fellow eunuch and big-shot politician, Nirmala Pandit. Dheeraj is eventually let out under Nirmala Pandit's influence. Meanwhile, Reshma escapes from the well and tries to find her way out through the forest.
Arjun meets Dheeraj's family, who reveal that Dheeraj used to beat his wife. He next meets a private dancer, Sonia, who had also been tortured by Dheeraj, but managed to escape. Arjun then meets an idol-maker who used to work with Dheeraj. The maker tells him that Dheeraj used to make idols of devils instead of deities and killed the factory-owner who tried to stop him.
Inspector Sadaa (Sudhanshu Pandey) informs Arjun that Dheeraj is free, and the police try to track him down as quickly as possible. Nirmala and Dheeraj enter the same temple where Reshma is hiding. Nirmala and the priest, who had both been unaware of Dheeraj's true nature, are killed by Dheeraj, but not before the priest reveals that Reshma is there. Dheeraj finds the terrified Reshma and brutally murders her, escaping just before Arjun and the cops arrive. Arjun finds Reshma's body and breaks down, feeling guilty and responsible for her death.
Dheeraj targets Priya next whom she calls for a photoshoot and tries to torture her, but Arjun saves her, engaging Dheeraj in a fight as police officers show up. They request Arjun not to kill Dheeraj. Dheeraj then plays the tape he recorded when he was torturing Reshma. Hearing Reshma's pleading cries, Arjun, tormented by her death and blaming himself for it, angrily kills Dheeraj, ending his reign of terror once and for all.
The film ends with Arjun visiting a church with Priya, implying that Reshma's near death has made Arjun realise his love for her.
Production and filming.
The film was shot in Mumbai and Goa. Earlier, Bipasha Basu was offered the part of the leading lady, but she refused. Then Mohit Suri offered the leading role to Asin Thottumkal but, she thought the role of leading lady is not so powerful so she also refused to do this role. The part then went to Jacqueline Fernandez, after also considering actress Sonal Chauhan. Basu was also offered the item number "Aa Zara". When she refused, the song was given to Yana Gupta.
The song "Haal-E-Dil" had to be re-shot to make it more suitable for television promos.
Yana Gupta's item number "Aa Zara" was not aired on television promos as it was too explicit and suggestive for audiences under 18. Instead, the number was shot with Jacqueline Fernandez and Emraan Hashmi, which was aired on television. The original number with Yana was retained in the film.
The DVD of the film was released on 1 August 2011.
Reception.
Critical reception.
"Murder 2" received mixed to positive reviews from various critics of India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 4/5 stars and stated ""Murder 2" is one of the finest crime stories to come out of the Hindi film industry.

Nikhat Kazmi of The Times Of India gave it 3.5/5 stars coomenting,'Murder 2 has enough to give the masses a mast time'.IANS gave it 3/5 stars. Komal Nahta of Koimoi rated "Murder 2" with 3/5 stars and said ‚Äì " It doesn‚Äôt have too much to offer in terms of entertainment as it is a dark film but its plus points are the abundant sex scenes and the good music. Its reasonable budget on the one hand, and wonderful recovery from sale of its satellite, music and worldwide theatrical rights on the other have ensured that the producers have made a handsome profit before release." Pankaj Sabnani of Glamsham gave it 3/5 stars while writng that'An intriguing plot supported by superb performances, make MURDER 2 a 'killer' film'. Daily Bhaskar also gave it 3/5 stars, stating that ' If Emraan plus Jacqueline under the name 'Murder 2' don't arise your interest enough, then the story will surely do the trick'.
Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 2.5/5 stars. Nikita Kapoor of FilmiTadka rated the film with 2.5/5 stars and said ‚Äì "Overall "Murder 2" is an adult, violent, and gruesome movie, which is a good thing, however after a time you feel as if the film was written and directed only for Emraan Hashmi (excessive presence in every frame) which doesn‚Äôt go down well with me." Raja Sen of Rediff gave it 1.5/5 stars and wrote in his review ‚Äì ""Murder 2" is flat, boring and not worth talking about. Even Emraan, sporting less stubble than usual, seems baby-faced as he goes through the motions. It might be inspired by some obscure film, but I don't even care enough to look for its name. By now, I've come to accept that the Bhatts have a bigger DVD collection than me. I do wish they'd stop flaunting it, though."

Swansea City won the final by a scoreline of 4‚Äì2. The Welsh side went into half-time 3‚Äì0 up thanks to two goals from Scott Sinclair and a third from Stephen Dobbie. Reading came close to bringing the score level in the early stages of the second-half through a Joe Allen own goal and a headed goal from Matt Mills. Swansea however, secured victory in the 80th minute with their second penalty kick of the game, converted by Sinclair for his second career hat-trick.
Venue controversy.
Due to the UEFA Champions League 2011 final being held at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2011, it appeared that the three Football League play-off finals may have to be played at a different venue for the first time since 2007 due to the double-booking of Wembley. 
Manchester United's Old Trafford had been confirmed as a possible alternative, while Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff were also said to be under consideration to host the Championship, League One and League Two play-off finals.
It was later confirmed that Wembley would host the Championship play-off final on 30 May, while Old Trafford would host the League Two and League One finals on 28 and 29 May respectively.
Route to the final.
The two-legged semi-finals determined that the final would be contested by Reading and Swansea City.
Second legs.
"Swansea City won 3‚Äì1 on aggregate."
"Reading won 3‚Äì0 on aggregate."
Match overview.
Build-up.
Accountancy firm Deloitte calculated that the Championship play-off final would again be worth about ¬£90,000,000 to the winner, including over ¬£40,000,000 of higher broadcast income, gate receipts and commercial income in the 2011-12 Premier League.
A win would also see Reading return to the Premier League after a three-year absence. Swansea City last played in England's top-flight in 1983, but a victory would make them the first Welsh team to enter the contemporary 'Premier League' since its establishment in 1992.
Summary.
A hat-trick which included two penalty kicks from Scott Sinclair helped Swansea City secure promotion to the Premier League for the first time since 1983. Two goals in two first-half minutes for Sinclair, the first a penalty, and a third from Stephen Dobbie saw the Welsh side go into the dressing room at half-time with a seemingly comfortable 3‚Äì0 advantage.
Television reports suggested that in the tunnel at half-time, Reading's assistant manager Nigel Gibbs and unused substitute Jay Tabb were both sent off by referee Phil Dowd.
Reading struck back early in the second half, however, through a Noel Hunt header which deflected in off Joe Allen for an own goal and a headed goal by Matt Mills to pull the score back to 3‚Äì2. Reading came close to an equaliser when Jem Karacan's shot was deflected onto the post, but Sinclair sealed it for the Swans with an 80th-minute penalty, and in doing so completing his second career hat-trick.

Stalag (pornography)

In the early post-shoah Israel (~ 1950-1960s), Stalag (German, abbreviation for "Stammlager"), was the name for certain types of pornographic magazines or erotic stories, whose main theme was about female SS-officers who enact abusive sexual practices upon male Jewish prisoners, and sometimes also the reverse theme, the male Jewish prisoners' sexual revenge on their tormenters.
Sociologically, this pop/youth phenomenon was seen as a youth-like ("revolt") way to deal with the tabooed immediate traumatic past of their whole people (Shoah), having their examination through this type of medium. The "victim topic" was widely silenced by their parents, plus the majority of the Israeli youth of this time never had any real-life experience with Nazi occupied Europe, as they were either already born from Ashkenazi parents in Israel or had non-European roots (Sephardi, Mizrahi).
With the Eichmann trials in the 1960s, which brought a broad public sensitization about the "victim role" within the Israeli society, Stalags' popularity soon decreased.

Henry Westenra, 3rd Baron Rossmore

Henry Robert Westenra, 3rd Baron Rossmore of Monaghan (24 August 1792 ‚Äì 1 December 1860) was an Anglo-Irish Member of Parliament and peer, from 1843 to 1852 Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan.
Life.
Westenra was Member of Parliament for County Monaghan from 1818 to 1830, again from 1831 to 1832 and from May to July 1834, and finally from 1835 to 1842. On 10 August 1842, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the titles of Baron Rossmore of Monaghan in the peerage of Ireland and Baron Rossmore of Monaghan in the peerage of the United Kingdom, the second title giving him a seat in the House of Lords. From 1843 to 1852 he was Lord Lieutenant of County Monaghan.
A member of a family of individualists, Rossmore was a prolific letter-writer, and his surviving letters have been described as "voluminous, frequently vitriolic, and very instructive".
He was also an accomplished player of the Irish pipes, and was considered to be the equal of a good professional piper. In "Twenty Years Recollections of an Irish Police Magistrate" (1880), Frank Thorpe Porter recalled an evening when Rossmore 
On 25 January 1820 he married firstly, at Edinburgh, to Anne Douglas-Hamilton (born c. 1796 ‚Äì died 1844), daughter of the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon (1756‚Äì1799), and of Harriet Pye Bennett. In right of this wife Rossmore inherited an estate on the Scottish Isle of Arran.
On 19 May 1846, after the death of his first wife, Rossmore married secondly at Camla Vale, County Monaghan, his cousin Josephine Julia Helen (n√©e Lloyd), with whom he had six children:
According to Rossmore's second son, the fifth baron, "My father's favourite amusements were yachting, shooting and fishing, and, oddly enough, playing the bagpipes, at which he excelled." He also reported that Rossmore had suffered from a very bad stammer.
Death.
Rossmore died on 1 December 1860 at his country house in County Monaghan, Rossmore Park, and was buried there on 7 December 1860. The house was abandoned in the 1940s, fell into a ruin, and was demolished in 1975.
His granddaughter Kathleen (1872‚Äì1955), married the 7th Duke of Newcastle in 1899 and was a dog breeder who influenced the Borzoi and Wire Fox Terrier breeds.

Philadelphia Science Fiction Society

The Philadelphia Science Fiction Society (PSFS) is a science fiction club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PSFS is the second oldest group in science fiction fandom and hosted what is considered by some to be the first science fiction convention. Anyone living in the greater Philadelphia area and interested in science fiction, fantasy, horror, whether written or on TV or in the movies; SF, fantasy, and horror art; gaming, board games or video games; comic books/graphic novels; and related arts is welcome.
The PSFS Constitution requires that a person must have attended three meetings before being voted into membership. The traditional club greeting for a person voted in is, "Pay your dues!" shouted in unison.
PSFS was formed in October 1935 as a merger of the 11th chapter of the Science Fiction League (chartered the previous January by Milton A. Rothman), and the Boy's Science Fiction Club, founded at about the same time. It adopted its present name in early 1936. According to John Baltadonis (one of its founders), the new name was inspired by an illuminated sign saying "PSFS" on the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society's building. The idea was that the science fiction group could then claim that the building was its clubhouse. In 1944, it merged with another Philadelphia SF club, the Philadelphia Futurians, and retained the PSFS name.
PSFS meets monthly, usually on the second Friday of the month. Meeting usually have a guest speaker. The Annual meeting is held in January and sees the seven members of the PSFS Board (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and three at-large members) report on their activities for the past year, and elections for new officers are held.
Since 1981, the July meeting of the Society has featured the Hugo Panel. This panel is made up of five members and a varying number of alternates. Panel members and alternates read all the nominees for the Hugo Awards in the categories of Short Story, Novella, Novelette, Novel, and the long form and short form Dramatic Presentations. One panel member summarizes all the nominees in a category, with the other panelists commented after the summaries. All panelists then vote their preference for each nominee, ranking them and the traditional "No Award." Votes are averaged to get the rankings. The panel is usually held several days before the deadline for voting on the Hugos, and helps those PSFS members who are voting.
Each panel member and alternate also makes a recommendation for Best and Worst of all of the nominees. It is not uncommon for the same work to be nominated for both.
PSFS hosts an annual science fiction convention, Philcon, in or near Philadelphia, usually in November. In 2006, the 70th anniversary Philcon was held at the Sheraton Philadelphia City Center Hotel. The first Philcon was held in 1936, making the convention the oldest science fiction convention in the world.
Since 1982, PSFS has sponsored the Philip K. Dick Award for "Best Original SF Paperback", which is awarded every year at Norwescon.
PSFS is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

Fight the Big Bull

Fight the Big Bull is a Richmond, Virginia based improvisatory ensemble with two 2010 recordings selected for NPR's best of the year lists. The band was founded in the mid-00s by guitarist Matthew E. White, one of the organizers of the Patchwork Collective, an arts group dedicated to creating a vital local music scene. The original configuration- called simply Fight the Bull- was a trio with drummer Pinson Chanselle and trombonist Bryan Hooten. The group was subsequently expanded to eight players (or nine, with the occasional addition of ex-Agents of Good Roots percussionist Brian Jones.) The band has had several notable collaborations, notably with Chicago saxophonist Ken Vandermark and with NYC-based slide trumpeter/composer Steven Bernstein (the latter captured on the 2010 recording ""All is Gladness in the Kingdom".") They also collaborated with alternative folk singer David Karsten Daniels, with White providing arrangement to his critically well-received 2010 Thoreau project ""I Mean to Live Here Still"." A performance with Daniels at the NYC club "La Poisson Rouge" was reviewed by the New York Times.
In 2011 White formed Spacebomb Records, featuring members of Fight the Big Bull backing musicians including Washington-based indie folk-rocker Karl Blau and NYC jazz bass clarinetist Jason Stein. The label's first release, Matthew E. White's "Big Inner" received international critical acclaim, including positive reviews in the NY Times and selection as "Artist of the Month" by Rolling Stone. 
White and Fight the Big Bull also provided the music for Duke University's 2011 tribute to Alan Lomax's "Sound of the South" field recordings in a concert featuring the band backing Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Sharon Van Etten and members of Megafaun.

Ken Hall (footballer)

Ken Hall (born 13 November 1980) is a former Australian rules football player from Tasmania. After playing junior football in his home state and spending two years in the seniors at North Hobart, Hall moved to Victoria in 2001 to play for Essendon Football Club's reserves side in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Hall played for the reserves for a year before being drafted onto Essendon's rookie list for the 2002 season. He was promoted to the senior list midway through 2002 and subsequently made his Australian Football League (AFL) debut, although he did not record a statistic in what was to be his only AFL match. Hall was retained on the Bombers' rookie list for 2003 and was again elevated to the senior list during the season. Although he was often named as an emergency after his promotion, Hall was unable to break into the senior team and Essendon delisted him at the end of 2003, ending his AFL career. After being delisted Hall played with the Tasmanian Devils in the VFL for four seasons, before rejoining his old side, Tasmanian Football League (TFL) team North Hobart, in 2008. He won two best and fairest awards and captained the club in his time with North Hobart before retiring at the conclusion of the 2011 season.
Early career.
A Tasmanian native, Hall played junior football for North Hobart Football Club's under 18 side in the Tasmanian Football League (TFL), as well as representing his under 18 state side, the Tassie Mariners, in the TAC Cup. He broke his wrist while playing for North Hobart's under 18s in 1997 and broke the same wrist again in April 1998, this time while playing for the Mariners. Hall recovered from the injury by August and was back playing for the Mariners. Hall was no longer eligible in the under 18s in 1999 and so became a regular fixture in North Hobart's senior side. He played as a defender, was occasionally required to shut down the opposition's star players, and was regularly named as one of the Demons' better players. Hall started the 2000 season playing as a centre half forward for the Demson, despite his relatively small size. In the first game of the year he kicked a match winning goal as North Hobart defeated Clarence by 11 points. By May Hall was again playing on the half back line. His form in defence was described as "reliable" and "solid" by the middle of the season. The young Demons side unexpectedly reached the finals and caused an upset in the semi final against the heavily favoured Burnie Dockers; Hall was named as the Demons' "best player without question" by "The Mercury". At the conclusion of the season, Hall was named as back pocket in the Tasmanian side and the North Hobart played with the most potential.
With the breakup of the TFL at the end of the 2000 season, many of Tasmania's best young footballers, including Hall, moved interstate to try and break into the Australian Football League (AFL) and other quality leagues. Hall began training with AFL side Essendon in December 2000 in the hope of being drafted. He was not drafted that year as the Bombers' lost draft picks due to salary cap violations, but was instead placed on the Bombers' supplementary list, playing with Essendon's reserves side in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
AFL career.
After impressing with the reserves in 2001, Hall was drafted by Essendon with the 46th selection in the 2002 AFL Rookie Draft, thereby placing him on the Bombers' rookie list. Speaking to "The Mercury", Hall described the opportunity as exciting said that it has always been his dream to play in the AFL. In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game. As rookie listed players must be promoted to the senior list before they play a senior AFL match, Hall began the 2002 season playing in the VFL for Essendon's reserves team. When Dean Solomon suffered a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall was one of three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. The Essendon team had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a particularly poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although a poor season for Hall in terms of AFL appearances, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.
Hall was retained on the Bombers' rookie list for 2003. Although Essendon had another poor pre-season, losing four of the five matches they played, Hall played in each of the games. He was described as "performwell" in "The Age" newspaper, and even kicked a goal in the first of the matches. After spending the majority of his career prior to 2003 as a defender, Hall was trialled as a midfielder for the 2003 season, a move which reaped immediate results as he became a "goalscoring weapon" for the Bendigo Bombers‚ÄîEssendon's new VFL-affiliate side‚Äîas well as becoming well known for his penetrating kicking ability. In early August, Hall kicked four goals in a close win against the Northern Bullants in the VFL, and three days later, Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy declared that Hall and two others were in contention to be promoted to the senior list, even though he had missed out on being elevated two weeks prior. Sheedy then proceeded to promote Hall, in place of the injured Joel Reynolds, only a day later to "see if [Hall will be a viable option come finals time". He was immediately named in Essendon's 25-man squad to play against the Western Bulldogs, but failed to make the starting 22. Despite not playing a senior match for the entirety of the regular season, there was media speculation that Hall may be selected for Essendon's elimination final against Fremantle, due to Sheedy stating that he had "little choice" but to select a youthful team for the match and that "it wouldn't worry " to choose an inexperienced player. Despite these comments, Sheedy elected not to play Hall in the match, instead selecting him as an emergency. Essendon won the match and moved on to the semi final, where Hall was again an emergency. Essendon lost the semi final and was eliminated from the finals series, ending the Bombers' season. Although he regularly pushed for selection in 2003 and finished equal second in Bendigo's best and fairest count, Hall was delisted at season's end.
Post-AFL career.
After being delisted by the Bombers, Hall was pursued by multiple clubs; he had offers from VFL sides Coburg, the Tasmanian Devils, Williamstown and Bendigo, as well as South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club West Adelaide before deciding to sign with Devils because he wanted to come home to family and friends. Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and despite moving into the midfield by mid-season he was still a regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West Australian Football League, but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month. Hall finished the home and away season in fifth place in the "The Mercury"s Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and in equal third place in the Devils' best and fairest award. In 2005 Hall was among the best on the ground in an interstate match between the VFL and the SANFL, finished in third in the Devils' best and fairest count, and was runner up in "The Mercury"s Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award. The 2006 season saw Hall named best on ground in his 100th VFL match, a 24-point win over Frankston. He was again runner up in "The Mercury"s Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and also finished as runner up in the team's best and fairest count. In 2007 journalist Matt Burgan, writing for the AFL website, named Hall in his best 22 players currently from Tasmania, with Hall and Cameron Thurley the only two players who were not listed with an AFL club at the time of selection. Hall began the 2007 season being named in the Devils' leadership group. He represented Tasmania in an interstate match against Queensland and was awarded the Lefroy Medal as best on ground for the Tasmanians. Hall finished the year winning his first Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and coming third in the best and fairest.
After 134 matches and 109 goals in the VFL, Hall left the Devils at the end of the 2007 season, citing work and family reasons‚Äîhis wife Lauren was expecting their first child in December 2007. He proceeded to rejoin North Hobart Football Club in the TFL for 2008. In his first year with the club Hall won the George Miller Medal, awarded to North Hobart's best and fairest player for the season. Although Hall did not win back-to-back best and fairests in 2009, he was described as North Hobart's "star player", represented the TFL in a match against the QAFL, and was his team's only representative in the top 10 of the Tassie Medal, awarded to the league's best and fairest player. By 2010, Hall was the captain of North Hobart, and was one of only four players in the TFL to have senior AFL experience. Hall had another good season in 2010; he won his second George Miller Medal, and was described by his coach as one of the league's five best players and the "best tackler in the competition". Despite carrying a nagging ankle injury, Hall started the 2011 season well, with "The Mercury"s Brett Stubbs stating that he was arguably the second best player in the league. He missed five weeks during the middle of the season and although he was named best on ground in his comeback match, Hall said that another injury would probably be the end of his career. He played out the reason of the season and finished in ninth place in the State League Player of the Year award, was named on the half back flank in the TFL Team of the Year, and finished in the top 20 in the Tassie Medal count. Hall retired from football at the end of the 2011 season; his coach at North Hobart described Hall as irreplaceable.

Paul S. Farmer

Paul Stephen Farmer MBE (born 16 April 1950) is a retired British educationalist who developed the use of pop music in school music education in the 1970s, and is reputed to be the first to devise a public examination in the UK exclusively in pop music. He wrote several music education books and became a London comprehensive school head teacher at the age of 33.
Education.
Farmer was born in Woodford Green, Essex, the son of an examiner in HM Patent Office. After Woodford Green Preparatory School he won an LEA grant to Chigwell School, where he learnt to play the organ. He was accepted as an undergraduate by both the Royal College of Music and Royal Academy of Music and attended the former. There he gained the ARCM diploma and took the joint College and Academy graduate course (GRSM). He began his career as a secondary school music teacher and later studied part-time at London University‚Äôs Institute of Education, where he took both the Diploma and MA in Education. In 2013 he was accepted as a graduate student of Cambridge University for a Master's research degree in Education. He became a member of Homerton College.
Awards & Honours.
In 1997 the Chartered Management Institute admitted Farmer to membership as a Fellow (FCMI), recognising his work in school management. In December 2012 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) and the following June he was appointed MBE by HM The Queen in the Birthday Honours list, for services to the community in Suffolk.
Teaching career.
In 1974, after two years' teaching, Farmer was appointed Head of Music at Holland Park School, London, where he developed the use of pop music in music teaching. He created the first public examination in pop music, a mode III Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) which was first administered in 1976. The exam was devised to motivate a group of fourth form pupils who did not want to follow the existing music exam course, including Angus Gaye (aka Drummie Zeb) who went on to form the reggae group Aswad. 
Out of this course emerged what was claimed to be the first classroom textbook in pop music, "Pop Workbook", co-written by Farmer and Tony Attwood and first published in 1978. Demand for the book led to its reprinting in 1979 and 1982. Alongside Holland Park's 4th/5th year course in pop music Farmer devised similar but broader modules for 11-14 year olds which were later published as the "Longman Music Topics".In 1979 the first edition of Farmer's book "Music in the Comprehensive School" was published, written for teachers and students of education, with a slightly larger second edition in 1984.
In 1981 Farmer became Deputy Head of Dick Sheppard School, a mixed comprehensive in Brixton noted for its left-wing activists on the teaching staff. He was subsequently appointed its Head Teacher at the age of 33 and was described as the Inner London Education Authority's (ILEA's) youngest head. His four years of headship were eventful (see WP entry for school) and after successfully applying for the headship of a larger school in 1987, he was eventually succeeded by Philip Lawrence QGM, who was murdered outside the school gates of his own subsequent headship.
Later life.
After the ILEA was abolished Farmer left London for Suffolk and held a number of part-time posts, teaching and examining music, including Choirmaster at Old Buckenham Hall prep school. He also founded and ran the first registered UK charity specialising in exclusively male health problems, "The Men's Health Trust".
In 2003 Farmer was elected to St Edmundsbury Borough Council and Bury St Edmunds Town Council. He has served on St Edmundsbury's cabinet, first as Arts & Culture portfolio holder, where he immediately got embroiled in the "dangerous" headstone controversy and closing the Manor House Museum. The latter action was deeply unpopular with many of his electors and a possible reason that he lost votes in the 2007 election, though still winning by a comfortable majority. From May 2007 he became responsible for finance. He was elected to Suffolk County Council in 2009 and after a spell as town, borough and county councillor resigned from the county council and reduced his borough council responsibilities in 2010 for health reasons. He was re-elected to the town centre historic Abbeygate ward on St Edmundsbury council and Bury St Edmunds town council in May 2011 with a personal record number of votes.

1948 Desert Hot Springs earthquake

The 1948 Desert Hot Springs earthquake occurred on December 4 at 3:43¬†p.m. Pacific Standard Time with a Richter magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum perceived intensity of VII ("Very Strong"). The shock was felt from the central coast of California in the north, and to Baja California in the south, and came at a time when earthquake research in southern California was being resumed following the second world war. The earthquake was one of two that have occurred on the southern San Andreas Fault system in modern times, and although damage was not severe, some serious injuries occurred.
Preface.
The United States' involvement in World War II brought about a lapse in earthquake research in California, due to scientists and other technicians being pulled away for defense-related work, and the ongoing process of using earthquake records to establish their epicenters eventually came to end. The Seismological Society of America cancelled their annual meetings and their "Bulletin" was reduced to half its normal size. In the late 1940s though, research resumed at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena and the University of California, Berkeley in the form of monitoring local earthquakes in order to detect the location of active faults. By 1948, Charles Richter had determined that areas where small earthquakes were occurring did not necessarily mean that a stronger shock would take place at the same location in the future.
Tectonic setting.
The San Gorgonio Pass is the site of the largest irregularities of the San Andreas Fault system, where it becomes extraordinarily complex by branching into a group of discontinuous faults. The convoluted nature of the fault strands there makes estimating the source characteristics of future events in that area challenging. Simultaneous rupture of multiple fault strands can produce exceptionally complex earthquakes, like the 1992 Landers earthquake, which was caused by sequential rupture of multiple strike-slip faults. The site of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is another example of a simple fault within a relatively complex zone. That shock occurred on an unexposed and unknown strike-slip/reverse fault that lies close in proximity to the San Andreas fault in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The San Andreas fault system is similarly complex as it moves through the San Gorgonio Pass, with associated oblique reverse faults that are actively uplifting San Gorgonio Mountain, the tallest peak in southern California. The 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake occurred to the west of the 1948 shock, on the Garnet Hill fault or the Coachella strand of the Banning fault, with of surface rupture. Together, these are the only historical shocks to occur on the portion of the San Andreas fault system that lies south of the Cajon Pass.
Damage.
The shock was felt as far north as Santa Maria and south into northern Baja California, and was described by seismologists as having been stronger than the 1933 Long Beach earthquake that heavily affected southern California, but no one was killed and only relatively minor damage occurred. A few injuries, some serious, occurred at the Palm Springs Theater during the rush to evacuate the building, and another man was injured by falling merchandise and required hospitalization. In downtown Los Angeles, buildings swayed, some windows were broken, and cracks appeared in some buildings. Similar types of damage was also present in Twentynine Palms, El Centro, and Yucca Valley.

When Oscar starts crying, Alec tells Lyn that he may need feeding or changing, but she snaps at him and he becomes concerned. Lyn tells him that she does not love Oscar and Alec calls Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) as he believes Lyn is suffering from postnatal depression. He explains that his wife went through the same thing. Alec investigates Charlie Cassidy's (Cliff Ellen) death when a high level of painkillers are found in his system and some pillow fibres are also found. He asks Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) why she moved Charlie's pillow after he died and after questioning the rest of the family, he tells her to get a lawyer.
Alec later questions her at the police station. Alec also investigates the murder of Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack). He questions Karl and he and his colleague Joanna Douglas (Matilda White) question Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) and Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh). Alec tells Boyd that he was seen threatening Gus and when Boyd lies that he and Sky were watching a movie the night Gus was killed, Alec proves that he was not. Alec next investigates David Bishop (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. He and his officers take David's computer for evidence, when they discover that there are irregularities with the Helen Daniels Trust. When Alec's wife, Trish, becomes seriously ill, Alec tries to make sure she receives the best care. Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) offers Alec money in exchange for information about the identity of a Lassiter's share holder. Alec accepts, but when Paul tries to bribe him into setting up Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney), Alec breaks off the deal. Alec goes to see Boyd after he is involved in an accident with Charlotte Stone (Rachel Gordon). Charlotte tells Alec that Boyd kidnapped her and made theats. She also tells him that Boyd was involved in Terrence Chesterton's (Scott Johnson) murder. Boyd, however, tells Alec that Charlotte murdered Terence and that he has a confession on an MP3 player. Alec and his team do not find the MP3 player and he charges Boyd with kidnapping and fraud. Steph finds the MP3 player and Alec arrests Charlotte for murder.
A year later, Alec investigates the murder of Chris Knight (Luke Mitchell). He talks to Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) about what happened when she was alone with him and she tells him that she pushed Chris over. Bridget's father, Steve (Steve Bastoni), then confesses to hitting Chris. Alec questions Steve and charges him with murder.

The following year, Alec becomes involved with Jill Ramsay's (Perri Cummings) death and the subsequent investigation into Paul Robinson, when he goes on the run. Animal activist Mia Zannis (Alicia Bonnadio) strikes a deal with Alec, whereby she will give him the ring leader of her animal activist group and he will drop any charges against her. Mia tells Alec that Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) is the ringleader and he gives her a week to prove it. Mia plants computer files containing plans of a house owned by an animal testing facility's CEO on to Zeke's laptop and she takes him to the house. Alec catches Zeke about to climb through a window and arrests him and Mia. Alec does not find any evidence on Zeke, as he knew about it in advance. He then tells Alec that Mia is the ringleader and he is willing to testify against her.

In March 2004, it was revealed that Rocco is having an affair with Sindi Watts (Marisa Warrington). Sindi calls him "Tiny" and does not tell her friends his real name. She later decides to end the relationship and she meets up with Rocco, but he tells her that he does not want her let her go. When Sindi tries again, Rocco tells her that he has left his wife and gives her an engagement ring. At first, Sindi cannot bring herself to tell him that she is in love with someone else, but she manages to end their affair. Rocco is hurt and he decides to have her followed to see why she left him. He is "enraged" when he sees photos of Sindi with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Warrington said "It's an understatement to say that Rocco is not happy about Sindi and Toadie. He goes a bit crazy.

Months later, Rocco asks Lou to employ his daughter, Carmella (Natalie Blair). Rocco notices Connor looking at his daughter and he threatens him. However, he begins to suspect that Carmella is dating Connor and makes plans to stop it immediately. Rocco runs into Connor and lies to him that he is going to leave for Sicily.

Rocco spends his time visiting Toadie, who is actually in a coma in a country hospital. It is revealed that while Rocco's henchman was transporting Toadie to Adelaide to give him a fright, they were involved in an accident, which left Toadie badly injured. Rocco becomes upset and he is comforted by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), who is on her way home to Erinsborough. Libby later tells Sindi and Stuart where she met Rocco. They drive to the hospital and find Rocco leaning over Toadie. Rocco tries to run, but Stuart catches him and he is arrested for his crimes. Three years later, Carmella and her sister, Rosetta (Natalie Saleeba) receive a letter from their father, who claims to be dying. They go to visit him in prison and discover that Rocco was lying. He tells them that he is having trouble with his brother, Raimondo (Jeff Kovski), who is trying to destroy one of the family businesses.

Trixie arrives in Erinsborough after being dumped by her double act partner and Nina's (Delta Goodrem) father, Nick. Stapleton told "Inside Soap", "It's a blow to Trixie's ego and it leaves her vulnerable. Her act is in ruins. She puts on a front, but underneath it all she is completely shattered." Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) offers Trixie a solo gig at his pub as he likes her, but she cannot perform in public without Nick, so Nina helps out. Stapleton said that Trixie manages to gain back some confidence and they win the audience over. Stapleton also explained that Nina's relationship with her mother is complicated and there are issues between them. Stapleton and Goodrem did not get much of a chance to explore their character's relationship, as Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma three weeks into the storyline. The storyline was kept, but the scripts were changed so Nina was not involved. Stapleton said "You'll see scenes where we pretend she is upstairs until we got the chance to sort it out properly."

Trixie gives birth to their daughter, Nina, and she travels with her parents to venues across the world. When Nina's schooling begins to suffer the family spend more time in Erinsborough.

When she discovers that Nick has been having an affair with a chorus singer, their personal and professional relationships end. Trixie tries to keep her problems from Nina, but when she attends one of her mother's shows, she sees that Trixie has no confidence. Lou Carpenter sees Trixie, and as he was a fan and had a crush on her, he offers her a regular gig performing in his pub. She accepts, but her first performance is almost a disaster, when she forgets notes and lyrics. Nina joins her mother on stage and rescues the show. Lou and Trixie begin spending more time together and when Trixie tells him that she cannot live with Nick anymore, Lou offers to rent Number 22 to her and Nina. Trixie cooks Lou a meal to say thanks and they kiss.
When Trixie finds out that Nina has signed a contract with Melody Jones (Robyn Arthur) and forged her signature, she is furious. Lou eventually helps Nina get out of the contract. Trixie makes it clear that she and Nick are over and she kisses Lou again. Trixie tells him that she and Nick were not legally married and they can go public with their relationship. Lou encourages Trixie to tell Nina that she is an illegitimate child and when she does, Nina refuses to speak to her mother for a while. Trixie then proposes to Lou, who accepts. Trixie gets an offer of the lead in a touring production of "Hello Dolly" and she asks Lou to invest money in it. Lou and Trixie have a showbiz wedding at Her Majesty's Theatre. Valda Sheergold (Joan Sydney) objects to the wedding and calls Trixie a gold-digger, but she and Lou marry.

Lou remortgages all of his properties and businesses to raise money to fund the Hello Dolly tour. Trixie is excited and she and Lou hold a press conference to announced the tour and their departure for three months.

Lou finds out that Trixie lied to him and he decides to go home, as they have no money. Trixie gets a gig in a themed club, but Lou tells her to go back to Erinsborough. Trixie feels that she has failed Lou and she slips away during the night. Months later, she joins Nick and Nina in India.
The BBC said Trixie's most notable moment was "Walking out on Lou when her show "Hello Dolly" was a flop."
Carmella Cammeniti.
Carmella Cammeniti, played by Natalie Blair, made her first on-screen appearance on 26 November 2003. The character of Carmella was created by the writers, following Delta Goodrem's sudden departure due to illness. Three months worth of scripts were rewritten and Carmella was introduced to fill the void left by Goodrem's character, Nina Tucker. Carmella is the youngest daughter of Rocco and Lucia Cammeniti.
Chris Cousens.

He buys Janae a drink and when she collapses, she realises that it was spiked.

When Serena discovers that her parents are having financial problems, she decides to take up Chris' offer to earn them some money. She and Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) go to Chris's studio and he gives her a lot of attention. Sky thinks that Chris is looking for more than just a model, but Serena enjoys his attention. She goes back to the studio alone and Chris touches her to change her position and offers her a dress for her school formal. Chris gains her trust and he asks Serena if she would join him at a hotel. Serena agrees, but at the hotel she begins to feel uncomfortable. Chris offers her drinks, but she decides to leave. Chris chases her, but Serena gets into a taxi. He sends her flowers to apologise. Serena models for Chris again in a swimsuit. Serena's parents, Liljana (Marcella Russo) and David (Kevin Harrington), find the photos and refuse to let Serena see Chris. When he comes into the Coffee Shop, Liljana slaps him. Serena claims that she loves Chris and continues seeing him in secret. On her birthday, Serena goes to see him and he begins to get heavy with her and she becomes uncomfortable. When he leaves the room, Serena notices a webcam and leaves. She tells her parents and they call the police. David breaks in to Chris' studio and takes his hard drive. Serena later meets Lana Crawford (Bridget Neval) who tells her that she too met Chris and had been taken in by him.

April 7, 2013 as he addressed the Bloomberg sponsored 'Texas Rally for Gun Sense' Martinez stated his intention to ban guns. Martinez singled out a man holding a "Stop the Gun Ban" sign and said "to the gentleman who is dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently, but because of the work we‚Äôre doing here today, we will make your sign legitimate shortly, so you hang on to that."

Awards.
Mike Martinez was named "Best Council Member" by the Austin Chronicle in 2009 and 2010.
Controversy.
Council Emails.
On February 25, 2011 it was reported that Councilman Martinez had referred to City Manager Marc Ott and an Assistant City Manager, both of whom are African-Americans, as "jokes" in an email exchange with Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell. Martinez apologized for his e-mail comment, adding "I regret any instance where my criticisms may have been too personal." One day later, the Austin chapter of The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed an open records request and an ethics complaint against Martinez and Mayor Leffingwell. The City of Austin Ethics Review Commission dismissed the NAACP complaints against Martinez and Leffingwell on April 12, 2011.
In his initial response to an early 2011 public information request for email exchanges between Austin City Council members, Mike Martinez released fewer than a dozen emails.Later, Martinez acknowledged that his office did not collect and release all of the emails responsive to the request. "This is a complete oversight on my part," Martinez said. "There was never an intent to withhold any responsive e-mails, and I accept full responsibility for the oversight.".
Open Meetings.
On March 7, 2011 it was announced that the Travis County Attorney would be seeking emails and documents from Capital Metro to determine to whether or not Martinez and other members of the board were meeting in small groups to avoid a quorum.
It was reported in the "Austin American-Statesman" on April 5, 2011, that Councilman Martinez, along with all but one other councilmember, had decided to forego the $75 monthly taxpayer stipend for cell phone use. "This is my personal phone, and I want to keep it as such. If there are rules I need to comply with, I need to know what the rules are, and they are very unclear." said Martinez in regards to the on-going open meetings and records investigation by the county attorney.
Close to 5 p.m. on Friday, April 8, 2011 Martinez, released more personal emails. As the "Austin American-Statesman" reported, "Martinez used an obscene, derogatory term to describe opponents of a memorial marker planned for East Live Oak Street to honor slain police officer Ralph Ablanedo. The marker was erected in February. He said Friday night that the language he used in describing the memorial opponents was inappropriate but that he also wrote the email without contemplating whether it would be released."
Election code violation.
While voting on May 3, 2011, Martinez snapped a photo of his completed ballot and posted it to Facebook, an apparent violation of state election law as cameras and recording devices are not allowed within 100 feet of a polling location. Martinez responded by deleting the photo from his account.
2012 Election.
Martinez was reelected in his closest race on Saturday May 12, 2012 over his opponent, Laura Pressley. Pressley, a libertarian, had called for a person with business experience on the council. .

Virtual fiber

Virtual Fiber is a term that describes wireless data transmission comparable in data throughput to optic fiber. The term was coined in El Salvador, Central America to describe a communications network service provided by Five Nines Communications, S.A. de C.V. Wireless data transmission is used for mobile telephony, mobile internet service, monitoring, and security applications to name a few.
Present applications for Virtual Fiber (or "Fibra Virtual" as it is known in Spanish) are being developed with Salvadoran governmental agencies in order to service educational centers that currently have no access to hard-wired Internet or telephone service. Virtual Fiber installations avoid the need to install expensive fiber or cabled networks in order to access areas not currently covered by existing networks and are a more efficient option to traditional wireless or hard-wired installations. Another advantage of Virtual Fiber is the fact that it can carry a vast array of signalling protocols within the electromagnetic spectrum and it is not limited by legacy issues.

Green Cinema

The Green Cinema was a film theatre that operated for over half a century in Dublin, Ireland until its closure in 1987. 
Originally known as the Stephen's Green Cinema, it was located on the west side of St Stephen's Green. It opened on Wednesday, 18 December 1935 in an official ceremony performed by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alfred Byrne. The Green was designed by architects Jones and Kelly and had a seating capacity of 1,500. Some seats were equipped with a Fortephone apparatus which enabled patrons suffering from deafness to hear the soundtrack. The first film to be screened at the Green was "Paris Love Song", starring Mary Ellis and Tullio Carminati. 
In October 1987, the Green Cinema was purchased by the Dublin hotelier, PV Doyle, for ¬£1.5m. The cinema was demolished shortly afterwards and the site remained derelict until 2002 when work began on the construction of a new office block. In 2005, the new building was leased by Bank of Scotland (Ireland) as their Irish headquarters.

Thanks! Plain and Simple

Thanks! Plain and Simple, Inc. (‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù), a nonprofit organization established in 2005, creates projects in West Virginia that can be modeled or participated in by many Americans.
Each project that ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù creates has these criteria: to strengthen a community; to have a high probability of success; to have potential to be modeled or improved by people in many places; to clearly express people‚Äôs potential; and to have long-term, positive impacts for people. Model projects help people take action and then reflect on the meaning of what they have done by using experiential learning (see also: action learning, cooperative learning, and service learning). Creating projects that people can participate in while improving society is a major goal of ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù
The organization encourages those with military training to realize they can continue to serve America and expand their skills and build ties within their own community and between diverse American communities. ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù creates model projects with model people.
The West Virginia Rosie the Riveter Project: A Model for America.
The West Virginia Rosie the Riveter Project meets these criteria. ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù has developed ways to involve women who worked throughout America during World War II on ‚Äúmen‚Äôs jobs‚Äù (most notably riveting airplanes and welding ships, but including a broad range of defense industry employment). This work was critical to shortening and winning World War II.
‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù conducts interviews of these ‚ÄúRosie the Riveters,‚Äù now at least 85 years old, to archive in libraries. Yet, it does more - the project provides opportunities for ‚ÄúRosies,‚Äù themselves, to participate in the decision making of teaching their own legacy. The methods and tangible tools ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù has created help American communities find and learn from their ‚ÄúRosies" while adding a distinctive touch to the community's "Rosie" project. For example, a "Rosie" wall can be put in each community with photos of the work of individual and all Rosies. 
TAPP People's Power.
‚ÄúTAPP People‚Äôs Power‚Äù is used by ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù to mean ‚ÄúTangible, Achievable, Positive Projects to increase People‚Äôs Power.‚Äù The organization strives to assure that participants: are willing to take part in the experience, reflect on the meaning of the experience, and are involved in decision-making and problem-solving. A basic assumption is that people often want to take part in positive projects. Evaluations are important throughout, and a body of know-how and show-how is expected to be invaluable to society long term.
Future Projects.
Future projects after the West Virginia Rosie the Riveter Project will still meet our mission of meeting a national need while being tested in West Virginia. Each should: 1) meet local and national needs, 2) model good work ethic, 3) be open to continuous improvement and adaptation, 4) be able to raise needed financial and in-kind support, 4) focus on people‚Äôs strengths, while recognizing that limitations may exist (for instance, ‚ÄúRosies‚Äù and veterans often have health issues that slow advance; yet, progress is clear).

Canadian Spinal Research Organization

The Canadian Spinal Research Organization is a nationally registered charity whose mission is improve the physical quality of life for persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and related neurological deficits, as well as reduce the number of spinal cord injuries through awareness and prevention programs.
History.
In 1982, Ray Wickson was involved in an accident leaving him paralyzed. While recovering at the Lyndhurst Rehabilitation Centre, Ray Wickson began to inquire about the possibility of finding a cure for paralysis, learning from SCS, that since 1945 through the 1980s, there had been little research conducted on spinal cord injuries. In 1983, Wickson joined SCS in the US. He was asked to form a Canadian office, of which he did so shortly thereafter.
SCSC (Spinal Cord Society Canada), became a branch office for SCS U.S.A, founded by Dr. Charles Carson. Ray Wickson became the Canadian head of this international organization dedicated to "cure research", which focused on finding a cure for chronic spinal cord injuries. In those early days in the mid 1980s there were two main chapters in existence that were raising funds for research in Ontario. One such chapter in Mississauga Ontario, headed by Jocelyn Lovell, the other in Barrie headed by Antony Gariepy. 
In 1987, Ray Wickson was asked to resign from SCS due to a crisis of leadership, and shortly after this, he quit, leaving him free to create an identical organization in Canada called CSRO. The Canadian Spinal Research Organization was originally a concept from SCS U.S.A. founder, Dr. Charles Carson who observed the long held hopeless dogma promulgated by the medical establishment in respect to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries, and the need to challenge the status quo. 
After his resignation in 1987, Wickson connected with Barry Munro, who was a patient in rehab at Lyndhurst Hospital at the time, after he sustained a spinal cord injury from a diving accident. Wickson started the CSRO on February 14, 1984 under the name Spinal Cord Society of Canada. At that time, no other chapters followed him into this new venture other than his newest recruit Barry Munro. 
Wickson uses the rational and structure of SCS U.S.A., as the basis for CSRO, which originated by Dr. Charles Carson of Fergus Falls, Minnesota. As the name Spinal Cord Society Canada was a legitimate licensed charity in Canada under the hospices of the American headquarters, Wickson's formation of CSRO was done so in attempt to distance himself from them, but at the same time utilizing the funds generated under their name. He even went so far as to litigate the release of funds from Chapters that refused to follow his attempt to tear apart the organization. Wickson eventually paid himself out of these funds because up to this point his involvement was purely on a volunteer basis. CSRO now became a way for him and his new recruit Barry Munro to secure paid positions.
Together, Munro and Wickson using the funds generated under the banner of SCS, formed the CSRO to legitimize their new requirement of receiving a financial renumeration. Initially, operating out of Wickson's house, the charity generated approximately $25,000 in the first few years. On June 12, 1992, the organization changed its name to the Canadian Spinal Research Organization from SCSC to distance their volunteer past.
Mission.
The Canadian Spinal Research Organization is dedicated to the improvement of the physical quality of life for persons with a spinal cord injury and those with related neurological deficits, through targeted medical and scientific research. The CSRO is also committed to the reduction of spinal cord injuries through awareness programs for the general public and prevention programs for targeted groups.
Spinal cord injuries (SCI).
Spinal injury and spinal cord injury results when the body is exposed to forces greater than body parts can withstand. Force in amounts that can cause such damage commonly result from events such as auto crashes, falls from heights, falls, crashes and blows associated with sport and recreation, contact with an unmovable object or surface when diving, or from penetration by gunshot or sharp objects.
Spinal injury.
Sometimes only the bony structures and/or ligaments are damaged, resulting in various kinds of fractures (broken bones and discs or dislocations) and an unstable spine. Though the area affected will probably need to be immobilized until healing results, the spinal cord is not affected.
Spinal cord injury.
When the injury involves the spinal cord, the flow of messages between the brain and the rest of the body is interrupted or broken. The interruption results in a decrease or loss in motor function, sensation, or both below the level of injury and will also affect the bowel, bladder, and sexual function.
Quadriplegia and paraplegia.
Injuries to the spinal cord are classified as quadriplegia or paraplegia depending on the location of damage to the spinal cord, also known as the severity of the injury.
Quadriplegia - The nerves that supply feeling and movement to the arms and hands, as well as the nerves of the diaphragm come from the nerve roots in the cervical spinal cord (C1-C7) or neck region. If the spinal cord is injured in this area, movement and sensation may be interrupted to the arms and hands as well as the rest of the body, including muscles in the abdomen, chest and legs as well as bladder, bowel, and sexual function. If the injury is high enough that the diaphragm is affected, breathing problems will also occur; thus, quadriplegia is a condition that causes paralysis of both the upper and lower limbs.
Paraplegia - An injury to the cord in the thoracic (T1-T12) or lumbar spine (L1-L5) may affect the legs and trunk (abdomen and lower back) as well as bladder, bowel and sexual function, but arms and hands remain unaffected.
SCI & CSRO research.
The CSRO strives to find a cure for paralysis and improve the quality of life for people with spinal cord injuries by funding SCI research. Ninety percent of what we know about SCI has been discovered in the last 20 years. Currently, there is no cure for SCI; however, there have been many advances in the laboratories around the world.
Research previously funded by the CSRO.
The CSRO has supported a number of research efforts over the years, leading to promising discoveries and therapies. A great accomplishment of the CSRO came in late January 2010. After 20 years of development, CSRO and Accorda Therapeutics announced marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for AMPYRA‚Ñ¢ (generic name dalfampridine), an oral treatment to improve walking in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The CSRO has also funded the administration of L1 in promoting nerve regeneration, and Clenbuterol-a potential therapeutic aid towards the limitation of muscle wasting associated with spinal cord injuries.
Projects currently funded by the CSRO.
Currently the CSRO is funding Gene Therapy as well as Enteric Glia.
Cure and care research.
Cure research focuses on the causes of a condition or illness and seeks to not only arrest deterioration, but also reverse the process, thereby achieving complete recovery. While there are a great number of studies, realistically there will not be a solitary finding that provides "the silver bullet" to cure SCI. More probable is the discrete development of a multitude of therapies that used in combination will enable individuals to return to the level of functioning they experience pre-injury. The current areas of cure research are neuroprotection, regeneration, transplantation, and rehabilitation.
Care research focuses on the means of improving the quality of life for individuals living with SCI. One means of achieving increased quality of life is by advancing the ability of persons with SCI to function successfully within the community. Researchers make strides in this area by investigating and improving "best practice models", which caregivers, peers and family members use to treat and educate consumers. One of the primary goals of early intervention and stabilization is to promote the recovery of function. Typically, care oriented research is conducted in clinical settings such as rehabilitation centers. The current areas of care research are physical and psychosocial.
Fundraising and awareness.
The CSRO and ASRO have organized several campaigns and programs that educate the general public about spinal cord injuries and raise money for spinal cord injury (SCI) research.
Shoot for a cure.
One program that the CSRO has been involved in since 2000 is the Shoot For A Cure campaign. Initially involving only the hockey community, Shoot For A Cure has expanded to target the curling, motor-sport, and horse racing industries in order to raise awareness about spinal cord injuries in the general public and raise money for SCI research.
The Shoot For A Cure campaign also seeks to promote prevention of hockey-related spinal cord injuries through the Play it Cool‚Ñ¢ prevention program. Since the induction of Shoot For A Cure, over $2,000,000 has been raised to further research and development for continued commitment to find a cure and prevent future injury.
Play it cool.
A program under the Shoot For A Cure awareness campaign is the Play It Cool‚Ñ¢ youth injury prevention program. Play It Cool‚Ñ¢ is a skill enhancement program, which aims to reduce the incidence of neurotrauma in hockey. This program is used to equip minor hockey players with the knowledge and skills that may prevent a hockey-related spinal cord injury and is developed to target hockey players, parents, coaches, and officials. Built on the foundation of scientific research by Dr. William Montelpare at Lakehead University, the Play It Cool website is an online platform uniting partners from the hockey community across North America to ultimately be the solution for creating a safer more effective game of hockey.

Glenfiddich House

Glenfiddich House, also known as Harrison Hall, was built in three sections, with the first section completed in 1780. When viewing the house from the street, the left wing of the residence is the original home. Between 1850 and 1860, the main block of the home was built for Henry and Jane Harrison (hence Harrison Hall), by the Norris Brothers of Leesburg, VA, and is a good example of the Italianate style of home. The property still includes historic outbuildings: a log springhouse with V-notched corners, circa 1800, and a brick meat house, circa 1855. 
During the Civil War Harrison Hall became a hospitality center for Confederate officers passing through the area. After the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21, 1861, wounded soldiers were tended to at Harrison Hall. Among those was Colonel E. R. Burt of the 18th Mississippi. He died of his wound four days after the battle.
The most famous Civil War visitor was none other than General Robert E. Lee. The general broke one of his hands and sprained the other when his horse, Traveler, shied from a fast approaching courier. On September 4, 1862, General Lee received treatment at Harrison Hall; that evening he held a war council, planning the confederate invasion of Maryland, which ended with the Battle of Antietam. Among the planners in attendance were Generals Lewis Armistead, Thomas ‚ÄúStonewall‚Äù Jackson, James Longstreet, and James Ewell Brown ‚ÄúJeb‚Äù Stuart. 
From 1966-68 poet and author James Dickey resided at Glenfiddich House, an easy commute to his position as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It was during his stay that he began his manuscript for his novel Deliverance. The desk that he wrote the first drafts of the novel is still at Glenfiddich House.

Peter Cleary

Peter Joseph Cleary (18 September 1950 ‚Äì 15 April 1976) was an Irish republican and a leading member of the 1st Battalion of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s South Armagh Brigade. He held the rank of Staff Officer and served as the unit's treasurer. He was implicated by journalist and author Joe Tiernan in the killing of Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal and alleged Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member Robert McConnell. Ten days after the purported killing, Cleary himself was shot dead by the SAS after being arrested at the home of his girlfriend outside Forkhill. He was the first person in Northern Ireland to be killed by the SAS, following their full deployment to Northern Ireland in January 1976. According to the SAS, he was shot after attempting to take the rifle from the officer who was guarding him in a bid to escape.
Irish Republican Army.
Cleary was born on 18 September 1950 in Northern Ireland, the second eldest of the 13 children of Hugh and Mary Cleary. He was brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, and according to author Tony Geraghty he was originally from Newry, County Down; although David McKittrick's book "Lost Lives" states he had lived in Magee Terrace, Belleeks, Newtownhamilton, County Armagh. At some stage after The Troubles broke out in 1968, Cleary joined the 1st Battalion of the South Armagh Brigade of the IRA. He served as the unit's treasurer and held the rank of Staff Officer. He made his living as a scrap-metal dealer.
Author and journalist Joe Tiernan claims that Cleary was part of the three-man IRA unit that ambushed and killed part-time UDR corporal Robert McConnell in the garden of his home at Tullyvallen, near Newtownhamilton. Cleary and his team hid in the bushes and when McConnell appeared, Cleary shot him twice in the head, killing him. McConnell had allegedly been a member of the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and part of the "Glenanne gang" that carried out sectarian killings. In 1993 Yorkshire Television aired a programme, "The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre", which implicated McConnell in the 1974 Dublin car bombings. The narrator also claimed he was a British Military Intelligence agent with links to Captain Robert Nairac. RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir confirmed this in his affidavit and named him as the perpetrator of a series of sectarian attacks. He also alleged that McConnell had been set up by Military Intelligence who passed on confidential information about McConnell to the IRA, through Nairac, in an attempt to infiltrate the organisation. The IRA upon receiving this information ordered the execution of McConnell.
Killing.
Cleary was on the run, living in the Republic of Ireland; however on 15 April 1976 (ten days after the McConnell shooting), he returned secretly to Northern Ireland where he was promptly arrested at the home of his pregnant girlfriend outside Forkhill. He was seized by an SAS team who had been watching the house from observation positions as part of a week-long surveillance job and taken to a field to await transport by a military helicopter, as travelling by road was deemed too risky for British military personnel. On the previous 31 March at 9h30am a group of Scots soldiers and SAS men had raided the Cleary family home in Magee Terrace, Belleeks. In their account of Cleary's killing, the SAS claimed that while four of the men were holding lanterns guiding the aircraft to a landing in the dark, the young officer (who was allegedly on his maiden SAS operation) left to guard Cleary was forced to shoot him twice after the latter made an attempt to wrest the officer's rifle from him in a bid to escape. Cleary, although gravely wounded, was still alive, and an NCO then took the rifle from the officer who had shot him, and killed him with a final, third shot to "end his misery". Before returning the weapon to its owner, he wiped away his fingerprints. An inquest into the killing was held nine months later. A witness who had been inside the house from where Cleary was arrested testified that immediately after the soldiers had taken Cleary away he heard somebody crying over the ditch, then a single shot. Three of the SAS team attended the inquest, a statement was read on behalf of the officer (using the "nom de Guerre" "Soldier A") who first shot Cleary. The statement defended his actions by describing Cleary as "heavier and stronger" than him, as well as a "notorious killer"; "Soldier A" went on to say
An open verdict was returned by the inquest.
Author Mike Ryan claimed in his book "Secret Operations of the SAS" that Cleary had actually managed to escape and was shot by the pursuing soldiers who had ordered him to stop as he tried to make his way to the Republic of Ireland border. Cleary received three shots to the chest.
Peter Cleary was the first person killed by the SAS since they were deployed to Northern Ireland in full force in January 1976 by order of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the wake of the Kingsmill massacre; although there had been an SAS presence in the province prior to then, having had a proxy intelligence role through the 14th Intelligence Company, and their sub-unit 4 Field Survey Troop.
John Weir claimed in his affidavit that Robert Nairac's cover had been blown when he was recognised at the SAS shooting of Peter Cleary, the implication being that Nairac had been present when the incident took place.
On 17 April 1976 the "Cork Examiner" described Cleary's killing as "an act of utter folly".

Walter Raleigh (priest)

Walter Raleigh or Ralegh (1586‚Äì1646) was an English divine, Dean of Wells from 1641. He died after a violent attack, a prisoner in his own deanery.
Life.
Raleigh was the second son of Sir Walter Raleigh's elder brother, Sir Carew Raleigh, of Downton, Wiltshire. His mother was Dorothy, widow of Sir John Thynne, of Longleat, Wiltshire, and daughter of Sir William Wroughton, of Broadheighton, Wiltshire. He was educated at Winchester School and at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated as commoner on 5 November 1602. He graduated B.A. in 1605 and M.A. in 1608.
Raleigh took holy orders, and in 1618 became chaplain to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. In 1620 he was presented by his patron to the rectory of Chedzoy, near Bridgwater, Somerset; in the following year he received the rectory of Wilton St Mary, Wiltshire. About 1630 he was chosen a chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles I, who admired his preaching. In 1632 he was made rector of Elingdon or Wroughton, and in 1635 of Street, Somerset. In 1634 he was minor prebendary of Combe in Wells Cathedral, and received besides the rectory of Street-cum-Walton. In 1636 he was created D.D. In 1637 he became dean and rector of St Buryan, Cornwall, and in 1641 he was chosen to succeed Dr George Warburton as dean of Wells.
Among Raleigh's friends were Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, Henry Hammond, William Chillingworth, and Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. A royalist and a member of the Falkland circle, Raleigh suffered during the First English Civil War. While he was attending the king, his rectory-house at Chedzoy was plundered by the parliamentarians, his property stolen, his cattle driven away, and his wife and children expelled from their home. But in the western counties fortune was for some time favourable to the king, and Raleigh was enabled to return to Chedzoy. He continued to live there in safety until the defeat of George Goring, lord Goring, at Langport in 1645. Raleigh then fled to Bridgwater, and on the fall of the town (21 July 1645) surrendered to the parliamentarians. From Bridgwater he was sent a prisoner to Chedzoy, but on account of his weakness he was allowed to live in free custody in his own house.
The departure of Fairfax and Cromwell was for Raleigh the beginning of new troubles. One Henry Jeanes, being anxious, it is said, to secure the rectory for himself, carried off the dean to Ilchester, and there had him lodged in the county gaol. From Ilchester the prisoner was removed to Banwell, and then to the deanery, Wells, where he was entrusted to the care of David Barrett, a shoemaker.
Death.
Raleigh was harshly dealt with, and mortally wounded in a scuffle. According to Simon Patrick, Raleigh was murdered while attempting to screen from Barrett's curiosity a letter that he had written to his wife. He died on 10 October 1646, and was buried in the choir of Wells Cathedral, before the dean's stall.
Raleigh's eldest son George attempted to bring Barrett to justice. A priest-vicar of Wells named Standish was arrested for having permitted the burial of the dean in the cathedral, and kept in custody. The handling of these matters in the "Sufferings of the Clergy" by John Walker, half a century later, has been used to illustrated the methods and problems of Walker's historiography.
Works.
Raleigh's papers were preserved in the family, and thirteen of his sermons were given by his widow to Simon Patrick, who published them in 1679, with a biographical notice, and a Latin poem written in praise of Raleigh by a Cambridge admirer, who is probably Patrick himself. The volume is entitled "Reliqui√¶ Raleighan√¶, being Discourses and Sermons on several subjects, by the Reverend Dr. Walter Raleigh". The editor praises Raleigh's quickness of wit, ready elocution, and mental powers, but says that he 'was led to imitate too far a very eminent man,' whose name is not given.
In 1719 Laurence Howell published "Certain Queries proposed by Roman Catholicks, and answered by Dr. Walter Raleigh", with an account of Raleigh copied from Patrick. Of a tract on the millennium which Raleigh is said to have written, no trace remains.
Family.
Between 1620 and 1623 Raleigh married Maria, daughter of Sir Ralph Gibbs. During the civil war she took refuge at Downton, where she was joined by her husband.

Ernie Mills (cyclist)

Ernest Victor Mills (10 April 1913 ‚Äì 1972), commonly known as Ernie Mills, was an English amateur cyclist who, with his teammate Bill Paul, set the British 12-hour record on a tandem in 1934 and re-established it in 1936 with a 'world's best performance'. In 1937, in Italy, they set the world one-hour tandem record which stood for 63 years until September 2000. The Addiscombe Cycle Club teammates set 20 world and British records at both short and long distances.
Mills represented Great Britain at the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin and won a bronze medal in the Team Pursuit. At the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney Australia, he won a bronze medal in the 1,000 metre Time-Trial
In 1937 "Cycling Weekly" jointly awarded him and Bill Paul their own page in the Golden Book of Cycling.
Personal life.
Mills lived in the Addiscombe area near Croydon, London.
Career.
In 1934 Mills was paired with his teammate, William George (Bill) Paul, ('stoker') (1910 - 29 January 2003) also from the Addiscombe Cycle Club in Croydon. Initially they had been on opposing tandem teams but together they covered over 30 miles in one hour in 1936 and won a 10 minute pursuit race in less than four minutes.
Together they set the British 12-hour tandem record in 1934, and, after losing it in 1936 to both G.A.Birtchnell and C.G.Taylor, and later C.C.Melhuish and H.G.Chapman, Mills and Paul then retook the record in September 1936 with a 'world's best performance'.
In 1936 Mills and Paul set a British record for a 30 mile ride on a tandem, covering the distance in 1 hour 5 minutes 3 seconds.
He represented Great Britain at the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, and won a bronze medal in the Team Pursuit along with his colleagues Harry Hill, Ernest Johnson and Charles King.
In 1937 Mills and Paul set the 'World Tandem Hour Record', 31.06 miles (49.991¬†km), at the Velodromo Vigorelli (Velodromo Comunale Vigorelli) track in Milan owned by 'Vigorelli Cycles'. The trip had been funded by readers of "Cycling" magazine. This record stood until Sept 23rd 2000 at Manchester Velodrome when it was beaten by Simon Keeton and Jon Rickard of Rutland Cycling Club.
Mills represented England at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney Australia, where he won a bronze medal in the 1,000 metre Time-Trial behind the Australians Bob Porter and Tasman Johnson. He finished fourth in the road race and also competed in 10 miles scratch event.
As of 2011 Mills and Paul's 1938 100-mile tandem record at Addiscombe Cycle Club of still stands.
Commemoration.
Addiscombe Cycle Club.
Mills is commemorated every year at Addiscombe C.C. by an array of awards presented in his name for all sporting categories, road, track, ladies, juniors and the open time trial. 
The Golden Book.
Mills & Paul's achievements were celebrated in 1937 when Cycling Weekly awarded them their own page in the Golden Book of Cycling.
Cigarette cards.
In 1939 Mills and Paul's efforts were celebrated nationally when John Player & Sons issued a Cigarette card of them on their tandem. In a series of 50 cards called "Cycling 1839-1939", they were featured on card no.45 titled "Tandem track position".

Frankie Teardrop

"Frankie Teardrop" is a song by Suicide from their acclaimed first album "Suicide", released in 1977. The song tells a story of a young father and poverty-stricken factory worker whose destitution drives him to insanity. One day, Frankie comes home from work, murders his wife and child, and then commits suicide. The narrative then continues to follow him into hell. The music backing this is sparse, featuring just a simple keyboard riff, drum machine, and the vocal line, creating a chilling atmosphere. Singer Alan Vega's "Dark, inhuman screams" add to the claustrophobic nature of the piece.
Reviews.
The track has had many reviews for its unique nature, both in its disturbing nature (Nick Hornby in his book "31 Songs" described it as something you would listen to "Only once"), and for its political viewpoint, by Allmusic as "More literally and poetically political than the work of bands who wore their radical philosophies on their sleeve". Bruce Springsteen has cited that he loves this song in interviews, and that it was an influence on his album "Nebraska". Pitchfork cited it as "track that gets most of the ink" in terms of critical acclaim, and jokingly as ""Taxi Driver": The Musical" when citing the album "Suicide" in their "100 Greatest 70s Albums" list.

Turok (video game)

Turok is the 2008 installment in the first-person shooter Turok video games series and is loosely based on comic series under the same name. The game was released in February 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was later ported on to Microsoft Windows in April 2008. "Turok" was developed by Propaganda Games, published by Touchstone Games and distributed by Disney Interactive Studios. A sequel, identified only as ""Turok 2"", was planned for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 but it was cancelled before it was officially announced.
Plot.
The player takes on the role of a soldier named Corporal Joseph Turok. Previously, Turok was a member of the Wolf Pack, a specialized military detachment whose members were trained in black ops by General Roland Kane. After a falling out with the group, Turok was reassigned to a general military unit known as Whiskey Company. The team has been assembled to apprehend his former mentor and return him to Earth. After committing various war crimes, Kane had disappeared three years earlier only to surface on a backwater world. Unbeknownst to Whiskey Company, the planet is under the jurisdiction of the Mendel-Grumman (M-G) Corporation, and Kane is in command of a private army of M-G soldiers and equipment.
At first, the crew shuns Turok, thinking that he is an inexperienced fighter, untrustworthy, and a liability. One particular member, Slade, has a personal grudge against Turok because his brother Robert was also a member of Wolf Pack, and was killed in the same battle in Columbia from which Turok had reputedly fled, earning him his dubious reputation.
On approach to their destination, their starship is shot down from orbit and crash lands on the terraformed surface, where Turok quickly learns that the jungles covering the surface, even the planet are inhabited by dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are wild and dangerous, and the M-G soldiers have been capturing them to be used as experimental weapons for General Kane, meaning a three-way battle between Whiskey Company, the M-G soldiers, and the dinosaurs takes place throughout the game. Upon crashing, many of Whiskey Company are killed by the crash or are either killed by dinosaurs or M-G soldiers.
Turok is first guided through the ship's engine blocks by two unnamed soldiers and then by Sergeant Morris, the senior NCO of the company. Upon seeing where the rest of the ship came down, Morris attempts to contact members of Whiskey Company but is ambushed and killed by a raptor. Turok travels a little further on and discovers Morris' mangled body being eaten by mini raptors. He takes his gun and proceeds to kill them. Turok then proceeds to find other Whiskey Company members on his own, following wreckage and bodies. He soon finds a soldier who is gunned down by an M-G soldier before Turok can help him. He eventually finds Slade, who is less than pleased to meet Turok. They proceed to get to the main crash site, finding Turok's bow in the process. The pair navigate the jungles, an M-G outpost, a dinosaur-infested valley, and a raptor cave. They eventually link up with Reese, Whiskey Company's resident sniper, and stumble upon a group of M-G troops searching starship wreckage for survivors before heading through a lair of feline-like raptors. The group eventually makes their way to the crash site where they find Chief Engineer Carter, heavy weapons trooper Jericho, weapons specialist Logan, Whiskey Company's medic Parker, second-in-command Henderson, Company leader Cole, Chief Security Officer Louis, technician and pilot Shepard,and soldiers Foster and Gonzales. After resting up, Turok is sent by Cole on a mission to find the comm unit from the ship's wreckage to attempt to call for help.
While searching for the unit, he is discovered by Grimes, a member of Wolf Pack and one of Turok's trainers. Grimes left Turok with a warning at knife-point before vanishing as quickly as he appeared. Turok then finds Cowboy engaged by several M-G soldiers. After clearing out a camp, Cowboy is wounded by a hidden enemy's arrow moments before Foster, Gonzales, Parker, Slade and Logan arrive. Slade then accuses Turok of deliberately shooting Cowboy, mocking his native American heritage while he's at it. While Parker, Logan and Slade take Cowboy back to the camp, Turok, Gonzales, and Foster continue looking for the comm unit. Logan at this point starts to exhibit signs of mental trauma.
The marines shortly came across what looked like an abandoned outpost, and Foster, who was on point, got shot by a sniper. Turok and Gonzales assault the outpost, taking out M-G troops and raptors in the process before having to defend said outpost from an M-G counterattack. Moving deeper into the jungle, they finally find more wreckage from the ship and take out the M-G troops patrolling the area. Gonzales finds the comm unit on a rocky ledge and celebrates the fact, only for him to get snatched in by Mama Scarface (A giant T-Rex who has scars on her right side from battles with MG soldiers) and carried off. Turok sets off in pursuit. During the chase, Turok ends up in the nest of the T-Rex and is attacked by her offspring. When he locates the Comm Unit, Mama Scarface herself appears and attacks him. During the battle, she gets her right eye knifed, but she throws Turok off of her and out of her lair. After regaining consciousness, Turok finds that night has fallen and he now has to make his way back to camp while navigating through an abandoned outpost and fighting raptors along the way.
Reaching the camp, he informs the others that Foster and Gonzales didn't make it. Slade is not happy about the news and claims that Gonzales was his closest friend. In a suggestive manner, he challenges Turok to a knife fight and accuses him of being a traitor. Cowboy, having recovered from the arrow, defends Turok, stating that Turok held his own during that ill-fated mission with Wolf Pack, and Jericho drags a defiant Slade out of the way. After that argument, Turok gave the comm unit to Cowboy and thanked him for his support. Cole, about to inform Turok of something, is suddenly killed by an arrow fired from Grimes and a battle ensues at the camp as M-G troops storm the area. Whiskey Company wins the battle, fending off waves of infantry and even a spider tank, but also lost Henderson, Lewis, and Parker. Even worse, the comm unit was destroyed during the fight. A brief clash for leadership occurred until Logan, unofficially, takes command. Jericho then insists that they go hunt down M-G in retaliation for their fellow soldier's deaths but an approaching storm soon changes his mind. Upon hearing a strange noise along with a large light beam in the distance of the forests, Logan orders Turok and Slade to investigate. Knowing that this was a suicide mission, Carter speaks up but is ordered to go with them. The rest of the company then search for a way off of the planet.
While en route to where the light was coming from, Turok and company witness a raptor being pulled down into a giant hole by an unknown force and find more holes of the same kind the closer they got to the light. When they arrived at their destination, a seemingly derelict outpost, they discover that the light emitted was from an APC that was pulled halfway into the ground. Forcing their way into the outpost, they come across a log entry from Kane. Kane details that these scorpion-like bugs have a potent neurotoxin and, after an accident which killed several M-G scientists, states that he had found this interesting element in the bugs' blood and has begun analysis. Carter, who was on a separate computer, soon finds the location of a shuttle in an abandoned substation not far from the main M-G base. Turok relays this info to Logan, only to be attacked by giant scorpion bugs, which drag Carter underground. Managing to escape from the swarm, Turok and Slade find a chopper on a landing pad on the other end of the outpost. Before they can even reach the landing pad, the ground collapses and Turok and Slade are separated. Turok then had to navigate the dark cave system, fending off bugs before reuniting with Slade at an underground river. Their reunion was cut short as a kraken-like creature emerges from the water and Turok manages to kill it by using geothermic gas fissures and a flamethrower. Slade begrudgingly thanks Turok for saving his life, having now come to respect the former Wolf Pack soldier. They eventually escape the caves and linked up with what's left of Whiskey Company. Turok informs them that Carter was killed by the bugs and Logan comments on how people keep dying around him.
Upon seeing a patrolling convoy coming for their position, Logan accuses Turok of drawing M-G soldiers to them since the beginning, and threatens shooting Turok. A battle begins, in which Turok, Shepard, Logan and Jericho are split from the other three, Logan and Jericho are killed in battle. Turok and Shepard go one The two escape the area and link up with Slade, Cowboy and Reese. They reach the hanger where the ship was located, only to discover that the ship was long destroyed by the environment. With no other choice, they decide to get into the main base. Upon discovering a back entrance into the MG base, Reese is killed by an arrow to his eye. The four remaining soldiers enter the base, indirectly helped by Mama Scarface who was rampaging at the Base's gate. Having entered the base, they come across a log from Kane, stating that he had developed a nerve gas from the scorpion-bug's blood, a gas that can kill any living creature before dissipating without a trace. Now the group knows they have to destroy this base to stop this weapon from being spread. Turok sets charges on the generators, fighting off both M-G sentries and flying bugs. However, he and the others are captured by Kane. During the ensuing argument between Kane and Turok, Cowboy speaks out, saying none of them would have survived this long without him and Kane kills him. Turok detonates the charges, which results in the death of Grimes.
Turok, Shepard and Slade navigate their way through the collapsing base, battling MG soldiers and raptors. Soon they reach the ship but Turok refuses to board it and goes to prevent Kane from escaping. He destroys Kanes ship using rocket turrets. After destroying the starship, Turok is faced with an intense knife battle under the ruins of the MG Base with Kane, in which Turok kills Kane. Soon after this event had occurred, Turok is confronted by Mama Scarface, who is driven insane by the loss of her brood, for final time. Turok manages to eventually put Mama Scareface at ease by carefully placing a grenade in its ruptured eye which causes the "T. rex"'s upper jaw to explode. Turok is showered by the blood of the "T. rex" whilst witnessing the other members of Whiskey Company (Shepard and Slade) return to save him in a Starship. Turok enters the ship and the three friends finally escape from the planet.
Characters.
Joseph Turok
The game's main titular protagonist. He was a former member of Wolf Pack, and a former military operative given extensive training in knife fighting and use of the longbow, in addition to training with more conventional firearms. Turok left Wolf Pack because he did not agree with the orders he was given. He joined Whiskey Company and was one of the few that survived. Like Tal'set and Joshua Fireseed in the previous continuity, Joseph has Native American heritage, specifically Kiowa. He is one of only three marines who survives to the end of the game. (Voiced by Gregory Norman Cruz.)
Slade
A member of Whiskey Company that holds a grudge against Turok after his older brother Robert, a member of Wolf Pack, was killed in action, something he blames Turok for. Slade has a short temper that is seen many times throughout the game (sometimes snapping at Carter), and whose best friend is Gonzalez. He takes a particular delight in using the flamethrower. Slade finally respects Turok after Turok saves him from a giant serpent seen underground. One of only three marines who survives to the end of the game. He is a Corporal according to the other characters but, like Cowboy, he bears no insignia on his armor.(Voiced by Ron Perlman.)
Shepard
A technician for Whiskey Company that is prone to complaining and annoys Turok because he talks too much. He is the only one able to pilot a spacecraft in Whiskey Company. One of only three marines who survives to the end of the game. (Voiced by Donnie Wahlberg.)
Cowboy
A marine and the only one that accepts Turok from the start. When Turok first encounters Cowboy, Cowboy is shot by an arrow and Slade blames it on Turok. He is one of the final four marines but is shot in the stomach by Kane for speaking out. (Voiced by Timothy Olyphant.)
Reese
Whiskey Company's sniper, an albino. He saves Turok from a raptor attack. He appeared as a very calm person throughout the game. He never really showed any emotion even during the ambush that killed Cole. Reese is one of the final five marines and dies while assaulting the M-G base when he is shot through the eye with an arrow, likely launched by Grimes. He was a Private First Class based on the insignia on his armor. (Voiced by Gideon Emery.)
Logan
The senior ranking Corporal of Whiskey Company. He becomes increasingly unstable as the game progresses. While attempting to find a spacecraft to escape the dinosaur planet, he accuses Turok of alerting M-G soldiers to their position, and promptly reveals their positions to the soldiers, who hadn't actually been aware of their location. Logan is killed by an M-G helicopter while trying ineffectively to destroy it. Logan had also taken command of Whiskey Company after all higher-ranking officers had died. He suffered brain damage during the crash, something that was not apparent to the others at first though Cole notes that Logan took a bad hit to the head. Unfortunately, he was the highest-ranking member of Whiskey Company after the ambush which killed all the officers. (Voiced by William Fichtner.)
Morris
An NCO of Whickey Company. Morris is the sergeant encountered at the beginning of The Lost Land. He is the senior NCO of Whiskey Company and therefore is fourth in command of the company after Cole, Henderson and Louis. He, besides Turok, is the only one to survive the escape from the engine chunk of the ship after it crashed. He and Turok are also the first ones to encounter the dinosaurs. He notices smoke on the horizon and says that that is where the rest of the ship came down. He then walks off to contact several members of Whiskey company. Just as he comes in contact with someone, he is carried off into the bush and eaten by a raptor. He is also one of the men seen exiting cryo sleep with Turok at the beginning of the game.
Cole
Captain and the leader of Whiskey Company. He is usually calm but can be sharp if needed. When Turok, Slade and Reese arrive at the main crash site, he orders Turok to search for the comm unit. Turok contacts Cole several times throughout the game. After Turok finds Cowboy, he sends Logan, Parker, Foster, Gonzales, and Slade to rendezvous with them. When Turok returns to the camp without Foster and Gonzales he doesn't question it. He is killed by an arrow to the abdomen by Grimes at the start of a large battle with the M-G soldiers. (Voiced by Mark Rolston.)
Jericho
Whiskey Company's heavy weapon specialist. He is dedicated to his men and persisted on going after the M-G soldiers after they killed many marines. Jericho dies when he stays behind, fighting M-G soldiers, to let Turok and Shepard escape to the station.(Voiced by Christopher Judge.)
Gonzalez
A marine with what seems to be latino heritage. He had gone with Turok in one mission to recover the long-range radio but was carried off by Mama Scarface, the massive T. Rex, who likely fed him to her offspring. Slade was his best friend. (Voiced by Lombardo Boyar.)
Carter
Another technician for Whiskey Company. He worries a lot and annoys Slade. Carter was sent with Turok and Slade to go see what was making an odd sound after he had complained to Logan. He was killed by the giant scorpion bugs and dragged underground. (Voiced by Jason Harris Katz.)
Henderson
Whiskey Company's second-in-command. He was only seen once in the game and was said to have died when the M-G soldiers attacked Whiskey Company's campsite. His death was not shown unlike Louis and Cole's deaths. (Voiced by Steve Van Wormer.)
Louis
Another high-ranking officer. He died in the ensuing battle that also claimed the lives of Henderson and Cole. He was gunned down by machine gun turrets.
Foster
A soldier paired with Turok and Gonzalez to retrieve the comm unit. He is shot in the head by an M-G sniper. (Voiced by Jon Curry.)
Parker
Whiskey Company's medic. He tried to treat Cowboy for his arrow wound before taking him back to camp for better treatment. It is unclear how he died, but he does not make it off the dinosaur planet at the end with Turok, Slade, and Shepard. It is thought that he was either killed during the attack as he is not seen during the meeting to decide who will lead Whiskey company or he was killed on the return journey to the main crash site as he is not seen when Turok returns with the comm unit. (Voiced by Josh Gomez.)
Roland Kane
The AWOL leader of Wolf Pack. After Kane left the military he began working with the Mendel-Grumman Company. Kane set up a base on a planet, and among other things, genetically engineered quite a few species of resurrected dinosaurs, and created an incredibly potent toxin that he planned to sell to the M-G Company. Kane also kills Cowboy when he speaks out. He failed in his attempt to escape the dinosaur planet after his facilities were destroyed when Turok blew up his escape vessel and defeated him in a knife fight. Roland Kane was the person that trained Turok to his amazing combat level. (Voiced by Powers Boothe.)
John Grimes
Wolf Pack's second-in-command. He is seen multiple times throughout the game, the first is outside an M-G base on the second level, when he confronts Turok, briefly seen after he killed Cole with his bow and when Kane captures the four remaining members in Whiskey Company. It is unclear whether or not he survives the events of the game. He may have been killed when the reactor room exploded and he was hit by a falling metal beam. Grimes also causes the death of Cole and Reese, and is likely the one who injured Cowboy. His signature weapon is the bow, and his skill with the weapon is exceptional.
Mendell-Grumman Corporation
The paramilitary company that is funding Kane's research on the planet and providing the soldiers that kill the many stranded members of Whiskey Company.
Gameplay.
The gameplay is similar to that of most first-person shooters, with a strong focus on survival in dangerous natural environments. The human enemies, under the leadership of Kane, are the main threat to the player, although dinosaurs may often be found wandering throughout the game. The dinosaurs act as a neutral force and, if the player chooses, can be used as a tool to attack enemy soldiers. This may be done by attracting roaming dinosaurs to a firefight (via: flares, gunshots, etc.) to aid the player and help dispatch the enemy, with possible other ways depending on the situation. The dinosaurs' intelligence are much alike the Earth dinosaurs, so other dinosaurs and all humans, including the player's allies and enemies, may be attacked. The game does not utilize an aim-assist feature.
Propaganda Games has included an additional, stealth mechanic in the game. Because "Turok" takes place mostly in jungle environments with a focus on ambiance, the player may kill enemies with a bow or knife without being heard or use dinosaurs to attract the attention of other enemies and slip by unnoticed. A famed new feature into this game is the Silent Kill, which is done by drawing your knife, then attacking a human or unaware dino from behind. The kill can be utilized against dinosaurs and humans alike as a finishing blow, and can be executed from any side. The knife is also utilized as a self-defense weapon during phases known as "mauls", where the player is attacked by a dino or bug, and must hammer on the according buttons in order to counter-attack or fend off the attack.
At the end of the game, when you fight Kane as a boss, he steals your knife, and you must quickly hammer on the randomly chosen button(s) and finally kill him at the 4th or 5th set of buttons. These gameplay elements have been made optional, meaning the player is never forced to use stealth to their advantage if they wish not to. Well-known among "Turok" fans, the games generally feature a large, creative arsenal, with unconventional futuristic weaponry, much unlike that found in typical first-person shooters.
Multiplayer.
Online multiplayer support is also available. There is a (Team) Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Wargames, and Assault Capture the Flag. Multiplayer supports up to 16 people, and 4 players for three co-op missions. A feature in the multiplayer‚Äîrandomly spawning computer-controlled dinosaurs and insects that appear in various locations in levels‚Äîadds a new factor to the gameplay. While players must worry about the opposing enemies, they must now also worry about the hostile dinosaurs that will be attempting to kill them. There can be up to 4 A.I controlled dinosaurs or insects on any map at one time. Unfortunately, splitscreen multiplayer is not supported in any form.
Originally, the Xbox 360 version of "Turok" was set to feature an Achievement called "Grab Bag", which required players to kill at least one enemy, one dinosaur, one teammate, and themselves, all in the same match. This caused controversy on the Internet as the Achievement essentially rewarded players for team killing. Josh Holmes, a representative of Propaganda Games, described the creation of the Achievement by saying "What we found was that players playing their first match in "Turok" - almost every player - was (accidentally) killing himself, a team mate and an enemy with a grenade or a Stick Bomb gun and so we thought 'hey, we should give them an Achievement for that', as kind of a joke." He went on to say that developers were planning to release a patch removing Grab Bag if excessive team killing became a problem after launch. In the launch version of the game, however, while the "Grab Bag" Achievement is still present, it removed the requirement of killing a teammate, and is awarded after the player kills an enemy, a dinosaur, and themselves in the same match.
A Map pack called the ""Velociraptor" Pack" has been released, containing 2 new multiplayer maps, one new Co-op map, and 2 refurbished maps, which now take place at Night.
Below is a brief description of the five new maps:

PlayStation 3 multiplayer issues.
Since February 2011, the Turok multiplayer servers have been disconnected either by the Turok developers Propaganda Games or their parent company, Disney Interactive Studios. The multiplayer had been running perfectly fine for nearly 3 years until then, when the servers went offline and no-one could access them. This problem has only been reported by PlayStation Network gamers and petitions exist to re-boot the Turok multiplayer again. The main and most recognized campaign to restore turok multiplayer is the Turok Multiplayer Revival Campaign (TMRC) with over 500 supporters.
Reception.
"Turok" received mostly mixed or average reviews, citing undesirable details in the gameworld. As of April 2012, the game holds an aggregate score of 70% on Gamerankings and a 69 out of 100 on Metacritic.
In terms of individual reviews, "Turok" has received a 9/10 from "Play" magazine and a 7/10 from both the "Official Xbox Magazine" and the "Official PlayStation Magazine". Both praised multiplayer but commented on the ""sketchy enemy awareness"" and ""dodgy textures"". Game Trailers, which gave the game 8.3/10, highlighted the game's use of the Unreal 3 Engine, believing it to be "the best use of the tech outside of Epic's own efforts" and praising the modeling and animation of the dinosaurs in particular. 1up.com gave the game a score of C+, specifically complaining about its stealth mechanics, the use of camera shaking, and occasional graphical glitches in the PlayStation 3 version. Gameplasma gave the game a 7 out of 10 claiming that "the storyline is mediocre" and it is "forgettable". "Hyper"'s Yuri Spadeface commends the game for its "solid frame rate". However, he criticised the "frustrating level design and average execution".
"Turok" received 3/5 from "X-Play", commenting on its aim-assist being woefully inadequate both in multiplayer and singleplayer, but praised its graphics and "outlook". In its G-phoria episode, it won the category of "Game Deserves An Uwe Boll Movie". Gamepro magazine reviewed the game, saying that ""Turok" isn't good enough to single handedly repair the franchise's tarnished reputation, but it is good enough that you'll want to forgive some of its ancestors' sins." They gave the graphics a 4.0, the sound a 3.75, the control a 4.75, and the fun factor a 3.75 out of 5.
"Game Informer" magazine reviewed "Turok", and gave it a 7/10, stating "the ecosystem environment does not live up to what it was supposed to or should be. Minor problems like a paper thin story, the constant knocking of the camera from explosives and dinosaurs, the poor multiplayer and poorly spaced checkpoints, drag down what otherwise is a decent shooter." However, they liked the game for its voice talents including Powers Boothe and Timothy Olyphant. It was reviewed by Ben and Bertz, who both agreed on the same score.
Elsewhere, "Turok" was criticized to a further extent. Honest Gamers awarded the game 5/10, citing the unforgiving checkpoint system, badly contextualized story and poor AI as reasons for the mediocre mark; and PC Gamer UK awarded the game 57%, calling it "weary and uninspired."

<doc id="31036619" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31036619" title="Mining in Sierra Leone">
Mining in Sierra Leone

The mining industry of Sierra Leone accounted for 4.5 percent of the country's GDP in 2007 and minerals made up 79 percent of total export revenue with diamonds accounting for 46 percent of export revenue in 2008. The main minerals mined in Sierra Leone are diamonds, rutile, bauxite, gold, iron and limonite.
Mining in Sierra Leone, especially diamond mining, has been seen as one of the key factors for instability in the country and one of the reasons for the country's recent civil war. Traditionally, benefits from diamond mining have ended up with private companies and corrupt officials rather than the country's government and people. The Ministry of Mineral Resources is responsible for the management of the country's minerals sector and the Mines and Minerals Act 2009. Sierra Leone is a candidate for the Extraction Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). GoSL publishes data on licenses and payments by mining companies in their Online Repository established by Revenue Development Foundation, the repository was launched in January 2012
History.
Organised mining began in the 1920s with bauxite first being recorded in 1920 along the Falaba to Waia road. Diamonds were found in the early 1930s, from 1934 to 1956 the Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) held the monopoly for mining, prospecting for and marketing diamonds throughout Sierra Leone. The Consolidated African Selection Trust Ltd (CAST), which owned mining operation around West Africa, provided the initial capital for the SLST. The monopoly was originally given for 99 years but in 1955 the SLST gave up rights to alluvial deposits outside its lease area. This allowed artisan and small scale mining of alluvial deposits, and by 1965 there had been a large movement from agricultural work to working these deposits. In 1970 a joint SLST and government organisation was formed call the National Diamond Mining Corporation (NDMC).
Before the start of the Civil War in 1991 250,000 people made a living in the mining and quarrying sector with direct and indirect employment accounting for 14% of the country's total labour force. The mineral wealth of Sierra Leone, especially in diamonds, became a key factors in its instability and the outbreak of Civil War.
Resource Curse.
Despite being among the top-ten diamond-producing nations, the mining sector faces many challenges, including weak laws and smuggling issues. Sierra Leone is losing large revenue that could have been earned from taxes and licensing agreements. Those revenues could be reinvested for example in the healthcare sector to help those people whose health is affected by mining operations. Research suggests 50% of Sierra Leone‚Äôs diamonds were smuggled annually. NACE argues that with good institutional reforms, Sierra Leone can increase mineral exports seven-fold by 2020. Sierra Leone‚Äôs mining performance is extremely poor as compared to Botswana, where mining contributes approximately 38% to their GDP.
Rutile.
Sierra Leone is ranked as one of the top five producers of rutile, a titanium ore, used in paint pigment and welding rod coatings. The government issued leases for mining rutile are held by Sierra Rutile Limited which is owned by Titanium Resources Group which is owned by European and U.S investors. These leases cover 580 km2 of land where there are 19 identified deposits of rutile. In 2009 the Government of Sierra Leone received Le 1,854 million in royalties from rutile mining. In 2009 production decreased by 19.07 percent to 63,860 tons, and exports were worth US$ 35,920,300.
Gold.
Gold mining in Sierra Leone consisted of small scale operation exploiting alluvial deposits. After the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War exploration of gold grew and by 2013 to 2015 new modern mines are expected to be in production. In 2010 Cluff Gold, a British company, found gold deposits in the rocks of the southern Kangari hills and is planning to build a mechanised mine to extract it. In 2009 production levels of gold fell by 17.71 percent to 5060 Troy Ounces (157¬†kg) from 6150 Troy Ounces (191¬†kg) in 2008. This was due to a drop in mining activity in the second half of the year and was despite a rise in the price of gold on the global market. The drop may also have been due to increased smuggling as the Government of Sierra Leone had raised the duty to higher than the neighboring countries. The increase in the value of gold meant gold exports were worth 15.73 percent more at US$4,764,000 in 2009 compared to US$4,116,400 in 2008.
Diamonds.
Diamonds are found in about a quarter of Sierra Leone in the south-east and east of the country, with the diamond fields cover 7,700 square miles. The main production areas are concentrated around the drainage areas of rivers in the Kono, Kenema and Bo Districts. In the Kono, Kenema, Bo and Pujehun Districts there are 1,700 artisanal mining licenses in operation. In 2009 the government recorded exports of 400,480 carats (80,096 g) of diamonds, this included 143,620 carats (28,724 g) of industrial diamonds and 256,860 (51,372 g) of gem diamonds. This was and increase of 7.86 percent on the previous year which was a result of legislative changes, in the form of a new mining law, to enable fees and royalties to be collected more effectively and an increase in the amount of diamond mining. Diamond exports were worth US$ 78,373,900 in 2009 accounting for 59 percent of the country's exports. The drop in the value of diamonds on the world market meant that the value of diamond exports decreased by 20.68 percent in 2009 compared to 2008.
The largest diamond found in Sierra Leone, and the third largest diamond in the world, was a 969.8 carat (194 g) rough diamond. It was found in 1972 and named the Star of Sierra Leone.
Sierra Leone should have been one of the world‚Äôs richest countries, being blessed with resources, including gold and diamonds. However, it remains one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries, ranking 203 out of 206 countries by World Development Report. Wealth that diamonds should have brought is not evident, and Sierra Leone is still emerging from scars from the recent brutal Sierra Leone Civil War, which was fuelled by illicit diamond trading. Revenue from mining in Sierra Leone has not been redistributed to benefit the larger population. The mining industry contributed 4.5% towards its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007. Economic development is low due to poor management of resources and unrealized potential revenue.
Bauxite.
Sierra Leone's production of bauxite, an aluminium ore, is around one percent of the total global production. Deposits occur between Moyamba and Mano, on the Freetown Peninsular, at Krim-Kpaka in the Pujehun District, southern Sierra Leone; in north on the road from Falaba to Waia, at Kamakwie and Makumre.
Sierra Minerals Holdings is the only company mining bauxite in the country, and the second largest employer in the mining industry. It runs the Sieromco Bauxite Mine as well as holding the mining lease to 321.7 km2. In 2009 production of bauxite fell by 22.17 percent to 742,820 tons. This was due to Sierra Minerals ceasing production from June to September 2009 as a response to falling global demand for aluminum, which is produced from bauxite.
Iron.
Mining for haematite iron ore recommenced at Marampa mine on 11 February 2010 after 35 years. The mine is owned by London Mining which also owns an exploration license covering 319¬†km¬≤.
The Tonkolili region hosts the biggest iron ore deposit in Africa and the third largest in the world, exploited by African Minerals, in the hills around Bumbuna, Mabonto and Bendugu
Governance.
Institutions.
Inefficiency and corruption of Sierra Leone‚Äôs institutions are impeding its economic growth. Absence of well-established institutions is the result of the destructive civil war which ended only in 2002. World Bank‚Äôs assistance brought reforms but also allowed local government to become lax. The Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)(MMR) administers the regulations and property rights of the Mines and Minerals Act (Sierra Leone) in 2009. However, licences made by mining companies were only published in 2011. This reflects inefficiency in establishing a legal framework due to time-lag.
It is also questionable whether there are proper corruption-checking mechanisms. Although the Sierra Leone Anti-corruption Commission (ACC) investigates corruption cases, critics have that noted it could merely be a political tool to quieten the government‚Äôs political opponents. However, the ACC objects to this and claims it is impartial. Pervasive corruption and unstable political environment stymie Sierra Leone‚Äôs economic growth and decrease investors‚Äô confidence in Sierra Leone‚Äôs business and political climate.
Mining industry and other Economic Sectors.
Policies regarding well-management of mining industry should be done alongside a broader focus for the economy‚Äôs development, and greater efforts should be done to expand the manufacturing and service sector, which currently only contribute 12% to the GDP. Sierra Leone produces raw diamonds but gem-quality diamonds are manufactured in developed countries like Belgium. For example, the government of Sierra Leone can provide greater tax incentives for investors to conduct businesses and invest in Sierra Leone, to facilitate the transfer of technology and skills to the native workers. One recent example is the Gemstone School Sierra Leone, which was established as an institution to improve diamond polishing, cutting and jewelry-manufacturing skills to boost job-training and employment opportunities locally and to attract overseas investors. More efforts from the government and Multi-National Corporations can hence be done in the future to build more diamond-processing facilities and plants in Sierra Leone to boost the diamond mining industry.

Willy Christian Simonsen

Willy Christian Simonsen (13 September 1913 ‚Äì 4 December 2003) was a Norwegian engineer and business founder.
He was born in Kristiania as a son of chemist Einar Simonsen (1867‚Äì1918) and Alice Sophia Andersen (1877‚Äì1969). He finished his secondary education at Hegdehaugen School in 1933, and graduated in electrical engineering from the Dresden University of Technology in 1938. He worked as an engineer for Elektrisk Bureau and Chr. Michelsen Institute. During the German occupation of Norway from 1940 he was involved in the Norwegian resistance movement where he cooperated with fellow engineers Odd Dahl and Helmer H. Dahl to wiretap German forces. This was discovered and Simonsen was arrested by Gestapo, but admitted to Ullev√•l Hospital from which he escaped. He fled to the United Kingdom, where he started working in the Radio Production Unit of the British War Office. He developed the shortwave radio "Sweetheart".
He was hired as a technical consultant for the Norwegian High Command after the war. In 1947 he started the company Simonsen Radio in Oslo, and in 1957 the company Simonsen & Mustad followed in Horten. He received initial capital from Halfdan and John Mustad. The brand name Simrad became known in the communications business, and was leading in echo sounding equipment. He backed out of these companies in 1968 and started Simonsen Elektro (in Oslo) in 1970 and Simonsen Elektro L√∏kken (in L√∏kken Verk). These companies produced automatic cell phones, in the NMT 450 system, and were leading in the Norwegian market until the 1980s.
Simonsen was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945, the UK Defence Medal, the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal and the Order of St. Olav, and has received the Reginald Fessenden Award. He died in December 2003.

<doc id="31036750" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31036750" title="Geometric stable distribution">
Geometric stable distribution

A geometric stable distribution or geo-stable distribution is a type of leptokurtic probability distribution. The geometric stable distribution may be symmetric or asymmetric. A symmetric geometric stable distribution is also referred to as a Linnik distribution. The Laplace distribution is a special case of the geometric stable distribution and of a Linnik distribution. The Mittag‚ÄìLeffler distribution is also a special case of a geometric stable distribution.
The geometric stable distribution has applications in finance theory.
Characteristics.
For most geometric stable distributions, the probability density function and cumulative distribution function have no closed form solution. But a geometric stable distribution can be defined by its characteristic function, which has the form:
where formula_2
formula_3, which must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2, is the shape parameter or index of stability, which determines how heavy the tails are. Lower formula_3 corresponds to heavier tails.
formula_5, which must be greater than or equal to ‚àí1 and less than or equal to 1, is the skewness parameter. When formula_5 is negative the distribution is skewed to the left and when formula_5 is positive the distribution is skewed to the right. When formula_5 is zero the distribution is symmetric, and the characteristic function reduces to:
The symmetric geometric stable distribution with formula_10 is also referred to as a Linnik distribution. A completely skewed geometric stable distribution, that is with formula_11, formula_12, with formula_13 is also referred to as a Mittag‚ÄìLeffler distribution. Although formula_5 determines the skewness of the distribution, it should not be confused with the typical skewness coefficient or 3rd standardized moment, which in most circumstances is undefined for a geometric stable distribution.
formula_15 is the scale parameter and formula_16 is the location parameter.
When formula_3 = 2, formula_5 = 0 and formula_16 = 0 (i.e., a symmetric geometric stable distribution or Linnik distribution with formula_3=2), the distribution becomes the symmetric Laplace distribution with mean of 0, which has a probability density function of:
The Laplace distribution has a variance equal to formula_22. However, for formula_23 the variance of the geometric stable distribution is infinite.
Relationship to the stable distribution.
The stable distribution has the property that if formula_24 are independent, identically distributed random variables taken from a stable distribution, the sum formula_25 has the same distribution as the formula_26s for some formula_27 and formula_28.
The geometric stable distribution has a similar property, but where the number of elements in the sum is a geometrically distributed random variable. If formula_29 are independent and identically distributed random variables taken from a geometric stable distribution, the limit of the sum formula_30 approaches the distribution of the formula_26s for some coefficients formula_32 and formula_33 as p approaches 0, where formula_34 is a random variable independent of the formula_26s taken from a geometric distribution with parameter p. In other words:
The distribution is strictly geometric stable only if the sum formula_37 equals the distribution of the formula_26s for some¬†"a".
There is also a relationship between the stable distribution characteristic function and the geometric stable distribution characteristic function. The stable distribution has a characteristic function of the form:
where
The geometric stable characteristic function can be expressed in terms of a stable characteristic function as:

HAL HTT-40

The Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 aircraft project is a Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) proposal for an indigenous replacement for the Indian Air Force's retired HPT-32 Deepak as a basic trainer.
Design and development.
The HTT-40 will be an all-metal tandem seat aircraft powered by a turbo-prop engine. In early 2012 the company forecast building 106 examples.
By the middle of 2012 the aircraft's future was in doubt as the Indian Air Force ordered 75 Pilatus PC-7 Mk IIs to fill the role envisioned for the HTT-40. In September 2012 the Air Force indicated that it had formally rejected the HTT-40 for service based on its cost per aircraft being double that of the PC-7 Mk II, a proven aircraft already in service worldwide. An MoD official noted, "We would be willing to pay higher rates to build indigenous capability in strategic defence equipment. But can HAL argue that the capability to build basic trainers is strategically vital[?]"
HAL did not confirm the IAF announcement that it will not buy the HTT-40, nor would the company indicate whether the aircraft's development will be continued. A company spokesman said, "We treat all MOD issues/proposals as confidential...All our projects are conceived with national interest in mind though, at times, some of those take time to fructify".

Tejo Power Station (working conditions)

The entire operation of the Tejo Power Station, as well as the evolution of electricity in the city, was only possible thanks to the work carried out by the people who set all of the machinery in motion, day and night, guaranteeing that the power station never interrupted its production.
Since the city‚Äôs consumption of electric power never stops, the boilers could never be idle. Thus it was necessary to create a twenty-four-hour work regime at the Tejo Power Station, with three rotational shifts; from 12am to 8am; from 8am to 4pm; and from 4pm to 12am. Due to the constant increases in the power station‚Äôs output and size, it became crucial to hire more workers, especially during war times. In the 1940s, there were approximately 550 workers on the payroll, from the more specialised staff to those with the simplest but more difficult tasks, the latter being in greater number.
Division of labour.
The Tejo Power Station is a highly complex industrial body, and the amount of workers it required demanded a hierarchical labour structure subdivided by room, with the harder work coexisting beside the more bearable tasks. Needless to say, those who worked near the boiler suffered more than those who, for example, controlled it from the control desk.
There were approximately 45 types of jobs in the power station, ranging from work in the plant such as that done by the ‚ÄòAlcochetanos‚Äô or the stokers, to work done in the workshops and the electricians in the substation.
Work areas in the power station:
In the square, the power station workers called the ‚ÄòSquare‚Äôs Men‚Äô distributed the coal, ensuring that it reached the boilers‚Äô feed system.
On a regular workday, there would be approximately 16 people on each shift, including foremen, machinery maintenance men and those who controlled the bucket elevators and the scale.
One chief engineer supervised the boilers with two men directly under him. To control the boilers, there was the head operator who, from the control desks, controlled steam production, while the sub-head operator gave instructions from the top of the boiler. Regarding the coal burning, the operator controlled the combustion quality, while the stoker, from behind the boiler, pushed the unburnt coal to be re-burned, thereby clearing the combustion conveyor belt.
Working Conditions.
The Tejo Power Station‚Äôs working conditions (as in any thermoelectric power station at the time) were in fact not easy: the work was very hard, which meant a poor quality of life for the workers.
The worst jobs in the power station were unloading coal, working near the boiler, collecting ash, and cleaning the refrigeration channels and ash pans.
The operators were located near the boilers and were in charge of supervising and controlling the coal levels on the combustion conveyor belt by opening or moving the silos, ensuring a regular distribution of coal and moving the combustion conveyor at a faster or slower pace. The stokers were situated at the back of the boiler, pushing the unburnt coal back to the middle of the combustion belt. This was an extremely arduous job, one of the worst in the power station, since they had to endure the intense heat of the entire room, facing an opening in the furnace that brought the heat to extreme levels, constantly breathing the coal combustion by-products, such as smoke and boiler slag.
But worse still was the work carried out on the floor beneath the boilers, in the ash section. Collecting ash is the most gruelling job of all, carried out in an environment where the temperatures in the power station reached the highest, filled with fumes and red-hot boiler slag and ash that had to be collected, often manually, and taken to the Pra√ßa do Carv√£o in trolleys to be unloaded in the Ash Skip. Taking the ash outside made these people‚Äôs working conditions even worse due to the difference in temperatures inside and outside the power station.
These three jobs deserve special attention because the work, effort and often life-threatening risks made it possible to produce electric power that the workers themselves never had the chance to enjoy. Thanks to them and all of the other workers, it was possible to bring power to Lisbon‚Äôs factories and to the higher classes in the city‚Äôs more affluent neighbourhoods.
Social Aspects.
The "Companhias Reunidas de G√°s e Electricidade" (CRGE ‚Äì United Gas and Electric Companies) implemented a social policy for their workers, since this was one of the largest companies in Portugal, employing thousands of workers all over the country. Among the most important work carried out in Lisbon, were the following:

Howard O. McMahon

Dr. Howard O. McMahon was Science Director, Vice President, Head of the Research and Development Division, and then President of Arthur D. Little, Inc, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, retiring from the Company in 1977. He made important contributions to the field of cryogenics as inventor, research scientist and engineer during the 1940s through the 1960s, and subsequently as an executive and member of the Board of Directors of both ADL and the Helix Technology Corporation, of Waltham, Massachusetts. McMahon, born in Alberta, Canada, was a naturalized citizen of the United States.
Awards.
1951 Edward Longstreth Medal, Franklin Institute 
1952 Frank Forrest Award, American Ceramic Society 
1979 Samuel C. Collins Award, Cryogenic Engineering Conference
Biography.
McMahon‚Äôs parents, Thomas Alexander McMahon and Tryphena Oldford McMahon, moved their family of five children from the prairie province of Alberta to the city of Victoria, in British Columbia, in the mid-1920s. McMahon attended Victoria College there for two years and then went on to earn his B.A. and M.A. degrees at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver. During his undergraduate years, in the depth of the Great Depression, when his parents were unable to help pay his college tuition, he developed and patented a device later used in bubbling Christmas tree candle lights. The sale of the patent to a Canadian neon sign company for $100 enabled him to return to college, as he later told an interviewer.
For his doctoral work at M.I.T., McMahon worked in the laboratory of Samuel C. Collins, chemist and professor of mechanical engineering, who became McMahon‚Äôs mentor. Prof. Collins brought in a very substantial grant from the National Defense Research Committee at the outset of World War II to work on a project to liquefy oxygen ‚Äúfor use on high-flying aircraft,‚Äù along with other defense-related work.
After receiving his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in 1941, McMahon continued at M.I.T. as a research associate, and joined Dr. Collins in working on the development of a small, portable oxygen machine for the Office for Scientific Research and Development, with funding from the Navy Department. Earl Stevenson, then president of Arthur D. Little, Inc., had recruited Collins and McMahon for this work. When McMahon was hired at ADL in 1943, he continued to collaborate with Dr. Collins on the application of very low temperatures to liquefying gases. Between 1945 and 1947 the Collins Helium Cryostat was engineered and became available for research laboratories. As reported in November 1947,
A 1948 Life Magazine spread on ‚ÄúAbsolute Zero,‚Äù featuring the Collins Helium Cryostat, publicized both the technological feat of creating a safe and relatively inexpensive apparatus for approaching absolute zero, and the expected industrial and research uses of the machine.
Collins and McMahon both received medals from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia in September 1951 for their collaborative work on the Collins Helium Cryostat.
In an interview many years later, McMahon said that ‚ÄúOne of the first large-scale applications of cryogenic engineering was liquefying hydrogen for the original hydrogen bomb. Until that time, liquid hydrogen had been just a laboratory curiosity. We had to dream up the way to do it.‚Äù McMahon was also one of a number of Arthur D. Little scientists and engineers who were employed in supporting roles when the U.S. government was completing development of the first hydrogen bomb at the Los Alamos laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1952. According to journalist E. J. Kahn, Jr., whose history of the Arthur D. Little Company was based in part on interviews with current and former members of the company, ADL had a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission ‚Äúto design, manufacture, field test, and operate‚Äù special aluminum-foil lined tank trucks that could safely carry hazardous materials. McMahon was one of the ADL staff that accompanied the trucks to Los Alamos for testing. He was also present at the first test explosion of the hydrogen bomb on Eniwetok Atoll, in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, in October 1952.
In the late 1950s, with an ADL colleague, William E. Gifford, McMahon co-developed the Gifford-McMahon cryogenic refrigerator, based on ‚Äúa unique method of reliably providing closed-cycle refrigeration at temperatures below 10 degrees Kelvin (-452 degrees Fahrenheit).‚Äù. These refrigerators had a variety of applications for further scientific research and technology, and the Gifford-McMahon refrigeration cycle on which they were based became an important standard for the semiconductor industry. Another application was ‚Äúin support of the early U.S. space program,‚Äù when the Gifford-McMahon refrigerator ‚Äúwas used initially to cool microwave amplifiers in ground stations for satellite communications.‚Äù.
In the 1960s, as McMahon rose from the research laboratory through the ranks at ADL into managerial positions, the company at the same time increased the proportion of its consulting work that was devoted to a wide variety of management problems brought to it by clients that included corporations, municipalities and governments outside the U.S.; By 1966, in addition to employing 1,300 staff in the Cambridge headquarters, ADL had another 100 employees in branch offices in Zurich, London and Brussels. In his position as President of ADL, McMahon became increasingly visible in public discussions of the relationship of science and technology to social change.
For example, he served on a National Academy of Sciences committee studying environmental pollution during 1966, participated in a well-publicized seminar on air pollution in February that year, and was interviewed on the costs of pollution cleanup when the report came out in May;.
In 1969 he presided as the general chair at the 136th meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in Boston, at which lively and contentious public discussion took place regarding the roles of science, technology and industry creating as well as potentially alleviating social, economic and political problems in the U.S. and the world. According to one interview-based account, ‚ÄúIt was largely on McMahon‚Äôs initiative that students and young scientists were invited for the first time to organize a formal critique of science. ‚ÄòWe knew we were taking risks,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòbut we thought it would be worth it.‚Äô At the end of the week, after it was all over, he still thought it had been worth it. ‚ÄòThe activists prodded the scientists into a greater sense of urgency over the issues of the day‚Äîthe quality of life, the arms race, population control, hunger, our national scientific priorities. Coupled with the alarming content of many of the sessions, their persistent questioning had a powerful effect.‚Äô‚Äù 
One of a series of presentations he made at M.I.T. during these years was as a panelist at a seminar held by the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, on the topic ‚ÄúThe Engineering Profession and Social Change,‚Äù February 9, 1971.
In 1967, the manufacture of the ADL-Collins Helium Cryostat, originally carried out by a special Division within ADL, was turned over to an ADL subsidiary which soon became an independent company called Cryogenic Technology, Inc. McMahon became Chair of the Board of Directors of the new company in 1972. When McMahon stepped down as ADL President in early 1972, he devoted much of his energy to helping guide the development of new cryogenic products by CTI and its parent company, Helix Technology Corporation.
In the mid 1970s, a cryogenic vacuum pump based on the Gifford-McMahon refrigeration cycle, making possible the processing of silicon wafers for the new microelectronics industry in clean, high-vacuum chambers, was developed at Helix. ‚ÄúSubsequently, the Gifford-McMahon cryogenic refrigeration cycle became the industry standard refrigeration cycle for cryopump applications in the rapidly growing semiconductor industry.‚Äù.
McMahon served as a Director of Helix from its inception, and chaired its Board from 1974 to 1979.
At the time of his death in 1990, McMahon held 22 patents and was recognized as an important pioneer in the development of the new field of cryogenics, through his scientific research and, equally importantly, his ability to envision and create practical technological applications for scientific innovations.

North Bohemia

North Bohemia (, ), is a region in the north of the Czech Republic.
Location.
North Bohemia roughly covers the present-day NUTS regional unit of "CZ04 Severoz√°pad" and the western part of "CZ05 Severov√Ωchod". 
From an administrative perspective, North Bohemia is made up of the present day √öst√≠ nad Labem Region ("√östeck√Ω kraj"), Karlovy Vary Region ("Karlovarsk√Ω kraj") and Liberec Region ("Libereck√Ω kraj").
In German language usage the term North Bohemia or "Nordb√∂hmen" often refers to that part of the Sudetenland once mainly populated by Germans in North Czechia between Karlsbad in the west and the Giant Mountains in the east.
Geography and nature.
North Bohemia is divided into many landscape areas including the Ore Mountains, the Czech Switzerland national park, M√°cha‚Äôs Country, the Lusatian Mountains and Je≈°tƒõd Ridge, Fr√Ωdlantsko and the Jizera Mountains. It is a popular tourist destination, much of which had been inaccessible until recently. 
The Jizera and Lusatian Mountains are protected landscape areas. The summits of the Jizera Mountains climb to heights of about 1,000 metres above sea level, and the region‚Äôs peat bogs have been opened up with interconnecting educational trails. The national nature reserve of the Jizera Mountain Beechwood Forest (Jizerskohorsk√© buƒçiny) contains the largest beech woodland in the Czech Republic, covering .

Immersive virtual musical instrument

An immersive virtual musical instrument, or immersive virtual environment for music and sound, represents sound processes and their parameters as 3D entities of a virtual reality so that they can be perceived not only through auditory feedback but also visually in 3D and possibly through tactile as well as haptic feedback, using 3D interface metaphors consisting of interaction techniques such as navigation, selection and manipulation (NSM). It builds on the trend in electronic musical instruments to develop new ways to control sound and perform music such as explored in conferences like NIME.
State of the art.
Florent Berthaut created a variety of 3D reactive widgets involving novel representations of musical events and sound, that required a special 3D input device to interact with them using adapted 3D interaction techniques. 
Jared Bott created an environment that used 3D spatial control techniques as used in known musical instruments, with symbolic 2D visual representation of musical events.
Richard Polfreman made a 3D virtual environment for musical composition with visual representations of musical and sound data similar to 2D composition environments but placed in a 3D space.
Leonel Valbom created a 3D immersive virtual environment with visual 3D representations of musical events and audio spatialization with which could be interacted using NSM interaction techniques.
Teemu M√§ki-Patola explored interaction metaphors based on existing musical instruments as seen in his Virtual Xylophone, Virtual Membrane, and Virtual Air Guitar implementations. 
Sutoolz from su-Studio Barcelona was the first experiment to use real time 3D video games technology to allow live performer to construct and play
a fully audio visual immersive environment.
Axel Mulder explored the sculpting interaction metaphor by creating a 3D virtual environment that allowed interaction with abstract deformable shapes, such as a sheet and a sphere, which parameters were mapped to sound effects in innovative ways. The work focused on proving the technical feasibility of 3D virtual musical instruments. Gestural control was based on 3D object manipulation such as a subset of prehension.
Early work was done by Jaron Lanier with his Chromatophoria band and separately by Niko Bolas who developed the Soundsculpt Toolkit, a software interface that allows the world of music to communicate with the graphical elements of virtual reality.

Solithromycin

Solithromycin (formerly known as CEM-101 and OP-1068) is a novel ketolide antibiotic undergoing clinical development for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other infections. It is expected to be the first macrolide antibiotic available in intravenous, oral, and pediatric suspension formulations in over 20 years.
Solithromycin exhibits excellent "in vitro" activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive respiratory tract pathogens, including macrolide-resistant strains. Solithromycin has activity against a wide variety of pathogens, and further research is being conducted for other infections.
Structure.
X-ray crystallography studies have shown solithromycin, the first fluoroketolide in clinical development, has a third region of interactions with the bacterial ribosome, as compared with two binding sites for other ketolides.
The only currently marketed ketolide, telithromycin, suffers from rare, but serious side effects. Recent studies have shown this to be likely due to the presence of the pyridine-imidazole group of the telithromycin side chain acting as an antagonist towards various nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Since solithromycin, like azithromycin and clarithromycin, lacks this chemical moiety, it is not expected to cause the adverse events seen with Ketek (telithromycin).

Storm Master

Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country.
Similarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.
The game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.

Music.
As a teenager, Blumas took a break from acting to form the reggae band "Staylefish." The band went onto to receive minor success around the Canadian college circuit, before Trevor left for Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. After re-locating back to Toronto, he started Corduroy (or Whatever Happened to Corduroy?) an indie-rock group that independently released a series of PWYC demo ep's they dubbed Demoroy's. Corduroy's music recently appeared in an online campaign for Chevrolet and in an episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation. Corduroy eventually dissolved in 2010. Trevor is currently working on Doom Squad, an electronic music project he started with his two sisters Jaclyn and Allie. In early 2011, Doom Squad released their debut EP entitled "Land O' The Silver Birch" and subsequently set out on a west coast tour to promote it.

Artur Gold

Artur (Arthur) Gold (born 17 March 1897, Warsaw, died 1943 in Treblinka) was a Polish Jewish violinist and dance-music composer during the Interbellum. He closely collaborated with his brother Henryk Gold and with Jerzy Petersburski with whom he arranged music for his famous ensembles; they were among the most popular composers in interwar Poland and many of their hits were sung throughout the whole country. Gold ran an orchestra in the "Qui Pro Quo" theater (1922) and in the Warsaw "Adria" night club (1931‚Äì1939).
Life.
Artur Gold was the second son of Micha≈Ç Gold, a musician in the Warsaw Opera; when Micha≈Ç died an uncle took Artur to England, where he received his musical education. He later returned to Warsaw and played there for various venues including nightclubs. Some of his noted compositions were the foxtrot "Gdy Petersburski razem z Goldem gra" ("When Petersburski and Gold play together") (1926), the tango "Gdy w ogrodzie botanicznym" ("While in the botanical garden"), "Jesienne r√≥≈ºe" ("Autumn roses"), "Nie odchod≈∫ ode mnie" (Don't walk away from me), "Nie wierzƒô ci" ("I don't trust you'"), "Ja≈õminy" (Jasmine), "Kwiaciarka z Barcelony" (Flower girl from Barcelona), "Oczy czarne" (Black Eyes), "Ostatni jeszcze," and others. Most of the lyrics were by Andrzej W≈Çast.
Artur Gold also performed with English orchestras in the 1920s and recorded for Columbia records. In the 1930s he also recorded several albums for the Polish "Odeon" record company.
Treblinka extermination camp.
After the German and Soviet invasion on Poland in September 1939, Artur Gold was forced into the newly created Warsaw Ghetto, in which he played with an orchestra. He was deported by the Germans with thousands of fellow inmates who boarded the Holocaust trains at the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw, destined for the gas chambers of German Treblinka extermination camp. He was not killed upon arrival there in 1942. He played for the Nazis in their casino, at least on one occasion dressed as a clown. He was murdered in 1943 in Treblinka. According to recollections of some of the Treblinka survivors Gold might have been killed during the uprising at Treblinka which occurred on 2 August 1943.
The melody of his song "Chod≈∫ na Pragƒô (Come to Praga)" (1930) is currently played as a Hejna≈Ç of the Warsaw borough of Praga, each day at noon.

Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, University of Portsmouth

The ICG is a research institute at the University of Portsmouth devoted to topics in cosmology, galaxy evolution and gravitation. It has nearly 50 staff, post-docs and students working on subjects from inflation in the early Universe to understanding the stellar populations in galaxies.
Research at the Institute is supported by grants from STFC (the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council), the Royal Society and the European Union.
History.
The Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, or ICG, was established as an independent research department by the University of Portsmouth in January 2002. It was formed from members of the Relativity and Cosmology Group that had been set up by Prof David Matravers, head of the School of Mathematical Studies at the University of Portsmouth, following the arrival of Roy Maartens as a lecturer in 1994. David Wands joined the group as a research fellow in 1996. 
The group won their first major research grant from PPARC (the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council) in 1998 to study the evolution of cosmological structure. In the UK Research Assessment Exercise in 2001 (RAE2001) research submitted by the group was awarded a grade 5, recognising the international excellence of their work in applied mathematics, and leading to the establishment of the ICG the next year. Bob Nichol joined the ICG from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh) in 2004 initiating a research programme in observational cosmology. 
In the 2008 UK government Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008), 75% of the ICG research was judged to be "Internationally Excellent" or better (3* or 4* status, with 4* being the highest). This ranking places the ICG in the top 6 Applied Maths groups in the UK. 
In 2009 the Institute moved from offices in Mercantile House to purpose-built rooms for nearly 50 researchers on the top floor of the Dennis Sciama Building. The building was officially opened by the Astronomer Royal, and former student of Dennis Sciama, Prof Martin Rees.
Roy Maartens was the director of the ICG from January 2002 until October 2010 when he took up a Square Kilometre Array research chair at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa, dividing his time between Portsmouth (30%) and Cape Town (70%). Since October 2010 the directors of the ICG are Bob Nichol and David Wands.

Holles was the son of Gervase Holles and his second wife Elizabeth Molesworth. His father was MP for Grimsby. Holles was a major in the Westminster militia and commanded a privateer called the Panther. He was recommended him for the navy by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. He lost an arm at the Four Days Fight in 1666 while commanding HMS "Antelope". He was knighted subsequently. 
In 1667, Holles was elected Member of Parliament for Grimsby in the Cavalier Parliament. In March 1672, he and Sir Robert Holmes sailed from Portsmouth and attacked the Dutch Smyrna convoy in the English Channel on its return home. This foray had official sanction and led to the Third Dutch War. Holles was in command of HMS "Cambridge" at the Battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672 when he was killed at the age of 29. He was given a funeral in Westminster Abbey and was buried in St Edmund's chapel in an unmarked grave.
Holles married Jane Crome (n√©e Lewis).

Lightspeed (magazine)

Lightspeed is an online fantasy and science fiction magazine edited and published by John Joseph Adams. The first issue was published in June 2010 and it has maintained a regular monthly schedule since. The magazine currently publishes four original stories and four reprints in every issue, in addition to interviews with the authors and other nonfiction. All of the content published in each issue is available for purchase as an ebook and for free on the magazine's website. "Lightspeed" also makes selected stories available as a free podcast, produced by Audie Award-winning editor Stefan Rudnicki.
History.
"Lightspeed" was founded and run as a science fiction magazine by publisher Sean Wallace of Prime Books with John Joseph Adams as editor. Wallace also published "Lightspeed"'s sister companion "Fantasy Magazine"; Adams came on as editor of "Fantasy Magazine" with the March 2011 issue. "Lightspeed" became an SFWA-qualifying market in July of 2011.
In November of 2011 Adams purchased "Lightspeed" and "Fantasy Magazine" from Wallace. With the January 2012 issue, the first published under Adams's ownership, the content of both magazines was combined under the "Lightspeed" masthead, and "Fantasy Magazine" was discontinued as an entity. The "Fantasy Magazine" staff was also absorbed into "Lightspeed". 
In September 2013, "Lightspeed" announced their first Special Issue, titled "Women Destroy Science Fiction", an anthology entirely written and edited by women. This issue was funded via Kickstarter, earning $53,136 with an original goal of $5,000. The additional funds allowed "Lightspeed" to publish further volumes, entitled "Women Destory Fantasy" and "Women Destroy Horror."
Awards and recognition.
"Lightspeed" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine in 2011 and 2012, and in 2011 its podcast was awarded a Parsec award for Maggie Clark's "Saying the Names."
In 2010 two Lightspeed stories were finalists for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story: Adam-Troy Castro's "Arvies" and Vylar Kaftan's "I'm Alive, I Love You, I'll See You in Reno" and in 2011 "Amaryllis" by Carrie Vaughn was a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Short story In 2011, Adam-Troy Castro's "Her Husband's Hands" and Tom Crosshill's "Mama, We are Zhenya, Your Son" were finalists for the Best Short Story Nebula, while Jake Kerr's "The Old Equations" was nominated for Best Novella. In 2012, Maria Dahvana Headley's "Give Her Honey When You Hear Her Scream" and Ken Liu's "The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species" were both finalists for the Best Short Story Nebula. In 2014, Ken Liu's "The Litigation Master and the Monkey King" and Christopher Barzak's "Paranormal Romance" were both finalists for the Best Novelette Nebula. In 2014, Matthew Kressel's "The Sounds of Old Earth" and Sylvia Spruck Wrigley's "Alive, Alive Oh" were both finalists for the Best Short Story Nebula.

<doc id="31037176" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31037176" title="Active Archive">
Active Archive

Active Archive is a method of tiered storage which gives the user access to data across a virtualized file system that migrates data between multiple storage systems and media types including solid-state drive/flash, hard disk drives, magnetic tape, optical disk, and cloud. The result of an active archive implementation is that data can be stored on the most appropriate media type for the given retention and restoration requirements of that data. This allows less time sensitive or infrequently accessed data to be stored on less expensive media, and eliminates the need for an administrator to manually migrate data between storage systems. Additionally since storage systems such as tape libraries have very low power consumption, the operational expense of storing data in an active archive is greatly reduced.
Active archives provide organizations with a persistent view of the data in their archives and make it easy to access files whenever needed. Active archives take advantage of metadata in order to keep track of where primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary copies of data reside within the system, in order to maintain online to near-online accessibility to any given file in a file system, regardless of the storage medium being utilized. The impetus for active archive applications, or the software involved in an active archive, was the growing amount of unstructured data in the typical data center and the need to be able to manage and efficiently store that data. As a result, active archive applications tend to be focused on file systems and unstructured data, rather than all of the collective data; however, many have features and functions that address traditional backup needs as well. 
Active archives provide online access, searchability and retrieval to long-term data and enable virtually unlimited scalability to accommodate future growth. In addition, active archives enhance the business value of the data by enabling users to directly access the data online, search it and use it for their business purposes.
Performance.
Since an active archive is built around a cost-performance ratio, the performance standards of these systems vary significantly based on each individual implementation. Within an active archive the quantities and types of media used are determined by the retention and access requirements of the varying types of data. This gives a company the flexibility to determine their own tolerance levels for accessing any given type of data. However, in general, active archive systems can recall data to a use ranging from milliseconds to 2 minutes, depending on what type of media the data is residing.
Important aspects.
Because an active archive is being used for storing both primary, secondary, and tertiary copies of data there are several factors that become necessary for the implementation of an active archive beyond simply the ability to move and access data, data integrity, media monitoring, energy efficiency, and interoperability are all important components of an active archive. Many active archive components include features such as self-healing data within the software, versioning, encryption, and media health monitoring. Reversely, since an active archive is also being used as an archive, features such as automatic migration between storage devices and technologies, vendor neutral formatting, and ILM management are all important components to an active archive as well. Many of these standards are driven due to specific industry compliance requirements such as HIPAA, SOX, PCI Compliance, etc.
Difference between Active Archive and Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM).
While active archiving is often compared to HSM, the two methods have very different implementations. Unlike an HSM, data in an active archive remains online regardless of the age or usage. The access pattern in an active archive is also different than a traditional HSM in that the data is not automatically restored to the "higher tier" storage system when requested, but rather is accessed directly from the storage device that the data is resting on. This makes every storage device in an active archive both primary storage and archival storage.
An active archive is an archive in the sense that it manages the data within the active archive throughout the lifecycle of that data according to each company's particular Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) policies and procedures. This means that while the active archive serves as the primary storage pool, it is also the final storage location for a file at the same time.
Active Archive Alliance.
The Active Archive Alliance is a collaborative industry alliance dedicated to promoting active archives for simplified, online access to all archived data. Launched in early 2010 by founding technology partners Dell, FileTek, QStar Technologies Inc, Silicon Graphics International (SGI) and Spectra Logic, the Active Archive Alliance is a vendor neutral organization open to leading providers of active archive technologies including file systems, active archive applications, cloud storage, and high density tape and disk storage, as well as individuals and end-users. Active Archive Alliance members provide active archive solutions, best practices, and industry testimonials so that organizations can achieve fast, online access to all their data in the most cost effective manner. Active Archive Alliance members include Cleversafe, Crossroads Systems, Dell, DataDirect Networks, Fujifilm, GRAU DATA AG, Hewlett-Packard, Imation, QStar Technologies Inc, Quantum Corporation, Scality, Seven10, Silicon Graphics International, Spectra Logic and XenData.

John Rice Jones

John Rice Jones (February 11, 1759 ‚Äì February 1, 1824) was a Welsh-born, American politician, jurist, and military officer. He helped establish the territorial governments in Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. John Rice Jones was the father of U.S. Senator George W. Jones from Iowa.
Early history.
Jones was born in Mallwyd, Wales, the eldest of fourteen children to John Jones, an excise officer. He received his college education at Oxford University, studying both Medicine and Law. He chose Law as a career and established a practice in London, England
In January, 1781 in Brecon, Wales Jones married Eliza Powell, daughter of Richard and Mary Powell. He remained in Brecon setting up as a solicitor, with chambers at Thanet Place in London.
Life in America.
Military officer.
In 1784 John Rice Jones sailed to the United States, settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania He returned to Wales within the year to bring his wife and son, John Rice, back to America, though leaving behind his infant daughter, Maria. While in Philadelphia he became friends with prominent Americans Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Benjamin Rush while practicing law with noted early attorney Myers Fisher. After two years in Philadelphia hearing tales of the opportunities awaiting in the new American west, in 1786 he moved to Louisville, Kentucky. In September of that year he joined the frontier army of General George Rogers Clark in the campaign to quash an uprising by the Native Americans of the Wabash Confederacy. As part of the ongoing conflict a garrison was established at Fort Vincennes with Jones appointed its Commissary General. Jones was joined by his family at Vincennes, but tragedy soon befell them as Eliza died in childbirth on March 11, 1787. The child, named Myers Fisher Jones for his Philadelphia friend, died soon afterward.
In the late 1780s John Rice Jones began to invest in land, both around Vincennes and Kaskaskia, in what would become the Illinois Territory. In his job as Commissary General Jones had made several trips to the Kaskaskia area. In March, 1791 his land holdings increased again as he was awarded a land tract near Vincennes by the U.S. Congress in appreciation for his military service. It was also in 1791‚Äîon his birthday February 11 in fact‚Äîthat Jones married for a second time, to Mary Barger. While still maintaining his property and law practice at Vincennes, by the early 1790s Jones had moved his family to Kaskaskia. Fluent in French, Spanish, and English, Jones was able to draw on legal clients from all the white inhabitants of the area and would sometimes act as emissary or go-between for the various nationalities. Early settlers often being cash-poor, Jones would accept land parcels as payment for legal work and became one of the territories largest landowners. It was also in the late 1790s that Jones made his first forays into what would eventually become Missouri. In 1797 he accompanied Moses Austin in exploration of lead mining areas west and north of Ste. Genevieve. Shortly thereafter he would become business partners with Austin and two French territorial officials in a mining operation near Mine a' Breton.
Territorial official.
In 1800 Indiana Territory was created from a portion of the old Northwest Territory. When territorial Governor (and later U.S. President) William Henry Harrison organized his administration in early 1801 he appointed Jones as the first Attorney General. The following year Jones, a pro-slavery advocate, participated in a conference that urged the U.S. Congress to repeal or suspend certain slavery portions of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance. With the reorganization of the territory came a new job for John Rice Jones in 1805 as Governor Harrison appointed him to the territory's Legislative Council, where he served until 1808. In 1808 Jones attempted to be named territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress, however a political and personal falling out with Harrison over slavery and the latter's dismissal of the Legislative Council scuttled Jones' bid to represent Indiana in Washington D.C. Perhaps John Rice Jones longest-lasting impact on Indiana came in 1807 when he helped in the founding of Vincennes University and served on its first board of trustees.
Illinois days.
After his falling out with William Henry Harrison in 1808, John Rice Jones left Vincennes for good, choosing to relocate his law practice and family to Kaskaskia. There he and John Edgar championed the cause of splitting the Illinois counties out of Indiana Territory into their own governing entity. This goal was reached on March 1, 1809. However, Jones found nothing but considerable heartache in the new Illinois Territory. It began in December, 2008 when his son Rice Jones was murdered in Kaskaskia. The younger Jones had been involved it a heated political dispute with Sadrach Bond, Jr. which led to a duel. Neither party was wounded in the affair of honor, but Bond's second, Dr. James Dunlap remained unsatisfied and allegedly arranged for the assassination of Rice Jones on a Kaskaskia street. The murderer was never apprehended. Soon after, Federal authorities ruled against many of John Rice Jones' land claims in Illinois, causing some financial loss.
Missouri.
In 1810 Jones, already with considerable business holdings across the Mississippi River‚Äînamely his lead mining venture‚Äîleft Illinois Territory for the Louisiana Territory (Missouri Territory after June 4, 1812) and settled around Mine a' Breton. For the next several years he largely concerned himself with lead mining and smelting. Once the Missouri Territory was organized, Jones served on the legislative council, as he had before in Indiana. In June, 1820 John Rice Jones was a delegate to the Missouri constitutional convention, his legal expertise often called upon in the drafting of the new states laws and regulations. With statehood came two United States Senators and ones very much desired to be one. David Barton was a first ballot selection to claim one of the seats, while Jones and four others vied for the remaining position. By a margin of one vote it went to Thomas Hart Benton.
As a consolation prize of sorts, but really a position much better suited to his temperament and training, John Rice Jones was named one of the three judges appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court in 1821. On the bench Judge Jones often cast dissenting votes and opinions on the various issues brought before the high court. He died without completing his first term on the court, on February 1, 1824.

Ordo Equitum Solis

Ordo Equitum Solis (abbreviated OES) are an alternative music band consisting of French Leithana, pseudonym of Nathalie Herrera (vocals, keyboards, zither, percussions) and Italian Deraclamo, pseudonym of Paolo De Marco (vocals, guitar). The duo formed in 1988, and released albums and toured between 1990 and 2000. In 2001 the band suddenly broke up, but there was a reunion in 2010.
The musical style of OES does not fall into a precise category. While the early albums have pronounced industrial, esoteric darkwave and a touch of medieval influences, with time their musical style matured, embracing multi-faceted sonorities between neofolk, experimentalism and ballad songs. The albums, that include also instrumental tracks, are characterized by a significant switch and mix of genres, making Ordo Equitum Solis' music unusual, various, intimistic and hard to describe. Distinguishing features are Leithana's voice, Deraclamo's folk guitar, lyrics in various languages (English, French, Latin, Italian), highly-emotional melodies, experimental effects, romantic and decadent atmosphere, and remarkable, sometimes provocative arrangements.
Ordo Equitum Solis' releases had often been concept-albums, inspired by symbolic themes or personal experiences. The albums denote also the duality of the band, between Leithana's often inflexible creative genius, and Deraclamo's instinctive inspiration.
History.
Formation.
Leithana and Deraclamo met in 1985 in a post-punk club in Paris (Le Saint), the city where Leithana lived. Deraclamo at that time roamed around London, Paris and Barcelona. They immediately decided to make music together, considering their love for music and the coincidence of their musical taste, especially regarding the dark and post-punk London scene. In addition, both had the same sense of freedom, that would induce a continuous wandering in the following years, a theme developed in their CD "Planetes".
To realize their musical project, in 1987 both moved to Paganotti, a mountain village in Italy, where they made their first album "Solstitii Temporis Sensus". Between 1988 and 1989 Ordo Equitum Solis befriended Tony Wakeford (Sol Invictus), who played on the first two albums of Ordo Equitum Solis. In 1992 Leithana recorded some piano tracks for Sol Invictus. As keyboard-player Leithana also participated in some of Sol Invictus' concerts, in particular during the legendary tour of Death In June, Current 93 and Sol Invictus together (1991).
1990-1997.
On 21 December 1990, the band's first album, "Solstitii Temporis Sensus" was released on the independent label Musica Maxima Magnetica (already label of Sleep Chamber, Vasilisk and numerous other artists). The album had an immediate and unexpected success both in terms of sales and in terms of audience. The cooperation with the label would continue until 1996 with the albums "Animi Aegritudo" (1992), the mini-CD "OES" (1993), the live-album "Parask√©nia" (1994), and finally "Hecate" (1995).
The period is characterized by an artistic growth of the music, as well as an increasing popularity especially among gothic and neofolk listeners. Many articles about and interviews with the band appeared in magazines and fanzines. The band played many concerts in Europe, and also did a tour in the USA and Russia in 1993. Ordo Equitum Solis released "Hecate" in 1995, which was innovative and astonishing, and very different from the music scene's standard of the moment.
From 1995 on there were disagreements between Ordo Equitum Solis and the label Musica Maxima Magnetica, because the distributor Audioglobe interfered more with the band's affairs. The recording sessions of their following album "Planetes" started in 1996, but weren't completed until 1998. That same year the band managed to get back all rights regarding Ordo Equitum Solis‚Äô past and future works, and therefore to be fully operational again, after a forced three year stop.
1998-2001.
"Planetes" was released in January 1999 on Ordo Equitum Solis' own label Sinope, through the UK-based World Serpent Distribution. In addition to "Planetes", the band's revival resulted in the release of the mini-album "Signs", the double CD compilation "Octo", the album "Metamorphosis - Personam Impono" and the 7 inch vinyl picture-disc "A Divine Image". During this period the artistic experimentations of the band kept evolving, with a more refined style detached from clich√©s. A review of "Planetes" stated: "Planetes, with its delicate electro-acoustic ballads and its subtle 'esoteric' keyboard layers, places itself more than worthily in a creative path still in solitary and noteworthy ascent" (Vittore Baroni, Rumore magazine n¬∞ 85 ‚Äì 1999). "Planetes" and the other CD's of this year were reviewed in various international magazines.
Nevertheless, the non-efficient distribution of World Serpent disappointed the band. The general drop in sales faced the band with excessive difficulties. Also, Ordo Equitum Solis found that live-concerts were harder to get or unsatisfying, and the band finally decided to break up, immediately after their concert at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig on 3 June 2001.
Notwithstanding the band's break-up, Leithana and Deraclamo would still continue working on unreleased tracks composed in 1989-90, with the intention of releasing a "posthumous" album. Apart from this, Leithana started working on an solo-album, which she ultimately decided to never publish. In 2002, all musical projects of the band were put on hold.
Since 2010.
In November 2010 an announcement on the band's official website reported the reunion of Ordo Equitum Solis, as well as the release of a brand new album.
Influences and music.
Ordo Equitum Solis is influenced by the gothic and post-punk London music scene of the 1980s, particularly by bands like Joy Division, SPK, Cocteau Twins, Bauhaus, Dead Can Dance, Clair Obscur, Virgin Prunes, Coil, Sol Invictus and Death In June.
The name of the band, which literally means "The Order of the Knights of the Sun" in Latin, was coined by Deraclamo, and was meant to underline a certain vision of the world, willingly anachronistic yet strong and current in the 1990s. The use of the Latin language as well as the look of the band represent some of the innovations introduced by Ordo Equitum Solis, which would be extensively reused in the gothic and alternative music scene. Ordo Equitum Solis is characterized by implicit symbolic and magical themes and more explicit themes of gnosticism, a love of nature and the conceptual union with the elements.

Asher Space Research Institute

The Normal and Helen Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) is a specialized institute dedicated to multidisciplinary scientific research at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa, Israel.
ASRI was established in 1984. Its members come from five Technion faculties, and it has a technical staff of Technion scientists in a variety of space-related fields (Physics, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Autonomous Systems and Computer Sciences). ASRI is a leading space research center in Israel and is involved in the development of space systems based on advanced and innovative technologies, as well as education through advanced degrees.
History.
Technion is Israel's oldest university, founded in 1912 to bring young people the technical skills they would need to build a nation. In the spirit of anticipating future needs, Technion established the faculty of Aeronautical Engineering in 1948. At the time, it was the only place in Israel teaching and researching aeronautics, and it has been credited in bringing the expertise to create the airforce which guaranteed the survival on the young State of Israel. The Faculty evolved into today's Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion. Driven by a need for Israel to move into satellite technology in the 1980s, the Asher Space Research Institute was set up in 1984, four years before Israel formally rocketed into space with the launch of the Ofeq-1 satellite in 1988. Today ASRI, is the only center of higher education for space research in Israel.
On February 12, 2009, the Norman and Helen Asher Space Building was dedicated at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Chicago resident Helen S. Asher and her late husband Norman provided the $3.5 million lead gift for the building. The occasion also celebrated the 30-year anniversary of Israel's space program.
The Institute is today managed by ASRI Director Prof. Ehud Behar.
ASRI Mission.
ASRI's stated mission is to expand the frontiers of space research; investigate the Cosmos and Earth; combine innovations in science and technology; foster collaboration with industry and academia worldwide; and to promote scientific and technological education.
Selected Laboratories.
In parallel to system development activities, members of the Institute technical staff perform, in collaboration with faculty members, research in various space related fields.
The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL).
The Distributed Space Systems Laboratory (DSSL) is focused on dynamics and control of multiple spacecraft formation flying. The experimental facility is designed and equipped to test methods and machinery under circumstances as close to actual operating conditions as possible, including cooperative control, relative position and attitude sensing and space-borne sparse-aperture imaging. The lab includes an air bearing table, model satellites, and sensing devices.
ASRI DSSL is currently working towards the launch of a formation flying mission into an Earth orbit.
Electric Propulsion.
ASRI's research into electric propulsion of small satellites has culminated in the creation of the patented CAMILA, cited as the most efficient and effective rocket propulsion engine for space-craft and satellites.
Working in collaboration with Israel's Soreq National Research Laboratory and RAFAEL, ASRI's Electric Propulsion laboratory is said to be pioneering the next generation of small thrusters. The lab is headed by Prof. Alexander Kapulkin, a rocket scientist from the former Soviet Union.
Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI).
The Laboratory for Space Interferometry (LaSI) at the Asher Space Research Institute seeks solutions for improving the angular resolution of telescopes for both astronomical and Earth observations from space.
Education.
ASRI's educational activities include topical lectures for engineering students, supervision of undergraduate students space projects, and of graduate research theses'. 
One example of ASRI's educational initiatives was the DUSAT project. This consists of two dentical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) microsatellites designed for simultaneous three-dimensional mapping.
A current example is SABRES: a constellation of microsatellites for automated meter reading and other non-real time communication services.
In addition to undergraduate and graduate degrees, ASRI has opportunities for postdoctoral research positions and frequently hosts international scientists.
Gurwin TechSat.
Gurwin TechSat was one of the world's first microsatellites to be designed, built and launched by students.
Operations of TechSat II, also known as TechSat-1b and Gurwin-TechSAT-2, ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
In the early 1990s, the Technion proposed building three or four small satellites for continuous early warning coverage. The TechSat Gurwin I was named in honour of Joseph and Rosalind Gurwin, whose interest and support of Israeli space research enabled its development.
The flight model was completed in October 1994, but the first TechSat, also known as TechSat-1a, was lost when its Soviet converted ICBM Start launch vehicle failed. 
On 10 July 1998, the next microsatellite in the series, TechSat/Gurwin II, was successfully launched by Zenit 2 from Baikonur Cosmodrome. 
The Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) at Technion managed and conducted TechSat II operations from the university-based station. The solar cells used thin-film photovoltaic cell technology developed in Russia; they were mounted on four of the six outer aluminium panels. The box-shaped TechSat II carried 6 instruments to perform a range of experiments. 
Operations of TechSat II ceased in April 2010 when deterioration of its solar cells reduced power output so that the nominal performance of the satellite systems could no longer be supported.
The mission has been said to demonstrate that a reduction of the satellite mass, size, and power consumption can be achieved without deterioration of its basic characteristics, such as mission life, payload efficiency and measurements precision.
Education and Outreach.
SpaceIL.
Sharing the vision of creating an "Apollo" moment to inspire young people in science, technology and space research, ASRI is actively supporting SpaceIL - the Israeli team competing in the Google Lunar X Competition to land a small space-craft on the moon by the end of 2012. The team hopes that by successfully landing the Israeli flag on the moon, they will inspire new generations of excellent scientists. They also plan to donate all prize money to educational projects.
Ilan Ramon Space Team Program.
In 2002, ASRI set up the Ilan Ramon Space Club, in collaboration with the Jerusalem-based Society for Excellence in Education.
After the tragic loss of the Columbia Shuttle and its crew, the space club was renamed in honor of Ilan Ramon - Israel's first astronaut. Ramon had conducted experiments in space designed by high school students and commissioned by ASRI and Israel's Ministry of Education.
The club today consists of 12 nationwide groups of 20 high school students each. ASRI researchers prepare the syllabus for the clubs which are run with the help of Technion undergraduates.
Science and Communication.
Part of ASRI's global outreach drive involves a social media initiative to educated and inform the general public about space research in general and projects at Technion's ASRI in particular. This includes an active presence on Facebook, Twitter, and a blog, with regular updates on develops in space research.

Knockboy, County Waterford

Knockboy ( meaning "Yellow Hill"), commonly referred to as Ballygunner (), is a suburb and formally a village on the outskirts of Waterford City, Ireland. Originally an independent village, it has become submerged with Waterford City, due to "urban sprawl", and now forms part of the city's "suburbs". It is forms part of the dual parishes of St. Mary's and St Joseph and St. Benildus.
History.
The old village of Knockboy consisted of an old 18th-century church, 19th-century schoolhouse, a row of cottages and a small pub at the base of the hill. In 1948, a new national school was built at the top of the hill. In 1980, the Waterford city boundaries extended, making Knockboy part of the Greater Waterford area. In 1984, the National School was moved to beside the Ballygunner hurling pitch, the old school buildings being developed into a Gaelscoil. In the early 1990s, the cottages were demolished and new council houses were built at the site. In the 2000s, a new housing estate was built adjoining the original village, in practise making it a suburb of Waterford City. In late 2009, redevelopment of the old church began which involved extending two sides of the church. In 2011, the crossroads at the site of "Gaelscoile Baile Mhic Gonair" were redeveloped to feature one single crossroad rather than two along with traffic lights.

Max Muscle

John Czawlytko (born February 22, 1963) is an American former professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances in World Championship Wrestling under the ring names Max Muscle and Maxx. 
Professional wrestling career.
Early career (1992-1993).
After a career as a bodybuilder, Czawlytko began training to become a professional wrestler. Following his training, Czawlytko adopted the ring name The Brute and began competing as part of a tag team called The Skull Crushers alongside Bryan Carreiro, who performed under the ring name The Beast.
World Championship Wrestling (1993-1997).
In 1993, Czawlytko signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling. He was sent to the WCW Power Plant for seasoning. Later in the year, he debuted on WCW television under the name Big Bad John, making appearances on the promotion's secondary television shows "Saturday Night", "Main Event", and "Pro". In 1995, he was repackaged as a heel under the ring name Max Muscle and became Diamond Dallas Page's bodyguard, where he consistently helped Page cheat in arm wrestling contests. However, Muscle's alliance with Page ended by 1996, as Muscle broke away from Page and briefly turned face. However, this was short-lived, as Muscle joined the Dungeon of Doom later on in the year under the ring name Maxx, reverting into a heel in the process. While a member of the Dungeon, Maxx wrestled and lost to Page on the March 17, 1997 episode of "Saturday Night" and then again on the March 19 episode of "Nitro".
On the April 1, 1997 episode of "Saturday Night", Czawlytko wrestled his final match for WCW as he defeated Roger Boone.
Retirement.
After leaving WCW, Czawlytko took a two-year-long hiatus from wrestling. On March 11, 1999, Czawlytko competed in his return match, then under the tweaked ring name Maxx Muscle, where he and Corporal Punishment wrestled to a no contest for Maryland Championship Wrestling. On April 8, Muscle lost to Punishment in a rematch. Following losses in both singles and tag team matches, Czawlytko left MCW in mid-October and wrestled his final match on January 29, 2000, when he resumed his Maxx ring name as he defeated Felony in a match for Xtreme Pro Wrestling.

St Luke's Church, Oseney Crescent

St Luke's Church, Oseney Crescent, Kentish Town, was a redundant Anglican church in the parish of Camden Town, London, under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust until April 15, 2011. At that time a pastoral measure was passed naming Revd Jonathan March as the new parish priest. Renovation work by HTB was completed in January 2012 and services have recommenced as of 29 January 2012
The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building,
History.
The construction in the 1860s of the Midland Railway's London terminus, St Pancras railway station, necessitated the demolition of a number of buildings on Euston Road, one of which was the recently erected St Luke's Church, designed by John Johnson and built in 1856-61 on the corner of Midland Road. The church was taken down and re-erected in 1866-7, with alterations by Johnson, as a Congregational church in Wanstead. The ¬£12,500 compensation provided by the railway company and the ¬£526 which purchased the building for Wanstead were used by the London congregation to build a new St Luke's in Oseney Crescent, Kentish Town.
Architecture.
The new St Luke's was built in 1867-9 to the designs of the 25-year-old Basil Champneys. It was his first church and one of his first buildings. His father, William Weldon Champneys, who commissioned the church, was the vicar of the parish of St Pancras. John Johnson, who had expected to be the architect of the new church, was not pleased to be passed over.
Exterior.
The exterior of the church is largely red brick with stone dressings, and the roof is tiled. The tower with its saddleback gabled roof is in the North German style, with three arcaded openings to the belfry and plate tracery above. The detail of the nave, chancel and aisles is Early English revival.
The nave has four bays with narrow aisles. The chancel is situated beneath the tower. It has a polygonal apse with plate tracery. The west end has three lancet windows, with a plate tracery rose window above. The aisles and clerestory have pointed windows in pairs.
Interior.
The walls are of exposed red brick with two bands of stone. The nave arcades have low cylindrical pillars. Between the arches are shafts which support the principal roof timbers. The floor is paved with red and black tiles. From the crossing, there are three steps up to the brick-vaulted chancel and a further six steps up to the sanctuary, which has decorative tiles and sedilia. The reredos was added in the 1930s. The brass eagle lectern (1882) came from the war-damaged St Paul's Church, Camden Square, one of whose architects was John Johnson, designer of the original St Luke's. The Willis organ was installed in 1893.

Saif al-Arab Gaddafi

Saif al-Arab Gaddafi (, "lit. Sword of the Arabs; of the Gaddafa"; 1982 ‚Äì 30 April 2011) was the sixth son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. From around 2006 to 2010, Saif al-Arab spent much of his time in Munich where he was enrolled at the Technical University Munich. On 30 April 2011, the Libyan government reported that Saif al-Arab and three of his young nieces and nephews were killed by a NATO airstrike on his house during the Libyan civil war. During the beginning of the uprising, Saif al-Arab was put in charge of military forces by his father in order to put down protesters in Benghazi. Saif al-Arab was viewed as the most low-profile of Gaddafi's eight children.
Early life.
Saif al-Arab was born in 1982 in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. His father was Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and his mother was Safia Farkash, Gaddafi's second wife. Saif al-Arab was wounded in the U.S. bombing attack of 1986 when he was four years old.
Life in Munich.
In 2006 Saif al-Arab enrolled as a student at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. In November that year, while living as a student in Munich, Saif al-Arab became involved in a fight with a nightclub bouncer, after his girlfriend was thrown out of Munich‚Äôs "4004" nightclub for performing a strip show for Saif al-Arab. In the resulting scuffle Saif al-Arab received a cut to his head. Although Saif al-Arab was charged, the Munich public prosecutor dropped charges on the basis that a prosecution would not be in the public interest. German police later received reports that Saif al-Arab was planning an acid attack against the bouncer and the Libyan embassy in Germany unsuccessfully attempted to secure diplomatic immunity for Saif al-Arab. By March 2007, Saif al-Arab's location was not known and it was thought that he was not in Germany.
In 2008, Saif al-Arab was again studying in Munich. Excessive noise from the exhaust of his Ferrari F430 led to questions from the German police and his car being impounded. Also that year Saif al-Arab was suspected of attempting to smuggle an assault rifle, a revolver and munitions from Munich to Paris in a car with diplomatic number plates. However, the case was later dropped as the alleged weapons were never found and the German public prosecutor decided that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a prosecution. The Guardian newspaper reported that German police officers had stated that the case was dropped out of fear that German businesses and residents in Libya would suffer retaliatory action, although this was denied by the German prosecutor's office. In addition to his studies, Al Jazeera reported Saif al-Arab engaged in unspecified business activities and spent much of his time partying while in Munich. Notwithstanding these media reports, Saif al-Arab was viewed as the most low-profile of Gaddafi's sons.
Actions during the Libyan civil war.
In February 2011, following the outbreak of the Libyan civil war, the German press reported that Saif al-Arab had returned to Libya. Subsequently, the Bavarian Interior Ministry stated that he had been declared "persona non grata".
On 26 February 2011, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 1970 which imposed a travel ban on Saif al-Arab but stopped short of imposing asset freezing as it did with many other members of the Gaddafi family. An Interpol notice (orange notice) was then issued against him.
Death.
On 30 April 2011, a Libyan government spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, announced an air strike on Saif al-Arab's house had killed Saif al-Arab, along with three of Muammar Gaddafi's grandchildren. Moussa Ibrahim refused to release the names of the grandchildren killed for "privacy reasons". The government also claimed Muammar Gaddafi was present in the house during the attack, but "escaped". The next day Libyan state TV showed footage of two bodies in a hospital fully covered and veiled, and thus unidentifiable, but claimed that one of them was Saif al-Arab Gaddafi's corpse.
NATO said it struck a command and control center, not a residential structure and that it was not targeting individuals. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office says it is unable to verify if Saif al-Arab or his relatives were killed.
Members of the opposition centred in Benghazi have speculated that the Libyan government's claim of Saif al-Arab's death was a tactic to gain sympathy. Abdul Hafez Goga, spokesman for the National Transitional Council, said he thinks it could all be fabrication: "Back in 1986, Gaddafi once claimed that Ronald Reagan, then US president, had launched a strike on his compound in Tripoli and killed his daughter. Many journalists since then investigated and found out that the actual child that had died had nothing to do with Gaddafi, that he sort of adopted her posthumously."
NATO claimed that it has no evidence of his death and could neither confirm nor deny Libyan claims. They further said what the Libyan government has called a "residence" actually held an underground bunker which is used as a command and control center and that was the target.
The French surgeon G√©rard Le Clouerec who worked at a private clinic in Libya was asked by the Libyan authorities to provide independent verification of the identity of the bodies of one adult and two children. While Le Clouerec was confident that all three had been killed as a result of blast injuries, due to the severity of the injuries he could not identify the bodies of the children. He was able to confirm that the adult corpse was the body of a man aged about 30, with a thin moustache and beard. Le Clouerec was shown a photograph, which he was told depicted Saif al-Arab. The face of the man's body matched that of the photograph and Le Clouerec concluded that the body was "most probably the son of Colonel Gaddafi." The highest-ranking Roman Catholic official in Tripoli, Apostolic Vicar Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli, also confirmed the death of Saif al-Arab; his body was reported to be shown to the leaders of churches in Libya.
On 25 May, Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, dismissed claims of Saif al-Arab's death as propaganda. He said that according to intelligence services, Saif al-Arab was not dead but was living in another unspecified country.
In August, with the pro-Gaddafi forces on the brink of losing Tripoli, Saif al-Arab's brother Mutassim spoke of envying Saif al-Arab as according to Mutassim, his brother had been "martyred" in a NATO airsrike. Mutassim had been speaking privately to his former girlfriend, Talitha van Zon.
Funeral.
About 2,000 of Muammar Gaddafi's supporters attended the funeral of the Libyan leader's son Saif al-Arab, his second youngest, in Tripoli on 2 May 2011, as the regime intensified its attack on the besieged city of Misrata. The elder Gaddafi himself did not attend the funeral, however, two of his other sons, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was seen as his father's intended successor, and Hannibal were both observed in the crowd.
Saif al-Arab's body, covered in a cloth of pro-Gaddafi green, was brought to the Al-Hani Cemetery in a black ambulance.
Three of Muammar Gaddafi's grandchildren, identified by the authorities as being a child each of Hannibal, Muhammad and their sister Ayesha, were also buried.

Karsdorf Fault

The Karsdorf Fault ( or "Karsdorfer Verwerfung") is a striking tectonic fracture line, which is part of the Central Saxon Fault, and is located in the eastern Ore Mountains and the Elbe Valley Slate Mountains. It forms the northern geological boundary of the Eastern Ore Mountains in the district of S√§chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge with the Elbe zone, where it is adjoined by the D√∂hlen Basin and the Kreischa Basin.
It derives its name from the town of Karsdorf near Rabenau, formerly also known as "Wendisch-Carsdorf". As a result the fault line is also called the Wendisch-Carsdorf Fault Line ("Wendisch-Carsdorfer Verwerfungslinie") in historical literature.
Near Karsdorf the fault line runs in a southeasterly direction where it is geomorphologically outlined by the following clearly visible features:
South of the fracture line is an almost level wooded area with remnants of sandstone - the Dippoldiswald and Hirschbach Heaths - which are drained by the Oelsabach, Hirschbach and Lockwitzbach. These woodland areas are part of the Cretaceous Elbe Sandstone and are regionally important for their water supply. The oldest sections of these relicts belong to the earliest Cretaceous deposits ("Niedersch√∂na Formation") in the Dresden region. They are separated from the main Elbe Valley chalk region by the Karsdorf Fault.

South African Class 8 4-8-0

The South African Class 8 4-8-0 of 1902 is a South African steam locomotive from the pre-Union era in the Cape Colony.
In 1902 and 1903 the Cape Government Railways placed twenty-three 8th Class steam locomotives with a 4-8-0 Mastodon type wheel arrangement in service, three on the Cape Western System, eight on the Cape Midland System and twelve on the Cape Eastern System. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered but retained their Class 8 classification.
Manufacture.
Evolution.
The first 8th Class locomotives of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) were Consolidation types designed by H.M. Beatty, the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR from 1896 to 1910. It was later to become the South African Railways (SAR) Class 8X.
While these first Schenectady and ALCO built 2-8-0 locomotives were being subjected to exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading two-wheeled pony truck and, when designs were prepared at Salt River for a later order for more locomotives, the pony truck was replaced with a four-wheeled bogie.
These twenty-three locomotives were the first 8th Class locomotives of the CGR to be built with a Mastodon type wheel arrangement. In spite of the difference in wheel arrangement, these Consolidations and Mastodons of the CGR were all grouped together into the 8th Class.
Manufacturer.
The new 4-8-0 locomotives were built by Neilson, Reid and Company in 1901 and 1902 and delivered in three batches in 1902 and 1903. The first batch of three, numbered in the range from 801 to 803, went to the CGR‚Äôs Western System in 1902. Of the second batch of ten that arrived in 1902, eight were numbered in the range from 358 to 365 and allocated to the Midland System, while the other two became numbers 771 and 772, allocated to the Eastern System. The last batch of ten, numbered in the range from 773 to 782, arrived in 1903 and all went to the Eastern System.
They were conceived as mixed traffic locomotives, equally suitable for goods and passenger work. They had larger driving wheels than the Class 7, bar frames, used saturated steam and had Stephenson valve gear. In service it was found that the four wheeled bogies and the slightly shorter fixed wheelbase made them steadier and easier riding than their 2-8-0 predecessors.
Class 8 sub-classes.
The Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, in terms of the South Africa Act. One of the clauses in the Act required that the three Colonial Government railways, the CGR, the Natal Government Railways and the Central South African Railways, also be united under one single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. While the SAR came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways required careful planning and was only implemented with from 1 January 1912.
When these twenty-three locomotives were assimilated into the SAR in 1912, they were renumbered in the range from 1069 to 1091, but they retained their Class 8 classification.
The rest of the 8th Class Consolidations and Mastodons of the CGR, together with the Class 8-L1 to 8-L3 Mastodon locomotives of the Central South African Railways, were grouped into nine more different sub-classes by the SAR. The other locomotives became SAR Classes 8A to 8F and the 2-8-0 locomotives became Classes 8X to 8Z.
Modification.
During A.G. Watson‚Äôs term as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, many of the Class 8 to Class 8F locomotives were equipped with superheated boilers, larger bore cylinders and either inside or outside admission piston valves. The outside admission locomotives had their cylinder bore increased from to and retained their existing SAR Class 8 classifications, while the inside admission locomotives had their cylinder bore increased to and were reclassified by having a "W" suffix added to their existing SAR classifications.
Of the Class 8 locomotives, five were equipped with superheated boilers, bore cylinders and outside admission piston valves, while retaining their Class 8 classification.
Four locomotives were equipped with superheated boilers, bore cylinders and inside admission piston valves and reclassified to Class 8W.
The Class 8 and Class 8W works numbers, renumbering and superheating modifications are shown in the table.
Service.
In SAR service, the Class 8 family of locomotives served on every system in the country and in the 1920s became the mainstay of motive power on many branchlines. Their final days were spent in shunting service and by 1972 they were all withdrawn.
Modifications illustrated.
The main picture shows Class 8 no. 1088, ex CGR no. 779, as built, at East London circa 1930. The following pictures serve to illustrate both sides of the Class 8 locomotive as well as the piston valve and superheating modification.

Wellington Pit

Wellington Colliery was a coal mine operating on the Manchester Coalfield before 1869 in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, then in the historic county of Lancashire, England.
Originally named Messhing Trees, the colliery was sunk by William Ramsden and, with Nelson Pit, formed Ramsden's Shakerley Collieries. The colliery worked the Trencherbone mine at 360 yards and was ventilated by furnace in 1895. Coal to make gas and household coal was produced in 1896 from the Arley, Hell hole, Trencherbone and Yard mines. Shakerley Collieries employed 422 underground and 87 surface workers. (Total for both pits) 
The colliery lasted until 1935 when the company was taken over by Manchester Collieries and closed the same year.

Richard Clarida

Richard Clarida (born 1957) is an American economist, C. Lowell Harriss Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University and Global Strategic Advisor for PIMCO. He is notable for his contributions to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. He is a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and is a recipient of the Treasury Medal.
Academic career and research contributions.
Since 1988, Richard Clarida has instructed students in Economics and International Affairs at Columbia University, where he is the C. Lowell Harriss Professor of Economics. From 1997 until 2001, Clarida served as chairman of the Department of Economics at Columbia University. Earlier in his career, he had been a member of the Cowles Foundation at Yale University.
Clarida's research centers on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling, a branch of applied general equilibrium theory that is influential in contemporary macroeconomics optimal monetary policy, especially through the lens of time series analysis. His studies with Jordi Gal√≠ and Mark Gertler suggest that monetary policy in many countries today resembles a forward looking Taylor rule, whereas the policy makers of the 1970s failed to follow such a forward looking Taylor rule.
Clarida has published numerous frequently cited articles in leading academic journals on monetary policy, exchange rates, interest rates, and international capital flows. He is frequently invited to present his research to the world's leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan. Recently, he has written on the monetary policy implications of the low-inflation period created by the 2008 financial crisis.
Other professional achievements.
Clarida served as the Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury for Economic Policy, a position that required confirmation by the US Senate. In that position, he served as chief economic advisor to two Treasury Secretaries, Paul O'Neill and John W. Snow, advising them on economic policy issues, including the U.S. and global economic prospects, international capital flows, corporate governance, and the maturity structure of U.S. debt. In May 2003, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow awarded Clarida The Treasury Medal in recognition for his record of outstanding service to the Treasury Department.
Clarida has served as a consultant to several prominent financial firms, including the Global Foreign Exchange Group at Credit Suisse First Boston and Grossman Asset Management.

Michael S. Bernick

Michael S. Bernick (born October 1, 1952) served as Director of California‚Äôs labor department, the Employment Development Department (EDD) from 1999 to 2004. He is a practitioner and theorist of job training and employment strategies. In a series of articles and books written during the 1980s and 1990s, drawing on his experience in community job training, he argues against the then-expanding social welfare system. He sets out alternative strategies of inner city entrepreneurship and market-based training and job ladders. In the 2000s, his practice and writing turned to worker retraining and reemployment strategies in response to the job losses accompanying globalization, technology, and the impacts of the Great Recession.
Bernick grew up in Los Angeles through Fairfax High School, and attended Harvard University (B.A. 1974), Oxford University (Balliol College, B. Phil. 1976) and the University of California, Berkeley Law School (J.D. 1979).
After graduating from law school, he spent much of the next seven years as executive director of the San Francisco Renaissance Center, a community job training agency that operated a series of literacy and vocational training classes, an early welfare to work program, and five business ventures providing transitional employment. In 1986 Bernick went into private law practice but remained a board member of several community job training agencies until being appointed EDD Director in 1999. Following the recall of California Governor Gray Davis, Bernick returned to law at the Sedgwick firm in San Francisco, and joined the Milken Institute as a fellow in employment policy. He continues to be active with several community job training agencies and work force intermediaries in California and with the Autism Job Club.
Criticism of the Welfare State, and Developing Market-Oriented Job Creation and Training.
In the early 1980s, Bernick began a series of articles and books on job training and employment, written from the viewpoint of the practitioner. "The Dreams of Jobs" (1982) reviews the job training programs in San Francisco from 1960 to 1980, and was followed a few years later by "Urban Illusions" (1986), covering job training experiences at the Renaissance Center.
Bernick was an early proponent of what became welfare reform under President Bill Clinton, and of market-based approaches to vocational and literacy training. He also argued for strategies of inner city entrepreneurship and inner city loan funds.
After becoming EDD Director in 1999, Bernick continued to write about training strategies, particularly job ladders for low wage workers and employment for workers with disabilities. His 2006 book, "Job Training That Gets Results" is an attempt to summarize lessons learned from the job training programs of the past 50 years. It contains the themes of market-oriented training and entrepreneurship, along with the professionalization of the low wage workforces, role of extra-governmental entities, and restructuring of government social services structures.
Worker Retraining and Reemployment Strategies in Response to Job Losses.
After leaving EDD in 2004, Bernick‚Äôs practice and writing turned to worker retraining and reemployment strategies. In twice-monthly California employment postings dating from early 2009 for the website Fox & Hounds, he has chronicled the large scale job losses in California employment during the Great Recession and the transformation of California industries. In essays for Zocalo Public Square and other journals, he has examined a range of employment issues: the breakdown in full time employment and rise of alternative forms of employment, the projected growth of the ‚Äúnon-knowledge economy,‚Äù the evolving forms of job placement, policies that restrict job creation, crowdfunding and anti-poverty impacts, and why most approaches today to wage inequality are ineffective.
As a practictioner, Bernick joined with workforce intermediaries and businesses in designing worker retraining for growth occupations in engineering, health care, and information technology. He has designed re-employment projects, utilizing the emerging internet job search and sorting tools. 
The Autism Job Club.
Bernick has been involved since 2004 in a series of projects involving adults on the autistic spectrum. He was part of teams developing programs for persons with autism at California State University East Bay and at William Jessup University. He helped develop The Specialists Guild, employing persons with autism in software testing, and the Autism Job Club, for building extra-governmental autism employment networks.
Transit Village Movement.
In 1988 Bernick was elected to the board of directors of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) rail system and soon began to note the lack of land development linked to rail. With UC Berkeley Professor Robert Cervero, he established a research center at UC Berkeley focused on the link of land use and transit, and together they published a series of articles leading to their 1996 book, "Transit Villages in the 21st Century". The book helped to develop and popularize the transit village concept.
Controversy.
Veteran Bay Area investigative reporters "Matier & Ross" wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle in June 1996 that the newly elected BART Director Michael Bernick "accepted campaign contributions from BART contractors". And "excerpts of a federal wire tap in connection with indictments showed that Bernick regularly talked to contractors about extending a deal for them at the same time they were helping to raise campaign contributions for his re-election."

Thomas Reeve (divine)

Thomas Reeve, D.D. (1594‚Äì1672), was an English royalist and Anglican divine.
Life.
Reeve was born at Langley, Norfolk, in 1594. He was the son of Thomas Reeve, a husbandman, and received his education in a school kept by Mr. Matchet at Moulton, Norfolk. On 30 June 1610 he was admitted a sizar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1613, M.A. in 1617, B.D. in 1624, and D.D. in 1660. After taking orders he was presented to the incumbency of Waltham Abbey, Essex, succeeding Thomas Fuller (1608‚Äì61), and he died there on 21 February 1671‚Äì2.
During his incumbency at Waltham Abbey, the Royal Arms of Charles II were put up in the church. They were commissioned in 1662 at a cost of ¬£24, and are still on display. The date may reflect the passing of the Act of Uniformity 1662.
Reeve, who was greatly admired as a preacher, published a number of sermons and devotional works.
