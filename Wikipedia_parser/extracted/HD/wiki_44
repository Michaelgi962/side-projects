Minor Calvo

Minor de Jesus Calvo is a Catholic priest and radio personality born in Costa Rica, convicted of fraud and accused of murder in 2007.
His works.
Father Minor jumped into the public eye as a charismatic leader in the Catholic Church in Costa Rica, he was able to gather many people in the Paso Ancho church.
Tv program.
He then got his own TV show, that lasted about 3 minutes, and in which he read a Bible passage and analyzed by applying it to everyday life. This program gave popularity to the father, who soon moved to the radio.
Radio program.
Radio Maria de Guadalupe was founded with the help of many entrepreneurs, but also monetary contributions collected in donation campaigns organized by the station, through various events, from social, to even people that were made to the radio to deposit their donations.
The station Radio Maria de Guadalupe collected approximately ¢ 1,000,000 (about $ 2,500 of that time) daily, which is a record in Costa Rican radio, second only to programs (television, radio because no one has these figures) created specifically to raise money, such as Chain Telethon or Mayor.
Controversy.
However, criticism from a satirical radio comedy program, called La Patada (The Kick) conducted by a Colombian named Parmenio Medina (assassinated in 2001), created friction between the two programs, as la patada accused the Radio Maria de Guadalupe of alleged embezzlement, The kick was characterized by a cutting sarcastic humor, and their jokes used to be topics about corruption, football, politics, and now, "Radio Maria de Guadalupe".
This version was supported by some former employees of the radio, but was denied by the father, despite weighing evidence against him:
The situation worsened when the priest was stopped in his car by police officer of Costa Rica driving on the night in La Sabana Metropolitan Park (which is not a road crossing zone, and that for the most part, has no lighting at night) accompanied by a minor. While the father wasn't caught committing a crime, the situation was taken by many as reprehensible, or at least suspect. The father testified that he was teaching the child how to drive.
Closing Radio Maria de Guadalupe.
Due to the highly controversial situation, Monsignor Román Arrieta Villalobos (who would die two years later), the highest Catholic authority in Costa Rica, decided to terminate the operations of the radio. Several groups demonstrated against the closure, as were certain groups of taxi drivers and other followers of the radio. But the decision was taken and held.
Today, the frequency is used by the radio station "La Paz del Dial" and remains of a religious theme.
The murder of Parmenio.
On July 7, 2001, Parmenio Medina was shot dead at the entrance of his home. This crime was perpetrated by hired killers, who fled the scene quickly, police said in a gray Hyundai.
The suspicions relating Calvo to the crime were confirmed when he was arrested on charges of masterminding the crime, along with businessman Omar Chávez.
Parmenio Medina's murder was heavily covered and discussed in Costa Rica. Partly this was because of the direct involvement of a notorious Catholic priest in a country with a heavy Roman Catholic majority. It was also the first murder of a journalist in Costa Rica, and thus a direct challenge to the country's freedom of expression.
Some figures of the trial.
On December 18, 2007, father Minor was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud in relation to the Catholic station Radio Maria de Guadalupe, but was acquitted of involvement in the murder of Parmenio Medina. Moreover, Omar Chavez was sentenced to 35 years in prison for the murder of Medina and 12 for fraud in relation to Radio Maria de Guadalupe, while another defendant was sentenced to 30 years for murder. In total, the 9 accused, 6 were acquitted and 3 convicted, which had generated much controversy in the country.

Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper

Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) is an instrument on the Juno spacecraft en route to the planet Jupiter. It is an image spectrometer and was contributed by Italy. Similar instruments are on ESA Rosetta, Venus Express, and Cassini-Huygens missions. The primary goal of JIRAM is to probe the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere down to pressures of 5–7 bars (72–102 pound/square inch) at infrared wavelengths in the 2–5 μm interval using an imager and a spectrometer. Jupiter's "hot spots" and auroral regions are targeted for study.
It is hoped ions, ammonia, and phosphine can be mapped. The ion of Hydrogen is rare on Earth, but is one of the most common ions in the universe and known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.

Fantine (painting)

Fantine is a painting by Margaret Bernadine Hall (1863–1910) hanging in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, England. It is executed in oil on canvas, and measures 157 cm by 116.2 cm.
History.
The subject of the painting is Fantine, a character in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Misérables". It was painted in Paris in 1886, the year following Victor Hugo's death, and received an honourable mention from the Société des Femmes Peintres. The following year some of Hall's paintings were shown at exhibitions in Vienna, Chicago, London and Manchester, and it is likely that "Fantine" was among them. After Hall's death in 1910, her brother Sir Douglas Bernard Hall offered the painting to the National Gallery, London, but it was declined. During the following year he offered it to the Walker Art Gallery, where it was accepted. In 1988 the painting was restored in the Harriet Owen Hughes Conservation Centre in Bluecoat Chambers, Liverpool, and as of 2012, it hangs at the head of the main staircase of the Walker Art Gallery.
Description.
The painting depicts the full-face portrait of a seated woman with strong highlights, in front of a dark background. The woman looks forward with a sad, wistful expression. In front of her is a cot containing a sleeping baby and an empty feeding bottle, with a doll in a red dress lying on the floor. The painting represents an episode in the early chapters of "Les Misérables". Fantine, having fallen in love, had been made pregnant, and then abandoned. This occurred in Paris during a period following the French Revolution. The baby was later nicknamed Cosette. The painting demonstrates the sorrow and poverty of an abandoned single mother in post-Revolutionary France.

Frank Fowler (writer)

Francis Edmund Town Fowler (1833 – 22 August 1863) was a British-born author and journalist who later played a significant role in the early development of Australia's literary culture. He is best known for his book "Southern Lights and Shadows" (London, 1859), and for founding and editing Australia's first literary journal, "The Month".
Background and career.
Frank Fowler was born in London to a publishing family. He worked as a journalist for "The Times" and reported for two sessions in the House of Commons. In 1855-57 he visited New South Wales and joined the staff of the "Sydney Empire" and also wrote for the "Sydney Morning Herald". He co-founded and edited Australia’s first literary journal, "The Month", and regularly addressed the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts on poetry, theatre, literature, politics and the importance of developing a uniquely Australian culture. His lectures were published as "Texts for Talkers" (London, 1860). He wrote the preface to "Australian Musical Album" (Sydney, 1857), and reviewed various performers, including the visiting French baritone Emile Coulon. Fowler also wrote a play, 'Eva', which was performed in Sydney in 1856.
Frank Fowler was a member of the Stenhouse Circle, a close-knit group colonial writers and intellectuals in the 1850s and 1860s, which included Nicol Drysdale Stenhouse, Richard Rowe, Charles Harpur, Henry Kendall, Joseph Moore, James Lionel Michael, Henry Halloran, William Bede Dalley, professors John Woolley and Charles Badham, and Sir Henry Parkes, the ‘Father of the Australian Federation’. Fowler clashed with Parkes following his critical review of Parkes’s poem "Stolen Moments" (1842).
In January 1858 Fowler contested the Sydney City seat in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, with the support of N. D. Stenhouse, Joseph Sheridan Moore, newspaper proprietor James Fairfax, and shipowner Edye Manning. However, his candidature was unsuccessful.
In April 1858 Fowler returned to England with his wife Rachel, "née" Clarke, whom he had married at a Congregational Church in Sydney on 9 February 1856, and their infant son. He was sent off with a testimonial. He wrote his first major work "Southern Lights and Shadows" (London, 1859) on the voyage He became editor of the Weekly Mail, leader-writer on The Standard and contributed occasionally to the Empire. He published in London "The Wreck of the 'Royal Charter'" (1859)"Dottings of a Lounger" (1859) and, as Harpur Atherton, "Adrift or, the Rock in the South Atlantic" (1861). He founded the London Library Co. and was its first secretary. As it began to flourish he died aged 30 from brain fever on 22 August 1863 at Kensington. His widow and children returned to Sydney. In 1864, a collection of his works with a brief biography, was published called Last Gleanings.
The "Oxford Companion to Australian Literature" notes that 'Fowler contributed significantly to literary, political and social discussion of the contemporary colonial scene.'

He focuses his practice on representing plaintiffs in cases involving serious personal injury, medical malpractice, and wrongful death, and has achieved numerous seven- and eight-figure verdicts and settlements over the years on their behalf. In 2009, he and his son co-tried a car-accident case that resulted in a $33.2 million jury verdict, the biggest in Lake County, Ill., history. He also tried a medical-malpractice case resulting in a $13.3 million verdict for his client.

The Empire Writes Back

The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in Post-Colonial Literature is a 1989 non-fiction book on postcolonialism, penned by Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin. "The Empire Writes Back" was the first major theoretical account of a wide range of postcolonial texts and their relationship with bigger issues of postcolonial culture, and is said to be one of the most significant and important works published in the field of postcolonialism. The writers debate on the relationships within postcolonial works, study the mighty forces acting on words in the postcolonial text, and proof how these texts constitute a radical critique of Eurocentric notions of language and literature. First released in 1989, this book had a second edition published in 2002.
The title references Salman Rushdie's 1982 article "The Empire Writes Back with a Vengeance". In addition to being a pun on the film "", the phrase refers to the ways postcolonial voices respond to the literary canon of the colonial centre. According to "WorldCat", the book is found in over 1200 libraries.

She won the national singles title from 1895 to 1907, winning in total 32 national titles. She defeated Blanche Hillyard the Wimbledon champion, and won two mixed doubles titles with Anthony Wilding; unfortunately there were fewer opportunities at Wimbledon for women players.

IBM 270x

270x is a generic name for a family of IBM non-programmable communications controllers used with System/360 and System/370 computers.
The family consisted of the following devices:
The 2701 and 2702 were announced simultaneously with System/360 in 1964, the 2703 was announced a year later.
The 270x series was superseded by the IBM 3704 and 3705 communications controllers in 1972.
2701.
The 2701 supported up to four start-stop or synchronous communications lines. It had two multiplexor channel interfaces for connection to one or two host computers. The synchronous adapter originally supported the "Synchronous Transmit-Receive (STR)" protocol, and later "Binary Synchronous Communications (BISYNC)" when it was introduced in 1967, in half duplex mode at speeds of up to 40,800 bits per second (bps). The 2701 could also have "data acquisition and control adapters" for direct control of external equipment.
Initially the 2701 supported the following devices:
Later the IBM 2740 and IBM 2741 Communication Terminals, and the IBM 2260/2848 were added.
2702.
The 2702 could accommodate up to 31 communication lines, but at a slower speed than the 2701. The System/360 Configurator indicates that in the 2702 supported start-stop lines only.
Initially the 2702 supported the following terminals:
Later the IBM 2740 and IBM 2741 Communication Terminals, the IBM 1032 Digital Time Unit, and a second channel interface were added.
2703.
The 2703 supported up to 176 half-duplex start-stop or Binary Synchronous communication lines. The maximum speed of one line was 2400 bit/s but the total aggregate line speed was limited. By 1970 the maximum line speed had been raised to 4800 bit/s. The 2703 attached to a single multiplexer channel; each communication line occupied a subchannel. It had a four or eight byte buffer per line to reduce data transfer to and from the host computer. The IBM 2712 Remote Multiplexer allowed up to fourteen slow speed devices to be multiplexed over one high speed line to a 2703.
As of 1967 the 2703 supported the following devices:
Clones.
Many companies produced clones of 270x controllers, such as the Memorex 1270, introduced in 1970, and devices from NCR-Comten.

Avioimpex Flight 110

Avioimpex Flight 110 was a Yakovlev Yak-42 that crashed near Ohrid, Macedonia on 20 November 1993. All 116 passengers and crew died as a result of the crash but one passenger lived for eleven days after the disaster before succumbing to his injuries.
Flight.
Flight 110 was an international scheduled passenger flight originating in Geneva, Switzerland with a final destination of Skopje, Macedonia. Due to a blizzard at Skopje, Flight 110 was diverted to Ohrid Airport. 
Cleared for an approach to Runway 02, the Yak-42 was approximately 2,300 feet too high to carry out a successful landing, so a missed approach procedure was executed. Shortly afterwards the crew of Flight 110 radioed that they were not receiving the VOR signal. Air Traffic control was unable to satisfy the request for a bearing and the pilot of Flight 110 advised that he could not see the runway lights. Shortly thereafter Flight 110 crashed killing 115 of the 116 people on board. One passenger, Rade Jevremovic, survived but was badly injured.
Aftermath.
Due to Flight 110 being the third aviation disaster in a sixteen month period to take place in his country, Minister of Urban Planning, Civil Engineering, Communications and Ecology Antoni Pesev resigned. The pilots association complained of broken equipment and poor safety standards at both Skopje and Ohrid Airports.
On 1 December 1993, Rade Jevremovic died without ever regaining consciousness in the days following the crash of Avioimpex Flight 110.
Flight 110 remains the deadliest aviation crash to ever take place in Macedonia.
Cause.
The cause of the crash was attributed to a violation of the airport traffic pattern by the crew of Flight 110, who initiated a turn into rising terrain. A contributing factor was their decision to proceed with the approach even though they were not receiving a navigational signal due to being out of range of the VOR station.

Beckwithia (arthropod)

Beckwithia is an extinct genus of average to large size ( to ), soft bodied basal chelicerate arthropods that lived during the late Middle and Upper Cambrian on the former paleocontinent Laurentia, in what are now Utah and Wisconsin. It has an inverted egg-shape, with a semi-circular head, 11 abdominal segments and a tail spine. It is a typical member of the group Aglaspidida.
Etymology.
"Beckwithia " was named after Frank Beckwith, editor and publisher of the Millard County Chronicle of Delta, Utah in the early to middle 1900s, who had a passion for trilobites.
Distribution.
"Beckwithia" has been collected from the Middle and Upper Cambrian of Utah (Weeks Formation, House Range, Millard County) and from the Franconian (in North-America called Sunwaptan) of Wisconsin.
Taxonomic history.
"Beckwithia" was previously placed in a separate family, the Beckwithiidae, but it has now been established that the defining character (that the terminal segments appeared to be fused) is actually an artifact.

<doc id="36685668" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36685668" title="True Love (Pink song)">
True Love (Pink song)

"True Love" is a song written and recorded by American recording artist Pink from her sixth studio album, "The Truth About Love" (2012). It was written by Pink, Lily Allen (credited as her former marital name, Lily Rose Cooper) and Greg Kurstin, and features Allen. The song was released as the album's second promotional single, following "Are We All We Are", in early 2013. It was released exclusively to Hungarian and Dutch radio. On April 29, 2013 it was announced that the song would be released as the fourth single. It officially impacted Italian radio stations on June 28, 2013. In the US, it impacted Hot/Modern/AC radio on July 15, 2013 before impacting Top 40/Mainstream radio one week later on July 23, 2013. The song was released in the UK on July 22, 2013.
Background.
In late February 2012, Pink tweeted that she was currently in the studio, working on an upcoming studio album. In early June, she released a video saying that her first single from the album was to be called "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)". It was released in July. Her new album was named "The Truth About Love" and was released in September. Since then, she has released two other singles from the album: "Try", and "Just Give Me a Reason". Pink says that the song is about her relationship with Carey Hart and she finds the song funny lyrically. "True Love" was the third song from "The Truth About Love" to be leaked onto the internet, as "Here Comes the Weekend" was leaked the day before.
Critical reception.
The song received mostly positive reviews from critics and was compared to the album's title track due to both songs revealing the positive and negative sides of love. In its review of "The Truth About Love", "Billboard" called the song the album's "brightest moment" and added that it "deserves to be one of Pink's signature songs". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also gave a positive review of the song, saying, "The upbeat, hell yeah, high-five love song features Pink calling her lover an “a–hole” and saying she wants to slap his whole face. Again, a dysfunctional relationship, which is sung about over a resonant rhythm, makes the misery of love sound like a delight in Pink’s capable hands, er, voice." MSN Music also reacted positively to the song, calling it "feisty". "The New York Times" complimented the song, as well as the album's title track, for recognizing "some nonstorybook sides of romance", and further praised "True Love" for being "bouncy" and upbeat.
"The Chicago Tribune" gave a more critical review of the song, calling Allen's vocals "strangely subdued" and added that Allen was "tamping down Pink's strident, comical posturing". They also wrote that the collaboration "should've been a dream pairing, but falls flat". PopMatters also gave the song a mixed review, complimenting the song, as well as the title track, for "daring to reveal the truth about love", but added that "True Love" especially "cutesily examines why we hate those we love" and contains "brave" and "honest" material that is far too cliché.
Music video.
According Pink's official Facebook page, the music video for "True Love" was planned to premiere on July 1, 2013. The video was leaked online on June 30, on the website Direct Lyrics; however, a few hours later the video was released to her official VEVO account, a day earlier than planned.
The video directed by Sophie Muller (who also directed videos for "Trouble" and "I Don't Believe You") features Pink, her husband Carey Hart and her 2 year old daughter Willow. It is the fourth music video that Hart appears alongside P!nk. The video is a melody of flashing and swirling colors. Pink stated that she has no time for a dramatic music video, (like her previous videos for "Just Give Me a Reason" and "Try", who show Pink's emotional and dramatic side) due to her being on her sold-out worldwide tour, backstage footage of which is featured in the video. Lily Allen was filmed separately; and during her short part in the song she is shown cutting vegetables and throwing them into a blender.

Try (Pink song)

"Try" is a song recorded by American singer songwriter Pink, which she released as the second single from her sixth studio album, "The Truth About Love" (2012). Written and composed by Michael Busbee and Ben West and produced by Greg Kurstin, it is a pop rock ballad about taking risks with love, no matter what consequences may result.
"Try" received mostly positive reviews from music critics who noted that it is one of the standout tracks on the album and called it a hit. Commercially, the song was a success, reaching number one in Spain and the top-10 in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, while reaching the top-20 in most countries. The Floria Sigismondi-directed video features shots of a paint-covered Pink and her male counterpart expressing their frustrations through contemporary dance.
Background and release.
Pink confirmed she was writing lyrics and composing music for her then untitled sixth album, which she titled "The Truth About Love" when she eventually released it, in February of 2012. An early version of the album's lead single, a song called "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)," was leaked online on July 1, 2012, resulting in the single being released a week earlier than planned. Rachel Raczka from "The Boston Globe" noted that "Try," the second single from "The Truth About Love," also leaked in September of 2012. The song was originally sung by GoNorthToGoSouth, a band fronted by Ben West and Michael Busbee. Pink's version of the song premiered on radio on September 6, 2012. "Try" was amongst one of five lyrics videos that Pink uploaded on 12 September, along with album tracks "Slut Like You," "Just Give Me a Reason" featuring Nate Ruess from fun., "How Come You're Not Here," and "Are We All We Are." Critics have pointed out the similarities between the artwork of "Try" and that of Kylie Minogue's 2007 album "X," for the latter of which they have expressed their preference.
Composition.
"Try" was written and composed by Ben West and Busbee, while production was handled by Greg Kurstin, who also produced her previous single, "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)." It is a pop rock ballad, modelled on 1980s FM Rock, built around two-volume arrangement, whereby the verses are quiet and the chorus is loud, according to Idolator's Carl Willot. Lyrically, it is an ode to taking risks with love, no matter the consequences. It also talks about hanging onto one's dreams and aspirations even if it means taking risks. "Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame," sings Pink on the chorus. "Where there is a flame someone's bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die. You gotta get up and try." Written and composed in the key of B minor with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute, "Try" follows a chord progression of G-D-A-Bm (VI-III-VIII-i) and Pink's vocals spans three octaves from D4 to F#5 (harmony).
Critical reception.
The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production. Andrew Hampp of "Billboard" commented "With a melody reminiscent of ‘Whataya Want from Me,’ the 2009 hit she penned for Adam Lambert, the single already pairs well sonically with Pink's catalog. Josh Langhoff of PopMatters called it "an ode to romantic persistence over crisp ‘Hysteria’ guitars." John Murphy of musicOMH wrote that ‘Try’ "demonstrates that she has a voice that not enough people give her credit for. For want of a better phrase, it's a full-on power ballad, with yet more references to love going wrong, and the sort of thing you can imagine someone like Kelly Clarkson pulling off in her sleep." Amy Sciarretto of "Pop Crush" also saw similarities with Clarkson, writing, "It's a belter with a soulful voice, and she sounds like Kelly Clarkson with this song. The midtempo track finds Pink mourning, lamenting and musing on a relationship that is breaking down at its core. It hurts, but this song is a salve over the wound."
Dean Piper of "Mirror Online" wrote: "The stand out track and an obvious international radio hit is ‘Try.’ Think how big and fabulous ‘Who Knew’ was – ‘Try’ is on the same wavelength." Sarah Rodman of "Boston Globe" called it a "keeper and an urging-to-victory battle cry," Robert Copsey of Digital Spy described it as "a ballad of the stadium-filling, lighter-waving variety." while Caryn Ganz of "Spin" called it a "breakup salve." Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song 4 out of possible 5, writing: "Although she may not be treading new ground sonically, her passionate tones and solid determination will continue her chart presence - and rightly so." However, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was less positive, writing that "the midtempo ‘Try’ doesn't push Pink forward either, and it's marred by singsong lyrics." Greg Kot of "Chicago Tribune" also shared the same thought, writing: "No one, not even Pink, can save lyrics such as these."
Commercial performance.
"Try" debuted after the album's release at number 56 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, on the week ending October 6, 2012. The song also debuted on the Adult Pop Songs chart, at number 29. Following Pink's highly-praised 2012 American Music Awards performance, "Try" rose from number 50 to number 18 on the Hot 100. The song peaked at number nine in its 15th week, and has sold over 2 million copies in the US as of July of 2013.
In Canada, the song debuted at number 26, on the Canadian Hot 100 chart issue date October 6, 2012. A week later, the song dropped to number 86, becoming the "Biggest Free Faller" of that week. After staying out for a week, the song re-entered at number 60 on the chart issue dated October 27, 2012. On the chart issue dated November 10, 2012, the song rose to number 25, becoming the "Greatest Gainer" of the week. On the week of November 10, 2012, it rose to number 18 remaining there for two weeks but rising again on the week of December 1, 2012 to number 12 becoming the greatest gainer once again.
In the United Kingdom, "Try" debuted at number 163 on the UK Singles Chart on September 16, 2012, due to digital downloads after album's release. On November 11, 2012, "Try" reached number 40, and went on to peak at number eight on December 9, 2012. The song debuted at number five in Germany. After her performance at Television program, "Wetten, dass..?", in Freiburg, the song reached number two on the charts. In France, "Try" charted lowly, debuting at number 87 on the charts, before falling to number 173. After two weeks, the single re-entered at number 81, before climbing to number 24, its peak position, so far. In Australia, "Try" debuted at number eight, on the ARIA Singles Chart. A few weeks later, it jumped up to number six, where it remained for two consecutive weeks. It became her 20th top-ten single in Australia. In New Zealand, "Try" debuted at number 21 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and so far has peaked at number seven, for two consecutive weeks a higher peak than her previous single, "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)," which peaked at number eight.
Surprisingly, "Try" re-entred on the Italian Chart ("FIMI") at number 88 on Week 25 (from 16-06-2014 to 22-06-2014), and reached number 10 the following week.
Music video.
Background.
The video was filmed on August 27, 2012. Pink stated that the video is one of the most beautiful music videos of her career. It was released on October 10, 2012. It was directed by Floria Sigismondi and choreographed by the Golden Boyz (who have worked with the likes of Madonna and Britney Spears) and stunt choreographer, Sebastien Stella. It was inspired by the Apache dance, a highly-stylized Parisian street performance. "Making this video was the most fun I've ever had in my entire career," said Pink. "I never wanted it to end. It's my favorite video ever."
Pink took to her Twitter page to record her mother, Judith's, reaction after showing her the risqué dance moves on the clip. "My mom, after seeing the new video... 'Wow, honey. I'm speechless. And uncomfortable. No one can ever say you play it safe.'" Pink's love interest is played by Broadway dancer Colt Prattes.
A reenactment of the video was performed during the 2012 American Music Awards where Pink received a standing ovation and was praised by critics for her ever-growing artistry. "Billboard" ranked "Try" the second best performance of the night, with the first being "Gangnam Style".
Synopsis.
The video is summed up in two locations: The indoor sequence where Pink performs a dramatic dance routine with her partner Colt Prattes, and the outdoor scene where they collide into one another in a desert. The video features flashes of color and is heavily metaphorical, portraying an unhealthy, tormented relationship through artistic usage of the two performers' bodies.
Reception.
James Montgomery of MTV News praised the video, writing of it: "Despite the weighty subject matter, the clip also manages to be as restrained as the sinewy bodies it showcases. In a lot of ways, it reminds you of Sigur Ros' arty 'Fjögur píanó' piece — you know, the one with the naked Shia LaBeouf — only minus the erudite sense of self importance. This is, first and foremost, a pop video, only it aspires to be so much more. And in that regard, it is the kind of video that only Pink would make. She is certainly a huge star, and yet, she delights in continually pushing past the restraints of the pop genre. 'Try' certainly works as a video, and yet, one could also see it being performed on the stage, accompanied by an orchestra. It is big, it is beautiful, it is definitely a work of art, and it is uniquely, unquestionably Pink. She pushes herself — and, really, the entire concept of what a pop video can be — to the limit, and pulls it off with effortless grace. Your move, everyone else."
Sam Lansky of Idolator wrote: "Although Pink’s videos are often driven by self-consciousness and irony, she plays it totally straight in this one, giving an emotive performance that communicates volumes, all while executing impressively acrobatic dance moves." Jason Lipshut of Billboard pointed out that watching Pink and Prattes "engage in heart-wringing physical movements" makes it "easy to see why the pop star so thoroughly enjoyed the shoot." Katie Hasty of HitFix felt the video allowed Pink to show off "her showmanship and physical abilities," adding, "It’s very powerful, particularly since both performers hold their own in the give-and-take of command…Plus the styling is rad."
Live performances.
Pink performed Try for the first time live on "The X Factor" Australia on October 2, 2012. A reenactment of the video was performed during the 2012 American Music Awards where Pink received a standing ovation and received overwhelming praise from critics and celebrities for her ever-growing artistry. Entertainment Weekly wrote: "As usual, Pink took the night to new heights," giving the performance an A. Idolator ranked it as the best performance of the night saying: "It was the evening’s only moment that fans will still be discussing years from now." Los Angeles Times stated that Pink stole the show. Examiner described the performance as "powerful" and "flawless."ABC News praised Pink for singing live throughout the strenuous choreography & said the performance was "arresting." Yahoo said that the performance was "extraordinary" and suggested that this performance rivaled Pink's "Glitter in the Air" performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards Philadelphia Weekly wrote: "P!nk wowed the crowd and national audience with the most stunningly artistic and challenging performance of the night." Following her performance, CNN wrote an article praising her "a true pop artist" further stating: "While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year-career by being something that is incredibly rare these days -- an artist. A complete artist." "Billboard" ranked the performance 2nd best of the night behind Psy's Gangnam Style labeling Pink as "the quintessential entertainer."
Following the performance, many celebrities took to their Twitter accounts to appreciate Pink. Nicole Scherzinger said: "Pink rules AMA's (sic).Thinking outside of the box n having the balls and talent to do it! Brilliant n beautiful performance!" Carly Rae Jepsen tweeted: "Pink Your performance was amazing!" Jenny McCarthy said: "As usual... @Pink was best live performance. That's talent." Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum wrote: "I wish everyone could've seen the Pink performance in person...truly inspired and BLOWN AWAY!!!" Billy Mann wrote: "No offense but...tonight's show could've been listed as: "@PINK (w special guest, the #AMAs)." Claude Kelly exclaimed: "listen...THAT. IS. HOW. IT. IS. DONE. @Pink just made your eyes and ears her bitch. (sic)" Editor of "Billboard" Bill Werde wrote: "Creativity, daring, skill & a voice: is there really any argument that theres a more consistently compelling live pop act than Pink?" Harry Styles of One Direction said: "Just got shown Pink 's AMA performance...incredible." Members of The Wanted stated: "Pink was unbelievable, she gave the performance of the night. She's so incredible and such an amazing professional." Brandy described the performance as "unforgettable."
On December 8, 2012 Pink performed the song on "Wetten, dass..?" ("Wanna bet that..?") in Germany and recreated the music video on stage.
On January 26, 2014 Pink performed "Try" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.

Bar puller

A bar puller is a tool for automatically drawing in material (round tubes or solid bars) on a CNC lathe. The machined part is cut off and new material has to be fed into the machine.
Function.
Bar pullers are used in CNC lathes to automatically draw in bars from the clamping chuck. In this case they serve as a substitute for a bar feeder on an NC/CNC lathe.
The clamping chuck is fitted directly into the turret of the lathe or into the bar holder. There are two different versions, depending on the design: Start on the X-axis (starting from the radius) or start on the Z-axis (direction of the spindle).
A bar feeder magazine and workpiece stop are not required when a bar puller is used.
Material.
The housing can be made of aluminium or steel, the top jaws are made of case-hardened steel, tempered steel and burnished.
History.
The history of the bar puller begins with the introduction of the NC/CNC lathes in around 1980. At this time lathes were changed to permit inexpensive and economical production of small or medium-sized batches.
The bar puller serves to draw bars into the lathe without operators having to feed the machine with material each time it is required. With the introduction of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) for the lathes it was possible to ensure the reliability of the individual process operations (moving the turret to the material, opening the clamping chuck, drawing in the material, closing the clamping chuck, moving the turret away with the bar puller).

Richard Weinberger (born June 7, 1990) is a Canadian long-distance swimmer. Weinberger won an Olympic bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in the 10 km open water marathon. He is the current reigning Pan American Games champion and also has a bronze medal from the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships.

Open water swimming at major international competitions started early for Weinberger.

In the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, he won bronze and silver medals in the 10 km swim at various World Cup events. Weinberger qualified for the Olympics after he won silver at the FINA Olympic Marathon Swimming Qualifier in June 2012.
At the 2012 Games, he won a bronze medal in the 10 km marathon, finishing behind Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia and Thomas Lurz of Germany. He become the first Canadian to win a medal in the event. After his win some media outlets such as the CBC were touting him as the future of Canadian Olympian swimmers. Weinberger himself said of his accomplishments that he was happy but "I want to be the Olympic champion in Rio in 2016."
During the 2013 World Aquatics Championships Weinberger was unable to repeat his Olympic success in the 10 km event and committed "a fatal mistake" when he missed a buoy and had to retreat from the front of the pack to swim around it again. He did however come within seven tenths of a second of a medal despite this, but only finished fifth. He himself noted his mistake and frustration, stating "I'm one of the strongest guys out there and I know I could have come first. It's just so disappointing that I made such an amateur mistake and I didn't notice the turning buoy pass on my right." Weinberger was looking for redemption in his next event the 25 km but was unable to regain the success where he finished 22nd, finishing fifteen minutes behind the winner Thomas Lurz.
Personal.
Born in Moose Jaw, Weinberger learned to swim at a family pool in a residential compound in Saudi Arabia, where his father was working at the time.

He swims and trains with Ron Jacks at Pacific Coast Swimming, he got into open water swimming at the University of Victoria after seeing friend Dave Creel doing longer workouts. He admits that swimming in the open water sometimes scares him, as he often encounters wildlife in the water or even the vast depths of the ocean can lead to it getting into his head. He commented on it saying that "If I see anything I'll freak out, but if I don't see anything I'll freak out. It's a lose, lose situation for me." He is a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.

New Lanzhou West Railway Station.
Situated a kilometre to the west of the old station, a new high speed railway station is under construction. This station will become the centre for most high speed services in Lanzhou, equaling Lanzhou Railway Station in importance for long distance and regional rail services. Built on the site of a former rail freight yard, it will dwarf the old Lanzhou West Railway Station in almost every respect in terms of size and services, including long distance and local bus stations. It is anticipated to open by the end of 2014.

Oxovitisin A

Oxovitisin A is an oxovitisin, a type of pyranoanthocyanin with a pyranone (2-pyrone) component. It is found in aged Port wines. It does not contain an oxonium ion component (flavylium cation), as anthocyanins do. Therefore it does not have an absorption maximum at 520 nm. Oxovitisins are stable yellowish pigments with similar unique spectral features, displaying only a pronounced broad band around 370 nm in the UV−vis spectrum. It is an oxidative derivative of carboxypyranomalvidin-3-glucoside (vitisin A).

3205th Drone Group

The 3205th Drone Group is a discontinued United States Air Force unit. It was last active with the Air Proving Ground Center, based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where it was discontinued on 1 February 1961.
A notable moment in the Group's history is that a Douglas DB-17P (Formerly B-17G-90-DL) 44-83684 of the unit's 3225th Drone Squadron flew the last operational mission by a USAF Flying Fortress on 6 August 1959.
History.
The 3205th Drone Group operated obsolete aircraft during the 1950s as radio-controlled aerial targets for various tests. It was the primary post-World War II operator of surplus Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress aircraft. It also operated converted Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and a few Boeing RB-47 Stratojet bombers that were converted into drone aircraft during the early years of the Cold War.
Origins.
At the end of World War II, the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator were obsolete as strategic bombers, having been replaced by the B-29 Superfortress. B-24 production ended after the surrender of Germany in May 1945, B-17 production ended a month earlier, in April. Many of these new aircraft were simply not needed due to the fortunes of war, and most of them were sent directly from the factory to storage depots.
Initially, these unneeded aircraft were scheduled for scrapping and metal reclamation. These included thousands of war-weary combat aircraft returned from the overseas theaters. A few B-17s were sold to the civil marketplace, however most wound up in the smelters for aluminum recycling. The Army Air Forces, however, decided to retain several hundred new B-17s.
The postwar Air Force B-17s found uses as personnel and VIP transports (CB/VB-17), loaned to defense contractors for various research purposes (EB-17 and JB-17), for mapping (FB-17), for air-sea rescue (SB-17), for weather reconnaissance (WB-17), and for trainers (TB-17). All postwar B-17 conversions and ongoing depot-level maintenance was managed by the Middletown Air Depot at Olmsted Air Force Base, Pennsylvania.
Air Proving Ground Command obtained B-17s for guided missile launching and as aerial targets for new weapons systems. They were designated as follows:
When they were worn out or the need was diminished, other postwar military B-17s would more often than not be sent to Middletown and converted to the QB-17 drone configuration. They would then be transferred to Proving Ground Command to be expended as aerial targets.
Predecessor units.
In 1946, the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field #3, Florida. The unit's formation was a result of the Air Materiel Command's Engineering Division at Wright-Patterson AFB looking for places to allow its contractors to launch missiles. It was with this group that the DB-17/QB-17 Fortress Drone Director/Drone pairing was developed. In May 1946, sixteen B-17s were withdrawn from storage for conversion into drones with the addition of radio, radar, television, and other equipment. Six other Fortresses were converted as drone controllers.
On 13 January 1947 the group flew a QB-17 drone, guided by a director DB-17, from its base at Eglin to Washington D.C. on a simulated bombing mission as a demonstration of capability. It also made preparations for operating QB-17s for the Operation Sandstone atomic bomb tests during April and May 1948. The group also picked up responsibility for drone QB-17 bombing tests (e.g., Operation Banshee)
The 550th Guided Missiles Wing was activated in 1949 as an expansion of the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The 1st Guided Missiles Squadron operated MB-17s, and the 2d Guided Missiles Squadron operated QB-17/DB-17s. Although based at Eglin Air Force Base, the wing established Detachment 1 at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico and Detachment 2 at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California.
In 1949, the 2nd GMS tallied 3,052 flight hours without mishap and secured the green and white pennant denoting safety supremacy for USAF B-17 type aircraft for the fourth straight time, gaining permanent possession of the three-starred flag. The 550th GMW played a prominent part in the spring of 1949 in the aerial filming of "Twelve O' Clock High", filmed in part at Eglin AFB. By March 1950, the 2d Guided Missile Squadron, had 62 pilots manning 14 B-17s, three B-29s, and three QF-80A Shooting Stars, yellow-tailed drone aircraft used in the role of testing guided missiles.
The 550th wing moved to Patrick Air Force Base, Florida on 11 December 1950 as a result of a reorganization of Proving Ground Command into Air Research and Development Command and to facilitate the development of long-range atmospheric guided missiles using the Florida Missile Test Range.
3205th Drone Group.
The 3201st Air Base Support Squadron was activated at Eglin on 26 April 1950 from personnel and equipment assigned to the 2nd Guided Missiles Squadron. It assumed the QB-17/DB-17 drone aerial target mission. Redesignated the 3200th Drone Group on 1 June 1951, it took over the detachments at Holloman and Point Mugu. It participated in Atomic tests, Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Island Group, Pacific 1950–1951
In July 1951, with the expansion to group level, several squadrons were activated to support operations. the 3205th and 3215th Drone Squadrons were activated at Eglin; the 3225th absorbed Detachment 1 at Holloman, which operated QB-17s and QF-80s over the Army White Sands Missile Range; the 3235th absorbed Detachment 2 at NAS Point Magu, which operated QB-17s over the Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility.
Often, the QB-17 would be the subject of intentional near misses to preserve the drone for as many missions as possible. Other QB-17s were used for various unmanned but destructive tests such as the ditching tests carried out by NACA in San Francisco Bay.
In April 1956, with the development of the IM-99 Bomarc surface-to-air missile, the 3215th Drone Squadron was moved from Eglin to Patrick to support the Bomarc testing program. From Patrick, DB/QB-17s could take off and the missile could be test-fired from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 3 over the Atlantic Missile Range. One such trial on 23 October 1957 (Bomarc 624-11) saw the unarmed missile destroy a Flying Fortress target by a direct collision, more than 100 miles from the missile's launch point.
However, the supply of QB-17s was dwindling in the late 1950s, and in any case the 1930s-designed B-17 could not realistically represent modern Soviet aircraft. This led to the refitting of two RB-47E Stratojets (53-4245, 53–4246) that were being phased out of the inventory to a QB-47E drone configuration. The QB-47s also carried electronic countermeasures gear and chaff dispensers in order to make for a more realistic target for the Bomarc during the tests. The Bomarcs were programmed to intentionally near-miss because the Stratojets were deemed too expensive to be intentionally destroyed in testing. However, one Stratojet drone did end up being shot down when an intended near-miss by a Bomarc turned into a hit.
F-80 drone operations.
In parallel with the B-17 drone program, in 1946/47, three P-80A Shooting Star fighters were converted to radio-controlled drones in a test program to develop faster, more maneuverable aerial gunnery targets for the new generation of jet fighters entering the Air Force inventory. All armament was removed, and radio control equipment was installed. The pilot's controls were retained, which made it possible for the drone to be operated either manned or unmanned. Postwar funding and personnel shortages, however, led to the cancellation of this project.
The project was revived in 1951 when eight first-generation F-80As were converted to the QF-80 drone configuration at the Sacramento Air Depot, McClellan Air Force Base, California, under a project known as "Bad Boy." These aircraft were assigned to the 3205th Drone Squadron for testing over the Eglin range. A second batch of 14 QF-80s were converted in December 1953 at McClellan that featured larger center-mounted wingtip tanks equipped with cameras rather than fuel so that attacking aircraft could be photographed. These cameras could be jettisoned by remote control and lowered by parachute. In November 1953, 55 more F-80Cs were converted to the QF-80F drone configuration, with improved radio-control equipment and a runway arrestor hook. Ten dual-seat T-33A Shooting Star jet trainers were also converted to DT-33 drone director aircraft to guide the drones.
The drones were usually painted all red, but with natural metal finish on the top surfaces of both wings. Many QF-80s were operated as pilotless drones both at the Eglin as well as the Holloman test ranges. In addition, Several QF-80s were used for sampling of radioactive material from mushroom clouds of nuclear tests at the Atomic Energy Commission Nevada Test Site. The last of the QF-80 drones were still operating as aerial targets in 1962.
Inactivation.
By 1958, the group's DB-17P Flying Fortresses were wearing out, and the number of available QB-17 drones was down to a handful. The wartime bombers were not designed or built for long-term use when new, and the supply of replacement parts was extremely limited, causing the aircraft to be very expensive to maintain. The aircraft had soldiered long past their estimated lifetimes and were gradually taken out of service and retired to the 2704th Air Force Aircraft Storage and Disposition Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. From the 2704th group the aircraft were sold to private owners or donated to aircraft museums (see below).
The last active USAF B-17 Flying Fortress, was a Douglas B-17G-90-DL, 44-83684. It was manufactured in Long Beach, California, being accepted by the USAAF on 7 May 1945. It was never assigned to an operational unit, instead being placed in long-term storage at South Plains Army Airfield, Lubbock, Texas in October. With the closure of South Plains AAF, the plane was flown to Pyote Army Airfield, Texas in July 1947 where it was stored by the 2753d Aircraft Storage Squadron. It was pulled from storage in March 1950 and flown to the Middletown Air Depot, Olmsted AFB, Pennsylvania, where it was inspected and modified to a DB-17G. On 18 July 1950 it arrived at Eglin AFB, Florida and was assigned to the 3201st Air Base Support Squadron.
The aircraft was deployed to the Pacific Proving Grounds where it was a support aircraft during the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests beginning in April 1951. Upon its return to Eglin in June, it was sent to Detachment 1, 3200th Drone Group (later 3225th Drone Squadron) at Holloman. It was modified into a DB-17P at Olmsted Air Force Base in 1956.
Aircraft 44-83684 remained and flew the last operational mission by a USAF B-17 on 6 August 1959 when it directed QB-17L 44-83717 from Holloman as a target for an AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile fired by an F-101 Voodoo. After the mission, a ceremony was held to commemorate the occasion. A few days later, it was flown to storage at Davis-Monthan.
With the retirement of the Flying Fortress, the group's activities were taken over by Headquarters, Air Proving Ground Center at Eglin in 1961. The program at Eglin went on to use QF-104A Starfighter drone aircraft until 1972, and subsequently was transferred to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida as part of Aerospace Defense Command, for Aerospace Defense Command interceptor aircraft weapons targets using the Eglin range. Over the years, QF-102s (1973-1986), QF-100s (1981-1992) and QF-106s (1990-1998) have been converted into target drones.
Since August 1981 the target drone mission has been assigned to the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron, now part of the Air Combat Command, 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Tyndall. The 82d operates retired QF-4 Phantom II aircraft (1997-) as target drones. The QF-4 saw a total of 238 aircraft being converted, the last of which will be phased-out in 2014. In 2010 Boeing was awarded the contract to start initial work on converting the first six F-16A/Bs into aerial targets. These six aircraft are being used now as a testing platform. It is a mix of block 15/25/30 aircraft to show the feasibility of the modifications on these blocks.

John II, Count of Ziegenhain

John II, Count of Ziegenhain (died 14 February 1450) was the second son of Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain and his wife Agnes of Brunswick. He was the last reigning Count of Ziegenhain and Nidda. He probably owed His nickname "the Strong" to his obesity, although he is said to have possessed an extraordinary muscle strength as a young man. His younger brother Otto was Archbishop of Trier from 1419 until his death in 1430.
Life.
John initially pursued an ecclesiastical career. Between 1393 and 1406, he was canon in Trier and from 1403, he was a canon of Mainz. In 1394, he studied in Vienna and in 1396 in Heidelberg. After the early death of his elder brother Engelbert III in 1401, he succeeded as Count of Ziegenhain and Nidda.
On 5 January 1417, he married Countess Elisabeth of Waldeck. This marriage remained childless.
Reign.
In the war between Hesse and the Electorate of Mainz (1401–1405), John II supported Mainz. In 1401, he was taken prisoner by Landgrave Herman II of Hesse. He was released in January 1402, after he had promised to not act against Hesse in this conflict, and his brother Gottfried IX had promised the same.
In 1414 John II and Gottfried IX were outlawed for their involvement in a violent feud against Siegfried of Frekenhausen. In 1415, they took Lißberg Castle by force, claiming that if was a fief of Ziegenhain and that it had reverted to them when Frederick of Lißberg had died in 1396 and that Frederick's cousin John of Rodenstein had unlawfully taken possession of the castle. In 1418, they sold a 50% share of the castle to Landgrave Louis I of Hesse.
In 1420 John II gave his allodial property in the Counties of Ziegenhain and Nidda to Emperor Sigismund. In return, Sigismund enfeoffed im with the County and City of Nidda and its castle, plus the County of Ziegenhain with all the cities, villages and castles it contained and two tolls at Treysa and Gemünden. This exchange made him an imperial count, since he now held his county directly from the Emperor. Thus, he had a much stronger than before, when his feudal overlord had been the abbot of Fulda. However, his weakening of his relationship with Fulda also increased the appetite of Hesse and Mainz, who were interested in his possessions, considering that he had no male heir.
Landgrave Louis I of Hesse decisively won the Mainz-Hesse War of 1427 with a victory against Mainz' commander Gottfried of Leiningen in the Battle on the Großenenglise Plateau near Fritzlar on July 23 and against Archbishop Conrad III himself at Fulda on August 10, Louis established his territorial supremacy in Upper and Lower Hesse. This meant that Ziegenhain could no longer lean on Mainz to retain its independence from Hesse. Instead, John II concluded a defensive alliance with Hesse on 29 June 1428, that made Ziegenhain virtually a Hessian dependency. This brought Hesse much closer to its goal of annexing Ziegenhain and thereby connecting Upper and Lower Hesse geographically.
In 1434, the Abbot of Fulda John of Merlau enfeoffed Louis I of Hesse with Fulda's share of the County of Nidda. On 2 February 1437, John II enfeoffed Louis I with his two counties. His feudal overlords, the abbots of Fulda and Hersfeld approved this contract and sold their shares of the two counties to Hesse (Ziegenhain and Nidda were partly allodial possessions of the House of Ziegenhain, partly imperial fiefs, partly fiefs held from Fulda and partly fief held from Hersfeld. However, the contract specified that Hessian rule in John's counties would only begin after his death.
John II died on 14 February 1450. He was probably buried in the church of Haina Abbey.
Succession dispute.
Despite treaties between John II and Landgrave Louis I of Hesse that had been confirmed several times between 1437 and 1450, a long and bitter dispute about his inheritance broke out after his death. The tho claimants were:
Albert's sons Albert II and Kraft V were enfoeffed on 14 May 1450 by Emperor Frederick III with the part of Ziegenhain that was an imperial fief. They were thereby raised to imperial counts. Louis I ignored this enfeoffment and occupied the territory. The dispute lasted until 1495. After several armed conflicts and court cases, Hesse won, but only after Landgrave William II had paid the Counts of Hohenlohe 9000 guilders in compensation. The Ziegenhain territory has remained part of Hesse ever since, and members of the House of Hesse still use "Count of Ziegenhain" as one of their titles. However, the House of Hohenlohe retained the status of imperial counts, which they had obtained when they were enfeoffed with Ziegenhain, and they included the six-pointed start of Ziegenhain in their coat of arms.

Michael Blakey (anthropologist)

Michael Blakey (born February 8, 1953) is an American anthropologist who specializes in physical anthropology and its connection to the history of African Americans. Since 2001, he has been a National Endowment for the Humanities professor at the College of William & Mary, where he directs the Institute for Historical Biology. Previously, he was a professor at Howard University and the curator of Howard University's Montague Cobb Biological Anthropology Laboratory.
Early life and education.
Blakey obtained his B.A. in Anthropology from Howard University in 1978, and an M.A. (1980) and a Ph.D. (1985) from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He served as president of the Association of Black Anthropologists from 1987 to 1989.
Career.
African burial ground in Manhattan.
Blakey was the director of the New York African Burial Ground Project, now the African Burial Ground National Monument. According to Blakey, the existence of this burial ground in what is now Lower Manhattan (where between 10 and 20 thousand people of African descent were buried in the eighteenth century) was evidence of "false historical representation" and exposed as a myth the idea that New York and the northern states were not slave-owning areas. Blakey says that, in general, educated Americans had the impression that slavery played little role in the development of the northern American colonies in general, and New York City in particular. Blakey's research helps dispel those myths, and offers a "compelling portrait of the exploitation and violence suffered by enslaved Africans, and equally to the active resistance of people of African descent to this exploitation and violence". Blakey concluded that these slaves faced "brutal working conditions, premature rates of mortality, and excessive workloads, while nutritional deficiencies were common among young children."
Blakey's research team examined 27 skeletons that had filed or "culturally modified" teeth, which was considered a strong indication of African birth. Previously, only nine such skeletons had been discovered in the Americas. It is likely that these individuals had come to New York previous to 1808, when the importation of slaves from Africa was banned. Blakey's team examined more than 1.5 million artifacts discovered at the site, which included everything "from pottery and glassware to tools and children's toys". His research determined that approximately half of the African people buried at the site were children. After his research was completed, the skeletal remains were reinterred at the site "in 400 hand-carved mahogany coffins" in a 2003 ceremony described as "joyous and bitter all at once".
Analysis of racism.
Blakey says that physical anthropology has a "pattern of denial" about racism, which has its origins in the dominant view that social differences are due to the inherent characteristics of individuals, and less on political and economic factors. Blakey maintains that the history of physical anthropology has been "sterilized", downplaying the role that eugenics and scientific racism had in its origins.
Discussing a museum exhibit about race at the Science Museum of Virginia, Blakey criticized the contemporary reluctance to discuss racism, maintaining that "it has become illegitimate to talk about racism" and that failing to do so is "the new racism".

<doc id="36686176" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36686176" title="Siege of Corfu (1798–99)">
Siege of Corfu (1798–99)

The Siege of Corfu (October 1798 – March 1799) was a military operation by a joint Russian and Turkish fleet against French troops occupying the island of Corfu.
Background.
By the Treaty of Campo Formio (November 1797) and the dissolution of the Republic of Venice, the Ionian Islands were ceded to the French Republic, who occupied Corfu as the "département" "Corcyre".
In 1798 Admiral Fyodor Ushakov was sent to the Mediterranean in command of a joint Russian-Turkish squadron to support General Alexander Suvorov's forthoming Italian and Swiss expedition (1799–1800). One of the main tasks assigned to the squadron was the liberation from the French of the strategically important Ionian Islands. In October 1798 the French garrisons were driven from Cythera, Zakynthos, Cephalonia, and Lefkada. It remained to release the largest and best-fortified island of the archipelago, Corfu.
The garrison of the island.
The city of Corfu is located on the east coast in the central part of the island between two forts:
From the new to the old fort a high wall ran along the shore. The town was also covered by bastions on two mountains, Abraham and Salvatore, and the intermediate fort of San Rocco. From the sea, the city was protected by the well-fortified island of Vido, and the smaller island of Lazaretto, two miles up the coast, was also strengthened by the French.
The French, commanded by the governor General Louis Chabot, had 3000 soldiers and 650 guns in Corfu, plus 500 soldiers and 5 artillery batteries on the island of Vido. In the harbour was a French squadron of two ships of the line, the 74-gun "Généreux" and 54-gun "Leander", the 20-gun corvette "Brune", a bomb-vessel, a brig and four auxiliary vessels.
The siege of Corfu.
On 4 November 1798 Ushakov's Russian-Turkish squadron, consisting of three ships of the line, three frigates and a number of small ships, began the siege of Corfu. They were joined shortly afterwards by a Turkish squadron and another Russian squadron under the command of Captain Dmitry Senyavin. Given the strong fortifications of the island and the lack of strength for a landing, it was initially decided to wait for Turkish reinforcements for a landing force. However, on the first day the French abandoned their fortifications on Lazaretto island, which the Russians immediately occupied.
On 13 November a small force of Russians landed without opposition and took the small port of Gouvia about five miles along the coast. From then on the Russians began building batteries and shelling the French-held forts. In December, another Russian squadron, this one under Rear-Admiral Pavel Pustoshkinthe, augmented the besieging forces. The combined fleet now consisted of 12 ships of the line, 11 frigates and many smaller vessels.
On the night of January 26th the "Généreux", with her sails painted black, and the brig escaped from the harbour and sailed to Ancona.
In February, about 4,000 Turkish and Albanian troops arrived and it was decided to make a landing on the island of Vido – the key to the defense of Corfu – using naval artillery against its shore batteries.
Capture of Vido.
The assault on Vido began early in the morning of 28 February 1799. After a four-hour bombardment by several ships, all five shore batteries on the island had been suppressed. The "Leander" and "Brune" tried to intervene but were damaged and forced to retreat to the protection of the batteries of Corfu. The allied fleet then landed over 2000 men on Vido and after a two-hour battle the island was taken. Of the 800 men defending the island, 200 were killed and 400 were taken prisoner, including the commandant of the island, Brigadier-General Pivron. About 150 men managed to swim to Corfu. Russian losses were 31 killed and 100 wounded. The Turks and Albanians lost 180 killed and wounded.
Capture of Corfu city.
After the fall of Vido, the key to Corfu was in the hands of Ushakov. On March 1 the captured batteries on the island opened fire on the city's forts, supported by the Russians' shore batteries and some of the Russian and Turkish warships. The allied forces stormed and captured the outlying forts of San Rocco, San Salvatore and San Abraham.
On 2 March Ushakov planned to assault the main forts, but in the morning the French sent envoys to request a forty-eight hour armistice, and on 3 March they surrendered.
Aftermath.
The capitulation agreed between the French and Russians was an honourable one, including a provision for the French troops to be conveyed to Toulon. The remaining French ships in the harbour were taken by the allies, including the "Leander" which had been captured from the Royal Navy on 18 August 1798; the Russians returned her to the British.
Admiral Ushakov was honoured by the Emperor of Russia with the star of the Order of St Alexander Nevsky and by the Ottoman Sultan with a chelengk, rarely awarded to non-Muslims.
The capture of Corfu completed the Russo-Turkish takeover of the Ionian Islands, which was of great military and political importance. The islands became the Seven Islands Republic, a temporary protectorate of Russia and Turkey, and for several years Corfu served as a base for the Russian Mediterranean fleet. Ushakov's fleet went on to support the allied attack on Naples.

3205th Drone Squadron

The 3205th Drone Squadron is a discontinued United States Air Force unit. It was last active with the Air Proving Ground Center based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where it was discontinued on 25 October 1963. The squadron operated various drones between 1950 and 1963 to provide targets to support development of weapons and for interceptor training.
History.
The 3205th Drone Squadron was organized in April 1950, when it assumed the mission of operating QB-17L Flying Fortresses as drone aerial targets from the 550th Guided Missiles Wing. The squadron operated QB-17 drones and DB-17 controller aircraft, providing aerial targets for surface-to-air and air-to-air missile development programs at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The unit also used QF-80 Shooting Star jets for aerial gunnery targets for Air Defense Command interceptor squadrons.
The squadron deployed elements to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Nevada Test Site and Pacific Proving Grounds during the 1950s, flying drone Flying Fortresses equipped with air sampling equipment and other instrumentation though atomic and nuclear testing mushroom clouds for post-detonation analysis. This support for nuclear testing ended in 1957, and the mission was taken over by the 4901st Support Wing (Atomic) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.
In the late 1950s as the supply of drone B-17s began to become exhausted, the squadron began to use QB-47E Stratojets as gunnery targets for missile tests. It operated the QB-47 until the early 1960s. Approximately 10 B-47 aircraft were converted to drones. Test missiles were programmed for a near-miss rather than a hit on the drone in order to conserve the target drones for multiple flights.
Beginning in 1960, the squadron's QF-80 Shooting Star target drones were replaced by QF-104A Starfighters, modified F-104As that were deemed surplus to United States Air Force requirements. The QF-104s could be flown either by onboard pilots or by remote control from the ground or other aircraft.
The squadron was discontinued in late 1963 and its mission was taken over by USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center when the aerial target mission at Eglin was transferred from Air Force Systems Command to Tactical Air Command. QF-104 aerial targets were primarily used for air-to-air gunnery targets by Air Defense Command Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. The drone mission continued at Eglin until June 1971, when it was transferred to Aerospace Defense Command's air to air weapons school at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.

Wendy Isdell

Wendy Diane Isdell (born March 30, 1975) is an American author and artist. She is best known for her young adult works, which incorporate science and math into fiction. Her most popular novel, "A Gebra Named Al," has been in print since 1993. It has been translated into several languages, made required reading in some school systems, and published internationally.
Wendy Isdell dedicated much of her early life to writing. Her first notable publishing credit came at age nine, through articles in the Haydon Elementary School newsletter (the first ever by a student). Seven years later, she signed a contract for her first novel, "A Gebra Named Al," with Free Spirit Publishing in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The sequel was published two years later.
Wendy Isdell was also a pioneer of the internet, having developed websites as early as November 1994. (However, the Internet Archive project has records for her original website dating back only to 1999, the older records presumably having been lost.) She was a contributor for early versions of DreamingGates.com, experimenting with javascript and css to create a rudimentary shopping cart as early as 1999.
Wendy Isdell graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1997 from Hofstra University with a B.A. in Creative Arts, then Summa Cum Laude from Mary Washington University in 2004 with an M.A. in General Studies. She went on to obtain a Doctorate of Divinity and Ph.D. in Religion.
Wendy Isdell currently lives in a rural community in central Virginia. On her website she jests that she "talks to her plants" and has had "moderate success at being a starving artist." For health reasons, she rarely ventures out.

Certation

In botany, certation is competition in the style between pollen tubes attempting to fertilise the ovules there. If different pollen genotypes have different success rates then the genotype frequencies of the fertilised seeds will deviate from that which would occur if all pollen was equally successful. This process has been proposed to explain female-biased sex ratios in some dioecious plants, if female-determining pollen (which causes seeds to be female) is more successful than male-determining pollen (which causes seeds to be male), though other mechanisms whereby the sex ratio may be skewed away from 50:50 are also known.

Gorg, Badalona

Gorg is a neighbourhood of Badalona (Catalonia, Spain) which belongs to the town's District 5 and consequently part of the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Gorg owes its origins to the Industrial Revolution and the substantial growth of the Barcelona area. It still contains a great number of factories, but the area has been recently subject to profound changes. Developers related to Marina Badalona have been involved with the ongoing transformation of the area. The area is home to the 1992 Summer Olympics venue Palau Municipal d'Esports de Badalona. Construction of an urban canal connecting the marina with the sports arena through Gorg has long been put on hold.
Transport.
Public transport improved substantially during the 2000s (decade) with the Trambesòs and the Barcelona Metro upgrades that took place during the decade. Tram and metro station Gorg opened in 1985 as part of L4, but the original service was transferred to L2, and it is currently served by L10 as well.

Crystal Hill is an unincorporated community in Hill Township, Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States. It is located along Crystal Hill Road near the junction of Interstate 40 (I-40) and I-430.
History.
When the Arkansas territorial legislature decided to move the capital from Arkansas Post in 1820, governor James Miller purchased land on Crystal Hill in an effort to profit by later selling it to the government as the new state capital. However, the final vote was between Little Rock and Cadron, a vote that selected Little Rock as territorial capital. Miller built a house and lived at Crystal Hill in protest until being appointed Collector of Customs in Salem, Massachusetts by James Monroe. Crystal Hill was never platted or incorporated.

EX-TRTC United Workers Front v Premier, Eastern Cape Province

EX-TRTC United Workers Front v Premier, Eastern Cape Province is an important case in South African law, heard and decided in the Eastern Cape High Court, Bhisho, on 25 February – 4 June 2009, respectively. T Delport (attorney) appeared for the plaintiffs, and SM Mbenenge SC (with CTS Cossie) for the defendants.
The case has important implications for civil procedure in South Africa, with its determination that, although a voluntary association may, under the Uniform Rules of Court, sue or be sued in own name, this does not confer "locus standi" on the association where "locus standi" is otherwise lacking.
The court also held that whether or not an association amounts to a "universitas" is to be determined with reference to its nature and object and activities. A written constitution is in this regard desirable but not essential. Where the association is formed for a limited purpose, and would cease to exist once that purpose has been achieved, it lacks the object to have perpetual succession and to hold property separate from its members; it also lacks the essential element of a "universitas".
Facts.
In an action in the High Court for damages for breach of contract, after a separation of issues, the court was asked to determine the question of the "locus standi" of the first plaintiff, described in the particulars as a voluntary association whose objective was "to represent its members in regard to their rights and interests emanating from their employment by and the closure of the Transkei Road Transport Corporation and to jointly institute legal proceedings to achieve" that objective. The plaintiff had no written constitution.
The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked "locus standi", because
Conversely, the plaintiffs argued that the first plaintiff "was" able to sue in its own name by virtue of the provisions of rule 14(2) of the Uniform Rules of Court. (Rule 14(1) defines a "firm" as "a business, including a business carried on by [...] the sole proprietor thereof under a name other than his own name," while Rule 14(2) allows such a firm to sue or be sued in its own name.)
Judgment.
The court held that rule 14(2) was nothing more than a procedural aid, in that it assisted a plaintiff to cite certain legal entities that did not have any existence separate from their members or owners. It did not turn a partnership, a firm or an unincorporated association into a different entity that existed separate from its members; nor did it vest it with "locus standi" where such was otherwise absent.
There was no merit, the court found, in the submission that the first plaintiff could not be a "universitas" because it did not possess a written constitution. Although advisable, it was not essential for a "universitas" to have a constitution. Accordingly, the mere fact that the first plaintiff had no written constitution was not determinative of the question of whether or not it had "locus standi".
Whether or not the first plaintiff was a "universitas", therefore, had to be decided with regard to its nature, its object and it activities. From a reading of the particulars of claim, it was clear to the court that the rights and interests referred to were those arising from a contract entered into between the defendant and a labour union (the Transport and General Workers Union) representing persons who were employed by the said corporation prior to its dissolution. The conclusion was inescapable: The first plaintiff was formed for a very limited purpose; once that purpose was achieved, there would be no further need for it, and it would cease to exist. The very object of the association negated an intention that it would have perpetual succession and hold property separate from its members. It was clearly unnecessary for the achievement of its purpose to possess those characteristics. The first plaintiff consequently lacked the requisites for a "universitas".
The court held that an association could sue on behalf of its members under rule 14(2) only if there existed a sufficient nexus between the individual members, in their capacities as members of the association, and the right that formed the subject-matter of the litigation. Applied to the present matter, the first plaintiff did not institute the present proceedings to protect or enforce an interest which it had as a body or organisation; it did not propose to enforce those rights of its members which they possessed by reason of their membership of the association. The right to claim damages from the defendant for the alleged breach of contract was a personal right; it vested in each member of the association individually.
The plaintiffs, in deciding jointly to pursue their claims against the defendant, were consequently not an "association" of persons within the meaning of that word. Their intention was rather, having regard to the purpose of the first plaintiff and the nature of the relief claimed, to use the first plaintiff as a convenient vehicle to bring a representative action. Such an action did not exist in South African civil procedure.
The court concluded that it had not been shown on the pleadings that the first plaintiff had "locus standi". The defendant's objection in that regard had to be upheld. The defendant's objection to the "locus standi" of the first plaintiff was consequently upheld and the first plaintiff's claims dismissed.

Fly from Here (song series)

"Fly from Here" is a set of songs by progressive rock band Yes from their 2011 album "Fly from Here". With a complete length of 23 minutes and 49 seconds, it is the longest studio recording ever released by Yes. It is split into six parts, consisting of the first tracks of the album: "Overture", "We Can Fly", "Sad Night at the Airfield", "Madman at the Screens", "Bumpy Ride" and "We Can Fly (Reprise)". Being the first composition of the album, it is the first Yes work to feature singer Benoît David.
The basis of the hexalogy was a demo originally recorded by Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn of The Buggles before they joined Yes in 1980. After Yes disbanded in 1981, Horn and Downes recorded a second demo, and both recordings became the foundation of the tracks "We Can Fly" and "Sad Night at the Airfield". Chris Squire called it "the band's 11th epic-length piece, the first in 15 years".
A single uniting "We Can Fly" and "We Can Fly (Reprise)" was released under the name "We Can Fly".

The Institute of Jamaica (IOJ), founded in 1879, is a patron and promoter of the arts in Jamaica, sponsoring exhibitions and awards. It is also the country's museums authority, as well as administering other national arts and cultural outlets including the National Gallery, the African Caribbean Institute of Jamaica, and the "Jamaica Journal".
History.
The Institute of Jamaica was established in 1879 by Sir Anthony Musgrave, then Governor of Jamaica, "For the Encouragement of Literature, Science and Art in Jamaica", and as such was designed to help Government in the promotion and preservation of culture in the island. It is Jamaica's "most significant cultural, artistic and scientific organization". In the words of the late Edna Manley: "When I pay tribute to the Institute, I like to think back over the years to the twenties - when there was almost nothing that stood for the encouragement of any of the Arts or Sciences. Only the Institute stood like a beacon in its attempt to create an atmosphere where creativity could hope to flourish. The Institute stood for integrity. It also had the strength and intelligence to survive. Let the Institute survive, beaming aloft its flame of integrity."
The IOJ is located at 10-16 East Street, Kingston, Jamaica, and has responsibility for the following organizations:
The IOJ publishes "Jamaica Journal", originally the "Journal of the Institute of Jamaica", established in 1896.
The Musgrave Medal has been awarded by the Institute of Jamaica since 1897 for excellence in the fields of arts, sciences and literature.

Freddy Rodríguez (artist)

Freddy Rodríguez (born 1945) is an artist from the Dominican Republic who has lived and worked in the United States since 1963. Much of his work takes the form of large, colorful geometric abstractions. His paintings have been widely exhibited and are held in several important collections.
Life.
Freddy Rodríguez was born in Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic in 1945.
His family were artists.
Rodríguez immigrated to the United States in 1963 at the age of eighteen.
In New York he spent much time at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was particularly interested in the work of Piet Mondrian.
He studied painting at the Art Students League of New York and The New School, and obtained a degree in textile design from the Fashion Institute of Technology.
In the 1980s he joined with several other Dominican visual artists including Bismark Victoria, Eligio Reynoso, Magno Laracuente and Tito Canepa to form the "Dominican Visual Artists of New York".
This group succeeded in obtaining sponsorship for exhibitions of Dominican Art in popular locations.
In 1991 the New York Foundation for the Arts named him "Gregory Millard Fellow in Painting".
In 1992 he was a NYSCA Artist in Residence at El Museo del Barrio.
Work.
Rodríguez was influenced by Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne and Piet Mondrian.
His style incorporates elements of Abstract Expressionism, Pop and Minimalism.
In 2011 the Smithsonian American Art Museum acquired three of his early works, painted in the early 1970s. Tall and narrow, the abstract paintings named "Danza Africana", "Amor Africano" and "Danza de Carnaval" represent the energy of Dominican music through vibrant colors and zigzagging lines.
A reviewer has discussed the political messages in his work, mourning the impact of colonialism and subsequent dictatorships on the original Caribbean paradise, saying, "The political messages are subsumed by the artist's desire to create beautiful paintings fusing Renaissance and modern traditions. Integrating illusionistic space with flattened surfaces, and contrasting loose and tight brushstrokes, the artist enters a dialogue with centuries of art concerned with these same pictorial issues."
Exhibitions.
In 1994, Rodríguez's work was shown as part of the American contingent at the IV Bienal Internacional de Pintura en Cuenca, Ecuador. Other American artists exhibiting at this show were Donald Locke, Philemona Williamson, Whitfield Lovell and Emilio Cruz. 
His works were exhibited in the Jersey City Museum between 13 December 1995 and 17 February 1996 in a show called "Priest: The Spirit and the Flesh."

Lovisa Card-Catlin

Lovisa O. Card-Catlin (August 5, 1846-December 7, 1925) was an artist and educator credited with developing Erie, Pennsylvania’s art community.
Early Life and Career.
Lovisa Card was born in Gainesville, New York to William Merritt and Eliza Wheel Card. Though not much is known about her early life, it is generally accepted she left home at the age of sixteen. By 1868, she had taken up residence with an aunt and uncle, Jehiel and Hannah Towner, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Lovisa opened a small art studio in the family home before opening the Erie Art School in the 1870s. Located on the second floor of the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building, the school was the first of its kind in the city and came to include nearly one hundred students. In her classes Lovisa stressed realism, teaching students to use their tools in order to enhance their own innate abilities. Her students included Ruth E. Newton, Ruth Halleck, Gretchen Newberger, Charles A. Hulbert, Elizabeth Spalding, and Inez Wagner. During this time, she also studied at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming a life member.
After the death of her mother and aunt, it is likely Lovisa took a break from teaching and the Erie Dime Saving and Loan Building was closed. By 1893, Lovisa married the widower Henry Catlin, a noted abolitionist and man of culture who was previously married to her cousin, Ellen Towner. The couple relocated and Lovisa returned to teaching, opening the Catlin School of Art in her home studio.
Art Club.
In 1898, nineteen members of the community, many of them Lovisa’s former students, came together in the Catlin home to establish Erie’s first Art Club; an institution that would form the foundations for the Erie Art Museum. The club’s self-declared mission was: “The advancement of art by the elevation of its standards, by encouraging every form of art enterprise, by creating a more intelligent appreciation of art products, and by the cultivation of a spirit of fraternity among art students.” Lovisa was elected the club’s first president, a position which she held until 1922. The Art Club met in the classrooms of Erie Academy until the Public Library building opened in 1899. The club’s first exhibition featured 321 works from local artists. They also sponsored outside exhibitions of noteworthy American artists. Paintings hung for one month and exhibitions were free to the public. With each show, the Art Club would purchase one or more works for its permanent collection. One of the first purchases included work from H. Bolton Jones and F. S. Church.
Later life.
On June 19, 1903, Henry Catlin died at home after he was stricken with a bout of rheumatism. With his passing, Lovisa focused her attention on bringing art programming to Erie, raising membership, and building the club’s permanent collection. After her brother also died, Lovisa spent two years traveling in Europe where she studied with Henri Martin and attended classes at The Academie Colarossi and The Académie de la Grande Chaumière. Coincidentally, Lovisa was among the visitors at The Louvre on the day Leonardo da Vinci’s "Mona Lisa" was stolen.
Upon her return to Erie, Lovisa was awarded honorary membership to the Woman’s Club of Erie. She was also posthumously named one of the twelve greatest women in Erie history by the Business and Professional Women’s Club in 1931. Well into her seventies, Lovisa continued to build exhibitions with the Art Club. In 1923, she helped institute the Art Club’s first regular exhibition of local artists This exhibition continues today as the Annual Spring Show at the Erie Art Museum.
Scholarship Fund.
Lovisa died at her home on December 7, 1925. She and Henry had no children. As part of her will, the Card-Catlin Art Scholarship was created for the continuing education of fine art, industrial arts, and architecture students. Noteworthy winners include Erie artists Joseph Plavcan and Richard Anuszkiewicz. Today the scholarship continues to support students of the arts through the Erie Community Foundation.

Mat Taram bin Sa'al

Mat Taram bin Sa'al (alias Utoh) was an Indonesian mass murderer who killed eleven people and wounded ten others on a Kuala Lumpur-bound train and a kongsi near Bangi, Malaysia on October 9, 1947. He was acquitted by reason of insanity.
Utoh was a Banjarese padi planter hailing from Tunggal Island near Sumatra. He owned a farm in Parit Six, Bagan Terap, near Teluk Anson, but when he wanted to return to his birthplace, he sold his house and land for 200 Straits dollar, and together with his wife and three children took the train to Singapore, to inquire the price for the journey. Upon finding that he could not afford the fee for the ferry, he became depressed, and, according to his wife, stayed awake for two days, but eventually he decided to return to Parit Six. On October 9 he and his family went to Labis by bus, where they boarded the mail train from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.
For most of the journey 30-year-old Utoh remained quiet, but at about 6:10 p.m., when the train had just passed Bangi and was on its way to Kajang, he entered the restaurant car, drew a pocket knife with a four-inch blade and attacked four British Other Ranks of the Malaya Command Signals Regiment, who were having dinner at one of the tables. He killed sergeant Herbert Victor Marston by stabbing him in the heart, fatally stabbed J. Cormack in the abdomen, grievously injured Robert Ralston with a stab in the chest, and also stabbed a Malay named Mohamed Eusoff, as well as an Indian named Malimalai, who succumbed to his chest wound on October 12.
When the train was brought to an emergency halt, Utoh jumped off and disappeared into the jungle. Under a bridge near the railway tracks he stabbed a Chinese vagrant to death, and three miles further on entered a kongsi hut near Sungai Tangkas where he killed Cheow Hin, as well as two elderly women, and three children, and wounded nine other people, among them four children, before fleeing. Police arrived at the hut about one hour later, whereupon the wounded were brought to hospital. One of them, a woman, succumbed to her wounds soon thereafter.
While hundreds of police officers were searching for him in the jungle around Bangi, Utoh went on a 90 mile march to his home in Parit Six, where he arrived 36 hours later. Upon being asked why he had returned, since it was thought that he was on his way to Sumatra, he told that he had no money for the trip and was on his way back home, but he had lost his wife and children when he was pushed out of the train after a fight that was incited by a Chinese boy who had spilt tea on him. Utoh was then brought to Sabak Bernam Police Station where he related his story, telling that he couldn't remember anything that happened after he was pushed off the train. One of the policemen, who had read the story about the mass murder in a newspaper, suspected that he could be the sought culprit, and so Utoh was arrested.
Utoh was detained in Teluk Anson, where he was identified by his wife, and charged with the murder of Herbert Marston on October 13. The case was then transferred to the court in Kajang, where hearings began on October 14. On October 29 Utoh was sent to the mental hospital in Tanjong Rambutan to be observed there for a month. On May 4, 1948 he was found to have been of unsound mind while committing the murders and was sentenced to be confined at the mental hospital in Tanjong Rambutan at the pleasure of the Ruler-in-Council.
Victims.
Those wounded were: Robert Ralston, Mohamed Eusoff, Liew Ngan, 8, Liew Fah, 14, Liew See Tai, 13, Chong Kew, 13, Ng Lan, 50, Chong Shuen, Wong Yee and Chin Sam.

Facts.
By reason of a "bona fide" mistake made by its legal representatives, the plaintiff was cited in its particulars of claim as "Golden Harvest (Pty) Ltd." It subsequently appeared, however, that the plaintiff was in fact a company, Norris Fresh Produce (Pty) Ltd, which traded as "Golden Harvest." The plaintiff thereupon applied for an amendment in which it sought to substitute for its name as cited the following citation: "Golden Harvest, a business of which the sole proprietor is Norris Fresh Produce (Pty) Ltd."
This amendment was resisted on the basis that
Judgment.
The court held that no attempt was being made to substitute one legal entity for another. There was no question of separate legal entities, but clearly an incorrect description of the original plaintiff, which mistake could be cured by the proposed amendment to the description of the plaintiff. The incorrect description had not rendered the summons invalid, and the proposed amendment would not involve the substitution of one persona for another. The amendment accordingly had to be granted.

It is the first single by Yes since "If Only You Knew" (from "The Ladder"), released in 1999. It is also the only Yes single with Benoît David on vocals, and the second after "Into the Lens" in 1980 without Jon Anderson on vocals and with Geoff Downes on keyboards.
Music video.
The official music video was released on 3 July 2011. The video portrays the story of an airline passenger awaiting his flight, who reads a magazine article about a 1940s Hollywood mogul who died in a plane crash as a result of a "pilot error." The man finishes reading, runs down a flight of stairs, and boards his plane only to find the same '40s-era cast of characters aboard, with a stewardess leading him to the cockpit to pilot the plane. Trevor Horn makes a cameo appearance as the movie mogul.
Reaction from Jon Anderson.
In an interview with "Rolling Stone", Anderson stated that on hearing "We Can Fly" he felt it sounded "a bit dated" and that Trevor Horn's production "wasn't as good as I expected". He did, however, praise David's vocal performance.

List of countries ranked by ethnic and cultural diversity level

This page contains lists of countries ranked by ethnic and cultural diversity level. 
Methodology.
The lists are commonly used in Economics literature to compare the levels of ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious fractionalization in different countries. Fractionalization measures are computing the probability that two randomly drawn individuals (from a country) are not from the same group (ethnic, religious, or whatever the criterion is). The two lists have been described by Alesina and Ferrara as follows:
List based on Fearon's analysis.
In the Fearon list, cultural fractionalization is approximated by a measure of similarity between languages, varying from 1 = the population speaks two or more unrelated languages to 0 = the entire population speaks the same language. This index of cultural diversity is biased towards linguistic variations as opposed to genetic diversity and other variations. 
List based on Alesina et al's analysis.
This list is based on the analysis of Alesina and others, they develop fractionalization scores based on ethnicity, religious and linguistic data directly from the Encyclopædia Britannica lists. This list is biased by how the Britannica chooses to list ethnic groups, but it does not make a judgement call on which identities are more salient than others. According to Patsiurko et al.

John II, Count of Saarbrücken

"Not to be confounded with his uncle John II of Saarbrücken-Commercy (fr)" 
John II of Saarbrücken, Jean II de Sarrebruck, Johann II von Saarbrücken (circa 1310 – 11 March 1381). He was the Count of Saarbrücken (de) and Seigneur (lord) of Commercy (fr), as Jean IV of Saarbrücken-Commercy, part "Château bas".
Life.
John was the son of Simon of Saarbrücken-Commercy (d. 1325), son of John I (fr) (b. 1265 - 1341/42), Count of Saarbrücken. His mother was Marguerite of Savoy-Vaud (d. 1313), a daughter of Louis I of Vaud, married with Simon in 1309. 
1326, before the death of John II's grandfather, Count John I, the inheritance was divided. John was awarded the County of Saarbrücken and a small part of Commercy, called "Saarbrücken" or "Château bas". The larger part of Commercy, called "Château haut", went to his "uncle" John II (Jean II) (fr), as "Seigneur of Commercy", of the house of Saarbrücken-Commercy. One of his sons was Jean III.
Like his father Simon, John II supported France in the war against England. During the Battle of Poitiers 1356, both John II and King John II of France were taken prisoner by the English. He was held in Wallingford Castle until 1360.
In 1362, he fought against gangs of mercenaries near Lyon and was briefly taken prisoner again. John II undertook several diplomatic missions in the service of the French King. In 1362, he travelled to the court of Emperor Charles IV and in the following years, he travelled to the English court several times. In 1364, he was appointed Grand Butler of France as a reward for his services. In 1370 John was appointed chairman of the Court of Finances. In 1371, he received the Lordship of Vaucouleurs.
In 1380, John II retired from the French court. He died in 1381. As he had no sons, his daughter Johanna inherited the County of Saarbrücken. However, she died later that year, and the county fell to her son Philipp I of Nassau-Weilburg. Various lines of the House of Nassau would hold the county until it was conquered by France in 1795.
Marriage and issue.
Latest in 1334, John II married Ghislette (d. 1356/62), a daughter of Peter of Bar (d.c. 1348), Lord of Pierrefort, son of Theobald II, Count of Bar. Ghiselette's mother was Jeanne of Vienne (d.b. 1326), daughter of Hugues of Vienne (d. 1307?), Sire of Longwy and Pagny (or Philipp I, Count of Vianden?). John and Ghislette had one daughter:
Johann († 6. Oktober 1365)
Philipp (* 1368; † 1429), folgte dem Vater in Nassau-Weilburg
Johanna (* 1362; † 1383), ∞ Hermann II., Landgraf von Hessen
Johannette († 1365)
Agnes († 1401), ∞ Simon III. Wecker, Graf von Zweibrücken-Bitsch († 1401)
Schonette († 1436), ∞ (1384) Heinrich X. von Homburg († 1409) ∞ (1414) Otto von Braunschweig-Grubenhagen († 1452)

Great Depression in Washington State Project

The Great Depression in Washington State Project is a multimedia web resource based at the University of Washington in Seattle. Created in the context of renewed economic hard times in 2009, the Project includes essays, maps, digitized newspaper articles and hundreds of rare photographs from the 1930s. In addition to rapid industrialization and demographic change, the Depression ended decades of Republican rule, created a powerful labor movement, changed the face of the Democratic Party and molded new set of political priorities. In several thematic sections, the Project examines these changes in everyday life, culture, politics and work. The Project is one of the Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects, characterized by student-led research and public scholarship. 
Content.
The site is divided into sections on Economics and Poverty, Strikes and Unions, Radicalism, Civil Rights, the University of Washington, Politics, Culture and Arts, Everyday Life and New Deal Public Works. Each includes historical photographs, research reports, maps and other unique materials. In addition, the Project contains a special section on Theater Arts and the Federal Theater Project in Washington. Other aspects of the site include a full timeline of major events in the state during the Depression, Seattle Hoovervilles, interactive maps of New Deal public works projects, famed photographer Dorothea Lange's work in the Yakima Valley and a day-by-day database of digitized newspaper articles on labor issues covering 1930 to 1938. The unveiling of the site was accompanied by the production of the Depression-era plays "Waiting for Lefty" and "End of Summer" at the Jones Playhouse in Seattle in February 2010.

Mar de Grau

Mar de Grau () is the official name for the body of water in the Pacific Ocean under the control of the South American country of Peru. This body of water extends in length approximately 3079,50 km, from the parallel of the Boca de Capones in northern Peru to the parallel of the "Punto Concordia" and the parallel in front of the city of Tacna in southern Peru. In terms of width, the maritime zone extends from the Peruvian coast to 200 nautical miles (370,4 km) into the Pacific Ocean.
This maritime domain was officially named in May 24, 1984, in honor of Miguel Grau Seminario, a Peruvian military officer widely regarded in Peru and Bolivia as a hero from the War of the Pacific fought against Chile. During the war, Grau led the defense of the Peruvian and Bolivian coasts by holding off the Chilean navy for six consecutive months, ultimately dying at sea amidst the decisive Battle of Angamos.

Holy Touch

"Holy Touch" is the second single from American rock band Foxy Shazam's fourth studio album, "The Church of Rock and Roll". It was released on May 17, 2012.
The single features a radio DJ who tries to cut in at the end but continues to get interrupted by the song's final accented notes, much to his annoyance, saying, "alright, this is WQ...this is...alright, this is WQRX, that was a new hit by...REALLY?"
The DJ is not heard on the music video, which shows the band escaping a helicopter that goes down in flames after the pilots leave them behind. It pictures the band playing the song both in front of neon lights, and while skydiving out of the burning helicopter. The video ends instead with the band seemly crashing to the Earth in their presumed death, as they fall without a parachute.

Korean Empire passport

Korean Empire passports were issued to subjects of the Korean Empire for international travel. The first English-language passports of the Korean Empire were issued in 1902 by the People's Comfort Agency (수민원; 綏民院) to Koreans migrating to Hawaii. By 1904, passport issuance was conducted by the Imperial Korean Foreign Office (대한제국 외부). The passport was written in English, French, and Classical Chinese, and contained the bearer's name, address, age, and destination.
Soon after the 1910 advent of Japanese rule in Korea, Koreans began having to use Japanese passports. These were not always easy to obtain, and some Koreans resorted to naturalising as citizens of China and acquiring Republic of China passports instead. However, for those aiming to travel to the United States this method created its own difficulties, as the bearers of such passports then became subject to the provisions of the United States' Chinese Exclusion Act.
Surviving examples of Korean Empire passports are rare. One specimen is the passport of An Cheol-yeong, preserved by his son An Hyeong-ju of Hawaii; in 2012, the younger An donated that passport and his collection of nearly 2,500 other documents of Korean American history to the National Library of Korea in Seoul. Another specimen is the passport issued in 1903 to Min Yeong-hwan (민영환; 閔泳煥), which is held by the Soongsil University Museum.

Schizachyrium condensatum

Schizachyrium condensatum is a species of grass known by the English common names Colombian bluestem, bush beardgrass, and little bluestem, and the Spanish common names aguará ruguay and yerba barbuda. It is native to South America, and it is well known in other places as an introduced species and noxious weed, particularly in Hawaii.
This is a perennial grass growing up to 1.5 meters tall. It branches near the top of the stem, producing a wide, loose inflorescence up to 40 centimeters long.
This grass is very common in the dry woodlands of Hawaii. It competes with native vegetation, displacing it and forming thick monotypic stands. These stands become very flammable and increase the frequency of fire. After fire occurs, it is easier for a similarly invasive grass, "Melinis minutiflora", to move in, which increases the total nonnative grass cover. "S. condensatum" then dies back.

James White (Texas politician)

James E. White (born July 16, 1964) is an African-American Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 19, which encompasses Polk, Hardin, Jasper, Newton, and Tyler counties. He was first elected in District 12 in 2010, which then included Angelina, San Jacinto, Trinity, and Tyler counties. He resides in Hillister in Tyler County.
Background.
Born and reared in Houston, Texas, White attended public school and graduated in 1982 from Lamar High School. In 986, White procured a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science and Military Science from the historically black Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University in Prairie View, Texas. From 1986 until 1992, he served in the United States Army as a commissioned officer in the infantry. Thereafter, he taught in the public school system in the Houston area and was a guest columnist for "Headway Magazine". 
Later, White became a teacher at Woodville High School in Woodville, the county seat of Tyler County. He also owns a cattle ranch. He is a member of the Hillister Baptist Church.
In 2000, he obtained a Master of Education degree from Prairie View. In 2010 and 2012, respectively, he received a Master of Science and a Ph.D. from the University of Houston.
White is a member of the American Foreign Legion, the Masonic lodge, the National Rifle Association, the historically black fraternity Omega Psi Phi, the Farm Bureau, and 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. He is a board member of the Texas Federation of Republican Outreach.
White is a widower.
Political life.
White was born in a critical month of black history, two weeks after U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and on the day after the Republican Party nominated Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona to oppose Johnson in the 1964 presidential election. As a U.S. senator, Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act but later said that he had erred in doing so. Black voters swung solidly behind Johnson and have since remained attached to the Democratic Party in overwhelming numbers. White's Republican affiliation hence contrasts with the large majority of his race, both nationally and in Texas. 
Running in House District 12 in 2010, White unseated the Democratic incumbent, Jim McReynolds, 20,958 (57.6 percent) to 15,405 (42.4 percent).Switched to District 19 in 2012, White unseated in the Republican primary the 10-year incumbent Mike "Tuffy" Hamilton of Lumberton in Hardin County. White polled 10,190 votes (54.5 percent) to Hamilton's 8,503 (45.5 percent).White then ran without Democrat opposition in the general election held on November 6, 2012.
In the 2013 legislative session, White voted to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure was approved 96-49. He co-sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. Texas Right to Life rated him 78 percent favorable in 2013 and 74 percent in 2011. 
White opposed the taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73-58. He supported legislation to provide marshals for school security. He voted against the bill to require immunization of minors without parental consent, a measure which the House nevertheless approved, 71-61. He co-sponsored the law to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. White opposed the measure to prohibit texting while driving. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those receiving unemployment compensation. He voted against an "equal pay for women" measure, which passed the House, 78-61. He voted to forbid the state from enforcing federal regulations of firearms and in support of another law allowing college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He voted for the redistricting bills for the state House, the Texas Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. He voted against term limits for certain officials. 
In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated White 93 percent favorable. Young Conservatives of Texas ranked him 80 percent. The interest group, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, assigned White a score of 91 percent in 2013 and 100 percent in 2011. The Texas Association of Business gave him an 87 percent score in 2013. He ranked 53 percent from the Texas League of Conservation Voters and 92 percent from the National Rifle Association.

<doc id="36686915" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36686915" title="Political ethics">
Political ethics

Political ethics (also known as political morality or public ethics) is the practice of making moral judgements about political action and political agents. It covers two areas. The first is the ethics of process (or the ethics of office), which deals with public officials and the methods they use. The second area, the ethics of policy (or ethics and public policy) concerns judgments about policies and laws.
Ethics of process.
Niccolò Machiavelli is often considered the founding father of the first area of political ethics. He believed that a political leader may be required to commit acts that would be wrong if done by private. In contemporary democracies, this idea has been reframed as the problem of dirty hands, described most influentially by Michael Walzer, who argues that the problem creates a paradox: the politician must sometimes do “wrong to do right”. The politician uses violence to prevent greater violence, but his act is still wrong even if justified. Walzer’s view has been criticized. Some critics object that either the politician is justified or not. If justified, there is nothing wrong, though he may feel guilty. Others say that some of the acts of violence that Walzer would allow are never justified, no matter what the ends. Dennis Thompson has argued that in a democracy citizens should hold the leader responsible, and therefore if the act is justified their hands are dirty too. He also shows that in large political organizations it is often not possible to tell who is actually responsible for the outcomes—a problem known as the problem of many hands.
Political ethics not only permits leaders to do things that would be wrong in private life, but also requires them to meet higher standards than would be necessary in private life. They may, for example, have less of a right of privacy than do ordinary citizens, and no right to use their office for personal profit. The major issues here concern conflict of interest.
Ethics of policy.
In the other area of political ethics, the key issues are not the conflict between means and ends but the conflicts among the ends themselves. For example, in the question of global justice, the conflict is between the claims of the nation state and citizens on one side and the claims of all citizens of the world. Traditionally, priority has been given to the claims of nations, but in recent years thinkers known as cosmopolitans have pressed the claims of all citizens of the world.
Political ethics deals not mainly with ideal justice, however, but with realizing moral values in democratic societies where citizens (and philosophers) disagree about what ideal justice is. In a pluralist society, how if at all can governments justify a policy of progressive taxation, affirmative action, the right to abortion, universal healthcare, and the like? Political ethics is also concerned with moral problems raised by the need for political compromise, whistleblowing, civil disobedience, and criminal punishment.
Criticisms.
Some critics (so called political realists) argue that ethics has no place in politics. If politicians are to be effective in the real world, they cannot be bound by moral rules. They have to pursue the national interest. However, Walzer points out that if the realists are asked to justify their claims, they will almost always appeal to moral principles of their own (for example, to show that ethics is harmful or counterproductive).
Another kind of criticism comes from those who argue that we should not pay so much attention to politicians and policies but should instead look more closely at the larger structures of society where the most serious ethical problems lie. Advocates of political ethics respond that while structural injustice should not be ignored, too much emphasis on structures neglects the human agents who are responsible for changing them.

Barry Blitt

Barry Blitt (born April 30, 1958 in Côte Saint-Luc, Quebec) is a Canadian-born American artist.
Barry Blitt is a cartoonist and illustrator, best known for his "New Yorker" covers and as a regular contributor to the op-ed page of the "New York Times". Blitt creates his works in traditional pen and ink, as well as watercolors.
Early Life and Education.
Blitt grew up in Côte Saint-Luc, Quebec, a municipality on the Island of Montreal. The artist's first publication credit came at age 16: a series of drawings in the Philadelphia Flyers 1974 yearbook. He graduated from The Ontario College of Art and Design and moved to the US in 1989.
Work.
Blitt’s illustration work has been featured by publications such as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic and others.
The artist is also well known for illustrating Frank Rich’s Sunday op-ed column in the New York Times. Regarding that work, Rich is quoted as saying, "It’s a long-distance collaboration — me in New York City, Barry in Connecticut — but one of the most satisfying I’ve had in my career."
Many of Blitt's New Yorker covers have been finalists for the Cover of the Year from the American Society of Magazine Editors, including, in 2008, "Narrow Stance" and "I'll Get It!","First Anniversary" in 2010, and "The Book of Life" in 2012.
Blitt is also credited with animation design by Saturday Night Live 
Controversy.
Blitt's 2008 New Yorker cover titled "The Politics of Fear", depicting Michelle and Barack Obama standing in the Oval Office was labeled "tasteless and offensive" by Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. A campaign spokesman for Senator John McCain also condemned the art. In the cover art, Obama is shown wearing traditional Muslim clothes, including sandals, robe and turban.  His wife, Michelle is shown dressed in camouflage, combat boots and has an assault rifle over her shoulder. Behind them, an American flag is burning in the fireplace.
The controversial art was covered by numerous media outlets including the Los Angeles Times, PBS and others. In defense of the art, Eric Bates of Rolling Stone was quoted as saying "...I don't think it (The New Yorker) crossed the line. I would question whether there's much of a line to be crossed. I think their intent was clear, but I think it's clear from the response that a lot of people didn't get the joke.". The New York Times called it the most memorable image of the 2008 presidential campaign, and Françoise Mouly, the Art Editor of the New Yorker, said she was "extremely proud" of the piece. Regarding the controversy, Blitt was quoted as saying "Anytime I produce a cover, I always regret it afterward"." 
The cover art was parodied later the same year by Entertainment Weekly, with a photograph by Jake Chessum featuring Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.
In spite of the controversy and condemnation by the Obama campaign, after taking office President Barack Obama chose one of Blitt’s New Yorker covers to hang in the White House. The Dec. 8, 2008 cover depicts the President picking the family dog at the same time as he is vetting candidates for his national security cabinet. Additionally, President Obama requested and received a signed New Yorker cover by the artist, which depicts the President walking on water.
Personal life.
Blitt currently resides in Connecticut His younger brother, Ricky Blitt, is a screenwriter, based in West Hollywood, California.

From 1508 he studied under John Lascaris, at this time becoming a friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam. He was secretary of the bishop of Albi, Lois de Amboise, and later of the French statesman Jean de Ganay.
After the death of Jean de Ganay in 1512, de Brie sought the patronage of the French queen Anne of Brittany, which he achieved by writing what became his most famous work, "Chordigerae navis conflagratio" ("The Burning of the Ship Cordelière") (1512), a Latin poem about the recent destruction of the Breton flagship "Cordelière" in the Battle of Saint-Mathieu between the French and English fleets. It was translated into French for Anne by Pierre Choque.
Controversy with Thomas More.
The poem led to a literary controversy with the English scholar and statesman Sir Thomas More, in part because it contained criticisms of English leaders, but also because of its hyperbolic account of the bravery of the Breton captain Hervé de Portzmoguer. In his epigrams addressed to de Brie, More ridiculed the poem's description of "Hervé fighting indiscriminately with four weapons and a shield; perhaps the fact slipped your mind, but your reader ought to have been informed in advance that Hervé had five hands. 
Stung by More's attacks, de Brie wrote an aggressive reply, the Latin verse satire "Antimorus" (1519), including an appendix which contained a "page-by-page listing of the mistakes in More's poems". Sir Thomas immediately wrote another hard-hitting pamphlet, "Letter against Brixius", but Erasmus intervened to calm the situation, and persuaded More to stop the sale of the publication and let the matter drop.
Later work.
Appointed Archdeacon of Albi, de Brie also held other lucrative ecclesiastical posts along with the role of secretary to queen Anne and almoner to the king. In 1522 de Brie returned to the study of Greek. He began translating the writings of the Greek theologian John Chrysostom, whose work he wished to make more readily available. Erasmus assisted him in this. Later, de Brie intervened in quarrels between Erasmus and other scholars, notably Guillaume Budé, occasioned by the publication of Erasmus's "Ciceronianus". In 1536 he wrote an appreciative obituary for Erasmus.

Schinopsis brasiliensis

Schinopsis brasiliensis is a species of flowering plant in the cashew family known by the common names baraúna or braúna, quebracho, and chamacoco.
This species is endemic to Brazil, where it is a component of the Caatinga.
The tree can grow up to 12 meters tall with a trunk diameter of 60 centimeters.
This tree has a hard, sturdy wood which is used in construction. Because of its overexploitation for this purpose, the tree is considered an endangered species.
Two species of mite have been noted to live on this tree, "Calacarus torulus" and "Shevtchenkella schinopsidis".

John Komnenos Vatatzes

John Komnenos Vatatzes, (), or simply John Komnenos or John Vatatzes (the transliteration 'Batatzes' is also employed) in the sources, was a major military and political figure in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire during the reigns of Manuel I Komnenos and Alexios II Komnenos. He was born c.1132, and died of natural causes during a rebellion he raised against Andronikos I Komnenos in 1182.
Background and family.
John Komnenos Vatatzes was the son of the "sebastohypertatos" Theodore Vatatzes, and the "porphyrogenita" princess Eudokia Komnene, daughter of the emperor John II Komnenos and his empress Eirene of Hungary. Theodore Vatatzes was one of the 'new men' raised to prominence by John II; the Vatatzes family were not previously counted amongst the highest levels of the Byzantine aristocracy, though they had long been prominent in the region around the city of Adrianople in Thrace. John's parents married in 1131, and he was born soon thereafter, probably ca. 1132. John had a brother, Andronikos, who was also a prominent general - he led an army against the city of Amaseia in 1176 and was killed by the Seljuq Turks; they displayed his severed head during the Battle of Myriokephalon shortly afterwards. He had another brother, named Alexios. John's wife was named Maria Doukaina and they had two sons, Alexios and Manuel. The latter was named for John's uncle, the Emperor Manuel, to whom John was very devoted—to the extent of tolerating a love affair between the emperor and his own sister Theodora.
Military career in the reign of Manuel I.
John Komnenos Vatatzes enters contemporary sources as a senior general in the 1170s; it is certain that he served in lesser military capacities before being appointed to high command, but no record of his activities has survived. He undoubtedly had a military apprenticeship under his father Theodore, also a prominent general, who undertook the siege of Zemun on the Hungarian frontier in 1151, and captured the city of Tarsus in Cilicia in 1158.
In 1176 Emperor Manuel Komnenos attempted to destroy the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, but was defeated at Myriokephalon. Following a truce which allowed the Byzantine army to retreat from Turkish territory, Manuel failed to implement all the conditions, particularly the destruction of border fortresses, demanded by the Seljuq sultan Kilij Arslan II as a prerequisite for a cessation of hostilities. The fortress of Soublaion was razed, but the more important fortification of Dorylaion was not. The sultan reacted by dispatching a substantial Seljuq cavalry army, numbering about 24,000 men, to ravage Byzantine territory in the Meander Valley in western Anatolia. John Komnenos Vatatzes was entrusted with command of a Byzantine army and set out from Constantinople with instructions to intercept the Seljuq raiders. Vatatzes was given Constantine Doukas and Michael Aspietes as lieutenants, and was able to reinforce his army through local recruitment as it moved through Byzantine territory.
Vatatzes intercepted the Seljuq army as it was returning to Turkish territory loaded with plunder from sacked Byzantine cities. He deployed his army to create a classic ambush, which was sprung when the Turks were in the process of crossing the Meander River, near the settlements of Hyelion and Leimocheir. The Seljuq army was almost helpless to defend itself and was destroyed; the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates stated that only a few out of many thousands escaped. The Seljuq commander, who held the title 'Atabeg', was killed as he attempted to fight his way out of the trap. The battle was a significant victory for the Byzantines and it underlined how limited the immediate effects of the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon were on the empire's hold over its Anatolian possessions. The Byzantine victory was followed up by punitive expeditions against the Turcoman nomads settled around the upper Meander Valley.
Alexios II and rebellion.
When Vatatzes is again mentioned in the sources, in 1182, he is holding very high office: he was both "megas domestikos", the commander in chief of the Byzantine army, and governor of the important Theme (province) of Thrace. The city of Adrianople was both the seat of the government of Thrace and the centre of the landholdings of the Vatatzes family, and John is recorded as building and endowing fine almshouses and hospitals there. 
Following the death of Emperor Manuel I in 1180 the succession fell to his son Alexios II Komnenos. As Alexios was a child, power devolved on his mother, the empress Maria of Antioch. Her rule proved unpopular, especially with the aristocracy who resented her Latin (Western) origins. When Manuel’s cousin Andronikos Komnenos (Andronikos I) made a bid for power in early 1182 he wrote to John Vatatzes in an attempt to suborn him. Vatatzes recognised Andronikos as a potential tyrant and wrote back in insulting terms. Vatazes' cousin Andronikos Kontostephanos the commander of the navy, however, was deceived and played a key role in allowing Andronikos' forces to enter Constantinople. Once in power, Andronikos Komnenos proved that he had indeed a tyrannical nature and a vehement desire to break the power and influence of the Byzantine aristocratic families. 
After Andronikos had achieved power, later in 1182, Vatatzes is recorded as residing near Philadelphia in western Anatolia; presumably he had been dismissed from his offices. As a member of the imperial family and a respected and successful general he had no difficulties in raising a substantial army when he openly rebelled against the new regime. Vatatzes upbraided Andronikos as a "demonic adversary" who was "intent on exterminating the imperial family." The second accusation, at least, was an accurate assessment.
Andronikos I sent the general Andronikos Lampardas (or Lapardas) against Vatatzes with a large force. Vatatzes, who had become seriously ill, met Lampardas' army near Philadelphia. He first instructed his sons Manuel and Alexios in how to array the army, then had himself carried to a hill where he could observe the battle from a litter. Vatatzes' forces were victorious and Lampardas' broken troops were pursued for some distance. However, a few days later, on 16 May 1182, Vatatzes died. Without his leadership the rebellion quickly broke apart, and Vatatzes' sons fled to the protection of the Seljuq sultan. When attempting to get to Sicily by sea they were wrecked on the coast of Crete and taken prisoner. They were then blinded on the orders of Andronikos I. Andronikos considered the death of Vatatzes as divine providence, and it emboldened him to declare himself co-emperor alongside Alexios.
Legacy.
John Komnenos Vatatzes is one of the few figures whose character is described with unalloyed admiration in the works of the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates.

Sevcik v. Sandoval

Sevcik v. Sandoval is a federal case challenging the State of Nevada's denial of same-sex marriage as prohibited by Nevada's constitution and statutory law. The complaint was initially filed in the Federal District of Nevada on April 10, 2012, on behalf of several couples denied marriage licenses, challenging this denial on the basis of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. 
On November 26, 2012, Chief Judge Robert C. Jones ruled against the plaintiff same-sex couples, granting in part a motion to dismiss the complaint against the Nevada government officials named in it. The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 3, 2012.
On July 3, the Ninth Circuit scheduled oral arguments in "Sevcik" for September 8, 2014. If the district court ruling upholding Nevada's same-sex marriage ban is overturned, the circuit court could simply vacate the ruling below, or could rule more broadly, allowing same-sex marriage statewide, or possibly circuit-wide.
Constitutional amendment.
The Constitution of Nevada was amended in 2002 to incorporate Article 1, Section 21, which reads: "Only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state," restricting marriage to different-sex couples. Voters first approved a ballot question endorsing this amendment to that effect on November 7, 2000, with 70% of the vote. Its principal sponsor was the Coalition to Protect Marriage, a local organization. Because Nevada requires a constitutional amendment be approved by the voters twice, Nevada voters considered the same ballot question on November 5, 2002, and approved it by a margin of 67%–33%.
Lawsuit.
On April 10, 2012, Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights advocacy organization, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada on behalf of eight same-sex couples. Four of the couples had been denied marriage licenses by county clerks in Nevada. The other four had married in other jurisdictions (California and Canada) and wanted Nevada to recognize their relationships as marriages. The suit named as defendants Gov. Brian Sandoval and three county clerks. Lambda Attorney Tara Borelli explained the plaintiffs' argument: "are relying on the Nevada domestic partnership law to help illustrate how irrational the unequal treatment of same-sex couples is, because there are a number of rationales they have articulated for this kind of discrimination that really are not credible in Nevada. For example, it is often argued in these cases that there is an interest relating to children and parenting. But in Nevada, separate and apart from the constitutional amendment, the state treats same-sex couple equally as parents in other respects. And so that can't be what the marriage amendment is about, because it has no effect on parenting." The plaintiffs argued that Nevada's contrast of marriage and domestic partnership, which it called "a second-class status", distinguished their case from Minnesota's lack of any provision for same-sex couples in 1972, when the Supreme Court in "Baker v. Nelson" refused to hear a challenge to Minnesota's restrictive marriage definition "for want of a substantial federal question."
As part of their equal protection claim, the plaintiffs argued that the court should evaluate distinctions based on sexual orientation using the heightened scrutiny standard. They did not assert a fundamental right to marry nor a due process claim, but focused on the equal protection claim and Nevada's disparate treatment of same-sex couples, being "so convinced that our equal protection claim is correct that we wanted to keep the focus of the case there... And courts often like to decide questions no more broadly than they need to, to resolve a case.
A Nevada reporter noted that both Republican Gov. Sandoval, the principal defendant in the suit, and Democratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who was representing him, tended to avoid public controversy and "both ... refused to fully engage in the political debate. They're framing their roles as technocrats doing an administrative job rather than politicians or ideologues wading into an emotional issue."
Judge Robert C. Jones, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Nevada, held an initial hearing on August 10, 2012. The parties had agreed in advance on how they wanted the court to handle motions in the case. The plaintiffs agreed not to oppose the request by the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, the original backers of the constitutional amendment and now based in Boise, Idaho, to intervene as a defendant. The defendants agreed that the court should postpone consideration of its arguments for summary dismissal until the case was fully briefed. Both sides asked the court to allow them to present expert testimony. Jones did not rule out expert testimony but expressed strong reservations, that it would require him to act "as a legislature". He said: "This area you're talking about ... is so broad it's across the entire United States. You're asking them to summarize thousands of incidences." Noting that several related cases were nearing possible consideration by the Supreme Court, he agreed the case should be expedited: "It makes sense to get this decided and off with the circus train." He thought "Sevcik" would make a good complement to the Ninth Circuit's decision in "Perry v. Brown".
Jones scheduled oral argument for November 26 on all issues in the case, but on September 19 he canceled the oral argument and announced he would rule on the basis of the briefs alone.
District Court decision.
On November 29, Jones ruled against the plaintiffs. He held that "the present challenge is in the main a garden-variety equal protection challenge precluded by "Baker"... The equal protection claim is the same in this case as it was in "Baker", i.e., whether the Equal Protection Clause prevents a state from refusing to permit same-sex marriages." 
Jones also analyzed the plaintiffs' other arguments "so that the Court of Appeals need not remand for further proceedings should it rule that "Baker" does not control..." He identified the discrimination Nevada makes between marriages the state does and does not recognize as a distinction based not on gender, which would require him to use intermediate scrutiny, but on sexual orientation, stating that the state maintains "heterosexual superiority ... by relegating (mainly) homosexual legal unions to a lesser status".
The court found that only rational basis standard applies to distinctions based on sexual orientation, relying "High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office" (1990). He explained his agreement with that case's determination that "homosexuals are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class" requiring a higher standard of review because "where no lingering effects of past discrimination are inherited, it is contemporary disadvantages that matter for the purpose of assessing disabilities due to discrimination. Any such disabilities with respect to homosexuals have been largely erased since 1990." He also argued that homosexuals have gained significant political power, citing the rarity of anti-homosexual messages in the national media and attributing the president's acceptance of same-sex marriage to "the homosexual-rights lobby". He disputed the Second Circuit's finding in "Windsor v. United States" (2012) that homosexuals are a politically powerless class: "The question of 'powerlessness' under an equal protection analysis requires that the group's chances of democratic success be virtually hopeless, not simply that its path to success is difficult or challenging because of democratic forces." He states that no action should be taken on unclear Constitutional rules, such as "equal protection of the laws", which is a vague clause of the Constitution whose enforcement is "a usurpation of democratic governance via judicial whim—a judicial practice much in vogue today". Having determined that there is no clear Constitutional prohibition, he cites a concurring opinion in "Frontiero v. Richardson" that the Supreme Court should not decide sensitive issues at the very time they are under consideration.
Finally, applying rational basis review, Jones found that "he protection of the traditional institution of marriage ... is a legitimate state interest" and quoted "Lawrence v. Texas", stating that the prevention of "abuse of an institution the law protects" is a valid state interest. He found that the state may rely on speculation alone for its rational basis, citing "Heller v. Doe". If marriage is extended to same-sex couples, he wrote, "it is conceivable that a meaningful percentage of heterosexual persons would cease to value the civil institution as highly as they previously had ... leading to an increased percentage of out-of-wedlock children, single-parent families, ... or other unforeseen consequences." He stated that Nevada has not decreased same-sex couples' rights (having no right to marry to begin with) and that their exclusion from marriage but not from a separate-but-parallel institution can only be seen as "benevolence".
He also addressed issues not raised by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs had referenced "Romer v. Evans" (1996) only to note that the Supreme Court in that case had found it unnecessary to consider more than rational basis review. Jones discussed "Romer" at length to show how it did not apply to Nevada's marriage restriction, since "Romer" addressed, he wrote, "an extreme case concerning a novel and ambitious type of law ... prevalent only under totalitarian regimes." Nevada's definition of marriage by contrast was "not based purely upon anti-homosexual animus, as the constitutional provision in "Romer" was."
Appeal.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed an appeal on December 3, 2012 with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court originally planned to hear the case on a parallel track with a similar Hawaii same-sex marriage case, "Jackson v. Abercrombie", until Hawaii's legalization of same-sex marriage as of December 2, 2013, mooted that case. The Court placed the case on hold pending the Supreme Court rulings in "Hollingsworth v. Perry" and "United States v. Windsor" on June 26. The Coalition for the Protection of Marriage on December 5, 2012, filed a petition for certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court, asking that court to take up the case without waiting for action by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court denied that petition on June 27, 2013. On October 18, 2013, Lambda Legal filed its opening brief. On January 21, 2014, the state of Nevada submitted its reply brief. On January 24, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto announced she was reviewing the state's brief because the Ninth Circuit's decision in "SmithKline Beecham Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories" on January 21 established that laws that make a distinction based on sexual orientation are subject to "heightened scrutiny", making the arguments that state had made based on the less demanding "rational basis" standard "likely no longer tenable in the Ninth Circuit." On February 10, Masto withdrew the state's brief defending Nevada's ban on same-sex marriage. Governor Sandoval agreed: "It has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court". On February 12, 2014, the Ninth Circuit issued an order vacating the previous order scheduling the "Jackson" and "Sevcik" cases together.
On July 3, the Ninth Circuit scheduled oral arguments in "Sevcik" for September 8, 2014. If the district court ruling upholding Nevada's same-sex marriage ban is overturned, the circuit court could simply vacate the ruling below, or could rule more broadly, allowing same-sex marriage statewide, or possibly circuit-wide.

Estimation

Estimation is the process of finding an estimate, or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available. Typically, estimation involves "using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter". The sample provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing information. An estimate that turns out to be incorrect will be an overestimate if the estimate exceeded the actual result, and an underestimate if the estimate fell short of the actual result.
How estimation is done.
Estimation is often done by sampling, which is counting a small number of examples something, and projecting that number onto a larger population. An example of estimation would be determining how many candies of a given size are in a glass jar. Because the distribution of candies inside the jar may vary, the observer can count the number of candies visible through the glass, consider the size of the jar, and presume that a similar distribution can be found in the parts that can not be seen, thereby making an estimate of the total number of candies that could be in the jar if that presumption were true. Estimates can similarly be generated by projecting results from polls or surveys onto the entire population.
In making an estimate, the goal is often most useful to generate a range of possible outcomes that is precise enough to be useful, but not so precise that it is likely to be inaccurate. For example, in trying to guess the number of candies in the jar, if fifty were visible, and the total volume of the jar seemed to be about twenty times as large as the volume containing the visible candies, then one might simply project that there were a thousand candies in the jar. Such a projection, intended to pick the single value that is believed to be closest to the actual value, is called a point estimate. However, a point estimation is likely to be incorrect, because the sample size - in this case, the number of candies that are visible - is too small a number to be sure that it does not contain anomalies that differ from the population as a whole. A corresponding concept is an interval estimate, which captures a much larger range of possibilities, but is too broad to be useful. For example, if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent. Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a hundred people.
Uses of estimation.
In mathematics, approximation describes the process of finding estimates in the form of upper or lower bounds for a quantity that cannot readily be evaluated precisely, and approximation theory deals with finding simpler functions that are close to some complicated function and that can provide useful estimates. In statistics, an estimator is the formal name for the rule by which an estimate is calculated from data, and estimation theory deals with finding estimates with good properties. This process is used in signal processing, for approximating an unobserved signal on the basis of an observed signal containing noise. For estimation of yet-to-be observed quantities, forecasting and prediction are applied. A Fermi problem, in physics, is one concerning estimation in problems which typically involve making justified guesses about quantities that seem impossible to compute given limited available information.
Estimation is important in business and economics, because too many variables exist to determine how large-scale activities will develop. Estimation in project planning can be particularly significant, because plans for the distribution of labor and for purchases of raw materials must be made, despite the inability to know every possible problem that may come up. Furthermore, such plans must not underestimate the needs of the project, which can result in delays while unmet needs are fulfilled, nor must they greatly overestimate the needs of the project, or else the unneeded resources may go to waste.
An informal estimate when little information is available is called a guesstimate, because the inquiry becomes closer to purely guessing the answer. The "estimated" sign, ℮, is used to designate that package contents are close to the nominal contents.

Indian Airlines Flight 171

Indian Airlines Flight 171 was a flight on 12 October 1976 that crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Bombay Airport killing all 95 persons on board.
The crash.
Flight 171 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Bombay to Madras. A Boeing aircraft was originally supposed to make the flight but it developed engine trouble and was replaced with a Sud Aviation Caravelle. Shortly after takeoff from runway 27, Flight 171 suffered a #2 engine failure. The crew of Flight 171 immediately turned back to attempt an emergency landing on Bombay Airport's runway 09. With its undercarriage down approximately 1000 yards from the end of the runway and while at an altitude of 300 feet, the aircraft suffered a loss of control and plummeted into the ground. Everyone on board Flight 171 perished in the accident.
Cause.
A fatigue crack in the tenth stage compressor disc caused a power plant failure which was followed by the bursting of the compressor casing and the cutting of fuel lines that spanned the structure. This caused an intense in-flight fire in the engine bay. It is believed the fire consumed the Caravelle's supply of hydraulic fluid and this was the cause of the aircraft going out of control.

Flick (physics)

In optical engineering and telecommunications engineering, the flick is a unit of spectral radiance. One flick corresponds to a spectral radiance of 1 watt per steradian per square centimeter of surface per micrometer of span in wavelength (W·sr−1·cm−2·μm−1). This is equivalent to 1010 watts per steradian per cubic meter (W·sr−1·m−3). In practice, spectral radiance is typically measured in microflicks (10-6 flicks). One microflick is equivalent to 10 kilowatts per steradian per cubic meter (kW·sr−1·m−3).

<doc id="36687277" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36687277" title="Hairstyles in the 1980s">
Hairstyles in the 1980s

Hairstyles in the 1980s included the mullet, tall Mohawk hairstyles, flattops, and hi-top fades (especially for black men), which became popular styles. Amongst women, large hair-dos, puffed-up styles, permanent waves, and softer cuts typified the decade. Big hair that was "often permed to achieve the desired volume" is especially associated with women of the late 1980s as well as male rockstars of that era, especially of the glam metal genre. Television shows such as "Dynasty" helped popularize the high volume bouffant and glamorous image associated with it.
Categories.
Cuts.
Totally shaved heads gained popularity among men. The sideburns of the 1960s and 1970s saw a massive decline in fashion in late 1970s. Big and eccentric hair styles were popularized by film and music stars, in particular amongst teenagers. It was these hairstyles that the 80s became iconic for. Although straight hair was the norm at the beginning of the decade, as many late 1970s styles were still relevant, by around 1983 the perm had come into fashion. This was in large part due to many movies released at the time, as well as possibly being a rebellious movement against the 1970s. In 1984, sideburns made a comeback but were slightly thinner and shorter, and better groomed than those of the 1970s, lasting until the end of 1986. These sideburns were usually (but not always) used as an add-on to the Mullet haircut. Spiked hair, teased hair, brightly colored hair, and shaved hair sections were popularized in the 1980s by the punk movement, as were the Mohawk and its twisted variant, Liberty spikes.
The Mullet haircut existed in several different styles, all characterized by hair short on the sides and long in the back. Mullets were popular in suburban and rural areas among working class men. This contrasted with a conservative look favored by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair and very short sideburns for men and sleekly straight hair for women. White collar men's haircuts were often shaved at the nape of the neck to create an artificially even hairline. Women's hairstyles became increasingly long in the latter part of the decade and blunt cuts dominated. Blunt cuts of the late 1980s brought long hair to an equal length across the back. Bangs were popular, with "mall bangs", attributed to teenage girls who frequented shopping malls, were styled by ratting bangs into peaks or mounds, and then using hairspray to keep them in place.
Chemical treatments.
Many young women in Europe and North America dyed their hair a rich burgundy or plum-red in the last half of the decade. Auburns and reds were favored by those who aspired to emulate Molly Ringwald. But non-traditional haircolors, such as bright blue, crimson, green, and shocking pink gained favor from the punk subculture. Contrasting color streaks were popularised by teenagers. Big permed hair for women (and some men) was popular. Chemical hair treatment was popularized by the perm hairstyle, which resulted in soft, full curls. By the late 1980s, the permed bouffant had become highly fashionable among women of all walks of life, notably Princess Diana. The long, permed hair look was particularly popular amongst male rock stars of this period, associated with heavy metal and glam metal bands of this era such as Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Whitesnake.
Styling techniques.
During the middle and late 1980s it was unfashionable to part either men's or women's hair as the perm made the center parting look unattractive. There was generally an excessive amount of mousse used in styling an individual's hair which resulted in a desired shiny look and greater volume; some mousse even contained glitter. Hairsprays such as AquaNet were also used in excess. Artificial dreadlock extensions were inspired by the Rastafari movement. Michael Jackson wore his hair in Jheri curl style in the 1980s; it was popular among African Americans in the early decade, but its popularity waned by the end of the decade. Hair gel was used by young men to effect the preppy look of a well groomed, short hair style. Crimped hair was as fashionable as the large wave.
Accessories.
Scrunchies and headbands made of elastic and cloth were popular in all different colors, styles, and patterns. Scrunchies were very popular in the side pony tail hair style. "Banana clips" were another favorite, pulling hair back into a fanned out style.
Facial.
One trend in facial hair for men from the mid 1980s until the late 1990s was called designer stubble.

Canal Street (Runcorn)

Canal Street was a sports stadium used by Runcorn RFC and later Runcorn FC, in Canal Street, Runcorn, a town now within the borough of Halton in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England, and on the southern bank of the River Mersey. It was also used for other sports.
History.
Rugby league.
The first owners of the Canal Street ground were Runcorn RFC, a rugby union club formed sometime before 1886. In 1895 the club were one of the founders of the Northern Union, which later became the Rugby League.
The club suffered badly during World War I and failed to return to the league after hostilities ended.
Football.
At this point the ground was purchased by a R H Posnett, the owner of a local tannery company and was used by the Highfield and Camden Tanneries Recreation Club, who became known as Runcorn FC from 1918). The club continued to be run under the overall control of the tanneries until the football club became a limited company in 1953.
Rugby league returns in ground share.
Huyton Rugby League Club moved to Canal Street under a ground sharing agreement with the football club from 1984–85 to 1989–90, changing their name to Runcorn Highfield RLFC.
Tragedy.
The football club had mixed success on the field, but in later years had problems with the ground, which by the 1990s was in need of major works. Disaster struck three times off the field during the 1993–94 season.
A first round FA Cup tie against Hull City, attracted a larger crowd than expected. The away supporters gathered in a central position and although the ground attendants tried to split them they resisted. The result was that in order to get a better view of a goalmouth incident and Hull's first goal the crowd surged forward and the perimeter wall collapsed. Forty to fifty spectators were trapped and four spectators and a police constable were injured. The match was abandoned and replayed the following week at another local ground.
Later in the season, the roof blew off a stand in high winds, and the main stand was gutted by fire.
With the clubs precarious financial position, and the cost of rebuilding their Canal Street home, Runcorn suffered on the pitch, resulting in relegation, which was to be the start of a downhill spiral.
Closure.
The last competitive game to be played at Canal Street was on 5 May 2001 and resulted in a defeat 2–1 by Gateshead. Runcorn player Liam Watson scored the club’s final goal in this match.
At the end of the 2000–01 season, the football club, struggling with large debts and dwindling attendances, sold the ground and moved to Halton Stadium, home of Widnes Vikings Rugby League Club, where they stayed for several years before again struggling financially and ground sharing with Southport at Haig Avenue and Prescot Cables at Valerie Park, before finally folding at the end of the 2005–06 season.
The ground itself, by now in a dilapidated and a dangerous condition, was sold to developers and is now a housing development, the Linnets Park housing estate
Note.
A brief scribbled note on an old programme mentions the name “Pavillions” as being the home of Runcorn RFC. This error is repeated in several books and websites. This ground is not related to Runcorn RFC or Canal Street.
It is in fact a recreation area on which sports are played and was used by Runcorn ARLFC, a junior team from the early 2000s, and who moved there from the start of the 2009-10 summer season (their 5th in the Summer Conference). It is on the Eastern end of Sandy Lane (between Western Point Expressway and Picow Farm Road), Runcorn.
Prior to that Runcorn ARLFC had played at various grounds including at Moore, and moved to Pavilions from the fields to the rear of The Heath School, off Clifton Road, where they had played the previous season (2008–09). The club website became static during season 2009-10 and the club appeared to fold.

This is where the club remained for eight years before promotion back into the League was achieved with victory in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final. The club's first team have competed in numerous nationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in fewer than 25 such matches, either as a member of the starting eleven or as a substitute, are listed below.
Each player's details include the duration of his York career, his typical playing position while with the club, and the number of games played and goals scored in domestic league matches and in all senior competitive matches. Where applicable, the list also includes the national team for which the player was selected, and the number of senior international caps he won. The names are ordered first by number of appearances in total, then by number of league matches played, and then if necessary by date of debut. All statistics are correct up to and including the match played on 16 May 2014.
Introduction.
As of the date specified above, more than 500 players had completed their York career before reaching the 25-match milestone. Many of these players spent only a short period of their careers at York before seeking opportunities in other teams. Players who have gone on to experience football in the English top tier include Chris Iwelumo, when playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Neil Warnock, when managing Notts County, Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers. Internationally, Iwelumo also went on to represent Scotland and Leo Bertos became the first former York player to represent his country at a FIFA World Cup when appearing for New Zealand at the 2010 tournament. Four players with under 25 appearances went on to manage the club; these were Jock Collier, Tom Mitchell, Viv Busby and Steve Torpey.
Many players spent brief periods with York on loan from other clubs. Some were young players gaining experience; Mike Stowell went on to play more than 400 matches for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Mike Cook played for the Cambridge United team that won promotion in the 1990 Football League Fourth Division play-offs. Other loanees had an established career but were not needed by their owning club; Steve Davis scored on his debut for York while Courtney Pitt came on as a substitute in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final.
As of the date above, 10 players have left the club with 24 career appearances; Bobby Warrender, Fred Marlow, Tom Mitchell, John Hammerton, Liam George, Jamie Price, Nick Pope, Richard Tindale, Phil Taylor and Byron Webster. Eight players listed here are still contracted to the club, so have the opportunity to add to their totals.

<doc id="36687386" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36687386" title="Hola (ethnic group)">
Hola (ethnic group)

Hola () are the descendants of Persians and Afro-Persians who migrated to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the 19th century.
Terminology.
Hola, or Huwala (in Arabic: هوله), is a plural Arabic term for Holi (in Arabic: هولي), which itself is a corruption of the singular Persian term Koli (in Persian: کولی), meaning Gypsy, and refers to a group of wandering Sunni non-Arabs who migrated to the Arabian peninsula, from the Iranian plateau and Indian subcontinent, during the 19th and 20th centuries. It can refer to people of multiple origins, including Iranian, Pakistani and Indian. The term should not be confused with non-Gypsy immigrants of non-Arab origins, who are usually referred to as Ajams.
Non-Arab descent.
DNA tests have confirmed that the Janahi and other Hola families belong to the R1a1a haplogroup, which is found within Iranian Kurds, Persians, Baloch, Africans and Bandaris. This means that the family does not belong to the Arab Bani Khalid tribe, as previously claimed.
Migration to the Arab Peninsula.
The most recent influx of the Hola to the now known as GCC countries is during the 1960s. Iran under the Shah was strict regarding different ethnic groups and maintained censuses on them. Most of the Hola families were exiled from various ports and villages of Iran. One inviting country was Bahrain, which had a need for more Sunni Muslims as the country was mainly Shia and was ruled by a Sunni family that came from Saudi Arabia. It was also a country that had a fairly large Hola community that existed on the island beforehand. Though there was a difference between the variety of people that had come during different times, the term “Hola” began to be used generally for all Sunni Muslims that had connections with Iran, especially after the Iranian Revolution, which brought about anti-Shia tensions to the GCC nation states, uniting those that were Sunni. You will mainly hear this term used in Bahrain, though Oman and the UAE has a large number of these families living among them.
The Hola had a degree of self-rule with a number of emirates (Arabic: see Arabic article) in the south of Iran until the 20th century. Following the ascent of the Pahlavi Dynasty, there was a diminution or abolition of the local ruling families' privileges as elsewhere in Iran.
Culture and Traditions.
Most of the Huwala families lived in the urban centres of the Persian Gulf states and established themselves as trading business families, making use of their networks across the Persian Gulf. In the Bahraini city of Manama, many settled in the neighbourhood of Awadhiya. They speak a dialect of Persian sometimes referred to as Khodmoni. However today, many Huwala families have become "Arabized" such that relatively few of them speak Persian, or even retain a separate identity. Traditionally, the Huwala have practiced the Shafi`i school of jurisprudence when it comes to Islamic rites, in contrast to the Maliki school practiced by most of the tribal Arabs of the Persian Gulf centres. Mahyawa is a fish sauce is that is regarded as being an essential item of Huwala cuisine.

Miner's figure

A miner's figure () is a traditional Christmas decoration from the Ore Mountains of central Europe. Miners' figures are turned or carved out of wood, and often bear two candles. They are usually displayed together with an angelic figure, also bearing a candle. This pair is intended to symbolize the relationship between man and woman or the worldly and spiritual aspects of life.
In the Ore Mountains, miners and angels, together with candle arches, smoking figures and nutcrackers, are all part of Christmas tradition. In modern times, people around the world place these candleholders on windowsills to provide light on long winter nights.
History.
Saxony’s Ore Mountain (German: "Erzgerbirge") region is one of the closely associated producers of this type of Christmas decoration since the 1800s. Over the years, the Ore Mountains in Germany has become synonymous with high quality Christmas craftsmanship. Mining was the economic driver of this area. However, miners’ hobbies of carving wood from the surrounding forest provided a supplementary income to the Ore Mountain villages and have continued until present.
It was one of the traditional "duties" of every Ore Mountain man, when he became a father, to carve a miner or an angel for his child. The miner for a son and the angel for a daughter.
And at Christmas time, the "fifth season" in the Ore Mountains, these figures were placed in windows and so passers-by could see how many children there were in the house. The figures also had, however, another purpose and thus became a symbol for the region. When miners went to the pit early in the morning, it was still dark, especially in the winter months. Likewise, it was dark in the mine itself and their place of work was only dimly lit. When their long shift was over the moon was already in the sky. In order to light the way for their menfolk in the dark winter's night, the women placed the Light Miner ("Lichterbergmann") and the Light Angel ("Lichterengel"), as the figures were called, in the windows.
The angel became a symbolic figure for the pious mining folk of the Ore Mountains. The angels acted as guardians and light-bearers on the dark and difficult road into the mine. In some versions,the wooden angels holding candles represented miners’ wives waiting for them to get home.

Bezirk Lothringen

Bezirk Lothringen (; i.e. Department of Lorraine), also called German Lorraine ("deutsches Lothringen"), was the name for a Department ("Bezirk") in the western part of Alsace-Lorraine when it was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918.
History.
The District of Lorraine was unlike Prussian government regions no simple governorate but a corporation of self-rule of the pertaining rural and urbans subdistricts and cantons, similar to regions in the then neighbouring Bavaria (Palatinate). Thus the district parliaments delegated deputies to the General Council (parliament), the "Bezirkstag von Lothringen" (). The capital of the "District of Lorraine" was Metz.
Territorial composition.
The department comprised the districts ("Kreise") of :
The district of Lorraine corresponds exactly to the current "département" of Moselle. After the outbreak of the Second World War and the defeat of France in 1940, the "département" of Moselle, renamed CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen, was added to the Gau Westmark on 30 November 1940.

The Subsiding of the Waters of the Deluge

The Subsiding of the Waters of the Deluge is an 1829 painting by English-born American artist Thomas Cole depicting the aftermath of the Great Flood.
The painting is an 90.8 x 121.4 cm oil on canvas. It is on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C..
Background.
Cole collected extensive notes on geology and consulted geologists and other scientists such as Benjamin Silliman to gather background information on what the world might have looked like after the Biblical Flood.
Description.
The painting shows a barren rocky coastscape as seen from the viewpoint of a cavern. A waterfall created by the receding waters of the Flood flows towards the sea. Debris such as broken trees, a destroyed mast, and even a skull are seen upon the coast. The land has been striped of soil. The sky outside the cavern is bright and in the distance floats an Ark and a dove flies.
Interpretation.
The painting is interpreted as representing rebirth and redemption through destruction. The cleansing nature of the Flood is meant to represent America as a "New Eden" free of the abusive power of the European monarchies.
History.
In 1829 and 1831 the painting was on exhibit at the National Academy of Design. It was subsequently lost until 1974.

Ralph Patt

Ralph Oliver Patt (5 December 1929 – 6 October 2010) was an American jazz-guitarist who introduced major-thirds tuning. Patt's tuning simplified the learning of the fretboard and chords by beginners and improvisation by advanced guitarists. He invented major-thirds tuning under the inspiration of first the atonal music of Arnold Schoenberg and second the jazz of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman.
He graduated with a degree in geology from the University of Pittsburgh. After his career as a guitarist, he worked as a geologist and as a hydrologist, often consulting on projects related to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Biography.
Patt was born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania on 5 December 1929 and studied geology at the University of Pittsburgh.
Guitar and music theory.
While in Pittsburgh, Patt studied guitar under Joe Negri. Patt played rhythm guitar in the style of Freddie Green, who played a Stromberg in the Count Basie Orchestra. Having earned his baccalaureate degree, he joined the United States Army and played guitar in an Army band. Following his 1955 discharge from the Army, Patt played with touring bands, for example, Neal Hefti, Frankie Carle, Les Elgart, Benny Goodman, Richard Maltby, and The Glenn Miller Orchestra.
After touring for five years, Patt settled in New York City, where he worked as musician both at ABC and on Broadway from 1960 to 1970; during this period he regarded Barry Galbraith as his mentor. He studied under George Russell, whose (1959) "The Lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization for improvisation" Patt edited.
</ref> Patt also studied with Gunther Schuller, who himself was a student of Arnold Schoenberg and who used Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique for atonal composition. Patt wanted to be able to play and then to improvise twelve-tone music.
Major-thirds tuning.
Patt was inspired by the jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane and the atonal music of Schoenberg. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. Patt's tuning is a regular tuning in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, the standard guitar-tuning has one major-third amid four fourths. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a session musician after 1965 in New York.
Major-thirds tuning packs the chromatic scale (the consecutive twelve-notes of the octave) onto four consecutive frets of three consecutive strings, an arrangement that reduces the extensions of the little and index fingers ("hand stretching"). Major and minor chords are played on two successive frets, and so require only two fingers; other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on three successive frets. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' improvisation. In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords; standard tuning has separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.
Having exactly three pitch classes for its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note in a higher octave, because guitars have three strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this repetition simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.
Guitars with seven and eight strings.
Major-thirds tuning has a smaller scope than standard guitar-tuning, and so Patt started using seven-string guitars, which enabled major-thirds tuning to have the E-e' range of the standard tuning. He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963. In 1967 he purchased a seven-string by José Rubio. Patt used major-thirds tuning when he performed as a session musician in New York City after 1965.
Later, he purchased six-string archtop hollow-body guitars that were then modified by luthiers to have wider necks, wider pickups, and eight strings. Patt's Gibson ES-150 was modified by Vincent "Jimmy" DiSerio, a luthier who worked in the firm of John D'Angelico, circa 1965. Luthier Saul Koll modified a sequence of guitars: a 1938 Gibson Cromwell, a Sears Silvertone, a circa 1922 Mango archtop, a 1951 Gibson L-50, and a 1932 Epiphone Broadway; for Koll's modifications, custom pick-ups accommodated Patt's wide necks and high G (equivalently A); custom pick-ups were manufactured by Seymour Duncan and by Bill Lawrence.
Besides these guitars, Patt regularly played other stringed instruments as a recording musician: classical guitar, 12-string guitar, 6-string bass guitar, mandolin, banjo, and oud. Patt stated that "the only guys that didn't have to double on dates were the Tony Mottolas and the Johnny Smiths"; Tony Mottola and Johnny Smith were famous jazz-guitarists, and "doubling" refers to a musician's switching from one instrument to another, particularly within a family of instruments.
</ref> Patt worked primarily as a studio musician from 1970 to 1975.
Scholarship.
Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning. This webpage was part of website with extensive information for jazz guitarists. Patt's website published his "Vanilla book", which contains the chord progressions for four-hundred jazz standards, from "After you've gone" to "Zing! went the strings". Its title refers to "Just play the vanilla changes", advice to young pianists from Lester Young. It was updated in 2008.
His website followed earlier contributions to guitar scholarship and instruction. In 1962, Patt wrote his "Guitar chord dictionary" (1962). Living in New York City in the 1960s, he studied with Chuck Wayne, with whom he wrote "The guitar appreggio dictionary" (1965), one of the bestselling titles from the music-publishing firm of Henry Adler.
Return to geology.
As a studio musician in the 1970s, Patt had to play less jazz and more rock and roll, and so he changed careers. He returned to geology while continuing to pursue jazz as an avocation. Around 1975 he began working on his doctoral degree in hydrogeology. Employed by the US Department of Energy, he specialized in ground-water contamination from nuclear waste; as a research hydrogeologist, he accepted assignments world-wide and had extensive travels in Ukraine and Russia.
He was employed by Oregon's Department of Water Resources, where he served as its expert on the risks to the Columbia River from the Hanford Site. As a hydrological geologist (hydrologist), he was appointed to a panel of outside experts that reviewed and then "slammed" the U.S. Department of Energy's report on the safety of the underground storage of high-level nuclear waste at Hanford.
Death.
In 2002 and 2010, Patt's hometown was listed as Canby, Oregon, near Portland. Having been diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2007, Ralph Oliver Patt died at the age of 80 on 6 October 2010 in Canby at home. To honor his memory, the Ralph Patt Memorial Scholarship provided full tuition, room, and board for a college student to attend the Mel Brown Jazz Camp in 2011.

Despite growing up very close to Lethbridge, the tour's opening performance marked the first time that she had performed professionally as an actor in the city, an event she attested to looking forward to. She has also performed in Theatre Prospero's production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" as Titania.

Jimmy Robinson (recording engineer)

James Kelly "Jimmy" Robinson II (born 29 July 1950, Washington, DC), is an American recording engineer, record producer and musician. He is best known for his engineering techniques with both analogue and digital audio recordings with prominent popular pop and rock records in American music from the late 1960s to the present. In addition to his recording expertise, Robinson is also an accomplished musician in his own right and has been awarded gold records as both a saxophonist and bass guitarist.
Early life.
Jimmy Robinson was born 29 July 1950 in Washington D.C. to James K. Robinson I and Louise H. Robinson and spent his early childhood growing up in College Park, Maryland. At an early age Robinson took a strong interest in music and electronics while attending schools in the Washington metropolitan area and began playing saxophone at age of 12 with various bands before joining in the band "The Nowhere Men" at the age of 18 in 1968.
Engineering and producing.
The Record Plant NYC.
In 1969, The Nowhere Men were playing a show at the Cellar Door and Robinson met former Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Buddy took a liking to Robinson's sax playing and invited him up to New York City to work a few gigs and meet Gary Kellgren, and subsequently Jimi Hendrix, at the Record Plant recording studios in NYC.
Gary Kellgren immediately was impressed with Robinson’s technical ability and asked him begin working as an assistant engineer at the Record Plant NYC. At his first session there in 1969, he worked with engineer Jack Adams and R&B singer Patti Labelle.
During his tenure working at the Record Plant, Robinson developed a close working relationship with Hendrix whom he would drive home and hang out with after sessions. Hendrix preferred to work at night and since Gary Kellgren and fellow engineer Eddie Kramer preferred to record during the day Robinson soon became one of Hendrix’s regular recording engineers for late night sessions.
Band of Gypsys.
Upon hearing that Capitol Records was looking for Hendrix to fulfill a contract he had signed with Ed Chaplin of PPX Enterprises before he had put together the "Jimi Hendrix Experience", Hendrix decided to form a band with Buddy Miles and long-time friend and bass player Billy Cox. The name "Band of Gypsys" was already mentioned as an alternative name for his band by Hendrix in his speeches during the Woodstock concert.
Capitol Records sent out Wally Heider to record the live debut of the Band of Gypsys and Gary Kellgren sent Robinson as the Record Plant’s preferred engineer. The first live show was to be performed at the Fillmore East on New Year's Eve 1969 with the Voices of East Harlem as the opening act. 
The Band of Gypsys' performances were recorded two nights in a row with two shows each night. After the shows, the recordings were sent over to Juggy Sound Studios (owned by producer Juggy Murray) where the album was to be mixed by Eddie Kramer. For a few days the tapes went missing, but were soon found, mixed by Kramer, and then delivered to Capitol Records. 
"The Band of Gypsys Live at the Fillmore East" went up the charts quickly to #4 in the US and #5 in the U.K. and was RIAA certified gold that same year. This was a first for a live recording. Initially, it was unclear if it was going to be a commercial success. However, shortly after its release it was hailed by critics as the standard for which all artists should strive in live recordings. The recording was Jimmy Robinson’s first gold record for recording. Robinson's recording of "Machine Gun" (Capitol Records STAO-472 -US) on "Band of Gypsys", is considered by most Hendrix aficionados to be the best live solo recording of Hendrix.
"Loose Ends", the fourth and last studio album released by Hendrix where Robinson engineered and overdubbed, was released by manager Michael Jeffery. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. Records decided not to release the album in the US & Canada because of content. It was released in the UK, France and Japan.
Electric Ladyland.
Under the advice of Eddie Kramer and manager Michael Jefferies, Hendrix decided to construct his own recording studio, Electric Ladyland. After construction was completed, Kramer and Andy Edlen invited Robinson to work there in the summer of 1970. During his tenure working at Electric Ladyland, Robinson began working on a few tracks for Stevie Wonder's "Talking Book" and "Innervisions". Robinson also worked with several prominent artists of the time including Roberta Flack, Led Zeppelin (on "Houses of the Holy"), Blood Sweat and Tears, and Miles Davis' "Live Evil". In August 1972, Michael Manari the jazz vibraphonist asked Robinson to be his assistant and join GNU Music. Robinson worked for Manari until the end of the year.
Larabee Sound Los Angeles, California.
In January 1973 Bob Margaloff and Malcolm Cecil invited Jimmy out to Los Angeles to work on a few projects of which Jimmy Robinson decided it was time to leave NYC.
Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Jimmy Robinson quickly found himself as the lead candidate to be Chief Engineer of Larrabee Sound on Bob Margaloff and Malcolm Cecil’s recommendation. In February 1973 Jimmy Robinson was invited to join Larabee Sound as Chief Engineer under the supervision of Jackie Mills. The first slate of recording projects included Cher, Al Wilson, Robbie Krieger, John Densmore from The Doors, Chris DeMarco, and Rachel Perry.
As Jimmy was working at Larabee his fondness for technology and instrument construction led him to begin working with Paul Beaver as part of the synthesizer team Beaver and Krouse on a suggestion from Walter Sear and began developing apolyphonic synthesizer with Paul Beaver that unfortunately never came to fruition due to Paul Beaver’s untimely death in 1974.
Jimmy Robinson married Maggie Welch, whose brother was Bob Welch, the guitarist and vocalist for Fleetwood Mac and invited Bob to move in with them over in Laurel Canyon. Bob Welch and Jimmy Robinson became good friends, and shortly after Bob moved in they had a discussion about Welch's desire to leave Fleetwood Mac.
Jimmy Robinson suggested bringing in former Jethro Tull bassist Glen Cornick and ex Todd Rundgren’s Nazz drummer Thom Mooney for a new project and brought the band to John Carter at Capitol Records. The new group was to be called Paris, and the idea was embraced by Al Courey then head of Capitol's A&R department.
The Record Plant, L.A..
Every Sunday night at 6 P.M., Gary Kellgren would throw a special A-List only party bearing the name "The Jim Keltner Fan Club Hour" after world famous drummer Jim Keltner who was well known in musician circles at the time. Austin Godsey who lived with Jack Adams across from Frank Zappa's house in Laurel Canyon where Jimmy Robinson was also living invited Robinson to the latest "The Jim Keltner Fan Club Hour" party at Record Plant in Los Angeles.
Upon arrival at the Record Plant, Robinson was asked by Kellgren to help out with recording the artists during the jam session. The artists at the studios that evening were John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Jessie Ed Davis, Danny Kortchmar, Trever Lawrence, Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Jim Keltner, Ringo Starr, Bruce Gary, Wolfgang Metz, Rocky Djubano, Mike Finnigan, Al Kooper, Harry Nilsson, Vennetta Fields, Clydie King, Claudia Lennear all for a track to be entitled "Too Many Cooks are Bound to Spoil the Soup". The engineers for the session were; Gary Kellgren, Lee Kiefer, Austin Godsy, and Robinson. The current location of the original 16 track master is unknown to this day, however bootleg 2 tracks have surfaced from time to time on the internet.
While working on Paris, Robinson received a phone call from Ben Edmonds from Capitol Records A&R department and asked him to work with Jimmy Page on a new group signed to Swan Song Records. The group was to be called "Detective" and Robinson was to serve as producer and engineer for the first album. This album turned out so well that many Led Zeppelin fans thought that Jimmy Page had produced it under the pseudonym "Jimmy Robinson".
After Detective, Robinson began two albums with Sammy Hagar. The first project with Hagar was "9 on a Ten Scale" and then subsequently "Red". Shortly after working with Hagar, Lou Bramey of Spread Eagle Productions asked Jimmy Robinson to record and produce Y&T's "Struck Down" album for London Records. The album "Struck Down" is best remembered for Dave Meniketti's heavy guitar leads that was preceded the metal scene by a decade. 
During his tenure with the Record Plant in Los Angeles, Jimmy developed an even closer friendship with Gary Kellgren and the two of them took over Sly Stone's custom project studio in Saulsalito, CA called "The Pit" that featured eccentric amenities such as a recessed recording area with shag carpeting and secret passages; where they worked closely with Sly Stone, Paris, Sammy Hagar, Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, and Tower of Power.
Gary Kellgren.
The sudden death of his close friend Gary Kellgren in 1977 devastated Robinson. Although he continued to work at The Record Plant Los Angeles, the infamous studio didn't feel the same and so with great sadness Robinson left pursue other endeavors.
In 1979, Bruce Gary and Prescott Niles, from the band "The Knack", called Robinson to produce and record Randy California of "Spirit (band)", for a six song E.P. After completing that project, Robinson took a job working A&R for Capitol Records where he helped with the development of several punk rock bands, most notably "The Dogs". After getting word that his mother's health was not good, Robinson moved back to NYC to be close to her and work as a freelance engineer.
Chun King , Sony Music, MTV, NYC.
As an independent engineer Jimmy Robinson found himself highly sought after as a consultant and began working for numerous companies of those included; MTV headquarters in NYC, Chun King Studios, and Sony Music for Tommy Mattola and Dave Smith.
2003 to present.
Jimmy Robinson still works as a free lance engineer today and produces records with his own small company Ear Candy Audio Productions based in NYC. In addition to his production work he is also an active member of The International Communications Industries Association, A.R.R.L. (Ham Radio), a voting member of National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (N.A.R.A.S./Grammys), and voting member of the Audio Engineering Society (A.E.S.).

New Stage

New Stage is a webseries that stars Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino as Angel Adonis, a famous hip-hop star and lead judge on a reality television singing competition. Directed by Joshua David Evans and produced by YOBI.tv, the series reveals the extent to which Producer Frank Rossi (Dom Chizzoniti) must go with his judges—Angel A (Mike Sorrentino), Lola Lathers (Ashley Gerke), and Rufus Middleton (Ben Green) -- his cast, and his entire crew to insure the show's success.

Liberty Hill International Sculpture Park

The Liberty Hill International Sculpture Park resides in Liberty Hill, Texas. The Sculpture Garden is the result of an International Sculpture Symposium held in the town in 1976. There are currently 27 pieces created by various artists from 6 different countries, including, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The symposium project won the town of Liberty Hill the first Texas Arts Award for a city with a population under 100,000 in 1977.
History.
International symposium.
In the early 1970s, Mel Fowler, a painter and sculptor, came to Liberty Hill, Texas. Fowler attended an International Sculpture Symposium in Europe in 1975. On his return to Liberty Hill he began to organize a site for the first international sculpture symposium in the southwest. Initially, Fowler aimed to host the symposium in Austin, Texas, but a local of Liberty Hill, James Vaughan, convinced him to hold the symposium in the small town. 
In celebration of the U.S. bicentennial, during the fall of 1976, the town hosted 25 sculptors from 6 different countries. Many local families provided room and board for the artists, and many local organizations provided meals. Local companies also supplied all of the materials for the sculptures. Native granite, concrete, and steel were the primary materials used. The entire symposium took place without any state or federal money. The symposium resulted in a park of abstract sculptures located in downtown Liberty Hill at Veterans Park.
Dedication.
The sculptures remained in Veterans Park for 10 years while Fowler attempted to raise funds to buy a larger piece of land for the sculptures. In mid-1980's, Don Cunningham, a new administrative assistant for Liberty Hill Independent School District, wished to purchase a piece of granite from one of the sculptures for a sign for the new high school. After negotiations, the school district accepted all of the sculptures as part of a landscape for the high school. 
On May 5, 1987, after a massive moving effort, the sculptures were dedicated on the grounds of Liberty Hill High School (now Liberty Hill Middle School). It became the only recorded site of an International Sculpture Park on school grounds. Several sculptures were added after the symposium and dedication, including one by Jim Thomas and several by Mel Fowler, bringing the total to 27 pieces in the park.
Future.
Currently, some of the sculptures are being moved from the middle school to the adjacent Lions Foundation Park, run by the Liberty Hill Development Board. The sculptures will remain partially on the school grounds, partially in Foundation Park, with a clear walking trail between the pieces. A re-dedication of the park is set to occur in late April 2013.
Sculptors and sculptures.
The following lists the sculptors and the piece created for the park at Liberty Hill. The list is categorized by country of origin or residence. Some artists have two countries listed due to multiple residences at the time of the symposium. Two pieces from the original symposium were destroyed as noted. Thomas created a sculpture for the dedication in 1987, and Fowler added three pieces after the original symposium.

Features.
The figures consist of carved bone, antler or Mammoth tusk ivory. They are between 15,000 and 11,500 years old and stem from the Magdalenian period. These figurines are between 5.4 and 8.7 cm long. 
At the same place many engravings of animals, human beings and abstract signs on slate were found. The depictions of human beings were much stylized. Most often women were depicted, always in profile without a head. The Montastruc decorated stone (Palart 518) in the British Museum has similar stylization.

Abu Taghlib

Fadl Allah Abu Taghlib al-Ghadanfar ʿUddat al-Dawla (), usually known simply by his "kunya" as Abu Taghlib, was the third Hamdanid ruler of the Emirate of Mosul, encompassing most of the Jazira.
His reign was troubled, being marked by conflicts with some of his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.
Life.
Origin and background.
Abu Taghlib was the eldest son of al-Hasan, better known by his "laqab" of Nasir al-Dawla, who had established the Hamdanids as masters of a practically independent emirate encompassing the Jazira and centred on Mosul. Nasir al-Dawla engaged in repeated attempts to gain control over the Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad, but in the end was forced to concede defeat to the more powerful Buyids, recognize their suzerainty and pay them tribute. At the same time, Nasir al-Dawla's younger brother Ali, better known as Sayf al-Dawla, managed to establish his control over northern Syria from his two capitals Aleppo and Mayyafariqin, and through his clashes with the Byzantine Empire quickly overshadowed his brother. However, the last decade of Sayf al-Dawla's rule, until his death in February 967, was marked by heavy military defeats at the hands of the Byzantines, who occupied much of his domains, and internal turmoil.
It was in this context that Abu Taghlib is first mentioned in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.
Reign.
Abu Taghlib, surnamed ""al-Ghadanfar"" ("The Lion"), succeeded his father as emir and head of the Jaziran branch of the Hamdanid family, but almost immediately his authority was contested by a younger half-brother, Hamdan. Nasir al-Dawla had entrusted the latter with the governance of Nisibis, Maridin and Rahba shortly before his deposition, and may have intended to name him as his heir over Abu Taghlib. Hamdan was indeed the only son of Nasir al-Dawla to protest his father's deposition, and refused to recognize Abu Taghlib. With the aid of the new Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, Abu Taghlib prevailed over Hamdan, who fled to Baghdad. In addition, Abu Taghlib used the conditions of near-anarchy prevailing in Syria at the time and after Sayf al-Dawla's death to expand his territory at the expense of his cousin, Sa'd al-Dawla. Upon Sayf al-Dawla's death, Abu Taghlib seized al-Raqqah and Rafiqa, and by 971 he had extended his control over all of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar, once part of Sayf al-Dawla's domain, uniting the entire Jazira under his rule. Sa'd al-Dawla, deprived of his own capital and lacking any power to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty. As ruler of the Jazira, Abu Taghlib was one of the richest rulers of the region; Ibn Hawkal's descriptions attest to the wealth derived from the many Hamdanid estates, and Ibn Miskawayh, who was tasked with inventorying the family's mountain strongholds after the Buyid dissolution of the Hamdanid emirate in 979, writes of the immense cash reserves stored there.
Relations with the Buyids were initially good, as Abu Taghlib, unlike his father, had no direct claim on Baghdad, and Bakhtiyar himself was too preoccupied with affairs in Iraq and elsewhere to focus his attention on the Jazira. However, the Buyid prince offered refuge to Hamdan and other disgruntled members of the Hamdanid clan (including another of Abu Taghlib's brothers, Abu Tahir Ibrahim) and intervened in the Hamdanid family quarrels. Thus in 970 Hamdan was restored in Rahba thanks to Buyid pressure, only to be chased away again in 971. The exiled prince now urged Bakhtiyar to make war on Abu Taghlib: in 973 the Buyids once again occupied Mosul, while Abu Taghlib with his army outflanked them and threatened Baghdad. The conflict ended in a negotiated settlement in 974 that included in its provisions the award of the "laqab" of ʿUddat al-Dawla ("Instrument of the Dynasty") to Abu Taghlib by the caliph and the restoration of Hamdan to his domains. During the same period, Abu Taghlib also faced the attacks of the Byzantines, who under Emperor John I Tzimiskes penetrated deep into the Jazira, forcing the Hamdanids to pay tribute. The devastating raids of 972 were partly avenged through the defeat and capture of the Domestic of the Schools Melias at Amid in 973, but in 974 Tzimiskes himself raided the Jazira in retaliation.
In 973–975, Abu Taghlib supported Bakhtiyar in his own struggles to safeguard his power. Thus he once again marched on Baghdad during the rebellion of the Turkish military commander, Sabuktakin, although it was the intervention of the Buyid emir of Shiraz, 'Adud al-Dawla, that decided the conflict for Bakhtiyar. As a result of his assistance, in 975 Abu Taghlib secured a revision of the earlier treaty which freed him from the payment of tribute. In 976, following the death of Tzimiskes, Abu Taghlib agreed to support the bid for the Byzantine throne of the rebel general Bardas Skleros, with whom he concluded a treaty whereby the Hamdanid ruler supplied Skleros with light cavalry in exchange for an unspecified marriage agreement.
In 977, as Bakhtiyar found himself driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned again to the Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in exchange for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.
Exile and death.
With the Buyid troops completing their conquest of the Jazira, and unable to seek aid from his cousin Sa'd al-Dawla, who had already acknowledged 'Adud al-Dawla's suzerainty and was under orders to arrest him, Abu Taghlib with his remaining followers crossed the Syrian Desert to the Fatimid-controlled south of Syria. There he became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites. He endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of Lake Tiberias. Abu Taghlib's ambitions and his contacts with the Fatimids now came to threaten the position of Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a Tayy chief and ruler of Ramla. Hoping to sow dissension among the Arab tribes of the area and strengthen Fatimid authority, the Fatimid general Fadl now promised Ramla to Abu Taghlib, who openly allied himself with Mufarrij's rivals, the Banu Uqayl, and attacked Ramla in August 979. Fadl's troops, however, came to the aid of Mufarrij, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was taken captive and executed.
The Jazira remained under Buyid control until 989, when Abu Taghlib's brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim, who had submitted to the Buyids, were installed as governors to oppose the power of the Kurdish chieftain Badh, who had taken control of Mosul. In this fight, the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Badh, the Banu Uqayl turned on the Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the Uqaylid Dynasty as the rulers of the Jazira.

Subject to Change (EP)

Subject to Change was the first and only EP by Washington D.C. hardcore band The Faith. It was released in December 1983 through Dischord Records. Like other influential D.C. records, it was released after the band had broken up.
For the band's only other release after their split LP with Void, Edward Janney added some second guitar.
Overview.
"Allmusic" described it to be "hot-wired classic hardcore outrage and self-questioning, as before" giving it 4 stars out of 5; and also praised the production.
Don Zientara once again handled the recording, with Ivor Hanson's drumming sounding both stronger and also a touch more accomplished. Bass and guitar seemed to have switched positions of prominence in the mix, with Mike Hampton's crunch a touch more subtle and Chris Bald's own crisp work more directly audible.
It makes for a calm but interesting contrast; in combination with the fine if not especially original songs, the result is more prime hardcore. Alec MacKaye still screams with passion but also has a little more open ache slipping through here and there, which goes well with the lyrics of songs like "Limitations" and the combination of reflection and call to action in the especially inspiring title track. It all makes for a fine way for this solid band to be remembered. 
As the record progresses things get even more dynamic. "Say No More" finds Alec near-singing, and ends with four hand claps. Also, rather than snarling that he wants to make society bleed, he drops lines like "It's a feeling coming from your heart. Don't want to stop it, just want to know how it starts." If listened closely enough on "Aware" and "More of the Same," something can even be noticed, something more or less alien to hardcore records of the era: guitar solos.
As an exceptional record, not only because of its heavy, melodious (but not poppy, in fact punk) sound, but because of its great personal, introspective lyrics, things one can really relate to; it should be noted that it is far from a transitional record; the eight songs on "Subject to Change" are totally complete and powerful. The scene, however, was about to raze itself and start again from scratch. The record, in its music, lyrics, and especially the title song, was a forecast of the great things to come.
Influence.
When The Faith released it in 1983, the record marked a critical evolution in the sound of D.C. hardcore and punk music in general. Alec MacKaye's voice is still as bitterly venomous as ever on the lead track "Aware," but the new dual guitar version of The Faith was a far cry musically from the tracks on the Void split.
The record (along with the previous year's LPs by Scream and Marginal Man) did not only paved the way for bands like Dag Nasty, Rites of Spring, obviously Embrace (which is the same band except for an exchange of MacKaye brothers and the absence of Eddie Janney) and Fugazi who would continue to combine desperate introspective lyrics with angry, melody-tinged songwriting that moved even further from the hardcore formula, but also a subsequent generation of bands such as Nirvana and Sonic Youth. "Subject to Change" deserves to be thought of as one of the first melodic hardcore records, as significant to the form as Bad Religion or the Descendents; the whole scene would sound markedly different without this precursor. The Faith strove for fewer personally destructive and more thoughtful and introspective lyrics, and it is little surprise that the band went in the direction they did after their split. Their last release began to push the boundaries of early post-hardcore.

Crazy Sexy Wild

"Crazy Sexy Wild" and "Tu şi Eu" are two versions of a song by Romanian recording artist Inna. They were produced by Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan and Radu Bolfea, better known as the Romanian songwriter and music producer trio Play & Win, and co-written by GoodWill & MGI and Kimberly Cole. First published in May on YouTube and officially released on iTunes in June 2012, "Tu şi Eu" was sung in Romanian and English language. Inna released a complete English version of the song, entitled "Crazy Sexy Wild" on June 17, 2012. For the international promotion a music video for "Crazy Sexy Wild" was released on August 2, 2012. The music video for "Tu şi Eu" was released on August 8, 2012. "Tu şi Eu" became an overwhelming radio hit in Romania, distinctly outperforming its predecessor "Caliente" on the Romanian Top 100. Its top ten entry made Inna the most successful Romanian female artist in Romanian Top 100 chart history.
Background.
"Tu şi Eu" and "Crazy Sexy Wild" were written and produced by Inna's managers and producers, the Romanian songwriter and music producer trio Play & Win, who previously produced Inna's albums "Hot" and "I Am the Club Rocker" as well as all her hit singles including "Hot", "Amazing", "Sun Is Up", "Club Rocker" and "Endless". "Tu şi Eu" was written in both English and Romanian, Inna's native language. The Romanian title can be translated as "You And I". Inna uploaded the Radio Version of the song on her YouTube channel on May 28, 2012. The song officially was made available for downloading on iTunes on June 11, 2012. 
Inna released another version of the song, entitled "Crazy Sexy Wild" -- co-written by GoodWill & MGI and Kimberly Cole -- which completely was sung in English language, on June 17, 2012. Acoustic Versions of "Tu şi Eu" and "Crazy Sexy Wild" were released on June 21, 2012 respectively June 24, 2012.
Music video.
On August 2, 2012, the music video for the English version of the song, "Crazy Sexy Wild", was released on Inna's YouTube channel. The video for its Romanian fellow "Tu şi eu" was released on August 8, 2012. It was shot in California, mostly at Venice Beach. It starts with Inna walking on the beach promenade and spotting a young street musician with his guitar. Instead off giving him some money, she grabs all the banknotes out of his little suitcase and runs away. Annoyed at it, the musician follows Inna to brace her but she convinced him to spend all the money. Together they start buying ice cream and stealing clothes in a shop. At sunset they meet some friends on the beach at a bonfire and enjoy a pleasant evening. After spending the night in a tent directly on the beach, they secretly ride along on the load space of a pick-up truck on the next morning and leave the town. Later in the desert Inna and her lover want to hitch a ride and make a sign with the word "Anywhere". After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road. In the motel bar Inna enters a little stage and sings a bit. While Inna then tries to phone home, her love interest starts to flirt with a blond girl at the bar. Inna keeps calm, kisses the girl on the mouth and then chooses a juke box track. She and the musician rent a room for the night but while he falls asleep on the bed, Inna looks through the window and reflects the last two days with the musician. She leaves the motel room early in the morning, while he wakes up later and only finds a bill with the word "Anywhere".
Chart performance.
"Tu şi eu" became a massive radio hit in Inna's native Romania and one of her most successful singles on the Romanian Top 100. Initially released as a promotional song along with "INNdiA", "Crazy Sexy Wild", "Alright" and "OK", "Tu şi eu" and "INNdiA" were the only songs entering the Romanian Top 100. On June 17, 2012, "Tu şi eu" debuted at number ninety-five, being in competition with Inna's official single release, "Caliente", which debuted on the chart on May 27, 2012 and only peaked at number eighty-four. "Tu şi eu" exceeded "Caliente" on June 24, 2012, rising up to number sixty-seven. Although no official music video was released at that time, "Tu şi eu" continued to climb up the chart and reached number eighteen. After the music video release on August 8, 2012, the song rose up to number eleven. On August 19, 2012, it entered the top ten at number seven, becoming her third top ten single in 2012 and the eighth since Inna started her career in 2008. This made her the most successful Romanian female artist in Romanian Top 100 chart history. On September 23, 2012, "Tu şi eu" reached its peak position at number five. It spent forty-one weeks on the chart, and re-entered the Romanian Top 100 once again on July 28, 2013, August 18, 2013 and September 1, 2013 respectively, bringing the total of weeks to forty-four.

Alexisonfire Farewell Tour

The Alexisonfire Farewell Tour is the final concert tour by Canadian post-hardcore band Alexisonfire, taking place in December 2012. The band, who disbanded in August 2011, announced at the time their plans of doing one last farewell tour before officially disbanding, which will be also celebrating their 10th anniversary, though since then, nothing official about the farewell tour was announced until August 9, 2012, when the band revealed the tour dates to take place in December 2012.
The band has commented that the tour is short, due to December being the only available time window for all five members when they are free from any other commitments, especially Dallas Green who's touring with City and Colour and Wade MacNeil who's touring with Gallows. Although the band officially announced their break-up in August 2011, this will be the band's first tour in two years, as their last tour took place in December 2010, after which Green expressed his desire to leave the band, although this was never announced until 2011.
On August 17, 2012, after the tickets for the London date were sold out in just 5 minutes, the band announced that they added another London date at the same venue, a day before, on December 2, 2012.

Međimurje County Museum

The Međimurje County Museum in Čakovec, the seat of Međimurje County, Croatia, is located in the Zrinski Castle inner palace, the biggest medieval fortification (later renewed several times) in the county, close to the centre of the town and its main square.
History.
The museum was established in 1954 by the authorities of Međimurje County as Čakovec Town Museum and opened to the public in 1955. At the beginning it was housed in the exhibition halls inside the fortified outer buildings of the castle. Later it was enlarged, renamed and transferred to the three-storey inner palace of the whole castle complex, so it has around 5.000 sq.m today.
Function.
The museum functions now as a regional museum of homeland heritage type. It collects, preserves, maintains, displays, exhibits and interprets the heritage artifacts pertinent to the history of Međimurje County. It also gives expert help, guiding services and other informational services, organizes educational lectures and specialized exhibitions, publishes expert books and has other activities.
Departments and collections.
Among the museum's exhibits are a lot of local artifacts and archeological findings dating from the prehistory to recent history (20th century). A series of rooms depicts different periods of history and include information boards. Themes covered include ethnographical heritage and the history of the local economy.
There are five departments in the museum aiming to promote the county's rich legacy of heritage, culture and arts: archeology, ethnography, cultural history, history and visual arts gallery. The latter includes the memorial collection of Ladislav Kralj–Međimurec (1891–1976), a notable Croatian painter and engraver. 
The five departments comprise a total of 18.993 exhibited items distributed in 51 various collections, including a lapidarium situated in the inner courtyard (atrium) of the Zrinski palace, with a large number of stone monuments exhibited in the open air.

Lendink

Lendink was an ebook sharing website which allows users to connect with other users who are willing to lend a copy of a certain book, utilizing the lending functionality provided by the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook platforms.
Lendink became notable for an incident in August 2012 where it was assumed to be an illegal file-sharing website, despite its legitimacy, leading to its temporary shutdown after the site's owner and host received hundreds of cease and desist and takedown notices.
History.
In 2011 Amazon allowed authors to publish their books through Kindle Direct Publishing. It gave authors the ability to sell their books directly to consumers via the Amazon Kindle Store. An author had two royalty levels to choose from. If they published their book at the 70% royalty level, the book would be lendable. If it was published at the 35% royalty rate, an author could opt in or opt out of the feature. Lending through both providers lasted for 14 days. A book could only be lent out once.
Lendink debuted in 2011 as a virtual book club. It allowed owners of ebooks to offer their copies up to be loaned. If a person wanted to borrow a book, they would send an email through the website to the person offering a book to be borrowed. The transaction would happen via the Amazon or Barnes & Noble software. The site did not host the books and operated off of no income. It was only a facilitator of activities that were authorized by the author or publisher. If a book was not authorized to be lent by the publisher, the option would be grayed out on the site.
Takedown.
At the beginning of August 2012, an unknown person took a quick glance at Lendink's website and interpreted it as a file-sharing website. They proceeded to tell as many authors as they could over social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The message spread quickly, passing mouth to mouth from author to author. Cease and desist letters and takedown notices started to pour into the website's internet service provider. The website was pulled after mounting legal threats which numbered in the hundreds.
Following the shutdown, a crowdfunding effort began to provide a financial base for re-opening the website. On August 24, Lendlink was officially re-opened; while the site did receive several takedown notices following the re-opening, the legitimacy of these requests was questioned.
Reactions.
The takedown sparked dialogue among opinion writers. The website's critics have defended their actions based on the fact that the intellectual property owners did not directly authorize the website. Its defenders pointed out that the owners did authorize the loaning out of the ebooks and that ignorance of the terms and conditions would not exempt the authors from them. One commentator pointed out that the takedown was a direct side effect of Digital Rights Management. They pointed out that few people would have complained if people were swapping physical copies of books.

Cadec-online.com

cadec-online.com is a multilingual web application that performs analysis of composite materials especially within the disciplines of aerospace engineering, materials science, naval engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. Users navigate the application through a tree view which structures the component chapters. cadec-online is an engineering cloud application. It uses the LaTeX library to render equations and symbols, then Sprites to optimize the delivery of images to the page.
Chapters.
Micromechanics.
cadec-online.com implements micromechanics for composites reinforced with unidirectional fibers, and random fibers, as well as plain weave, twill, and satin textiles. It predicts lamina elastic moduli, strength values, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), moisture expansion, and other micromechanical properties. The application conducts this analysis through several theoretical models, including:
Lamina analysis.
cadec-online.com can calculate the three-dimensional (3D) stiffness and compliance matrices, the two-dimensional (2D) "reduced" stiffness and compliance matrices, in lamina coordinate system (cs). It is also capable of transforming the composite laminates matrices to any other coordinate system. Lamina types supported by the software include:
Laminate analysis.
The application can carry out laminate analyses including calculation of laminate stiffness, stress, strain, and failure. The software supports intact and damaged laminates (see damage mechanics). For each category, cadec-online.com can calculate the laminate thermal stresses, laminate coefficient of thermal expansion, laminate stiffness and compliance matrices for composite laminates. Also, the application can predict the laminate moduli, which are orthotropic material equivalents for the stiffness of the laminate in both bending and membrane modes of deformation.
Failure analysis.
cadec-online.com predicts failures such as first ply failure (FPF) and last ply failure (LPF) under mechanical, thermal, and moisture loads, as well as insitu effects, using several failure criteria (FC) including:
Damage Mechanics.
Uses discrete damage mechanics (DDM) to predict crack density vs. strain for any symmetric laminate subjected to any membrane state of strain. The results can be exported to Excel for plotting. The state variable describing the damage state of the material is the crack density in each ply. The thermodynamic force is the midsurface strain applied to the laminate. The relevant material properties are the fracture toughnesses in modes I (opening) and II (shear) of the ply. 
Textile reinforced composite analysis.
The application can predict the stiffness and strength of composite materials reinforced with plain weave, twill, and satin textile, also called fabric. The textile lamina is idealized as a transversely isotropic material. The calculated textile lamina can be used as any other lamina in the rest of the application. The calculated properties include: 
Thin walled beam analysis.
The application is able to analyze laminated composite thin walled beams with general cross sections. Beams can be asymmetric and loaded by general combinations of forces in three planes (axial, vertical and horizontal) as well as by three moments (torque and two bending moments). cadec-online.com computes section properties such as the shear center.

The Complete TurtleTrader

The Complete TurtleTrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires (2009) is an international bestseller written by Michael Covel. Covel recounts the story of Wall Street’s Richard Dennis and his disciples, the Turtles.
Background.
In 1994, Covel picked up an issue of "Financial World" and skimmed through an article titled "Wall Street's Top Players." Amongst famous investors like George Soros and Julian Robertson, Covel noticed a name he did not recognize at 25th on the list: R. Jerry Parker, who stated that he was trained as a "Turtle" by Richard Dennis (another name Covel did not recognize). Parker was the only investor in the top hundred advertised as being "trained," and as an investor himself, Covel found this story intriguing.
Synopsis.
Richard Dennis made over $200 million as a trader. After having a debate with his partner, William Eckhardt, about whether trading is learnable or an inborn talent, they proposed an experiment where they would spend two weeks training novices in the science of trading and then give them each $1 million to invest. The inspiration came from a trip Dennis took to a turtle-breeding farm in Singapore, stating, "We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles."
Although each of the 1,000 applicants went through a rigorous application process designed to test their intelligence, ability to manage risk, and mathematical skills, the makeup of the chosen Turtles differed greatly; they included a Czechoslovakian-born blackjack master, a Dungeons and Dragons game designer, an evangelical accountant, a Harvard MBA, a U.S. Air Force pilot, and a former pianist. The Turtles would go on to gross over $150 million in four years.
Release and reception.
"The Complete TurtleTrader" was Covel’s second bestseller and "Stocks, Futures, Options Magazine" named "The Complete TurtleTrader" as one of 2007’s top 10 trading, investing and personal finance books. "Bloomberg" noted that the book was worthy of a spot on any investor’s shelf and "The Hindu" called "The Complete TurtleTrader" “exciting and educative.”

He taught at Hunter College at CUNY and then at Yale, before becoming the founding director of Yale's department of African-American studies, established in 1969. The Yale department's approach to African-American studies, and Bryce-Laporte's as well, centered not just on African-American history in the United States but on African experience in the entire Western hemisphere (the hemispheric studies approach) and what has come to be called the African diaspora. Bryce-Laporte's research centered on the experiences of Black immigrants in the United States.
After Yale, Bryce-Laporte taught at a variety of institutions including College of Staten Island at CUNY, Syracuse University, Catholic University of America, Howard University, University of Pennsylvania, and Colorado College. He was the founding director of Smithsonian Institution's Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies. In 1989 Bryce-Laporte joined the faculty at Colgate University as John D. and Catherine T.

New Zealand Soil Bureau was a division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research specializing in soil-related research and development. Originally formed as the 'soil survey group' of the 'Geological Survey,' they became the 'Soil Survey Division' in 1936 and 'Soil Bureau' in 1945. Established adjacent to Taita College on approximately 90 acres on the Eastern Hills of Lower Hutt north of Wellington, the foyer featured a large mural by Ernest Mervyn Taylor depicting cloaked figure using a kō (Māori digging stick). Soil Bureau competed nation-wide soil surveys of New Zealand. 
The impetus for forming a separate unit related to soil science was work in the 1930s by L. I. Grange and N. H. Taylor which showed a correspondence between soil type and bush sickness in cattle, which led to the discovery that ash-based soils in the central North Island were Cobalt deficient and that cobalt-enriched salt licks could open up tens of thousands of acres to dairy farming.
Soil Bureau was renamed as DSIR Land Resources in 1990 and then reformed into Landcare Research in 1992 by the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992, but the name remains protected under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981

Banks DIH

Banks DIH Ltd. is a publicly traded food and beverage in Guyana that can trace its origins back to 1840.
It is one of the leading local manufacturers.
History.
The company originates from a rum business founded in the 1840s by Jose Gomes D'Aguiar, which expanded into a chain of liquor stores.
The business grew in 1885 with the addition of a Cocoa and Chocolate Factory and a Schooner Shipping Agency.
In 1896 the four sons of the founder formed the D'Aguiar Bros partnership, and bought the Demerara Ice House (DIH).
The building, which contained a hotel, soft drink plant and liquor bars, got its name from holding ice imported by schooner from Canada. 
The company got into difficulty, and in 1934, the year in which Peter D'Aguiar took over DIH from his father, the last of the four sons, the business was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Peter D'Aguiar placed greater emphasis on the core business of manufacturing soft drinks and rum, although the company retained retail outlets, bars and the hotel.
The financial position gradually improved.
In 1942 the company obtained the first Pepsi-Cola franchise in South America, and during the 1950s rum production also expanded.
In 1955. Peter D'Aguiar promoted the publicly owned Banks Breweries Ltd.
In 1966 D'Aguiar Bros. (D.I.H.) was floated as a public company, and it was merged with Banks Breweries in 1969 to form the present Banks DIH Ltd.
Banks DIH was the first company to float shares publicly in Guyana.
For a long time the capital market was small, only reaching US$10 in 1992. 
As of October 1993, Banks DIH had just 8,346 shareholders.
Peter D'Aguiar also floated Banks Barbados in the 1960s, but the two companies soon separated, each marketing their own Banks Beer.
Both companies saw demand from abroad for their products, but ran into brand ownership problems and other difficulties.
In 2005 the two companies decided to market jointly, each buying shares in the other.
It was decided to produce the beer in Barbados, including the Banks DIH Shandy range.
The first shipment to the United States was made in 2008.
Current operations.
The company today produces soft drinks, alcoholic beverages and food products, operates bars and restaurants, and since 1998 has owned a controlling share in Citizens Bank Inc.
The company has branches and agents throughout the country and owns a large fleet of delivery vehicles.
Products are exported to various Caribbean countries. 
In collaboration with Banks Holdings Ltd. (BHL Group) of Barbados, Banks Beer is exported to Canada and the United States.
The BHL Group owns 20% of Banks DIH Limited and also owns 100% of Banks Barbados Brewery as well as shares of other companies in the Caribbean.
Banks DIH also imports and distributes whiskey, vodka and other products from abroad.
In 2011 the Banks DIH Group reported a group pre-tax profit of G$4.046B, a 31% increase over the previous year.
The results were announced in January 2012 at the 56th Annual General Meeting, held at the Banks DIH Thirst Park in Georgetown.
More than 1,000 shareholders attended the meeting.
Recent events.
In October 2010 a boat carrying drinks and other products from the Banks DIH company to the Essequibo Coast developed leaks and had to be grounded on the Stewartville foreshore. Mud had got into the pump, which would not start, and the engine room flooded. After the tide receded, the boat leaned to one side. Some boxes fell off and were taken away by Stewartville residents.
That night, dozens of people climbed onto the boat, taking soft drinks and alcoholic drinks, as well as other products such as biscuits and bottled water. The looting was thorough, including draining the fuel from the boat's tanks. Some started drinking while they were looting.

<doc id="36688334" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36688334" title="Poverty gap index">
Poverty gap index

The poverty gap index is a measure of the intensity of poverty. It is defined as the average poverty gap in the population as a proportion of the poverty line.
The poverty gap index is an improvement over the poverty measure headcount ratio which simply counts all the people below a poverty line, in a given population, and considers them equally poor. Poverty gap index estimates the depth of poverty by considering how far, on the average, the poor are from that poverty line.
Definition.
The poverty gap index, sometimes referred to as poverty gap ratio or PG index, is defined as average of the ratio of the poverty gap to the poverty line. It is expressed as a percentage of the poverty line for a country or region.
Significance.
The most common method of measuring and reporting poverty is the headcount ratio, given as the percentage of population that is below the poverty line. For example, "The New York Times" in July 2012 reported the poverty headcount ratio as 11.1% of American population in 1973, 15.2% in 1983 and 11.3% in year 2000. One of the undesirable features of the headcount ratio is that it ignores the depth of poverty; if the poor become poorer, the headcount index does not change.
Poverty gap index provides a clearer perspective on the depth of poverty. It enables poverty comparisons. It also helps provide an overall assessment of a region's progress in poverty alleviation and the evaluation of specific public policies or private initiatives.
Calculation.
The poverty gap index (PGI) is calculated as,
or
where formula_3 is the total population, formula_4 is the total population of poor who are living at or below the poverty line, formula_5 is the poverty line, and formula_6 is the income of the poor individual formula_7. In this calculation, individuals whose income is above the poverty line have a gap of zero.
By definition, the poverty gap index is a percentage between 0 and 100%. Sometimes it is reported as a fraction, between 0 and 1. A theoretical value of zero implies that no one in the population is below the poverty line. A theoretical value of 100% implies that everyone in the population has zero income. In some literature, poverty gap index is reported as formula_8 while the headcount ratio is reported as formula_9.
Features.
The poverty gap index can be interpreted as the average percentage shortfall in income for the population, from the poverty line.
If you multiply a country's poverty gap index by both the poverty line and the total number of individuals in the country you get the total amount of money needed to bring the poor in the population out of extreme poverty and up to the poverty line, assuming perfect targeting of transfers. For example, suppose a country has 10 million individuals, a poverty line of $500 per year and a poverty gap index of 5%. Then an average increase of $25 per individual per year would eliminate extreme poverty. Note that $25 is 5% of the poverty index. The total increase needed to elimiante poverty is US$250 million -- $25 multiplied by 10 million individuals.
The poverty gap index is an important measure beyond the commonly used headcount ratio. Two regions may have the similar headcount ratio, but distinctly different poverty gap indexes. A higher poverty gap index means that poverty is more severe.
The poverty gap index is additive. In other words, the index can be used as an aggregate poverty measure, as well as decomposed for various sub-groups of the population, such as by region, employment sector, education level, gender, age or ethnic group.
Limitations.
Poverty gap index ignores the effect of inequality between the poor. It does not capture differences in the severity of poverty amongst the poor. As a theoretical example, consider two small neighborhoods where just two households each are below the official poverty line of US$ 500 income per year. In one case, household 1 has an income of US$100 per year and household 2 has an income of US$300 per year. In second case, the two households both have annual income of US$200 per year. The poverty gap index for both cases is same (60%), even though the first case has one household, with US$100 per year income, experiencing a more severe state of poverty. Scholars, therefore, consider poverty gap index as a moderate but incomplete improvement over poverty headcount ratio.
Scholars such as Sen suggest poverty gap index offers quantitative improvement over simply counting the poor below the poverty line, but remains limited at the qualitative level. Focusing on precisely measuring income gap diverts the attention from qualitative aspects such as capabilities, skills and personal resources that may sustainably eradicate poverty. A better measure would focus on capabilities and consequent consumption side of impoverished households. These suggestions were initially controversial, and have over time inspired scholars to propose numerous refinements.
Related measures.
The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke metric is the general form of the PGI. The formula_10 formula raises the summands to the power alpha, so that FGT0 is the headcount index, FGT1 the PGI and FGT2 the squared PGI. 
Squared poverty gap index, also known poverty severity index or formula_11, is related to poverty gap index. It is calculated by averaging the square of the poverty gap ratio. By squaring each poverty gap data, the measure puts more weight the further a poor person's observed income falls below the poverty line. The squared poverty gap index is one form of a weighted sum of poverty gaps, with the weight proportionate to the poverty gap.
Sen index, sometimes referred to formula_12, is related to poverty gap index (PGI). It is calculated as follows:
where, formula_14 is the headcount ratio and formula_15 is the income Gini coefficient of only the people below the poverty line.
Watts index, sometimes referred to formula_16, is related to poverty gap index (PGI). It is calculated as follows:
The terms used to calculate formula_16 are same as in poverty gap index (see the calculation section in this article).
Poverty gap index by country.

Saint Eigen

Saint Eigen, Eurgen, Eurgain or Eurgan was the legendary, and possibly historical first female Christian saint. Her name has doubtfully been linked to two Welsh churches and is found in manuscripts from the collection of Iolo Morganwg making historical evidence of her existence dubious and limited.
Eigen is noted as the first female saint and daughter of Caratacus in the History of Dunraven Manuscript, a manuscript giving the genealogy of Taliesin from the collection of Thomas Hopkin of Coychurch, one from the Havod Uchtryd collection and in an extract he claimed to have copied from the Long Book of Thomas Truman. This reference can also be found in the family records of Iestyn ab Gwrgant, where it is said of her; ""She lived in the close of the first century, and was married to Sarllog, who was a lord of Caer Sarllog, or the present Old Sarum"". In this manuscript, Eigen is said to have returned from Rome with Caratacus with Saint Cyllin and Saint Ilid and formed a religious college of twelve named "Cor Eurgain" (the choir of Eurgain), suggesting the early entry of Christianity into Britain; ""the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain"". Attempts have also been made to identify Eigen with the Claudia mentioned by Saint Paul in the Second Epistle to Timothy, however evidence for this is largely coincidental. Some authors also claim she was called Gladys on the suggestion that this was a Welsh word for princess.
Eigen is also discussed as the first female saint in the works of Rice Rees, Jane Williams, Sabine Baring-Gould and John Williams (Ab Ithel).
In the annals of Tacitus, a daughter of Caratacus is mentioned appearing in front of the Roman Senate and Emperor Claudius in approximately 53 CE. Caratacus' daughter is never named in the record of Tacitus and she is not mentioned with her mother, father and uncles as having been given a pardon from the brutality of a Roman execution by the Emperor.
Eigen features in a cantata by Edward Elgar in 1897-8 devoted to the defeat and capture of the king by the Romans. It was first performed at the Leeds choral festival in 1898. Her name in the Cantana has variously been claimed to be both historical and derived from a neighbour of Elgar's in Malvern called Eigen Stone. Eigen, spelt as Eigon is also the subject of a modern, time-slip novel by Barbara Erskine called The Warrior's Princess, published in 2008. 
The parish church of Llanigon, Wales is dedicated to "Saint Eigon", but this almost certainly refers to Eigion, brother of St Cynidr, to whom the parish church in neighbouring Glasbury was dedicated.
Another Welsh church in Northop (Welsh: Llaneurgain), Flintshire, is dedicated to "Saint Eurgain", said to have been the daughter of Prince Maelgwn Gwynedd and niece of St. Asaph. She is said to have lived in Flintshire in the 6th century CE and has a feast day on 30 June. There is evidence that the church of St Eurgain and St Peter has existed since the 6th century.

Anarchy at Samarra

The term "Anarchy at Samarra" refers to the period 861–870 in the history of the Abbasid Caliphate, which was marked by extreme internal instability and the violent succession of four caliphs, who became puppets in the hands of powerful rival military groups. The term derives from the then capital and seat of the caliphal court, Samarra. The "anarchy" began in 861, with the murder of Caliph al-Mutawakkil by his Turkish guards. His successor, al-Muntasir, ruled for six months before his death, possibly poisoned by the Turkish military chiefs. He was succeeded by al-Musta'in. Divisions within the Turkish military leadership enabled Musta'in to flee to Baghdad in 865 with the support of some Turkish chiefs (Bugha the Younger and Wasif) and the Tahirids, but the rest of the Turkish army chose a new caliph in the person of al-Mu'tazz and besieged Baghdad, forcing the city's capitulation in 866. Musta'in was exiled and executed. Mu'tazz was able and energetic, and tried to control the military chiefs and exclude the military from civil administration. His policies were resisted, and in July 869 he too was deposed and killed. His successor, al-Muhtadi, also tried to reaffirm the Caliph's authority, but he too was killed in June 870. With Muhtadi's death and the ascension of al-Mu'tamid, the Turkish faction around Musa ibn Bugha, closely associated with Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq, became dominant in the caliphal court, ending the "anarchy". Although the Abbasid Caliphate was able to stage a modest recovery in the following decades, the troubles of the "Anarchy at Samarra" inflicted great and lasting damage on the structures and prestige of the Abbasid central government, encouraging and facilitating secessionist and rebellious tendencies in the Caliphate's provinces.

Interior with Portraits

Interior with Portraits is an 1865 genre scene painted by American artist Thomas Le Clear. The painting features two children, James and Parnell Sidway, posing for a photograph in an artist's studio. The painting was commissioned by the subjects' older brother, Franklin Sidway. Parnell died of illness as an adolescent; James, a volunteer firefighter, died in a hotel fire at the age of 26, shortly before the painting was commissioned.
Both children were painted posthumously from family daguerreotypes. Some painters of the time regarded photography with suspicion, and refusing to use photographs as references for portraits. The painting is filled with references to this tension. The children are surrounded by painted portraits, and the photographer's back is to the viewer and his face is obscured. The girl appears to be supporting the boy and holding him still, as might have been necessary when posing a child for an early photograph due to the long exposure time. A dog is depicting just entering the studio, another acknowledgement of early photography's limitation to still subjects.

Hua Tou

Hua Tou (話頭, Korean: "hwadu", Japanese: "wato") is a form of Buddhist meditation common in the teachings of Chinese Chán and Korean Seon. "Hua Tou" can be translated as 'word head', 'head of speech' or 'point beyond which speech exhausts itself'. A "Hua Tou" can be a short phrase that is used as a subject of meditation to focus the mind.
Origins.
"Hua Tou" are based on the encounter-dialogues and koans of the interactions between past masters and students, but are shorter phrases than koans. The Hua Tou method was invented by the Chinese Zen master Dahui Zonggao (1089 – 1163) who was a member of the Linji school. Dahui was interested in teaching the lay community, particularly the educated Chinese scholar-officials. Support of those "literati" was essential for the survival of the individual lineages, since appointments as abbot of public monasteries were determined by this ruling class. Providing accessible methods of training for layman was a mean to gather this necessary support. "Hua Tou" practice does not use regular interviews and question and answer sessions between student and teacher (dokusan). According to Dahui, "Hua Tou" is also a form of meditation that "can be carried out by laymen in the midst of their daily activities."
Dahui was also against the intellectualism and literary commentary that had begun to enter into Koan practice with the Blue Cliff Record of his master Yuan-wu. In fact, Dahui burned his copy of the Blue Cliff Record.
Formal Hua Tou practice was promoted in Korea by Seon master Chinul. He was extremely successful in popularizing Hua Tou. According to Robert Buswell: 
Practice.
Dahui emphasised that initial insight is essential for Zen-training. Dahui stressed that it was possible for laymen to achieve enlightenment through this practice. He often gave instructions through letters to his pupils.
Chinul described Hwadu (Hua Tou) in his treatise "Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record" () as a practice that leads to the very limits of speech and acts as a purification device. Because the practice leads students beyond conceptual understanding, Chinul considered an advanced practice for those of particular talent, or those who had already advanced through other practices first.
To practice "Hua Tou", one concentrates on the phrase, initially repeating it silently with a questioning and open mind and then thinking about "Who" or "What" is generating the Hua Tou, this brings about "Great Doubt". Hua Tou can be practiced during sitting meditation, after the mind has been calmed through an initial period of breath meditation. 
Hsu Yun said of practicing Hua Tou: 
According to Chan master Sheng Yen, there are three stages of Hua Tou practice: reciting the Hua Tou, asking the Hua Tou and investigating the Hua Tou. Through these stages it is important not to try to answer the Hua Tou intellectually, but to persistently ask the question mindfully with genuine interest and sincere desire to know. It is through this constant practice that great doubt and then insight arises.

USCGC Point Chico (WPB-82339)

USCGC "Point Chico" (WPB-82339) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1962 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as "WPB-82339" when commissioned and acquired the name "Point Chico" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .
Construction and design details.
"Point Chico" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Chico" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.
History.
After commissioning, "Point Chico" was stationed at Sausalito, California, from 1963 to 1965 where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. On 14 June 1965 she escorted the damaged FV "Salmon Queen" from eighteen miles southwest of Point Bonita, California to Sausalito. In 1966 her homeport was shifted to Benicia, California where she helped fight a barge fire in San Francisco harbor on 26 September 1966.
In 1974 "Point Chico" was transferred to Yerba Buena Island. She and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for her part in fighting a fire that engulfed Pier 37 at the Port of San Francisco's Embarcadero and saving the historic ferry boat "San Leandro". She received a second unit commendation for rescue and relief operations during flooding of the Noyo River basin in October 1977. On 7 April 1980 she towed the disabled tanker "Austin" into the wind 35 miles northwest of Morro Bay, buying time for engineers working on damaged wiring as the tanker drifted toward the Piedras Blancas. 
After 4 August 1980 "Point Chico" was stationed at Bodega Bay, California. On 9 September 1983, she towed the disabled pleasure craft "Sabra" into San Francisco. On 16 September, she towed the disabled FV "Huyne Long" from off Farallon Island to San Francisco. On 8 November she rescued two divers off Mendocino, California.
"Point Chico" received her third unit commendation for participation in the Olympic Security Task Force during the 1984 Summer Olympics held at Los Angeles, California from 7 July to 15 August 1984. She was awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for search and rescue and law enforcement operations from 1 January to 9 April 1985. when her crew seized the FV "Oregon Beaver" with of marijuana on board. On 7 June 1985, "Point Chico" was adopted as the official Coast Guard cutter of the City of Sacramento. 
"Point Chico" was decommissioned 24 June 2001 and transferred to Costa Rica.

Divas in Distress

Divas in Distress is a 2012 Hong Kong television drama produced by TVB. Written by Chan Kam-ling and produced by Poon Ka-tak, "Divas in Distress" is a sister production of the time traveling comedy, "A Chip Off the Old Block".
Plot.
In the past (approximately the 50s-60s) Fung Hun Man (Chung King-fai) was a famous writer, producer, and actor in the early days of Hong Kong cinema. During his youth, he adopted two girls and had them become sisters-in-training: Sheung Ying Hung (Liza Wang) and Miu Sing Ho (Gigi Wong). Both girls were groomed into the path of becoming actresses and the two maintained a lifetime rivalry over each other's successes both on and off the stage. At the height of their careers, Miu Sing Ho suffered a severe auto accident that affected her ability to walk. Due to her disability, she was unable to continue acting and was forced to retire; she was looked over and Sheung Ying Hung took her place, rose to the top of stardom, and became very successful. Distraught, angry, and unable to accept her fate, Miu Sing Ho transferred much of her frustrations over her "sister", Sheung Ying Hung, and blamed her for taking away her success and fame. 
In between this time and unknown to the girls, their master, Fung Hun Man, developed a secret romantic relationship with a budding actress, Ching Yeuk Chan (Mimi Choo). While they kept their relationship a secret, Ching Yeuk Chan steadily grew tired of their secret relationship. One day, Ching Yeuk Chan discovered she was pregnant, but after overhearing the conservative and non-supportive chatter of her lover amongst other men, she realized he couldn't be relied on and decided to run off with a rich man. Before running off, she gave birth to a son, So Kei (Koo Ming Wah), and gave away the boy to Sheung Ying Hung's lifetime personal assistant, Deneuve So Lo Wah (So Yan Chi), and So Kei would end up growing up under Sheung Ying Hung's family for the latter of their lives and Vincent’s best friend.
Time had passed, but their rivalry continued even after getting married and having children. Sheung Ying Hung had two kids, Chak Ding Yum (older sister) and Vincent Chak Yau Sing (Him Law); her husband is not known. Sheung Ying Hung's husband went missing on a trip and was presumed dead after being missing for many years; she raised her kids along with So Kei (who grew up to be very metro-sexual, straight, but thought to be gay by many) for most of their lives. Miu Sing Ho eventually married a house renovator, Chong Kan Sau (Henry Lee) and had a son, Chong Ka Long, aka "Yi Long San", (Chin Kar-lok). Their worlds would collide again when Chak Ding Yum and Yi Long San (both reporters) would become romantically involved. 
Sheung Ying Hung didn't respect Yi Long San: she saw him as a poor match for her daughter, but the couple refused to listen and decided to marry with or without Sheung Ying Hung's permission. Out of pride, Sheung Ying Hung refused to attend the couple's marriage and ignored the couple until Ding Yum died. Ding Yum had a heart condition that she kept from everyone. She wanted to grant Yi Long San's wish of having a child together, which cost her life. Sheung Ying Hung would blame Yi Long San for Dim Yum's death for many years to come, but the one redeeming thing they could salvage out of this tragedy was the child, Michel Chong Man Sai (Tong Chi Fai). 
The story actually begins with both sides of the family actively competing for custody over Michel. On top of their long term rivalry, Sheung Ying Hung and Miu Sing Ho actively fight for the attention and future of their mutual grandson. Yi Long San is often trapped in the middle: he is often subjected to great difficulties in maintaining peace between both his mother and mother-in-law as well as maintaining a relationship with his son without the intervention of the overbearing Sheung Ying Hung. In between the bickering and the health scares with Michel (often causing Sheung Ying Hung to tighten her control over Michel), two situations began to develop: the budding romances between Hannah (Eliza Sam) and Yi Long San and between Kwai Yi Hei and Vincent. 
Vincent is a well-established designer and CEO of his own company because of the backing of his mother. When he assigns Kwai Yi Hei (Yi Long San's cousin, played by Mandy Wong) to renovate one of his open office areas, he is disgusted by her smell and tomboyish looks, but things that later change when he falls in love with her abilities. Kwai Yi Hei is also a talented spray paint artist and Vincent unknowingly falls in love with the Banksy-style HK art that she did while he searches for meaningful art. Only after learning the truth that Kwai Yi Hei is the actual artist does he begin to develop strong feelings for her and begin using strong-arm tactics to extend the length of the renovation project in order to spend more time with her. After a series of fights with Vincent, So Kei quietly explains to Kwai Yi Hei that Vincent cares about her and that he has risked his health (as he is a sensitive asthmatic) and career for the sake of her. Eventually, the two finally recognize each other's feelings and begin secretly seeing each other, but not without the ire of Vincent's mother.
Sheung Ying Hung self-righteously believes that Kwai Yi Hei is a lower-class person who is not worthy of Vincent; she also believes Hannah isn't worthy of Yi Long San as a replacement for Ding Sum. Because of Sheung Ying Hung’s disapproval of both relationships, this creates a rift in the pair’s own relationship. Yi Long San maintains a platonic relationship, but there are obvious signs he cares for Hannah and Kwai Yi Hei constantly shows hesitation in moving their relationship forward. 
Meanwhile, Yi Long San (a news reporter and cameraman) had a rough encounter with Hannah (daughter of Ching Yeuk Chan and So Kei's younger half-sister). Although Hannah is heir to a vast fortune, she wishes to be a reporter and starts an investigation about Sheung Ying Hung and Miu Sing Ho, wanting to uncover the dark secrets of the duo in their glory days and also digs up gossip to attract ratings. However, her quest nearly accidentally costs the life of Michel and Hannah eventually drops the investigation. However, she ends up working together with Yi Long San as a reporter-cameraman duo and starts to get closer. As the two get closer, Sheung Ying Hung took notice of Yi Long San's potential love interest and even though she always claimed he was never worthy of her daughter, she made him swear that he would be eternally loyal to her dead daughter. However, even though he maintains a platonic and professional relationship with Hannah, Yi Long San's actions prove he cares for Hannah more than just a friend.
Ultimately, this causes pain and suffering for everyone and Sheung Ying Hung eventually learned by eavesdropping that she is not liked for her past decisions, including the fact that her daughter might have lived if she was not so elitist and so controlling over her decisions. Feeling hurt and insulted, she makes an excuse to go off on a trip, but secretly stays at a Buddhist monastery to sort things out; in combination of learning the wisdom from the Buddhist monks and finally attaining self-awareness of the negative consequences of her actions, she suffers from great stress both mentally and physically and becomes physically and mentally ill. By chance, Kwai Yi Hei is also at the monastery, doing probation work after a mishap with the law. Seeing how Vincent’s mother was suffering, she contacts Vincent in the hope that he will take Sheung Ying Hung home. However, Vincent’s mother is being stubborn over the matter and he lets her off to her own devices until she ended up in the hospital and eventually returned home.
While this is happening, Vincent takes the chance to try to win Kwai Yi Hei’s heart, but she remains distant. After getting in trouble with the probationary officer for submitting an improper journal entry, Vincent discovered Kwai Yi Hei has a disability affecting her literacy; she relies on her personal “picture code” system to convey her thoughts on paper. To understand more, Vincent looks for Kwai Yi Hei’s uncle for answers and learns that Kwai Yi Hei used to be very rebellious and dated a troublesome boyfriend. When he committed a crime, he convinced Kwai Yi Hei to take the fall and promised to marry her after she’s released; she believed in her boyfriend and heartedly agreed to take the fall. Sadly, she ultimately found out she was tricked as her boyfriend broke up with her and found someone else while she was in jail. 
The sobering experience straightened her out as a person, but due to a combination of her low self-esteem and poor literacy skills, she developed a fear of commitment as she feels that she will eventually be abandoned due to her problems. However, Vincent vows to prove his loyalty and devotion to her and eventually wins her heart again. After helping her win a trip to Japan in a lottery, he strong-arms his way to make sure he and Kwai Yi Hei will be on the same trip. On this trip Vincent proposes to her; she at first refuses, but Vincent eventually wins her acceptance.
Meanwhile, Ching Yeuk Chan has returned to Hong Kong to visit Hannah. However, her sudden return makes Deneuve nervous. Deneuve thinks Ching Yeuk Chan had come back for So Kei, but Ching Yeuk Chan makes it clear she returned to visit her daughter, not her long lost son. However, So Kei and Ching Yeuk Chan have already encountered each without knowledge of their actual relationship and grow close. So Kei eventually learns of his true parentage and the two develop a friendly relationship. However, Ching Yeuk Chan still holds a grudge against Fung Hun Man and kept both him and her son out of the loop of each other’s identities.
Fung Hun Man discovers Ching Yeuk Chan’s return. Both miss each other, but due to past misunderstandings relating to their separation, there is both love and anger on both sides. It is only later when they heatedly argue about each other’s past actions that it is revealed she had their child. Eventually, Fung Hun Man figures out it was So Kei and the three temporarily accept each other, until So Kei develops a relationship with Yi Long San’s boss, a ruthless tomboy chief editor. This forms a rift as Fung Hun Man feels that it is shameful for his son to love a “man”, but So Kei eventually learns to understand his father and they maintain a mutually respectful relationship since.
Through this, Hannah learns about So Kei and their relationship. While she was quick to accept So Kei, she has difficulty accepting her mother was a gold digger who married for financial security. Although Ching Yeuk Chan admits she married for money first, she explained she learned to love her husband. Although she becomes cold towards her mother, Hannah eventually learns to forgive her. However, Hannah’s greatest challenge is with Yi Long San.
Yi Long San maintained a weak platonic relationship with Hannah. After Hannah gets into a car accident, Yi Long San admits at his wife’s grave that he has been unfaithful as he has feelings for Hannah. After Hannah recovers, she pretends to have lost her memories and even develops an aggressive personality to make it easier for Yi Long San to realize it’s better to move away. However, Yi Long San realizes that they care for each other, but Hannah points out he’s unwilling to move on due to his dead wife. The final straw for Hannah is when Yi Long San removes her audio cord during a live report. She felt Yi Long San is not supportive and constantly puts her aside when necessary. Tired of this repetitive cycle, she decides to quit the job and transfer elsewhere as the situation saddens her too much.
In the end of the story, everything ends at a happy climax. Vincent was hiding the fact that Kwai Yi Hei’s job (use of paints, chemicals, and plasters that ends up on her clothes) has made his health worse and she only found out later through So Kei. After hearing from So Kei that because of her work had caused Vincent health to decline, Hei decided to retire from carpentry and be a housewife for the sake of their love, but Vincent tried to leave their engagement because he doesn't want Hei to be sad in the future by insulting her and making her wearing a dress and shoes to the award ceremony. So Kei then arrived to Hei's uncle shop and tells Hei that vincent has gone to the airport, which makes Hei understand that Vincent done all these stuff to make her happy, so she doesn't have to give up her job as a construction worker. Then, Yi Long San took Hei to stop Vincent from going to the airport. Hei then ask Vincent why he always make his own decision and why she cant do something for him. Vincent tells Hei that saying she is stupid is right because she doesn't understand what make him love Hei so much. Vincent loves Hei the way she is because her hand is rough, her clothing are so dirty, and she is always wearing that dirty hat and how she is so stubborn. Vincent tells Hei that if she doesn't have these quailties she would just me a regular housewife and whats the point of marrying her. Hei then explains to Vincent that she has no choice because of his health even through normal contact he already this sick if she srtill work as a construction worker she is scared that he will be very sick one day. Also she tells Vincent that he is breaking his promise because he promised her that he will take her to the tower in Japan andwillhelp her write her name. Vincent then tells Hei that of he not her life its not too much of a problem because when he ask her to marry her she said she has to wait after Doomsday and that he is the one that make Hei to be with him. So, Vincent suggests that they should just break up. As Vincent walks to his car Hei goes to the front and hugs him and put his arm on her waist. Vincent lets go every time and the third time that Hei puts his hands on her waist and he holds on tight because he knows that both Hei and him don't want to lose each other because they still love each other. Both of them are happy, and Vincent kisses Hei on the forehead and they hugged each other again. Hannah’s absence has made Yi Long San realized how much he misses her and after she randomly returned for a news report, covering the 2012 Apocalypse, Yi Long San made it clear he wants to be with her and the two became a cameraman-reporter couple. So Kei and Yi Long San’s boss remains together, happily dancing and enjoying their reverse-gender role relationship. Vincent and Hei are finally engaged and Vincent took her to see pretty skyscrapers that lights up in Hong Kong in the nighttime. Fung Hun Man and Ching Yeuk Chan reunited as a couple after all these years and his lifelong rivaling students found mutual peace with Michel. Sheung Ying Hung realized the error of her ways and no longer opposed Vincent’s relationship with Kwai Yi Hei as she feared she might lose her only son like how she lost her daughter; everyone found peace and balance with each other.

American Elements

American Elements is a global manufacturer and distributor of the elements on the periodic table with a 10,000 page online compendium of information on the properties and uses of the elements. The company's headquarters and educational programs are based in Los Angeles, California. Its research and production facilities are located in Salt Lake City, Utah; Monterrey, Mexico; Baotou, China; and Manchester, UK.
History.
American Elements began as a toll chemical manufacturer and refiner serving U.S. mining companies by producing metal based chemicals from their deposits. In 1998, its two largest customers, the Unocal/Molycorp rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California and the Rhodia rare earth refinery in Freeport, Texas closed, ending domestic U.S. rare earth production. In response, the company established mining joint ventures in Inner Mongolia, China and in 1999 became one of the first post cold war companies to export rare earth metals from China to the U.S. and Europe.
Over the following decade the company expanded operations to include production of all elements on the periodic table and established educational programs, scholarships and scientific conferences to educate the public on the properties and applications of the elements. In 2001, it founded its website which is a compendium of information on the periodic table, the elements and the uses of advanced materials.
Product Lines.
The advanced materials manufactured by the company include:
Discoveries.
The company has made several new discoveries in materials science. These include:
Educational Programs.
In 2006, the company established the not-for-profit American Elements Academics & Periodicals Department. The department provides information on (1) the ways elemental advanced materials are used, (2) global issues effecting the mining and production of the elements such as Sino-American relations, and (3) ways to improve the teaching of science at all grade levels. Since its founding, the department has sponsored approximately 320 conferences on materials science, the elements, mining, and physics. In 2011, it co-sponsored, along with the National Science Foundation, a four-part PBS Nova television series on materials science called "Making Stuff". The department promotes improved transparency in global metal markets. It believes future global rare earth prices tend to move upward or downward in reaction to China’s then projected GDP (gross domestic product). The company publishes an annual Endangered Elements List naming that year's top 5 elements that due their geopolitical scarcity pose a threat to the future of American high technology manufacturing.
