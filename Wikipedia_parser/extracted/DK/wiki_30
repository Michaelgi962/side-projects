Milesian tale

The Milesian tale (Μιλησιακά, "Milisiaka" in Greek; in Latin "fabula milesiaca", or "Milesiae fabula") originates in ancient Greek and Roman literature. According to most authorities, it is a short story, fable, or folktale featuring love and adventure, usually being erotic and titillating. M. C. Howatson, in "The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature" (1989), voices the traditional view that it is the source "of such medieval collections of tales as the "Gesta Romanorum", the "Decameron" of Boccaccio, and the "Heptameron" of Marguerite of Navarre." 
But Gottskálk Jensson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, offers a dissenting view or corrective, arguing that the original Milesian tale was 
This resulted in "a complicated narrative fabric: a travelogue carried by a main narrator with numerous subordinate tales carried by subordinate narrative voices." The best complete example of this would be Apuleius' "The Golden Ass", a Roman novel written in the 2nd century of the Common Era. Apuleius introduces his novel with the words "At ego tibi sermone isto Milesio varias fabulas conseram" ("But let me join together different stories in that Milesian style") [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sjh/documents/prologueOUPvol.doc], which suggests that it isn't each story that is a Milesian tale but rather the entire joined-together collection. The idea of the Milesian tale also served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in Petronius' "Satyricon". 
In any case, the name "Milesian tale" originates from the "Milisiaka" of Aristides of Miletus (; fl. 2nd century BCE), who was a writer of shameless and amusing tales with some salacious content and unexpected plot twists. Aristides set his tales in Miletus, which had a reputation for a luxurious, easy-going lifestyle, akin to that of Sybaris in Magna Graecia; there is no reason to think that he was in any sense "of" Miletus himself. 
Later, in the 1st century BCE, the serious-minded historian Lucius Cornelius Sisenna for an intellectual relaxation translated Aristides into Latin under the title "Milesiae fabulae" ("Milesian Fables"), and the term "Milesian tale" gained currency in the ancient world. Milesian tales gained a reputation for ribaldry: Ovid, in "Tristia", contrasts the boldness of Aristides and others with his own "Ars Amatoria", for which he was punished by exile. In the dialogue on the kinds of love, "Erotes", Lucian of Samosata—if in fact he was the author—praised Aristides in passing, saying that after a day of listening to erotic stories he felt like Aristides, "that enchanting spinner of bawdy yarns." This suggests that the lost "Milisiaka" had for its framing device Aristides himself, retelling what he had been hearing of the goings-on at Miletus.
Plutarch, in his "Life of Crassus", tells us that after the defeat of Carrhae in 53 BCE, some Milesian fables were found in the baggage of the Parthians' Roman prisoners.
Though the idea of the Milesian tale served as a model for the episodic narratives strung together in Petronius' "Satyricon" and "The Golden Ass" of Lucius Apuleius (2nd century CE), neither Aristides' Greek text nor the Latin translation survived the centuries of literate disapproval of such disgraceful secular hijinks, written with verve and panache, essential elements of the style. The lengthiest survivor from this literature is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, found in Apuleius, which Sir Richard Burton observed, "makes us deeply regret the disappearance of the others."
Aristidean saucy and disreputable heroes and spicy, fast-paced anecdote resurfaced in the medieval "fabliaux". Chaucer's "The Miller's Tale" is in Aristides' tradition, as are some of the saltier tales in Boccaccio's "Decameron" or the "Heptameron" of Margaret of Angoulême.

Bill Leavy

Bill Leavy (pronounced LEE-vee) is an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) since 1995, wearing uniform number 127, and is a retired San Jose, California police officer and firefighter, serving for 27 years. As of the 2006 NFL season, Leavy has been assigned to nine playoff games and two Super Bowls in his NFL officiating career. He was selected as a back judge on the Super Bowl XXXIV officiating crew in 2000 and most recently headed up the Super Bowl XL officiating crew as referee in 2006. 
Personal.
Early years.
Leavy is a 1965 graduate of Santa Barbara High School in Santa Barbara, California and a 1970 graduate of San Jose State University in San Jose, California where he earned a degree in law enforcement. Just before earning his degree, he joined the San Jose Police Department in September 1969. During his high school and college years, Leavy's athletic interests included swimming and football.
As a member of the San Jose Police Athletic League (PAL), he was introduced to football officiating by a fellow PAL officer, who was a high school football official. Between the 1970s and 1984, Leavy worked several all-star, playoff, championship games at the high school and junior college levels.
Family.
Bill lives in San Jose, California.
Officiating career.
Early years.
Leavy joined the Big West Conference, a Division I college conference, in 1984. During his 11 seasons in Division I football, he worked four college bowl games (Independence, Freedom, California and Las Vegas).
NFL career.
In December 1994, Leavy received a call from then NFL Supervisor of Officials, Jerry Seeman, that he was selected as one of 12 finalists for open positions beginning with the 1995 NFL season. On March 27, 1995, Leavy was hired by the league as a field judge. Leavy's first game was a pre-season matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills at Texas Stadium. For seven seasons, Leavy worked as a field judge and later as a back judge, when the league swapped position names in 1998, before being promoted to referee for the 2001 NFL season. This opportunity at the referee position became available as a result of Phil Luckett returning to his original back judge position due to the time commitment that is involved to be a successful crew chief. 
Outside of the NFL, Leavy was hired in 1998 as the "Coordinator of Football Officials" for the Western Athletic Conference and was appointed "Coordinator of Football Officials" for the Mountain West Conference in 1999.
Leavy's officiating crew for the 2013 NFL season consists of umpire Ruben Fowler, head linesman John McGrath, line judge Mark Perlman, field judge Jimmy Buchanan, side judge Keith Parham, and back judge Keith Ferguson.
Memorable games.
Super Bowl XL.
Leavy's first Super Bowl as referee did not go unnoticed by the media and fans as several controversial calls were made throughout the game. Seattle coach, Mike Holmgren, at a team rally on February 6 at Qwest Field, criticized the officials as he felt they assisted the Pittsburgh Steelers in winning the Super Bowl saying, "We knew it was going to be tough going against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." The NFL did not fine Holmgren for the remarks.
In response to the criticisms leveled at the officials, the NFL, just two days after the game, released a statement defending the officials' performance. "The game was properly officiated, including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement.
Mike Pereira, Supervisor of Officials, appeared on the NFL Network show, "Total Access", stating that the calls were correct with the exception of the penalty called against Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck for an illegal low block in the fourth quarter.
On August 6, 2010, while visiting the Seahawks' preseason training camp for an annual rules interpretation session with the Seattle media, Leavy brought up Super Bowl XL without being asked:
He never mentioned specifically on which calls he made mistakes.
2011 Divisional Playoff Game (Giants at Packers).
Leavy once again drew controversy during the first quarter of the 2011 NFC Divisional Playoff game against the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers. Packers receiver Greg Jennings caught a pass and appeared to fumble just before he was tackled. It was initially ruled it as a fumble, but after a conference, officials ultimately ruled that Jennings was down by contact. The Giants challenged the call, but after reviewing the play, Leavy announced that the down-by-contact call would stand. Former NFL head of officiating and current Fox Sports analyst Mike Pereira was perplexed with Leavy's ruling, and said on the air that he would have reversed it back to a fumble. The league would later issue a statement suggesting that the reason why Leavy did not overturn the down-by-contact rule was primarily because there was no indisputable visual evidence as to whether Jennings' "calf" touched the ground before he fumbled.
2013 Green Bay Packers vs. San Francisco 49ers.
Leavy was downgraded only one day after an officiating mistake that allowed the 49ers an additional chance at a third down conversion inside the Packer's 10-yard line. Two offsetting dead ball flags were thrown for unsportsmanlike conduct and Leavy awarded a replay of the down. However, since both fouls occurred after the play had ended, the play should have counted without replaying the down. The 49ers went on to score a touchdown on the next play, en route to a 34-28 win. The league would later state that no penalty should have been called on the 49ers, only Green Bay, which would have instead given San Francisco an automatic first down.
2013 Kansas City Chiefs vs. San Diego Chargers.
Bill Leavy's crew officiated the Week 17 contest between Kansas City and San Diego, with the Chargers needing a win to get into the playoffs; otherwise, the Pittsburgh Steelers would have clinched the postseason spot instead. There were two controversial calls. First, officials missed calling an illegal formation penalty on San Diego, as per a new 2013 rule for having seven men on one side of the long snapper, during Kansas City Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop's missed 41-yard field goal attempt that would have given Kansas City the lead with eight seconds left in regulation. Then in overtime, San Diego's Eric Weddle ran up the middle during a fake punt for a first down inside the Chargers' own territory. Even though the officials immediately ruled that his forward progress was stopped, replays appeared to show that he lost the ball prior to, which was then picked up by a Chiefs player and returned the other way to the end zone. However, the ruling of "forward progress" is a judgement call that is not reviewable. In addition, Weddle was ruled to have been stopped right at first down line, close enough to warrant a replay review, but the replay official decided not to. The Chargers then went on to win in overtime to advance to the postseason.

South Carolina's 4th congressional district

The 4th Congressional District of South Carolina is a congressional district in upstate South Carolina bordering North Carolina. It includes all of Greenville, Spartanburg and Union counties and a part of Laurens county. The district is characterized by the two major cities of Greenville and Spartanburg.
The district is the state's wealthiest district and one of its most conservative. It has been in Republican hands since 1979, aside from a six-year stint by Democrat Liz J. Patterson, the daughter of former Senator Olin Johnston. Even before the Republicans finally took control of the seat, the 4th had been a rather conservative district; it had been one of the first areas of the state where Republicans won consistently at the local or state level.
Republican Trey Gowdy has represented the district since 2011.

Inertial fusion power plant

An inertial fusion power plant is intended to produce electric power by use of inertial confinement fusion techniques on an industrial scale. This type of power plant is still in a research phase.
Two established options for possible medium-term implementation of fusion energy production are magnetic confinement - being used in the ITER international project - and laser-based inertial confinement, as used in the French Megajoule laser and in the United States NIF. Inertial confinement fusion (ICF), including heavy-ion inertial fusion (HIF) has been proposed as a possible additional means of implementing a fusion power plant.
Overall principles of an Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) reactor.
For an easier understanding, it is worth using the analogy of operation between an IFE reactor and a petrol engine. By applying such an analogy, the process may be seen as a four strokes cycle:
To allow such an operation, an inertial fusion reactor is made of several subsets:
IFE projects.
Several projects of inertial fusion power plants have been proposed, notably power production plans based on the following experimental devices, either in operation or under construction:
As may be noted, only first two of these projects is based on z-pinch confinement, all others being based on laser confinement techniques. The project that is missing is RF Accelerator HIF as done at Argonne NL and supported by the scientific community as the "conservative way" to go for 37 years but never funded.<www.fusionpowercorporation.com>
The various phases of such a project are the following:
At the moment, according to the available data, inertial confinement fusion experiments have not gone beyond the first phase, as well for laser (although it is strongly expected to reach the objectives of the second phase around 2010, when NIF and Megajoule are complete) as for z-pinch (Z machine); these techniques should now demonstrate their ability to obtain a high fusion energy gain, as well as their capability for repetitive working.

<doc id="5895033" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895033" title="Platelet-derived growth factor receptor">
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor

Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-R) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits -A and -B are important factors regulating cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell growth, development and many diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the PDGF-R, alpha and beta each encoded by a different gene. Depending on which growth factor is bound, PDGF-R homo- or heterodimerizes.
Mechanism of action.
The PDGF family consists of PDGF-A, -B, -C and -D, which form either homo- or heterodimers (PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC, -DD). The four PDGFs are inactive in their monomeric forms. The PDGFs bind to the protein tyrosine kinase receptors PDGF receptor-α and -β. These two receptor isoforms dimerize upon binding the PDGF dimer, leading to three possible receptor combinations, namely -αα, -ββ and -αβ. The extracellular region of the receptor consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains while the intracellular part is a tyrosine kinase domain. The ligand-binding sites of the receptors are located to the three first immunoglobulin-like domains. PDGF-CC specifically interacts with PDGFR-αα and -αβ, but not with -ββ, and thereby resembles PDGF-AB. PDGF-DD binds to PDGFR-ββ with high affinity, and to PDGFR-αβ to a markedly lower extent and is therefore regarded as PDGFR-ββ specific. PDGF-AA binds only to PDGFR-αα, while PDGF-BB is the only PDGF that can bind all three receptor combinations with high affinity.
Dimerization is a prerequisite for the activation of the kinase. Kinase activation is visualized as tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor molecules, which occurs between the dimerized receptor molecules (transphosphorylation). In conjunction with dimerization and kinase activation, the receptor molecules undergo conformational changes, which allow a basal kinase activity to phosphorylate a critical tyrosine residue, thereby "unlocking" the kinase, leading to full enzymatic activity directed toward other tyrosine residues in the receptor molecules as well as other substrates for the kinase.
Expression of both receptors and each of the four PDGFs is under independent control, giving the PDGF/PDGFR system a high flexibility. Different cell types vary greatly in the ratio of PDGF isoforms and PDGFRs expressed. Different external stimuli such as inflammation, embryonic development or differentiation modulate cellular receptor expression allowing binding of some PDGFs but not others. Additionally, some cells display only one of the PDGFR isoforms while other cells express both isoforms, simultaneously or separately.
Interaction with signal transduction molecules.
Tyrosine phosphorylation sites in growth factor receptors serve two major purposes: to control the state of activity of the kinase and to create binding sites for downstream signal transduction molecules, which in many cases also are substrates for the kinase. The second part of the tyrosine kinase domain in the PDGFβ receptor is phosphorylated at Tyr-857, and mutant receptors carrying phenylalanine at this position have reduced kinase activity. Tyr-857 has therefore been assigned a role in positive regulation of kinase activity. Sites of tyrosine phosphorylation involved in binding signal transduction molecules have been identified in the juxtamembrane domain, the kinase insert, and in the C-terminal tail in the PDGFβ receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine residue and in general three adjacent C-terminal amino acid residues form specific binding sites for signal transduction molecules. Binding to these sites involves a common conserved stretches, denoted the Src homology (SH) 2 domain and/or Phosphotyrosine Binding Domains (PTB). The specificity of these interactions appears to be very high, since mutant receptors carrying phenylalanine residues in one or several of the different phosphorylation sites generally lack the capacity to bind the targeted signal transduction molecule. The signal transduction molecules are either equipped with different enzymatic activities, or they are adaptor molecules, which in some but not all cases are found in complexes with subunits that carry a catalytic activity. Upon interaction with the activated receptor, the catalytic activities become up-regulated, through tyrosine phosphorylation or other mechanisms, generating a signal that may be unique for each type of signal transduction molecule.
Examination of the different signalling cascades, induced by RTKs, established Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),PI-3 kinase and phospholipase-γ (PLCγ) pathways as key downstream mediators of the PDGFR signalling. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent STAT3 activation has been established to be a key downstream mediator of PDGFR signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells.
MAPK pathway.
The adaptor protein Grb2 forms a complex with Sos by the Grb2 SH3 domain. Grb2 (or) the Grb2/Sos complex is recruited to the membrane by the Grb2 SH2 domain binding to activated PDGFR-bound SHP2 (Also known as PTPN11, a cytosolic PTP), thereby allowing interaction with Ras and the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. Whereas the interaction between Grb2 and PDGFR occurs through interaction with the SHP2 protein, Grb2 binds to activated EGFR through Shc, another adaptor protein that forms a complex with many receptors via its PTB domain. Once activated, Ras interacts with several proteins, namely Raf. Activated Raf stimulates MAPK-kinase (MAPKK or MEK) by phosphorylating a Ser residue in its activation loop. MAPKK then phosphorylates MAPK (ERK1/2) on T and Y residues at the activation-loop leading to its activation. Activated MAPK phosphorylates a variety of cytoplasmic substrates, as well as transcription factors, when translocated into the nucleus. MAPK family members have been found to regulate various biological functions by phosphorylation of particular target molecules (such as transcription factors, other kinases etc.) located in cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, and thus contribute to the regulation of different cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immunoresponses.
PI3K pathway.
The class IA phospholipid kinase, PI-3 kinase, is activated by the majority of RTKs. Similarly to other SH2 domain-containing proteins, PI-3 kinase forms a complex with PY sites on activated receptors. The main function of PI3K activation is the generation of PIP3, which functions as a second messenger to activate downstream tyrosine kinases Btk and Itk, the Ser/Thr kinases PDK1 and Akt (PKB). The major biological functions of Akt activation can be classified into three categories – survival,proliferation and cell growth. Akt is also known to be implicated in several cancers, particularly breast. PLCγ is immediately recruited by an activated RTK through the binding of its SH2 domains to phosphotyrosine sites of the receptor. After activation, PLCγ hydrolyses its substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 and forms two second messengers, diacylglycerol and Ins(1,4,5)P3. Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulates the release of Ca 2+ from intracellular supplies. Ca 2+ then binds to calmodulin, which subsequently activates a family of calmodulindependent protein kinases (CamKs). In addition, both diacylglycerol and Ca 2+ activate members of the PKC family. The second messengers generated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis stimulate a variety of intracellular processes such as proliferation,angiogenesis, cell motility.

Bleadon Hill

Bleadon Hill () is a 13.52 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest just north of the village of Bleadon, North Somerset, notified in 1999.
The site is a Geological Conservation Review site, as it shows a low ridge of calcite-cemented Pleistocene sand and gravel on its southern side. Various marine or glacial origins have been postulated for the sediments and it has even been
suggested that this is a Mesozoic beach conglomerate. On the basis of the sedimentology, it is most likely that these sediments accumulated during the Quaternary when an ice sheet rested against Bleadon Hill.
There is evidence or agricultural use of the land in the medieval period and possibly from Roman times.

Dermot Ryan

Dermot J. Ryan (26 June 1924 – 21 February 1985) was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Ireland from 1972 until 1984. He was ordained a priest on 28 May 1950 and consecrated bishop on 13 February 1972. After his death he was criticised for having failed to act and covering up sexual abuse by priests in the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin.
Professor and scholar.
Dermot Ryan was Professor of Oriental Languages at University College Dublin before his appointment by Pope Paul VI as Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland on 29 December 1971. He was ordained a bishop by Pope Paul VI in Rome assisted by Cardinals Bernard Alfrink and William Conway (Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland), on 13 February 1972. At the time of his appointment he was seen as a liberal and a reformer in the Church. His predecessor John Charles McQuaid previously had Ryan removed from teaching in the seminary in Dublin due to teaching liberation theology.
Diocesan expansion.
During his term he consolidated much of the expansion of the Archdiocese which had taken place during the term of his predecessor. He also oversaw the fuller implementation of the reforms of Vatican II. He was particularly interested in liturgical reform, and encouraged increasing numbers of Catholics in Dublin to receive Communion at Mass each day or week.
Social opinions and activities.
Archbishop Ryan also took a strong stand on social issues, including poverty, family life and opposition to abortion. He strongly promoted the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland in 1983, which changed prohibition of abortion from a law to a constitutional provision.
He was named in the Murphy Report on sexual abuse of children in Dublin; his actions in respect of complaints against priest Fr. McNamee were described in the report as "an example of how, throughout the 1970s, the church authorities were more concerned with the scandal that would be created by revealing Fr McNamee’s abuse rather than any concern for the abused". He also did not act on complaints against other priests who were also subsequently confirmed to be abusers.
Archbishop Ryan Park.
As Archbishop he gave the people of Dublin a public park on a site earmarked by his predecessors for a proposed cathedral; it was named "Archbishop Ryan Park" in his honour. The land, at Merrion Square, was a gift from the Archbishop to the city of Dublin. 
In January 2010, after Ryan had been criticised in the Murphy Report the previous year, Dublin City Council sought public views on renaming the Park; in 2010 it was renamed Merrion Square Park by the City Council.
He also served as Pro-Prefect of Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples from 8 April 1984 until his death in Rome, following a heart attack at the age of 60.

Bourne SSSI, Avon

Bourne SSSI, Avon () is an 8.47 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest near the village of Burrington, North Somerset, notified in 1992.
This site is of considerable importance because it has provided detailed information upon the composition of a north Mendip Pleistocene alluvial fan. An alluvial fan is a fan-shaped deposit formed where a fast flowing stream flattens, slows, and spreads typically at the exit of a canyon onto a flatter plain.
At Bourne sections have shown highly weathered gravels overlain by sandy silts and clay loams, the highest levels in the sequence
showing evidence of cryoturbation. Two phases of fan sediment deposition were separated by a long period of subaerial weathering, which may represent an interglacial period.

Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephraem

Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephraem (known today as the Sermon at the end of the world) is a 7th-century Syrian tract which provides a glimpse into the events that took place during its time in the Middle-East.
Use of Pseudo-Ephraem in Controversy over the History of Rapture Doctrine.
A translation of a Latin text (with disputed date) of what is purported to be a sermon of Pseudo-Ephraem, by a professor at Tyndale Theological Seminary, Ft. Worth, Tx., Cameron Rhoades, is cited by some, to support an early Church reference to the rapture. However, exactly how early is questionable. The Latin text may not date before the 8th-century and may be a conflated text, and not translated directly from either the Syriac or Greek texts.
For perspective, according to Frazier, "Collections of works ascribed to Ephrem exist in several languages, the largest body of texts being Greek. Nearly all the surviving texts attributed to Ephrem in languages other than Syriac and Armenian are derived from this Greek corpus, including the Latin corpus.
Importantly, according to Reeves, "The Latin pseudo-Ephrem and the Syriac pseudo-Ephrem are not the same text, and the nature of their relationship to one another has yet to be satisfactorily explained. What does seem to be clear is that the Latin text borrows from the Pseudo-Methodius apocalypse (and is thus later than circa 700 CE), whereas the Syriac text seems to be older and does not betray such influence."
Thus, different translations from different underlying texts (Syriac text, Greek, and Latin) may be confusedly cited as the same Pseudo-Ephraem sermon and popular writers may not point out these important differences, e.g., that the Latin text is later and borrows from Pseudo-Methodius.
The opinions of scholars are divided on the origins of this apocalypse, but a date later than Ephraem with pseudonymous authorship are advanced by some. As an example, C. P. Caspari (Latin text editor) and Paul Alexander advance a date after the demise of (St.) Ephraem. Caspari would date it between late 6th and early 7th AD centuries. Alexander claims the work apparently was originally was written at the end of the 4th AD century, but only reached its final form by the late 6th to early 7th centuries. Thus for these scholars, this is not the actual work of Ephraem the Syrian, but the work of some unknown preacher now termed 'Pseudo- Ephraem'. Yet, both Caspari and Alexander consider Pseudo-Ephraem to be greatly influenced by the actual work of Ephraem.
But despite any debate on the date, this document does give evidence of rapture theory at least as early as the eighth century.
Different Text, Different Translations.
A translation by Professor John C. Reeves, from the Syriac text published by Edmund Beck, is available from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina The entire translation is reprinted below.
A translation from the conflated Latin text was done by Cameron Rhoades a Latin professor at Tyndale Theological Seminary in Ft. Worth, Tx. The entire translation is also reprinted below.
As referenced above, these two translations differ substantially due to the fact that the underlying text are in different languages and that the Latin version borrows from portions of Pseudo-Methodius apocalypse (late 7th century). 
The reader is cautioned to research the matter further and not confuse the earlier Syriac text with the later, conflated Latin text. This and other near Eastern texts are available at: http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/trajectories.htm
Translation of Pseudo-Ephraem.
SERMON OF PSEUDO-EPHREM ON THE END OF THE WORLD
Translated from the text in Edmund Beck, ed., Des heiligen Ephraem des Syrers Sermones III (CSCO 320; Louvain: Secrétariat du Corpus SCO, 1972), 60-71; see also 79-94 for Beck’s translation. The text is based on two manuscripts: (1) Codex Vaticanus Sir. 566, and (2) Codex Dublinensis (Trinity College) B 5.19. Editio princeps: Thomas Josephus Lamy, ed., Sancti Ephraem Syri Hymni et Sermones (4 vols.; Mechliniae: H. Dessain, 1882-1902), 3:187-212.
A discourse (memra) of the holy saint Ephrem, the Syrian teacher, concerning the end, (final) consummation, judgment, and punishment; on the people of Gog and Magog; and about the Antichrist.
O Son who by His grace humbled Himself
And who was pleased to make Himself a human being;
Who willingly experienced death
At the top of the wood(en cross) on Golgotha:
Grant me, my Lord, (the ability) to speak about
The struggles which will take place in the created order;
For peoples will fall upon each other
And nations will destroy one another,
Evil will fortify itself on the earth
And iniquity will increase throughout creation.
Righteous rulers will perish
And lawless ones will arise on the earth.
Then a judgment will arise,
And a weighing on the scale for those humans:
The side (containing) the wicked will sink down;
And that for the elect will rise up.
Then spiritual entities will go forth
And destroy the ends of the created order.
It will happen, my brethren, just as it is written:
A plague in a number of places,
And a famine will occur in the created order;
Terrible struggles and conflicts.
Dust will be saturated with blood;
The created order will be polluted from iniquity.
Regions will be ravaged,
And cities will be consumed by Sheol;
Nation will rise up against nation
And kingdom against kingdom.
Lawlessness will be sovereign on earth
And the defiled will pursue after the saints.
People will openly apostatize
And augment the left side;
The righteous ones will suffer indignities
From those who belong to the side of the sinners.
It is due to this, my beloved ones
That the final age has arrived.
Lo, we have observed the signs,
Just as Christ inscribed for us:
Rulers will arise, one against another;
There will be suffering on earth;
Nations will contend with nations
And armies will fall upon one another.
When the Nile, the river of Egypt,
Overflows (and) floods part of the land,
Certain regions will prepare themselves
Against the country of the Romans.
Nations will contend with nations,
And a kingdom with a kingdom.
They will depart, moving from one land to another;
Those Romans who are put to flight.
And the Assyrians will gain authority
Over the region of the Romans.
The fruit of their loins they will subjugate
And they will also ravish their women;
They will be sowing and also reaping
They will plant fruits in the ground;
They will acquire vast riches
And hoard treasures underground.
But just as the Nile, the river of Egypt
Recedes again from what it flooded;
So too will Assyria recede
Back to their own country.
For the Romans once again will be found
In their ancestral land (i.e., the Assyrians’).
Then evil will increase on the earth
And the land will be defiled with fornication.
The cry of the persecuted and the wretched
Will rise up to heaven.
Then a judgment will arise
To cast them out of the land.
The holy covenant will complain;
A cry will rise up to heaven.
A people will emerge from the wilderness,
The progeny of Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah;
Who hold fast to the covenant with Abraham,
The husband of Sarah and Hagar.
Set in motion, he (Ishmael) comes in the name of the ram,
The herald of the Son of Destruction.
A sign will appear in the heavens,
The one our Lord spoke of in His gospel:
Luminaries will shine among the stars
And the light of His face will gleam.
Rulers will quake and tremble;
The forces arrayed by them will fall.
The peoples of the earth will be terrified
When they behold the sign set in the heavens.
They will prepare for battle and come together,
All peoples and nationalities.
They will wage war there
And the ground will be drenched with blood.
The nations will suffer defeat there,
A marauding nation will prevail.
The marauders will fly over the landscape,
Across plains and over the peaks of mountains.
They will take women and children as captives,
Also men both elderly and young.
The best of the males will be destroyed;
The most desirable women will be removed.
With strong spears and lances
They will impale elderly men.
They will separate a son from his father,
A daughter from the side of her mother;
They will separate a brother from his brethren,
A sister from the side of her sisters.
They will slay the bridegroom in his bedroom
And expel the bride from her bridal chamber.
They will take a wife away from her husband,
And slaughter her as if she were a sheep;
They will cast an infant away from its mother
And drive the mother into captivity.
The child will scream out on the ground:
Its mother hears, but what can she do?
For it will be trampled by the hooves
Of horses, camels, and infantry!
She (tries to) turn toward it, (but) they will not allow her;
The child remains within the wild (?).
They separate children from their mother
As the soul (is separated) from the body.
She watches while they divide them up,
Her beloved ones (taken from) the embrace of her bosom;
Two of her children to two (different) masters,
Her own self to still another master;
She has been allocated, and her children with her;
For they are now slaves to robbers.
Her children cry out with laments,
Their eyes burning with tears;
She turns toward her beloved ones,
The milk flowing forth from her breast:
‘Farewell, my beloved ones!
May God go with you!
The one who accompanied Joseph
In (his) servitude among foreigners:
May He accompany you, my children
Into the captivity where you are going!’
‘Farewell, our mother!
May God go with you!
The one who accompanied Sarah
Into the palace of Abimelech the Gadarite:
May He accompany your own self
Until the Day of Resurrection!’
The son will stand and watch while his father
Is sold into slavery.
The eyes of both of them will burn with tears
While they groan, one in front of the other.
A brother will watch while his brother
Is killed and cast down on the ground,
Whereas he they drive off into captivity
In order to serve among foreigners as a slave.
They even put to death mothers
Who are holding their children to their breasts.
Bitter is the sound of the infants
Who are groaning to satisfy their desire (for milk).
They will prepare roads in the mountains,
Highways in the middle of the plains;
They will maraud until the very ends of the created order.
They will establish rule over the urban centers.
The provinces will suffer destruction,
And they will multiply corpses on the earth.
All peoples will be brought low
Before the marauder nation.
And once the peoples have endured much on earth
And hope that now peace has arrived,
They (the Ishmaelites) start exacting tribute
And everyone will be fearful of them.
Lawlessness will intensify on the earth
And even obscure the clouds;
Wickedness will enclose the created order
And waft up like smoke to the heavens.
Then since wickedness will be rampant upon the earth,
The Lord’s wrath will then stir up
Kings and mighty armies.
For when He seeks to expunge it from earth,
He sends out humans against humans
To annihilate one another.
Truly at that time He will summon
The kings and mighty armies
Who are behind those gates
Which Alexander fashioned.
Many rulers and peoples
Remain behind the gates.
They look toward heaven
And call on the name of God,
That the Lord send His sign
From within His heaven of glory
And the Divine Voice
Summon them who are by those gates;
So that they suddenly break down and collapse
At the command of the Divinity.
Numerous armies issue forth,
As many as the stars which cannot be counted.
As multitudinous as the sand by the sea,
And exceeding (the number of) the stars in the sky.
A full span was consumed
From the lower crossbar;
And from the upper crossbar
Another full span was consumed
On account of the great quantity of their sharp spears
With which they lacerated it. They issued forth,
Moving, spilling forth from there;
Kings and large armies
And every people and language group
Emerging from (behind) those gates.
Gog and Magog and Nūl and Agag,
Kings and mighty armies!
Togarmah and Ashkenaz and Daypar,
Pūìayē with Lūbayē.
Amzartayē and Garmēdō‘,
¬alab with helmet-covered heads,
Azmurtayē and Kūshayē,
Hunayē and Parzayē,
Diqlayē and Tūbalayē,
Mūshkayē with Kūshayē.
Allied to and coming with them
Were both the Medes and the Persians,
Armenians and Turks
And NamrūÐayē and MūshÐayē;
The descendants of Ke’wan and Serug;
The progeny of Yaqìan and the MaÐūnayē;
Numerous armies and nations
Whose number cannot be calculated.
They will burst forth and flood the earth,
Shaking the walls of the created order.
A dust cloud will rise up over the earth,
Obscuring the sun above
And covering creation
With clouds and dark fogs,
In accordance with what Ezekiel prophesied,
The son of Buzi in his prophecy.
For when the Huns come forth
To wage war and to do battle,
They will take hold of pregnant women
And heap fire on top of them;
They will come closer and mutter incantations over them,
While roasting their children inside them!
Splitting them open, they extract their fetuses
When they are finished cooking inside of them.
They draw near: then place them in basins,
And pour water over them
And dissolve their corpses there
In those enchanted waters.
They immediately take their swords
And their bows with their spears
And dip them in those waters
For their arrows and their weapons.
Every weapon to which are applied
Those magical potions
Appears as if there are hundreds, even thousands
Of cavalrymen who wield them.
Moreover those hundreds of horsemen
Who set out (and) traverse the whole of the earth
Appear as if they are accompanied
By six thousand myriads.
If one of them should fall off during battle
While engaging in the fight,
Wherever he extends his hand
Suddenly a knife emerges!
They eat the flesh of children
And also drink the blood of women.
Clothed in tanned skins,
They mount the winds and tempests;
And rapidly, in the blink of an eye,
They lay waste to cities,
Topple their walls to the ground,
And destroy the strong citadels.
Moving quickly, they bind the swift
And slaughter the vigorous men.
They are quicker in motion
Than winds and tempests.
Whenever news of them is heard on earth (to wit)
‘The Huns have set out (and) are coming!’
They blanket the whole of creation.
Because they are sorcerers,
They fly between heaven and earth.
Their chariots are like the winds,
And their swords and their lances
Are like terrifying bolts of lightning.
Holding straps in their hands
And two or three horses,
Each one of them leads with him
Some fifty or sixty men,
Traveling behind and in front of him
Like winds and tempests.
The sound of the battle-cry of just one of them
Is like the roaring of lions.
Indeed dread of the Huns
Will overpower the entire earth;
They will cover the whole earth
Like the waters during the days of Noah,
And they will overwhelm the edges of the created order:
There is no one who can withstand them.
These are the ‘numerous peoples’
About whom Ezekiel spoke
Who will cover the whole earth
As if they were clouds.
‘Fish will shudder before them,
(As will) the birds of the sky
And wild beasts and vermin of the earth
And every species in creation;
High mountains will be thrust down
And fortified towers will collapse,
Even the walls of the cities.’
On the earth will be a wasteland.
For Ezekiel has prophesied
That it will come to pass in the End of Days:
They will burst out (and) come up from the land
And cover the created order;
Gog and Magog will prepare itself
And arrive at the ‘hill country of Israel.’
Between the sea and Jerusalem
He will place his encampment.
Riders will fly off, descending
Upon Egypt and opposite India;
Leading away so many captives they cannot be numbered.
People and riches,
Cattle and property
Which have now become his prey.
Then Righteousness will summon
Michael, the one who is leader of the host,
To come down (and) destroy his encampment
Just as (he destroyed) the encampment of Sennacherib.
The angel, receiving the command, will draw
The terrible and powerful sword,
And departing, he will destroy his force
In the twinkling of an eye!
Righteousness will pick up and hurl
Stones of fire upon the encampment.
The slain on the ground will be as numerous
As the (particles of) sand which cannot be counted;
People and pack-animals will perish,
The entire encampment will be consumed.
The blaze will extend
Unto the sea and to the islands.
The bow will swerve from the hands
Of Gog, the wicked ruler;
Also his arrows (will drop) from his left hand:
His entire encampment will be consumed.
The inhabitants of Judaea will go out
And loot his whole encampment.
They will collect and pick up armament:
Lances, arrows, and bows.
For seven years within a fire
They will burn them, as it is written:
‘They will not need to gather
Wood from the field or thickets.’
Seven years they will throw in the fire
Shields and clubs,
Arrows, spears, and bows.
They will prove sufficient for fueling the fire for seven years.
Then the Lord will bring in His peace,
Which attests His glorification among the heavens.
And once more the empire of the Romans
Will spring up and flourish in its place.
It will possess the earth and its extremities,
And no one will exist who opposes it.
And when iniquity has become rife on earth
And has polluted the whole of creation,
Then a judgment will arise
Which will entirely obliterate the people.
The Son of Destruction, the Evil One,
Will emerge and come upon the earth.
A deceiver of humanity,
An instigator of trouble over the whole earth.
On the day when he comes to it,
(when) the Son of Destruction arrives on earth,
The created order will be thrown into commotion,
And terror will engulf the earth.
The sun will become dark in its place,
And the stars will fall from the height;
All the luminaries will be quenched,
Darkness will cover the created order.
The earth with its inhabitants will shake,
And mountains and heights will quake;
Springs and fountains will dry up,
And the waves in the sea will abate
And the fish therein grow still.
Rulers will stop rendering judgment
And priests will tremble in the sanctuary
And military power will collapse.
Confusion will be on the earth
And all human powers will be paralyzed,
For the Evil One will be ready.
He will come to and enter Jerusalem.
He will rebuild and establish himself in Zion,
And will make himself to be God
And enter into the sanctuary to take a seat
In accordance with what the Apostle wrote to us.
The Jews will take pride in him;
They will prepare themselves and come to him.
And he moreover will blaspheme when he says:
‘I, even I, am the Father and the Son!
The First and the Last!
There is no other god apart from me!’
But at that time ten thousand Jews will denounce him:
They will answer him in truth:
‘You are a deceiver for (all) creatures!
For the one whom our ancestors restrained
At the top of the wood(en cross) on Golgotha
Is (actually) the redeemer of (all) creatures,
And he was raised up to the One Who sent him!’
Then the Evil One will be enraged
And he will issue a command regarding those who denounced him
That they should immediately die by the sword,
And everyone will be too afraid to renounce him.
Then he will begin to display
Wonders through deception
In the heavens and on the earth,
Within the sea and on the dry land.
He will summon the rain and it will fall;
He will command the seed and it will sprout
However he will not actually perform (miracles);
He will be employing magic.
He will command the waves and they will cease,
And the winds will be obedient to him.
He will suspend fruits on the trees
And cause water to gush from the ground.
He will address the leprous and they will become clean,
(Speak to) the blind, and they will see light,
He will call to the deaf and they will hear him,
(Address) even the mute and they will speak.
He will effect all the wonders
Which Our Lord performed within the created order,
Except that he will not be able to resurrect the dead,
For he will not have authority over (the) spirits (of the dead).
Lightening-flashes will be his messengers,
And are the sign of his advent;
Demons are his armies
And the commanders of the devils are his pupils;
He will dispatch the heads of his legions
To distant lands
Where they will display marvelous powers and healings
And mislead the whole of creation.
Behold, the Apostle has penned a warning for us
In his epistle to the Thessalonians:
‘Let no word or no letter
Trouble you that is not from us.
For the rebellion comes first,
Also the Man of Sin
And he will exalt himself over God,
Making himself to be God.’
And when the Accursed One comes
And displays his mighty works and wonders,
The nations will gather together and come
As (if) they were going to see God.
Groups and nations will join him,
And every person will renounce their deity;
Everyone will say of him to their fellow
That they should acknowledge him, the Son of Destruction!
Peoples will fall upon one another,
Slaying each other with swords.
The elect will flee from his presence
To the peaks of mountains and hills,
And there will be calamity on earth
Unlike any that came before.
Fear will fall upon all people
And they will be overcome with terror.
Children will renounce their father
And follow after the Evil One;
Priests will abandon their altars
To serve as his heralds.
People will flee to cemeteries
And hide themselves among the dead,
Pronouncing the good fortune of the deceased
Who had avoided the calamity:
‘Blessed are you for you were borne away (to the grave)
And hence you escaped from the afflictions!
But as for us, woe is us! For when we die,
Vultures will serve as escort for us!’
And if the days of that time were not shortened,
The elect would never survive
The calamities and afflictions.
For Our Lord revealed (and) disclosed to us
In his Gospel when He said:
‘Those days will be shortened
For the sake of the elect and the saints.’
And when he has harassed the whole of creation,
(When) the Son of Destruction (has bent it) to his will,
Enoch and Elijah will be sent
That they might persuade the Evil One.
With a gentle question
The saints will come before him,
In order to expose the Son of Destruction
Before the assemblies surrounding him:
‘If you are indeed God,
Tell us what we ask of you:
Where is the place that you have hidden
The elders Elijah and Enoch?’
The Evil One will respond and say
To the saints at that time:
‘When I wish (it), they are in the height(s),
Or again should I choose, they are within the sea;
For I have authority over habitations,
Since there is no other god apart from me
And I can make anything
On earth (and) also in heaven!’
They will answer
The Son of Destruction as follows:
‘If you are truly God,
Call out to the deceased so that they will rise!
For it is written within the books
Of the prophets and the apostles
That when the Messiah reveals Himself,
He will resurrect the dead from the graves.
If you cannot show us this (sign),
Then the One who was crucified is greater than you!
For he roused and resurrected those who were dead,
And was exalted in great splendor.’
Then the Evil One will become enraged
With the saints at that time;
He will draw his terrible sword
And sever the necks of the righteous ones.
But Gabriel will arise (and) descend
(With) Michael (as) military commanders;
They will resurrect those saints
While the Evil One stands confused with his servants.
They will approach and seize that Accursed One
And the Lord will rebuke (him) from heaven;
Then He will destroy the Accursed One
And all of his forces.
Angels will suddenly approach
And cast him into Gehenna,
And all of those who believed in him
Will be thrust into the flame(s).
Then the Lord will come from above
In splendor and with a company of His angels,
And between earth and heaven
A throne-chariot will be fixed there.
He will admonish the sea and it will dry up;
The fish within it will perish.
He will dissolve the heavens and the earth,
And there will be (only) darkness and gloom.
He will dispatch fire upon the earth,
And it will burn there for forty <days>
Purifying it of iniquity
And of pollution and of sins.
A great throne will be adorned
And the Son will be seated on the right;
Seats will be positioned
For the twelve apostles of the Son;
And couches will be decorated for the martyrs
And a royal chamber for the righteous ones.
The Watchers will blow trumpets
And the dead will arise from the dust;
Fiery entities will suddenly go forth
And assemble all the descendants of Adam.
They will gather the wheat in a storehouse
And throw the straw into the fire;
The good will go forth into the Kingdom,
And the bad will remain in Gehenna;
The righteous will fly up to the height,
And the sinners will burn in fire.
The martyrs will float to the couch;
The wicked will go out into darkness.
And Christ will reign forever,
He will be sovereign over each generation.
To Him be the glory, and His mercy is over us
For all time, amen, amen!
Rhoades Translation from a Latin text of Pseudo-Ephraem.
On the Last Times, the Anti-Christ, and the End of the World A Sermon by Pseudo-Ephraem and Isidor of Sevilla (Caspari's title of the sermon is: Eine Ephraem Syrus und Isidor von Sevilla beigelegte Predigt über die letzten Zeiten, den Antichrist und das Ende der welt.)
The English translation of the Latin text in C.P. Caspari's Briefe, Abhandlungen und Predigten aus den zwei letzten Jahrhunderten des kirchlichen Altertums und dem Anfang des Mittelater (Christiania, 1890, pp. 208-20) was provided by Cameron Rhoades, instructor of Latin at Tyndale Theological Seminary, Ft. Worth, TX.
Section I
Dearly beloved brothers, believe the Holy Spirit who speaks in us. We have already told you that the end of the world is near, the consummation remains. Has not faith withered away among mankind? How many foolish things are seen among youths, how many crimes among prelates, how many lies among priests, how many perjuries among deacons! There are evil deeds among the ministers, adulteries in the aged, wantonness in the youths—in mature women false faces, in virgins dangerous traces! In the midst of all this there are the wars with the Persians, and we see struggles with diverse nations threatening and "kingdom rising against kingdom." When the Roman empire begins to be consumed by the sword, the coming of the Evil One is at hand. It is necessary that the world come to an end at the completion of the Roman empire.
In those days two brothers will come to the Roman empire who will rule with one mind; but because one will surpass the other, there will be a schism between them. And so the Adversary will be loosed and will stir up hatred between the Persian and Roman empires. In those days many will rise up against Rome; the Jewish people will be her adversaries. There will be stirrings of nations and evil reports, pestilences, famines, and earth quakes in various places. All nations will receive captives; there will be wars and rumors of wars. From the rising to the setting of the sun the sword will devour much. The times will be so dangerous that in fear and trembling they will not permit thought of better things, because many will be the oppressions and desolations of regions that are to come.
Section II
We ought to understand thoroughly therefore, my brothers, what is imminent or overhanging. Already there have been hunger and plagues, violent movements of nations and signs, which have been predicted by the Lord, they have already been fulfilled (consummated), and there is not other which remains, except the advent of the wicked one in the completion of the Roman kingdom. Why therefore are we occupied with worldly business, and why is our mind held fixed on the lusts of the world or on the anxieties of the ages? Why therefore do we not reject every care of worldly business, and why is our mind held fixed on the lusts of the world or on the anxieties of the ages? Why therefore do we not reject every care of earthly actions and prepare ourselves for the meeting of the Lord Christ, so that he may draw us from the confusion, which overwhelms all the world? Believe you me, dearest brother, because the coming (advent) of the Lord is nigh, believe you me, because the end of the world is at hand, believe me, because it is the very last time. Or do you not believe unless you see with your eyes? See to it that this sentence be not fulfilled among you of the prophet who declares: "Woe to those who desire to see the day of the Lord!" For all the saints and elect of God are gathered, prior to the tribulation that is to come, and are taken to the Lord lest they see the confusion that is to overwhelm the world because of our sins. And so, brothers most dear to me, it is the eleventh hour, and the end of the world comes to the harvest, and angels, armed and prepared, hold sickles in their hands, awaiting the empire of the Lord. And we think that the earth exists with blind infidelity, arriving at its downfall early. Commotions are brought forth, wars of diverse peoples and battles and incursions of the barbarians threaten, and our regions shall be desolated, and we neither become very much afraid of the report nor of the appearance, in order that we may at least do penance; because they hurl fear at us, and we do not wish to be changed, although we at least stand in need of penance for our actions!
Section III
When therefore the end of the world comes, there arise diverse wars, commotions on all sides, horrible earthquakes, perturbations of nations, tempests throughout the lands, plagues, famine, drought throughout the thoroughfares, great danger throughout the sea and dry land, constant persecutions, slaughters and massacres everywhere, fear in the homes, panic in the cities, quaking in the thoroughfares, suspicions in the male, anxiety in the streets. In the desert people become senseless, spirits melt in the cities. A friend will not be grieved over a friend, neither a brother for a brother, nor parents for their children, nor a faithful servant for his master, but one inevitability shall overwhelm them all; neither is anyone able to be recovered in that time, who has not been made completely aware of the coming danger, but all people, who have been constricted by fear, are consumed because of the overhanging evils.
Section IV
Whenever therefore the earth is agitated by the nations, people will hide themselves from the wars in the mountains and rocks, by caves and caverns of the earth, by graves and memorials of the dead, and there, as they waste away gradually by fear, they draw breath, because there is not any place at all to flee, but there will be concession and intolerable pressure. And those who are in the east will flee to the west, and moreover, those who are in the west shall flee to the east, and there is not a safer place anywhere, because the world shall be overwhelmed by worthless nations, whose aspect appears to be of wild animals more than that of men. Because those very much horrible nations, most profane and most defiled, who do not spare lives, and shall destroy the living from the dead, shall consume the dead, they eat dead flesh, they drink the blood of beasts, they pollute the world, contaminate all things, and the one who is able to resist them is not there. In those days people shall not be buried, neither Christian, nor heretic, neither Jew, nor pagan, because of fear and dread there is not one who buries them; because all people, while they are fleeing, ignore them.
Section V
Whenever the days of the times of those nations have been fulfilled, after they have destroyed the earth, it shall rest; and now the kingdom of the Romans is removed from everyday life, and the empire of the Christians is handed down by God and Peter; and then the consummation comes, when the kingdom of the Romans begins to be fulfilled, and all dominions and powers have been fulfilled. Then that worthless and abominable dragon shall appear, he, whom Moses named in Deuteronomy, saying:-Dan is a young lion, reclining and leaping from Basan. Because he reclines in order that he may seize and destroy and slay. Indeed (he is) a young whelp of a lion not as the lion of the tribe of Judah, but roaring because of his wrath, that he may devour. "And he leaps out from Basan." "Basan" certainly is interpreted "confusion." He shall rise up from the confusion of his iniquity. The one who gathers together to himself a partridge the children of confusion, also shall call them, whom he has not brought forth, just as Jeremiah the prophet says. Also in the last day they shall relinquish him just as confused.
Section VI
When therefore the end of the world comes, that abominable, lying and murderous one is born from the tribe of Dan. He is conceived from the seed of a man and from an unclean or most vile virgin, mixed with an evil or worthless spirit. But that abominable corrupter, more of spirits than of bodies, while a youth, the crafty dragon appears under the appearance of righteousness, before he takes the kingdom. Because he will be craftily gentle to all people, not receiving gifts, not placed before another person, loving to all people, quiet to everyone, not desiring gifts, appearing friendly among close friends, so that men may bless him, saying;-he is a just man, not knowing that a wolf lies concealed under the appearance of a lamb, and that a greedy man is inside under the skin of a sheep.
Section VII
But when the time of the abomination of his desolation begins to approach, having been made legal, he takes the empire, and, just as it is said in the Psalm:-They have been made for the undertaking for the sons of Loth, the Moabites and the Ammanites shall meet him first as their king. Therefore, when he receives the kingdom, he orders the temple of God to be rebuilt for himself, which is in Jerusalem; who, after coming into it, he shall sit as God and order that he be adored by all nations, since he is carnal and filthy and mixed with worthless spirit and flesh. Then that eloquence shall be fulfilled of Daniel the prophet:-And he shall not know the God of their fathers, and he shall not know the desires of women. Because the very wicked serpent shall direct every worship to himself. Because he shall put forth an edict so that people may be circumcised according to the rite of the old law. Then the Jews shall congratulate him, because he gave them again the practice of the first covenant; then all people from everywhere shall flock together to him at the city of Jerusalem, and the holy city shall be trampled on by the nations for forty-two months, just as the holy apostle says in the Apocalypse, which become three and a half years, 1,260 days.
Section VIII
In these three years and a half the heaven shall suspend its dew; because there will be no rain upon the earth, and the clouds shall cease to pass through the air, and the stars shall be seen with difficulty in the sky because of the excessive dryness, which happens in the time of the very fierce dragon. Because all great rivers and very powerful fountains that overflow with themselves shall be dried up, torrents shall dry up their water-courses because of the intolerable age, and there will be a great tribulation, as there has not been, since people began to be upon the earth, and there will be famine and an insufferable thirst. And children shall waste away in the bosom of their mothers, and wives upon the knees of their husbands, by not having victuals to eat. Because there will be in those days lack of bread and water, and no one is able to sell or to buy of the grain of the fall harvest, unless he is one who has the serpentine sign on the forehead or on the hand. Then gold and silver and precious clothing or precious stones shall lie along the streets, and also even every type of pearls along the thoroughfares and streets of the cities, but there is not one who may extend the hand and take or desire them, but they consider all things as good as nothing because of the extreme lack and famine of bread, because the earth is not protected by the rains of heaven, and there will be neither dew nor moisture of the air upon the earth. But those who wander through the deserts, fleeing from the face of the serpent, bend their knees to God, just as lambs to the adders of their mothers, being sustained by the salvation of the Lord, and while wandering in states of desertion, they eat herbs.
Section IX
Then, when this inevitability has overwhelmed all people, just and unjust, the just, so that they may be found good by their Lord; and indeed the unjust, so that they may be damned forever with their author the Devil, and, as God beholds the human race in danger and being tossed about by the breath of the horrible dragon, he sends to them consolatory proclamation by his attendants, the prophets Enoch and Elijah, who, while not yet tasting death, are the servants for the heralding of the second coming of Christ, and in order to accuse the enemy. And when those just ones have appeared, they confuse indeed the antagonistic serpent with his cleverness and they call back the faithful witnesses to God, in order to (free them) from his seduction ...
Section X
And when the three and a half years have been completed, the time of the Antichrist, through which he will have seduced the world, after the resurrection of the two prophets, in the hour which the world does not know, and on the day which the enemy of son of perdition does not know, will come the sign of the Son of Man, and coming forward the Lord shall appear with great power and much majesty, with the sign of the wood of salvation going before him, and also even with all the powers of the heavens with the whole chorus of the saints, with those who bear the sign of the holy cross upon their shoulders, as the angelic trumpet precedes him, which shall sound and declare: Arise, O sleeping ones, arise, meet Christ, because his hour of judgment has come! Then Christ shall come and the enemy shall be thrown into confusion, and the Lord shall destroy him by the spirit of his mouth. And he shall be bound and shall be plunged into the abyss of everlasting fire alive with his father Satan; and all people, who do his wishes, shall perish with him forever; but the righteous ones shall inherit everlasting life with the Lord forever and ever.

As a child, Carignan studied with noted Quebec fiddler Joseph Allard, as well as learning the music of the great Irish fiddlers Michael Coleman and James Morrison and the Scottish fiddler James Scott Skinner. Carignan was a friend of famous violinist and conductor Yehudi Menuhin. In 1974, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada as "the greatest fiddler in North America". He died in Montreal on February 16, 1988 at the age of 71.
In 1976, "The Folk Music Sourcebook"(Sandberg and Weissman) wrote about Carignan : "Carignan's technique is amazing, but more so the joy and energy with which he applies it. There are few players in any music who reach his degree of virtuosity without sacrificing feeling or originality"--p. 84. As a fiddler, he was always aiming for the strictest authenticity in his executions, displaying an attitude of absolute rigor when playing his repertoire of 7000 pieces learned from Coleman, Skinner, Allard, Wellie Ringuette and many others.

<doc id="5895130" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895130" title="House of Schwarzenberg">
House of Schwarzenberg

Schwarzenberg () is the name of a Franconian and Bohemian aristocratic family. The Schwarzenbergs were prominent members of the Bohemian nobility and achieved the rank of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The family traces its roots to the lords of Seinsheim during the Middle Ages.
The current head of the family is Karl VII of Schwarzenberg, the 12th Prince of Schwarzenberg. He is a Czech politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic.
History.
The family stems from the lords of Seinsheim, who had established themselves in Franconia during the Middle Ages. A branch of the Seinsheim family (the non-Schwarzenberg portion died out in 1958) was created when Erkinger of Seinsheim acquired the Franconian territory of Schwarzenberg and the castle of Schwarzenberg in Scheinfeld during the early part of the 15th century. He was then granted the title of "Freiherr" (Baron) of Schwarzenberg in 1429. At that time, the family also possessed some fiefdoms in Bohemia. 
In 1599, the Schwarzenbergs were elevated to Imperial Counts, and the family was later raised to princely status in 1670. The House of Schwarzenberg acquired extensive land holdings in Bohemia in 1661 through a marriage alliance with the House of Eggenberg. In the 1670s, the Schwarzenbergs established their primary seat in Bohemia and, until 1918, their main residence was in Český Krumlov, Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic).
At the beginning of the 19th century, the House of Schwarzenberg was divided into two princely-titled lines ("majorats"). The senior branch died out in the male line in 1979 upon the death of Joseph III of Schwarzenberg, who was the 11th Prince of Schwarzenberg. The cadet branch was established by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, at Orlík, Murau and Vienna, and this branch continues to the present day. 
The two branches have now been re-united under the current head of the family, Karl VII of Schwarzenberg, who is the 12th Prince of Schwarzenberg. He is a Czech politician and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic.
Coat of arms.
The ancestral arms of the lords of Seinsheim consisted of vertical stripes in silver and blue.
The family became "Freiherren" (Barons) of Schwarzenberg in 1429, and a silver tower on a black hill was added to their coat of arms to represent Schwarzenberg.
In 1599, Adolf von Schwarzenberg became an Imperial Count, and he added a quarter showing the head of a Turk being pecked by a raven. This was to commemorate the conquest of a Turkish-held fortress in Hungary that was known in German as "Raab" ('Raven').
In 1670, the Schwarzenbergs were raised to princely status. Their coat of arms was subsequently augmented, with quarters added for the domains of Sulz, Brandis (canting arms: a "brand") and the Landgraviate of Klettgau.
Notable family members.
The House of Schwarzenberg produced many military commanders, politicians, church dignitaries (including a Cardinal), innovators and patrons of the arts. They were related to a number of European aristocratic families, notably the Lobkowicz () family. Some of the most noteworthy members of the Schwarzenberg family are:
Property and residences.
Bohemia.
The Schwarzenberg land holdings in Bohemia included the Duchy of Krumlov, the town of Prachatice and Orlík Castle. The family also acquired the property of the House of Rosenberg (). On their lands, the Schwarzenbergs created ponds, planted forests and introduced new technologies in agriculture.
Upon the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1939, the possessions of Prince Adolph of Schwarzenberg were seized by the Nazi authorities. He managed to flee, but his cousin Heinrich, Duke of Krumlov, was arrested and deported. After World War II, the Czechoslovakian government stated, by law No. 143/1947 from August 13, 1947 "(Lex Schwarzenberg)", that the assets of the Schwarzenberg-Hluboká primogeniture passed to the Land of Bohemia.
Castles and palaces.
The Schwarzenberg property holdings included the following residences:
Titles of the family.
Lords of Seinsheim.
The House of Seinsheim regarded Erchanger, Duke of Swabia (died 917), as their ancestor.
Barons of Schwarzenberg.
"In 1599, the barony was raised to an Imperial county."
Counts of Schwarzenberg.
"On 14 July 1670, the county was raised to an Princely county and, the following year, to a Princely landgraviate."
Princes of Schwarzenberg.
"In November of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire ceased to exist."
Title of the head of the Schwarzenberg family.
The other members of the Schwarzenberg family are not referred to as Dukes of Krumlov, and they should be addressed without the word "The" in front of their title of Prince or Princess. In the German language, the princely title of the head of the family is ""Fürst"", whereas other members of the family are titled as ""Prinz"" or ""Prinzessin"". The eldest son of the head of the family would be addressed with the title of ""Erbprinz"".

Lord of Badenoch

The Lord of Badenoch was a magnate who ruled the lordship of Badenoch in the 13th century and early 14th century. The lordship may have been created out of the territory of the Meic Uilleim, after William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan, Justiciar of Scotia and Warden of Moray defeated Gille Escoib MacUilleim. However, there is no evidence that the Meic Uilleim held lands in this area. After the death of John III in 1306, the lordship was taken into royal hands, although it was still claimed by his son John. The Lordship was included in the vast Earldom of Moray when it was resurrected for Thomas Randolph.

Manhattan Building (Chicago, Illinois)

The Manhattan Building is a 16-story building at 431 South Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois. It was designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney and constructed from 1889 to 1891. It is the oldest surviving skyscraper in the world to use a purely skeletal supporting structure. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1976, and designated a Chicago Landmark on July 7, 1978.
Architecture.
The distinctive bow windows provide light into the building's interior spaces, and the combination of a granite facade for the lower floors and brick facade for the upper stories helps lighten the load placed on the internal steel framework. The north and south walls of tile are supported on steel cantilevers that carry the load back to the internal supporting structure.
The versatility and strength of metal frame construction made the skyscraper possible, as evidenced by this structure, which reached the then-astounding height of 16 stories in 1891. Its architect was a pioneer in the development of tall buildings.

Brutal Deluxe

Brutal Deluxe is a metal band from London, England.
History.
Formed in 1997, the band takes its name from the retro video game . They have currently released two albums on Dream Catcher. 
Brutal Deluxe quickly gained recognition for taking to the stage barefooted, bedecked in their tribalistic warpaint and pounding their audience into submission with their dynamic live performance. They were signed in 1999 to Dreamcatcher Records and released their debut album "Divine Head" in early 2000. It received wide critical acclaim and the band was hailed as a great British hope. The band toured in 2000 with Raging Speedhorn, Kill II This and Napalm Death.
The band started 2001 with a headline tour through the UK, culminating in a filmed live show for MTV2 in London. Just prior to this show the band suffered a serious blow when all their equipment was stolen. This brought to a head strained relationships in the band, and the end result was the departure of bassist Toad. 
A replacement was soon found and the band managed to move forward with the help of Richmo custom drums. They performed to 12,000 people at the Bulldog Bash with The Wildhearts and Feeder and continued to tour through 2001. The band then recorded their second album in 2002 entitled "Mistah Kurtz...He Dead".
In 2006 the band parted ways with their label Dreamcatcher and began recording new demos in their studio in South London.
In 2007 the band showcased some new material on an EP and began searching for another new bass player. "Guary MacSeanlaoic." joined on bass and they signed to Chimerical Records on 29 January 2009.
Between June and December 2009 the Slagfreak Mobile recording Studio was used to record the bulk of the songs for the new album at the remote Clymping Mill (Clymping Gap) on the English Southcoast.

Travesía

Travesía is an important pre-Columbian archaeological sites in the Ulua river valley of Honduras. The city reached its largest size in the Late Classic (500-850) but was founded earlier. How early, we don't know because of the destruction of the site in the 20th century and subsequent looting to find pieces for the thriving illegal antiquities market.
Doris Stone excavated in the city center of Travesía. Her photos of those excavations can be found in the photo archives of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. Some of what she found is published in her book, "The Archaeology of the North Coast of Honduras" (1941).
The site itself is known for its abundant Ulua polychrome pottery, and especially for the Ulua marble vessels. Christina Luke studied the marble vessels in her Cornell University dissertation and her report listed below on the FAMSI website
Research by Rus Sheptak in 1981 using aerial photography showed that the site apparently consisted of 3 large raised platforms over 100 meters on a side. One of these platforms contained the city center, a plaza and ball-court made of cut stone architecture and plaster. Its here that Doris Stone excavated. The other platforms weren't investigating. In the 1940s the site was destroyed as part of a project to flatten the fields to plant sugar cane. Subsequently, the site has been heavily looted to collect the polychrome pots and marble vessels prized on the national and international antiquities markets. Until 2004 these regularly appeared for sale on sites like eBay, Christies, and Sothbys. Archaeologists have tried to place test excavations at Travesia to get information on how far back it was occupied, but frequently end up re-excavating a looter's pit rather than undisturbed soil. In a 2002 letter to the U.S. Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC), the President of the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) noted that ""...the major center of Travesia has all but disappeared from the map under the looter's shovel."" In March 2004, the U.S. Government imposed import restrictions on all precolumbian Honduran materials.

Hiatus (television)

A hiatus of a television series is a break of at least several weeks in the normal schedule of broadcast programming. It can occur during a season of a television program, or can be between television seasons (usually starting in June and ending in August when shooting starts for the next season) which is called a mid-season break.
Planned hiatus.
Television stations often implement a hiatus for their programs to split up a season so it will run longer until the next season. Some programs also go on hiatus so that their television networks can reserve episodes for airing during ratings sweeps, wherein networks compute their television advertising fees based on their programs' ratings during that period. Programs "return from hiatus" in time for the sweeps period so as to generate high ratings, and as such usually include special content in programming such as guest stars, controversial and unexpected plots or topics, extended episodes, and finales.
Cancellation.
A network may put a show on hiatus before canceling it. This may be to evaluate the series' quality, warn the television producers in an effort to push them to produce a more profitable product, fill its timeslot with another program to compare ratings, or warn viewers that the show is not pulling its weight in ratings to see how the show performs in reruns before deciding whether or not it deserves another season.
Other reasons.
A series may be put on hiatus for other reasons. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced several television series (including "Pushing Daisies", "Eli Stone", "Chuck", "The Big Bang Theory", and "Heroes") to go into hiatus and deferred the scheduled returns of other series such as "24" for an extended period. A show may go on hiatus in reaction to its content: "Pokémon" anime was put on hiatus in Japan from December 17, 1997 until April 16, 1998 after the airing of an episode which caused 685 viewers to have seizures. A show may also be put on hiatus due to an actor's actions, death, or illness, such as the death of "8 Simple Rules" actor John Ritter, or "Sonny with a Chance" actress Demi Lovato entering rehabilitation, or "Megan Wants a Millionaire" contestant Ryan Alexander Jenkins being charged with murder.

Edward Joseph Byrne

Edward Joseph Byrne (May 10, 1872 – February 9, 1940) was an Irish prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Dublin from 1921 until his death in 1940.
Biography.
Byrne was born in Dublin to Edward and Eleanor (née Maguire) Byrne. His father was a farmer from County Wicklow. There were three children in the family, all boys, and Edward was the only one not to die in infancy. He went to Belvedere College and Holy Cross College, Clonliffe before completing his studies at the Irish College, Rome. He was ordained a priest on June 8, 1895 at St. John Lateran. His first post was as curate to Rush, Co. Dublin from 1895–98. He then moved to Kilsallaghan and Rolestown from 1898–99. The following year he spent at Howth before moving to Blackrock. He was appointed Vice Rector of the Irish College, Rome from 1901–1904 and returned as a curate to the Pro-Cathedral where he remained until 1920.
Bryne was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin and Titular Bishop of "Pegae" by Pope Benedict XV on August 19, 1920. He was ordained a bishop by Archbishop William Walsh at the Pro-Cathedral on October 28 of the same year. He was translated as Archbishop of Dublin and thus Primate of Ireland on August 29, 1921. His motto was: ""In Te Domine Speravi."" He was later appointed Assistant at the Pontifical Throne and named a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of Malta.
Byrne became Archbishop at a critical time in Irish history. During his early years as Archbishop, at the time of the Irish Civil War, he tried to bring about peace by calling a conference of the leaders, but no basis for agreement could be found. Arguing that the majority of the Irish people supported the Treaty, he advised de Valera not to split the Sinn Féin party, even if he was defeated in the Dáil; however, this advice was ignored. Byrne objected to the execution of Erskine Childers and other anti-Treaty supporters, and the policy of reprisals by both parties. After the hostilities ended, while he still maintained an interest in political matters, he was, and became, much more interested in the spiritual well-being of his flock. Byrne was very involved with the pastoral workings of the diocese and was extremely interested in the changing social conditions. He had a parish of over 20,000 people, many of whom were living in sub-standard conditions, and who had to be re-housed in new estates in the suburbs. He supervised the provision of schools and churches to serve the new parishes created and viewed all his work from a spiritual angle and was considered a wise and prudent ruler. Two major events can be seen as the highlights of his episcopacy, namely the centenary of Catholic Emancipation in 1929 and the Eucharistic Congress of 1932.
He was afflicted with a wasting muscular disease through the 1930s, but remained as Archbishop until his death. He is buried in the vaults at the Pro-Cathedral.

Independence Gate

The Independence Gate (독립문;獨立門) is a memorial gate located in Seoul, South Korea. The gate was built following the first Sino-Japanese war to inspire a spirit of independence away from previous Korean arrangement as a Chinese tributary state. design of Seo Jae-pil.
The Independence Gate was built to replace the Yeongeunmun Gate(영은문;迎恩門)., which was a symbol of diplomatic relations between Korea and Qing Dynasty. To raise funds for the building, the Independence Club collected contributions. The two supporting pillars of Yeongeunmun Gate remain in front of the Independence Gate.
Construction of the gate began on November 21, 1896, and it was completed on November 20, 1897. 
The design, by Seo Jae-pil, was modeled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It measures 14.28 meters in height, 11.48 meters in width, and is made of approximately 1,850 pieces of granite.
While the Independence Gate once straddled Tongil-ro, it was moved in 1979. to accommodate the construction of the Seongsan-ro. It now stands in the Independence Park, about 70 meters northwest from its original position. Photo showing the construction of Seongsan-ro Access to the gate was restricted for much of its history, but it was reopened following the completion of Seodaemun Independence Park on October 28, 2009. Visitors can now walk under the gate itself.

USS Artisan (AFDB-1)

USS "Artisan" (ABSD-1), a ten-section, non-self-propelled, large auxiliary floating drydock, was the only ship of the United States Navy given this name. She was constructed in sections during 1942 and 1943 by the Everett Shipbuilding Company, in Everett, Washington; the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, in Eureka, California; the Pollack-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, in Stockton, California; and the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, in Morgan City, Louisiana. Her official commissioning ceremony took place at Everett, Washington, on 10 May 1943, Captain Andrew R. Mack in command.
War service.
The floating drydock made the voyage to the southwestern Pacific in two separate convoys. The two sections constructed on the Gulf Coast departed Morgan City, Louisiana, on 14 July 1943, while the remaining eight sections concentrated at San Francisco, California, before putting to sea on 28 August 1943. The first two sections arrived at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides on 24 September, and the West Coast sections reached that destination on 2 October. Later that month, the drydock's crew began assembly procedures. On 2 November in the course of assembling the drydock, one of its sections sank, drowning 13 of her crew. By the end of 1943, she was a working drydock of eight sections repairing a variety of Navy ships at Espiritu Santo. In April 1944, ABSD-1 became a full ten-section drydock when her remaining section was combined with another from ABSD-2 and was joined to the eight already functioning. With all ten sections joined, she was 927 feet long, 28 feet tall (keel to welldeck), and with an inside clear width of 133 feet 7 inches.
She served in the New Hebrides until mid-April 1945 at which time she received orders to disassemble and move forward to the big base at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. ABSD-1 completed disassembly by the beginning of June and, on 30 June, the first six sections began the voyage, via Hollandia, New Guinea, to Leyte. The remaining four sections took departure on 7 July. The first echelon arrived at Manicani Bay, Samar Island, on 27 July, and assembly began three days later. On 2 August, the rest of the drydock entered Manicani Bay and, by mid-September, all ten sections had been joined together. The floating drydock resumed her repair work soon thereafter, and it continued through February 1946. On 28 February 1946, she undocked four yard craft and began preparations for inactivation. ABSD-1 was decommissioned on 31 May 1946.
Post-war service.
She remained in the Philippines through the summer and fall of 1946. During that time, in August 1946, the advanced base sectional dock was reclassified a large auxiliary floating drydock and was redesignated AFDB-1. Sometime after November 1946, her sections were towed from the Philippines to Pearl Harbor where they were placed in reserve. Her inactivity lasted almost exactly five years. She was recommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 2 June 1951, Captain O. J. Stien, USNR, in command. Later that month, she was towed, in sections, to Guam in the Mariana Islands where the Navy was improving another repair facility in fairly close proximity to the combat zone in the year-old Korean War. Reporting for duty on 26 June 1951, she was not completely assembled and ready for duty until the beginning of March 1952.
Active at Apra Harbor not quite three years, AFBD-1 was out of commission again and back in reserve by January 1955. She remained inactive at Guam for a little more than 15 years. In 1970, five of her sections were moved to Subic Bay in the Philippines where the floating drydock was placed in service once again on 17 November 1970. Her third period of active service proved to be her longest lasting almost 16 years. On 7 June 1979, she was named "Artisan". In October 1986, "Artisan" was placed out of service, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. In March 1987, however, "Artisan" received a reprieve when her name was reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register.
On 16 August 1996 her Section 1D was reclassified as unclassified miscellaneous vessel IX-521, and on 2 March 1998 her Section 1C was reclassified to IX-525.

Cosmin Olăroiu

Cosmin Olăroiu (born 10 June 1969 in Bucharest) is a retired Romanian football player and currently the football manager of UAE side Al Ahli. He is considered one of the greatest managers in the Arabian Peninsula, having led the most decorated clubs of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (Al Hilal, Al Sadd and Al Ain) to new trophies. 
Olăroiu also managed some other impressive results in his very short coaching career before arriving in the region, in his country Romania. During the 2001–02 season, Naţional Bucureşti under his managership became a challenger for the national championship title. However, they lost the leader position in the last game of the season, against Universitatea Craiova, and the title went to Dinamo Bucharest. He won the Romanian League and the Supercupa României with Steaua Bucureşti, both in 2006, and qualified the team in the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in the same year. 
He was chosen Romanian Coach of the Year in 2006.
Club career.
As a player, Olăroiu's best-known clubs he played for are Universitatea Craiova and Naţional Bucureşti. However, he also played with success in K-League for Suwon Samsung Bluewings and helped the team to win two league titles (1998, 1999). He also won the Korean League Cup and twice the Korean Supercup.
Coaching career.
Romania.
He started his coaching career during the 2000–01 season at Naţional Bucureşti, finishing a respectable 7th in his first season. During the following season, 2001–02, he guided the club to a second-place finish above teams like Steaua and Rapid Bucureşti.
In summer 2002, Olăroiu signed for Steaua Bucureşti. He resigned after only seven league games, blaming the decision on a lack of support from the board and players. The club president Viorel Păunescu re-appointed Victor Piţurcă, former manager before 2002 who wanted to return to head-coaching and was still highly regarded by the players.
After leaving Steaua București, Olăroiu returned to Național București, this time as a general manager. In 2003, he was named head coach again, replacing Walter Zenga.
In the winter of 2004, Olăroiu joined Politehnica Timişoara and brought with him the best players from Național București. He led them to a historical fourth place finish in Divizia A, but in November 2005 he was sacked by the club's owner Marian Iancu who replaced him with .
Steaua București & European campaigns success.
Just some days after, Olăroiu was appointed manager by Gigi Becali, the new president, and this time owner, of Steaua Bucureşti, to replace Oleh Protasov. His first championship title as coach came in June 2006 and then one month later his team also won the Supercupa României. In May 2006, Olăroiu reached the semi-finals of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. He also helped Steaua to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stages, where they played against Dinamo Kiev, Real Madrid and Olympique Lyon. Steaua secured a third place and a spot in the UEFA Cup knockout rounds.
Al-Hilal.
In June 2007, Olăroiu signed for Al-Hilal, supposedly drawn by the more attractive financial aspects that are typical of Saudi Arabian football. In 2008, he again proved his coaching worth, winning the Crown Prince Cup and the Saudi Premier League title. He also won his second Crown Prince Cup, before leaving the team in February 2009, while leading them to the first position in the national championship.
Al-Sadd.
On April 2009, he signed a two-year contract with Al-Sadd. In December 2010, Olăroiu announced his resignation as club boss immediately after leading his side to the Qatari Stars Cup.
On 5 May 2011, Olăroiu was named supervisor for Steaua Bucureşti for the last three matches of Liga I in the 2010–11 season and 2011 Cupa României Final. Steaua's assistant coach, Gabriel Caramarin took charge of the team as caretaker manager, for the last remaining games.
Al Ain.
In summer 2011, Cosmin Olăroiu was hired as Al Ain manager on a two-year contract. He steered the club away from the relegation zone, before leading them to the United Arab Emirates Pro-League title in the 2011–12 season. On September 18, 2012, he also won the UAE Super Cup with Al Ain. 
He then repeated the performance the following season, winning a consecutive title for Al Ain. In June 2013, Olăroiu signed a contract extension with Al Ain reportedly worth €4 million a season after penning new two-year deal. However, the contract was terminated on 1 July 2013.
Al Ahli.
On 6 July 2013, it was announced that Olăroiu signed a three-year contract with Dubai side Al Ahli. On 30 August, Olăroiu won his first match in charge of Al Ahli against his former club Al Ain in the Super Cup final. In April 2014, Cosmin Olăroiu mathematically won his third consecutive league title as Al Ahli won over arch rivals Al Wasl 2–1. During his first season in charge, Olăroiu won three domestic titles and was awarded as Coach of the Year by the Arabian Gulf League in 2014.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor

There are two known receptors for the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) termed VPAC1 and VPAC2. These receptors bind both VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) to some degree. Both receptors are members of the 7 transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family.
VPAC1 is distributed widely in the CNS, liver, lung, intestine and T-lymphocytes. 
VPAC2 is found in the CNS, pancreas, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, adipose tissue, testis, and stomach.
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) receptors are activated by the endogenous peptides VIP, PACAP-38, PACAP-27, peptide histidine isoleucineamide (PHI), peptide histidine methionineamide (PHM) and peptide histidine valine (PHV). “PACAP type II receptors” (VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors) display comparable affinity for PACAP and VIP, whereas PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 are >100 fold more potent than VIP as agonists of most isoforms of the PAC1 receptor.

Days of Glory (2006 film)

Days of Glory (; ) is a 2006 French film directed by Rachid Bouchareb. The cast includes Sami Bouajila, Jamel Debbouze, Samy Naceri, Roschdy Zem, Mélanie Laurent and Bernard Blancan.
The film deals with the discriminatory treatment of North Africa soldiers serving in the Free French Forces during the Second World War. The film's release contributed to a partial recognition of the pension rights of soldiers from the former French colonies by the French government.
Plot.
The film begins in North Africa where large numbers of "indigènes" (French Algerian "Tirailleurs" as well as Tunisian or "Moroccan Goumiers") have been recruited into the French First Army of the Free French Forces, that has been formed to liberate France of the Nazi occupation in World War II.
Saïd, an impoverished goat herder, joins the 7th Algerian Tirailleur Regiment. With him are several other Berber men, including Yassir, who is seeking booty so that he can return home and his brother can marry; Messaoud, who wants to marry and settle in France; and literate Corporal Abdelkader, who is fighting for the equality and rights of the colonized Algerians.
Soon the men, dressed in lend-lease American uniforms meet Sergeant Martinez, a battle-hardened pied noir, who trains them before leading them on their first mission in the Italian Campaign. Their mission is to capture a heavily-defended mountain from the Germans. It soon becomes clear that their white commanding officer is using the colonial troops as cannon fodder to identify artillery targets. The African troops eventually succeed, but the tactics result in high casualties among the colonial troops. When asked by a French war correspondent about his thoughts on the losses, the white colonel replies, "today was a great victory for the Free French Forces".
The troops of the 7th ATR are transported to France to participate in Operation Dragoon to liberate the south of France. While aboard ship, a white cook refuses to give tomatoes to black soldiers. Abdelkader calls for equality but the mutiny is averted when Martinez and the company Captain assures everyone will be treated the same.
On arrival at Marseille, the colonial troops are greeted as heroes. Messaoud, meets and courts Irène, a French woman; When his regiment leaves, he promises to write and to return. She says she'll wait for him and they will marry. However, due to French censorship of mail between Arab men and white French women, Irène never learns Messaoud's fate.
Saïd becomes Martinez's orderly, for which the other soldiers call him "wench". Eventually, he snaps and holds a knife to Messaoud's throat. Abdelkader calms the situation, but Saïd makes it clear that in this segregated world the French authorities will not give their African soldiers anything. While drinking with the sergeant, Saïd mentions they are similar, as he had seen the picture of Martinez with his Arab mother; the NCO—a self-hating Arab—attacks him, and threatens to kill Saïd if he reveals this secret.
The colonial troops discover that while they are not allowed breaks, the white Free French Forces are given leave to return home in France. Eventually, the troops are told they are going home, but it's a ruse; instead, they are billeted behind the lines and given a ballet performance. Bored and disillusioned, most leave the tent and hold a meeting outside decrying the injustice. Martinez challenges the group, led by Abdelkader, and a fight starts.
Early the next morning, French MPs bring Messaoud to a temporary stockade where Abdelkader is also being held. Messaoud says he was arrested for trying to go back to Marseille and find Irène. Abdelkader is brought before the white Colonel who tells him that he needs him to go on a special mission: to take ammunition to American troops fighting in the Lorraine Campaign and also be the first French troops to liberate Alsace. The white officer promises that Abdelkader and the other African soldiers will get the rewards and recognition that success in this operation demands. Later, the white company captain tells the corporal that the colonel will keep his word.
Most of the men are killed by a booby trap, including Yassir's brother, as they cross the German lines. Martinez has been severely injured. Most of the troops want to return to their side, but Abdelkader rallies them to push on. Eventually, the corporal, Saïd, Messaoud, Yassir and Martinez reach an Alsatian village. Over the next few days the soldiers ingratiate themselves into the area, and Saïd befriends a milkmaid. A battle begins when a company of Germans arrive, and everyone except Abdelkader is killed. However just as the corporal is cornered more colonial troops arrive and drive the Germans out of the village.
As columns of Free French forces begin to move through the area, Abdelkader sees the colonel passing in his jeep, but the white commanding officer ignores him and he is pulled away by a staff officer who asks him where his unit is. When Abdelkader says they are all dead, he is simply assigned to another white NCO. As he walks out of the village, he passes a film cameraman filming only white troops standing by the liberated villagers.
The movie then moves to the present day. An elderly Abdelkader visits a war cemetery in Alsace to visit the graves of his comrades: Martinez, Saïd, Yassir and Messaoud. He then returns to his small rundown flat in modern-day France. The film then concludes with the caption to say that the servicemen from France's former colonies living in France had their pensions frozen in 1959 shortly before their various countries of origin's independence.
Modern relevance.
While each has his own motives, these native Africans have enlisted to fight for a France they have never seen. In the words of "Le Chant des Africains" the four actors sing within the film, "we come from the colonies to save the motherland, we come from afar to die, we are the men of Africa." The film shows a complex depiction of their treatment in an army organisation prejudiced in favour of the European French.
The discrimination by the French authorities against these soldiers continued as successive French governments froze the war pensions of these indigenous veterans when their countries became independent. The closing credits of the film state that, despite the ruling that war pensions should be paid in full, successive French administrations since 2002 had not done so. It was only after the film's release that the government policy was changed to bring foreign combatant pensions into line with what French veterans are paid. But, as of 2010, no war pension in arrears (almost 40 years) have been considered.
In 2009, the BBC published documentary evidence that showed black colonial soldiers - who together with North African troops made up around two-thirds of Free French forces - were deliberately removed from the units that led the Allied advance to liberate Paris in 1944. General Charles de Gaulle, made it clear that he wanted Free French troops to enter the French capital first. In response Allied Command therefore insisted that all black soldiers should be replaced by white and North African ones from other French units.
Julian Jackson : "Once Vichy-ite Algeria had been conquered by the Allies, de Gaulle was finally allowed to go there, in May 1943. Now Algiers replaced London and Brazzaville as the capital of the Free French. Even more important was the fact that Algeria contained an important reservoir of North African troops. At the end of 1942 de Gaulle's total forces never numbered more than 50000, but now, in 1943, thanks to Algeria, he had an army of about half a million men. This multi-racial army was first thrown into battle in Italy in 1943 - it fought at the Battle of Monte Cassino - then landed with Americans in southern France in August 1944. But the Americans and British were agreed that for symbolic reasons the French should also be involved in operations in Normandy - for this reason the 2nd Armored Division of Leclerc was sent over to Britain from northern France, - in the words of one senior American general it was, 'the only French division which could be made 100% white'...Even if it was not at de Gaulle's instigation, it doesn't seem he particularly objected to this white-washing of the last stages of the Free French epic. The French were quick to forget that it was thanks to their colonial soldiers that they had any claim to have re-entered the war in 1944 as a great power." 
Awards.
Jamel Debbouze, Samy Naceri, Roschdy Zem, Sami Bouajila and Bernard Blancan won the "Prix d'interprétation masculine" at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to "The Lives of Others".

Pinus maximartinezii

Pinus maximartinezii, called Martinez pinyon or big-cone pinyon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to central Mexico. The range is highly localised, confined to a small area of the southern Sierra Madre Occidental in southern Zacatecas. It occurs at moderate altitudes, from 1800-2400 m and 21° North latitude, in warm and temperate, dry climate conditions.
It is a small tree, reaching 5-15 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The bark is brown, thick and fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in fascicles of five, slender, 7-13 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The cones are ovoid, massive, 15-27 cm long and 8-14 broad and up to 2 kg weight when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 26–28 months old, with very thick, woody scales, typically 30-60 fertile scales. The cones open to 10-15 cm broad when mature. The seeds are 2-3 cm long, with a thick shell, with a vestigial 1-2 mm wing; the seedlings have 18-24 cotyledons, the highest number reported for any plant.
Because of its isolation in a remote area, it escaped discovery until 1964, when the Mexican botanist Jerzy Rzedowski noticed some unusually large pine nuts ("piñones") sold in the markets of local villages, and investigated the area to find their source. It differs from all other pinyon species in that it has very massive cones and large seeds. Like other pinyons, the seeds are edible; this represents a threat to the species' survival, as the majority of the seeds produced are harvested, limiting natural regeneration of the pines.
It has started being cultivated recently and is a very attractive tree as ornamental. The Mexican government has declared this species endangered.

Sophie Maslow

Sophie Maslow (March 22, 1911 - June 25, 2006) was an American choreographer, modern dancer and teacher, and founding member of New Dance Group. She was a first cousin of the American sculptor Leonard Baskin.
Born in New York City in 1911 by Russian American parents, Sophie Maslow began her dance training with Blanche Talmud at the Neighborhood Playhouse School.

Molson Indy Vancouver

Molson Indy Vancouver was an annual Champ Car race held in a street circuit near BC Place and running past Science World (Vancouver) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada held in July or August from 1990 to 2004. 
On September 2, 1990, the first race took place on the original circuit, which was won by Al Unser Jr. From 1998 a new circuit was created to the east of the old Pacific Place, where only a small part of the original circuit was used. The circuit was popular with drivers and often produced an entertaining race. However, from 2004, Vancouver was left off the Champ Car fixture list, and no race has taken place since.
Controversy and cancellation.
For much of its time in Vancouver, the Molson Indy was a source of considerable local controversy, as local residents complained of the noise and disruption caused by this major event. As the lands of the former Expo 86 site were developed into the billion-dollar condominium development by Concord Pacific, debates raged over whether the Indy made Vancouver a "world-class city" or an "urban nightmare." Such debates were chronicled by Mark Douglas Lowes in his 2002 book, "Indy Dreams and Urban Nightmares: Speed Merchants, Spectacle, and the Struggle over Public Space in the World-Class City." 
The only official explanation for the cancellation came from an Associated Press article stating "Indy-car race in Vancouver canceled: The Molson Indy Vancouver race was canceled after 15 years. 'The bottom line is the business model couldn't work,' said Jo-Ann McArthur, president of sponsoring Molson Sports and Entertainment."
Deaths.
At the inaugural race in 1990, a track worker pushing a car on the racing circuit was struck by another car after accidentally getting caught in its path. The worker, Jean Patrick Hein, was slammed to the ground and run over after running in front of Willy T. Ribbs' car and colliding with Ribbs' rear tire. Footage of the incident is included in the shock reality compilation Traces of Death.

Donald Henry Gaskins

Donald Henry "Pee Wee" Gaskins, Jr. (March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American serial killer.
Early life.
Gaskins was born in Florence County, South Carolina. His mother's name was Parrott and he was the last in the string of illegitimate children. His early life was characterized by neglect and regular beatings from his various "step-fathers." He was small for his age and immediately gained the nickname Pee Wee. His mother apparently took so little interest in him that the first time he learned his given name—Donald—was when it was read out in his first court appearance. The court appearance had followed a brief crime spree he and a few of his fellow school dropouts had taken. They gang-raped the sister of one of the dropouts and committed a string of robberies. They were arrested after a witness was able to identify them to the police after surviving a hatchet assault. As a result, Gaskins was sent to reform school.
While in reform school, Gaskins was regularly raped by his fellow inmates. He was released at the age of 18 in 1951 and briefly worked on a tobacco plantation, but he was arrested in 1953 and charged with attempted murder after using a hammer to attack a teenage girl whom he claimed had been insulting him. Gaskins was sentenced to six years imprisonment at the Central Correctional Institution. He was raped again in prison, but this time he fought back and cut the throat of his attacker, Hazel Brazell. As a result, he received an extra three years in prison, but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to Florida, where he took employment with a traveling carnival. He was re-arrested, remanded to custody, and paroled in August 1961.
Second arrest and subsequent murders.
Following his release from prison, Gaskins reverted to committing burglaries and fencing stolen property. Two years after his parole, Gaskins was arrested for the rape of a twelve-year-old girl; he absconded whilst awaiting sentence, but was rearrested in Georgia, and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Gaskins was paroled in November 1968.
Upon his release, Gaskins moved to the town of Sumter and began work with Fort Roofing company. His first non-prison-related victim was a hitchhiker he tortured and murdered in September 1969, before drowning her body in a swamp. In his memoirs, he wrote: "All I could think about is how I could do anything I wanted to her." This hitchhiker was to be the first of many he picked up and killed while driving around the coastal highways of the American South. He classified these victims as "Coastal Kills": people, both male and female, whom he killed purely for pleasure, on average approximately once every six weeks, when he went hunting to quell his feelings of "bothersome-ness". He tortured and mutilated his victims, while attempting to keep them alive for as long as possible. He confessed to killing these victims using a variety of methods including stabbing, suffocation, mutilation, and even claimed to have cannibalized some of them. He later confessed to killing "eighty to ninety" such victims, although this figure has never been corroborated.
In November 1970, Gaskins committed the first of his so-called "Serious Murders": people whom he knew and killed for personal reasons. Gaskins' first "Serious Murder" victims was his own niece, Janice Kirby, aged 15, and her friend Patricia Ann Alsbrook, aged 17, both of whom he beat to death after attempting to sexually assault them in Sumter, South Carolina. Other "Serious Murder" victims were killed for a variety of reasons: because they had mocked Gaskins, attempted to blackmail him, owed him money, because they had stolen from him, or because Gaskins had been paid to kill his victim. Unlike his "Coastal Kills", Gaskins simply executed these victims, usually by shooting them, before burying them around the coastal areas of South Carolina. In 1973, he committed one of his more gruesome murders when he raped and murdered two of his neighbors: Doreen Dempsey, aged 23 and 8 months pregnant, and her one-year-old daughter. Nobody suspected that Gaskins was a sadistic serial killer, but there were some who knew that he was prepared to commit murder for a reasonable reward. In February 1975, a woman named Suzanne Kipper Owens hired Gaskins to kill her boyfriend, Silas Barnwell Yates. In order to cover up the murder, Gaskins ended up killing four more times. 
Final arrest.
Gaskins was arrested on November 14, 1975, when a criminal associate, named Walter Neeley, confessed to police that he had witnessed Gaskins having killed Dennis Bellamy, aged 28, and Johnny Knight, aged 15. Neeley confessed to police that Gaskins had confided in him to having killed several people who had been listed as missing persons over the previous five years, and had indicated to him where they were buried. On December 4, 1975, Gaskins led police to land he owned in Prospect, where police discovered the bodies of eight of his victims.
Imprisonment.
Gaskins was tried on eight charges of murder on May 24, 1976, found guilty on May 28 and sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life in prison, when the South Carolina General Assembly's 1974 death sentence ruling was changed to conform to the United States Supreme Court guidelines for the death penalty in other states.
On September 2, 1982, Gaskins committed another murder, for which he earned the title of the "Meanest Man in America". While incarcerated in the high security block at the South Carolina Correctional Institution, Gaskins killed a death row inmate named Rudolph Tyner, who earned his sentence for killing an elderly couple named Bill and Myrtle Moon during a bungled armed robbery on the store they owned in the Burgess community.
Gaskins was hired to commit this murder by Tony Cimo, son of Myrtle Moon. Gaskins initially made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Tyner by lacing his food and drink with poison before he opted to use explosives to kill him. To accomplish this, Gaskins rigged a device similar to a portable radio in Tyner's death row cell and told Tyner this would allow them to "communicate between cells". When Tyner followed Gaskins' instructions to hold a speaker (laden with C-4 plastic explosive, unbeknownst to him) to his ear at an agreed time, Gaskins detonated the explosives in his cell and killed him. Gaskins later said, "The last thing he heard was me laughing."
Gaskins was tried for the murder of Rudolph Tyner and sentenced to death. He is the only man to have ever killed an inmate on death row.
Final Truth.
While on death row, Gaskins told his life story to a journalist named Wilton Earle, confessing to having committed between 100 and 110 murders, one of them being that of Margaret "Peg" Cuttino, the 13-year-old daughter of then SC state senator James Cuttino, Jr. of Sumter, SC. However, law enforcement sources found it impossible to verify all of his claims. In his autobiography, "Final Truth," Gaskins wrote that he had "a special mind" that gave him "permission to kill."
Execution.
Gaskins was executed on September 6, 1991, at 1:10 a.m. He was the fourth person to die in the electric chair after the death penalty was reinstated in South Carolina in 1977. Only hours before he was escorted to the electric chair at Broad River Correctional Institution, Gaskins tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor blade he had swallowed the previous week, then coughed up. His last words were, “I’ll let my lawyers talk for me. I’m ready to go.”

Brian Saah

Brian Ebo Saah (born 16 December 1986) is an English footballer who plays for Dagenham & Redbridge as a defender.
Club career.
Leyton Orient.
Saah started his career in the youth system at Leyton Orient, making his debut at the age of sixteen in a 3–0 defeat to Huddersfield Town in September 2003. Despite starting as a central midfielder, Saah was converted to a central defender and won praise for his displays deputising for first team regulars John Mackie and Gabriel Zakuani during the 2005–06 promotion season to Football League One. At the end of the season he was rewarded with his first professional contract. He began to establish himself in the side and become a first team regular during the 2006–07 season, and was rewarded with a new two-year contract in March 2007. There was also speculation that Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur had offered £2,000,000 for the defender, after scouts had been sent to see him action. However, Orient manager Martin Ling rubbished the story saying the offer would have been accepted, but still claimed that Saah was the best defender outside the Football League Championship. Saah featured quite frequently over the next two seasons but was released at the end of his contract in May 2009, after making a total of 110 appearances scoring twice. 
Cambridge United.
Following his release from Orient, he spent time in pre-season at Southend United and Tranmere Rovers on trial, featuring in friendlies against Dagenham & Redbridge and Shrewsbury Town. In August 2009, Saah dropped into the non-league game, re-uniting with former Orient boss Martin Ling at Conference Premier side Cambridge United. He started in all of the U's first seventeen league games, scoring twice before a double hernia operation in November kept him out of action for six weeks. In May 2010, he signed a new two-year contract extension after in impressive first season where he made 33 league appearances and came runner-up in the Internet Player of the Year awards. He was also made club captain, taking some off-field responsibilities away from team captain Paul Carden. In January 2011, Saah found himself playing in a defensive midfield role which coincided with two back-to-back away victories. In total, Saah made eighty appearances for Cambridge scoring eight times.
Torquay United.
In July 2011, Saah signed for Football League Two side Torquay United reuniting again with Martin Ling, despite him having a year to run on his Cambridge contract. The club didn't want him to leave, but he didn't fit into the new wage structure that the club adopted as they had to slash the playing budget by twenty-five per cent. He was made club captain in his first season at the club as the Gulls missed out on promotion via the play-offs with defeat to Cheltenham Town. Saah again remained a first team regular with Torquay during his second season with the club making 46 appearances, but rejected the offer of a new contract and chose to leave the Gulls in the summer of 2013. He state that he wanted to find a club nearer his family home in London as his son was starting school. He left having played a total of 86 games, scoring twice.
Dagenham & Redbridge.
In July 2013, he signed for his hometown club Dagenham & Redbridge in League Two on a two-year contract, after impressing in pre-season friendlies. In his first season with the club he forged a strong partnership with Scott Doe as the Daggers finished in the top half narrowly avoiding the play-offs. Featuring 48 times for the club, he was also named as runner-up in the Player of the Year awards.
International career.
In May 2010, Saah was called-up to an eighteen-man squad to play for England C for an International Challenge Trophy match against the Republic of Ireland in Waterford. However, he remained an unused substitute in a 2–1 England win.
He made his debut for the side in September 2010, playing in a 2–2 draw with the Wales Semi-Pro team, replacing Aden Flint as a substitute.

Peter Craven

Peter Theodore Craven (21 June 1934 – 24 September 1963) was an English motorcycle racer. He was a finalist in each FIM Speedway World Championship from 1954 to 1963 and he won the title twice (in 1955 and 1962). He was British Champion in 1962 and 1963.
Personal life.
Craven was born in Liverpool and had four sisters and an older brother, Brian, who also became a speedway rider. He also had a twin brother who died at an early age. He got his first racing experience when he started participating in cycle speedway.
Career.
Peter Craven got his first taste of motorcycle speedway racing in 1949 at the Stanley Stadium, Prescot Road, Liverpool. He visited the stadium a day after his sixteenth birthday and drove a few laps on his brother's bike, before hitting the safety fence and sustaining a concussion. He was later given another chance to show his abilities to the Liverpool Chads, but after just one lap he hit the fence again. Despite this, he was included as a reserve in the team's away match against the Leicester Hunters. 
He made eight league appearances for the Liverpool Chads in Division II during 1951, scoring eight points. and he was with the Chads when they finished thirteenth in Division Two. He also rode for the Fleetwood Flyers. The next year, he made 10 league appearances equally divided between Manchester’s Belle Vue and the Liverpool Chads. 
Craven made his Belle Vue debut on 17 May 1952 when he scored two points in a race against the visiting Norwich Stars. That season, he made four more league appearances for Belle Vue, but he only managed to score one point in those races combined.
In 1953, Peter became a regular Aces rider and scored 70 points in 12 matches, but the British Army required his services, and he missed several matches. 
He continued racing for Belle Vue during his national service. During 1954 he made 24 league appearances and top-scored for his club. He qualified for his first Wembley World final and scored one point more than the brilliant Swedish rider Ove Fundin. About this time as a young man he owned his Jowett Jupiter road car which still exists. In 1955, on his second try, Peter sensationally won the first of his two FIM World Championships at Wembley. 
In 1958, Peter captained the English team against Sweden in Sweden, finishing top scorer; he also top-scored in the five-test series against Australasia.
In 1959 he took on Ove Fundin and won the Golden Helmet Match Race Championship, the Champions of Champions Cup at Poole; the Northern Cup at Belle Vue; the Internationale Derby at Ipswich; the Pride of the East at Norwich; the Tom Farndon Memorial Trophy at New Cross; the Champagne Derby again at Belle Vue, the CTS Trophy at Norwich and the Pride of the Midlands at Leicester.
In 1960 Peter came third in the World Championship final staged at Wembley when Ove Fundin beat Ronnie Moore into second place after a thrilling run off, all three riders having scored an equal number of points after their five rides. During 1961 he captained the Lions on a tour to Austria. He came third in the first FIM Internationale Individual Trophy meeting at the Harringay Stadium and was second in the British Final at Wembley.
Craven's son Robert was also a speedway rider.
Death.
1962 was another good year for Peter. He followed his three British Championship victories by carrying off his second World Individual Championship at Wembley in front of 62,000 fans. But in 1963 he died as a result of a freak racing accident in a challenge match at Edinburgh's Old Meadowbank stadium on 20 September 1963. While taking evasive action to avoid hitting fallen race leader George Hunter who suffered engine failure, Peter hit a fence. The unconscious Craven was rushed to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where his family remained at his bedside until he died at 9.10pm on Tuesday 24 September 1963.
There are allegations made that Peter Craven had started ten yards behind the other riders by way of a handicap. However Peter was actually at the tapes with the other riders but allowed the others to pull away ahead of him to make the racing more exciting. 
Since 1967, there has been a Peter Craven Memorial meeting held intermittently at the Belle Vue Stadium in honour of his memory. Winners of the Memorial have included World Champions Ivan Mauger (the inaugural winner), Ole Olsen, Peter Collins, Greg Hancock and Jason Crump.
His gravestone stands in West Derby Cemetery in Liverpool.

Little Nikita

Little Nikita is a cult 1988 American drama film directed by Richard Benjamin and starring Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix.
Plot.
Jeffrey Nicolas Grant (River Phoenix), a brash hyperactive high school student lives in a San Diego suburb with his parents, who own a successful garden centre. Keen to fly, he has applied for entry to the Air Force Academy.
During a routine background check on Jeff, FBI agent Roy Parmenter (Poitier) finds contradictory information on his parents, making him suspect that all is not as it should be. Further investigations reveal that they may be 'sleeper' agents for the Soviet Union with a teenaged son.
Unable to arrest them as they have not done anything illegal, Roy continues his investigation, moves into the house across the street from the Grant family, and worms his way into their confidence.
He eventually confronts Jeff with his suspicions and seeks Jeff's cooperation to learn more about his parents. Initially unbelieving, Jeff is soon forced to accept the facts and discovers that even his name is fictitious and that his real name is Nikita.
Roy confides to Jeff that twenty years earlier, his partner was killed by a Soviet agent, known only as 'Scuba' (Richard Lynch), and that he is still at large. It transpires that 'Scuba' is now a rogue agent, killing KGB agents one by one, including "sleepers". Meanwhile, a Soviet spy-catcher, Konstantin Karpov (Richard Bradford), has been sent from the Soviet embassy in Mexico to 'reel in' Scuba.
Jeff is captured and held as a hostage at gunpoint by Karpov, as he and 'Scuba' make their way to the Mexican border on the San Diego Trolley. Roy has also confronted them and is holding Karpov at gunpoint. At the border, the situation resolves itself; Karpov and 'Scuba' cross into Mexico, and the Grant family remain in the United States.
Cast.
Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix would team up again in the 1992 feature "Sneakers".
Reception.
The movie received mixed reviews and holds a "Rotten" score of 55% on Rotten Tomatoes. Walter Goodman said that Benjamin's directing strategy in the film "seems to have been to paper over the holes in the plot with routine moves from spy shows past, in hopes of making the improbable passable." Roger Ebert awarded the film one and a half stars, suspecting that Poitier and the makers of the film had no idea of how to use a computer, and that "it turns all of the characters into chess pieces, whose relationships depend on the plot, not on human chemistry. Since the plot is absurdly illogical, you're not left with much."
Box office.
It grossed $866,398 on its opening weekend. It went on to make $1.7 million in North America.

The school takes in pupils graduating from the PHM's three middle schools, Schmucker Middle School, Discovery Middle School, and Grissom Middle School, as well as some graduates from local private and religious grade schools and occasionally transfers from neighboring public school districts (primarily South Bend and Mishawaka and other schools). It is the largest high school in the South Bend metropolitan area.
History.
Penn High School was opened on September 1, 1958 following a year of construction and a cost of a million dollars. The first graduating class, the class of 1960, had roughly 200 seniors. Prior to the construction of Penn, students in the Penn and Harris Townships went to Mishawaka High School.
The 1962 merger of the Penn and Harris Township expanded the school system. The following year, Madison Township was also incorporated, creating today's Penn-Harris-Madison school district.
Penn High School continued to expand in the following years. By 1965, the school district was attended by over 1600 students. In the late 1980s, the school underwent renovations to enlarge the school.
Academics.
Penn High School students are divided into several academies. Freshmen are sorted into 6 freshman academies known as houses. Each house consists of roughly 160 students taught by the same core teachers. Prior to junior year, students choose to be a part of one of four academies: Fine Arts, STEM, Management and Business, and Health and Human Services.
Penn High School offers 19 Advanced Placement classes along with several Advanced College Project classes through a partnership with Indiana colleges. GPA is calculated on a 4.0 scale with college courses assigned a weighted grade that is on a 5.0 scale. Based on AP exam participation and passing rate, Penn students have a College Readiness Index of 30.0/100.0.
For the class of 2012, Penn achieved a graduation rate of over 96%. 93% of students passed the state's English graduation exam while 91% passed Indiana's math graduation exam. 26% of Penn students scored a three or higher on an Advanced Placement exam.

Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia

Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia (22 August 1903, Mikhailovskoe, Russia – 17 September 1965, Glen Cove, New York) was the daughter of Grand Duke George Mihailovich of Russia and Princess Maria Georgievna of Greece and Denmark.
Youth.
Her older sister was Princess Nina Georgievna, born in 1901. She and her sister left Russia in 1914 to spend the war years in England with their mother. In 1919, her father, his brother, Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, and their cousin, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, were executed by a Bolshevik firing squad in St. Petersburg. 
Anna Anderson controversy.
In the summer of 1927, Xenia involved herself in the Anna Anderson/Anastasia Tchaikovsky affair by telephoning Gleb Botkin (son of imperial physician Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered along with the former tsar and his family in 1918) with an invitation for Anna to live as a guest at Kenwood. Xenia explains her hospitality: "I had heard that Botkin was arranging to bring 'the invalid' to the United States through a newspaper organization. This bothered me because I had heard so many conflicting stories. It then occurred to me that I should take her myself and avoid all this proposed publicity. For if she were indeed an impostor it would save much unpleasantness for my family, and if she were the real Anastasia it was ghastly to think that nothing was being done for her... This solution would be simple, so it seemed to me."
As children, Xenia and her sister Nina had played frequently with the two youngest daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, Grand Duchesses Maria Nikolaevna and Anastasia Nikolaevna, as well as the youngest child and only boy, Tsarevitch Alexei. Through her father, Xenia was Anastasia's second cousin, once removed and through her mother they were second cousins. Both sisters possessed vivid memories of Anastasia, whom they described as ""frightfully temperamental"" and ""wild and rough"". According to Xenia, Anastasia "cheated at games, kicked, scratched, pulled hair, and generally knew how to make herself obnoxious."
Princess Nina even said, "Anastasia was madly jealous of me because I was taller than she was. As the daughter of the Emperor she thought she ought to tower over everyone."
Xenia was on a cruise with her husband William in the West Indies at the time of Anna's arrival in New York. She had arranged for Anna to stay with Annie Burr Jennings, a friend of Xenia's who lived in a Park Avenue townhouse. Upon her return, Xenia sneaked unannounced into Annie Jennings's crowded salon to observe Anna. After watching Anna offer her hand to Gleb Botkin, Xenia declared that she knew she was watching an equal. She stated, "It was so matter-of-course, so unforced--in no way a theatrical gesture. With it she radiated a natural grandeur and I was impressed on the spot."
Xenia recognized Anna Anderson as the Grand Duchess Anastasia at once, asserting that Anna was herself at all times, never giving the slightest impression of playing a part. The two remained great friends for life even after Anna Anderson had to leave Xenia's home after quarreling. Prince Christopher of Greece described the stay:
Criticisms of her behaviour.
Pierre Gilliard, Swiss citizen and French tutor for the five children of Tsar Nicholas II from 1905 to 1918, pointed out that Princess Xenia had last seen her second cousin when Xenia was 10 and Anastasia was 12. Xenia responded that she did not recognize Anastasia visually, but felt she was qualified to tell the difference between a member of the Romanov family and a "Polish peasant woman." Anderson bore a strong family resemblance to Tsarina Alexandra's family and her moodiness and temper also reminded Xenia of her cousin Anastasia. It is interesting to note what Prince Dmitri, son of Grand Duchess Xenia, wrote about what Princess Xenia had stated,
Personal life.
Xenia married twice, both times with men of unequal birth, first to William Bateman Leeds (19 September 1902 - 31 December 1971) at the age of eighteen, the son and heir of the American tin magnate. William was also the stepson of Xenia's maternal uncle Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark. They wed in Paris on 9 October 1921. Theirs was seen as a splendid match and the couple was an influential one in New York's "Long Island North Shore" society, where they lived at their estate, Kenwood, in Oyster Bay. Xenia and William had a daughter on 25 February 1925, Nancy Helen Marie Leeds, who married Edward Judson Wynkoop, Jr. in December 1945.
Xenia and William Leeds divorced in 1930. Her second marriage was with Herman Jud (14 February 1911 - 22 August 1987). The wedding took place at Glen Cove, New York on 10 August 1946. The couple had no children.
A common mistake in listing this family is to identify the daughter of Nancy Helen Marie Wynkoop (née Leeds) incorrectly as being, instead, the daughter of Princess Xenia Georgievna by her second husband. This daughter, Alexandra Leeds Wynkoop, is erroneously and often listed as Alexandra Leeds Jud, born 30 March 1959. Alexandra is the granddaughter of Princess Xenia Georgievna, born when her grandmother was 56 years of age.
Death.
Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova Leeds Jud died on 17 September 1965, aged 62, survived by her second husband and by her daughter, Nancy Leeds Wynkoop, and by granddaughter Alexandra. Nancy Helen Marie Leeds Wynkoop died in Woodstock, Vermont on 7 June 2006, aged 81, survived by her husband Edward Judson Wynkoop, Jr. and their daughter Alexandra Wynkoop.

Canadian Music Centre

The Canadian Music Centre holds Canada's largest collection of Canadian concert music. The CMC exists to promote the works of its Associate Composers in Canada and around the world. The Centre was founded in 1959 by a group of Canadian composers who saw a need to create a repository for Canadian music.
Initially the Centre focused on collecting and cataloguing serious musical works, developing a catalogue of music scores, copying and duplicating the music, and making them available for loan, both nationally and internationally. The Centre makes available on loan 18,000 scores and/or works by almost 700 Canadian contemporary music composers through its lending library. The CMC sells more than 900 CD titles featuring music of its Associate Composers and other Canadian independent recording producers.
The Centre also offers an on-demand printing and binding service, music repertoire consultations, and is easily accessible through five regional centres across Canada, as well as through its website. The CMC also engages in a number of national outreach projects, is digitizing all its scores and works, conducts research, and administers several awards. The Ann Southam Audio Archive, administered by the CMC, holds the largest cumulative collection of recorded Canadian concert works in the world.
In 1981, the Centre established the Centrediscs recording label, the only label devoted entirely to Canadian concert music. The Centrediscs label has received numerous awards, including six JUNOs, an East Coast Music Award, six West Coast Music Awards, and two Grande Prix du Disque Canada. 
Today the organization includes a national office in Toronto and five regional centres (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, and Sackville). The CMC regional branches include 837 Davie Street in Vancouver, the University of Calgary music library in Calgary, Chalmers House (20 St. Joseph Street) in Toronto, 416 McGill Street (an Old Montreal heritage site) in Montreal, and at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.

Thrombin receptor

There are three known thrombin receptors termed PAR1, PAR3 and PAR4 (PAR for protease-activated receptor). 
These receptors are members of the 7 transmembrane g protein-coupled family of receptors, however, their method of activation is unique. Thrombin, a serine protease, binds to and cleaves the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor. A tethered ligand corresponding to the new N-terminus, SFLLRN, is then unmasked, binding to the second extracellular loop of the receptor and activating it.

William Comyn, Lord of Badenoch

William Comyn was one of four sons (and three daughters) of Richard Comyn, Justiciar of Lothian and Hextilda of Tynedale. He was born in Scotland, in Altyre, Moray in 1163 and died in Buchan in 1233 where he is buried in Deer Abbey. He was Lord of Badenoch and was earl-consort of Buchan.
William made his fortune in the service of king William I of Scotland fighting the Meic Uilleim in the north. William witnesses no less than 88 charters of the king. William was sheriff of Forfar (1195-1211), Justiciar of Scotia (1205-33) and warden of Moray (1211-2). Between 1199 and 1200, William was sent to England to discuss important matters on King William's behalf with the new king, John.
William was appointed to the prestigious office of Justiciar of Scotia, the most senior royal office in the kingdom, in 1205. Between 1211 and 1212, William, as Warden of Moray (or "Guardian of Moray") fought against the insurgency of Gofraid mac Domnaill (of the Meic Uilleim family), who William beheaded in Kincardine in 1213. Upon finally destroying the Meic Uilleim's in 1229, he was given the Lordship of Badenoch and the lands it controlled.
From an unknown date, William held the title Lord of Kilbride.
He helped oversee the construction of St Mungo's Cathedral in Glasgow and after his death, Marjory continued his work there.
Earl of Buchan.
During his period as Warden of Moray, Comyn was so successful, it may have been the reason he received the hand of Marjory (aka. "Margaret"), Countess of Buchan, sometime between 1209-1212. Her father Fergus, Earl of Buchan, had no male heirs and so in marrying his daughter to William he ensured a suitable line for his titles before his death. Dying sometime around 1214 (perhaps earlier) William took over the management of the mormaerdom (earldom) of Bucham, by right of his wife.
Family tree.
William (is believed to have) had six children through his first wife Sarah Fitzhugh and eight through Marjory, Countess of Buchan. The two branches would be associated with the Lordship of Badenoch through his first wife and the Earldom of Buchan through the second. For the historian Alan Young, William's life, and particularly his marriage to the Countess of Buchan, marks the beginning of the "Comyn century".

Benjamin Franklin (clergyman)

Benjamin Franklin (1 February 1812 – 22 October 1878) was an important conservative figure in the American Restoration Movement, especially as the leading antebellum conservative in the northern United States branch of the movement. He is notable as the early and lifelong mentor of Daniel Sommer, whose support of the 1889 Sand Creek Declaration set in motion events which led to the formal division of the Churches of Christ from the Disciples of Christ in 1906.
According to contemporary biographies "His early religious training was according to the Methodist faith, though he never belonged to any church until he united with the Disciples." 
Biography.
Early years.
Born near present-day Belmont County, Ohio in 1812, Franklin was said to be a fourth-generation descendant of a brother of American Revolutionary War figure Benjamin Franklin, for whom he was named. He was the eldest son of a fairly big family.
When Franklin was near 21 years old, thus in late 1832 or early 1833, Franklin's father moved the family to farmland about three miles (5 km) south of Middletown in Henry County, Indiana. Franklin himself purchased .
Career.
Restoration Movement conversion.
In November 1834, pioneer Restoration Movement preacher and elder Samuel Rogers moved to the Falls of Rough Creek in Henry County from Kentucky, becoming a neighbor of the Franklin family.
Rogers began to preach Restoration Movement doctrine using a local schoolhouse to deliver his orations. He was quickly rejected as heretical by the Methodist leadership in the area: however, his family was sympthetic toward the neighbor and soon came under his theological influence. Franklin was baptised by full immersion in 1836 by Rogers near Middletown in Henry County, Indiana, along with many others who were baptised in the same meeting. (One source also credits Elijah Martindale in Franklin's conversion.) Of those baptised at this meeting, six or seven would go on to become preachers in the movement: Franklin, three of his brothers, Eider Adamson, John T. Rogers, and possibly another whose name was forgotten by one of Rogers' biographers.
Early ministry and editorship.
At the Connersville State Meeting in 1842, Franklin was designated as the lead evangelist of the northeastern quarter ("district") of Indiana: the districting plan soon failed for lack of local funds to pay the evangelists' salary of US$500 per year.
Franklin began preaching at New Lisbon, Indiana in 1842. He began publishing his "Reformer" in 1845, soon changing the name to "Western Reformer". He moved to Milton, Indiana in 1846 and published the journal from his own shop. This publication was to be merged with Hall's "Gospel Proclamation" as the "Proclamation and Reformer" in 1850. Franklin served as one of two secretaries at the Disciples' eighth state meeting at Columbus, Indiana, which covened on October 3, 1846.
Later, Franklin published the "Christian Age" with collaborator David S. Burnet. His last publication was the American Christian Review begun in 1856: following Franklin's death the name of the paper would be changed to the Octographic Review. He was said to have influenced the founding of Butler University as well as other national societies, and was also said to have been an abolitionist and pacifist, like many of his contemporaries within the movement.
After changing residences several times in Indiana and Ohio, Franklin settled in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1850, where he remained for 14 years. It was during the 1850s that Franklin changed his views to oppose missionary societies.
"The American Christian Review".
In 1856, Franklin began to publish the ultra-conservative "American Christian Review," which he published until his death in 1878. Its influence, initially considerable, was said to have waned following the American Civil War. Franklin undertook a rigorous program of publication correspondence, and traveling lectures which took him to "many" U. S. states and Canada.
Franklin's last move was to Anderson, Indiana, where he lived from 1864 until his death.
Traveling orator.
In 1871 Franklin gave a series of sermons at Wellsburg, West Virginia. It was here that he attracted the interest of a young Bethany College student named Daniel Sommer, becoming a lifelong mentor of Sommer, who would take up Franklin's mantle as publisher following Franklin's death. Sommer would become notable for his participation in the 1889 Sand Creek "Address and Declaration", a particularly strong statement of exclusivity which helped to drive the split between the Disciples of Christ and more conservative Church of Christ.
Personal life.
Franklin married Mary Personet on 15 December 1833 with whom he had eleven children. Nine survived to adulthood. He died suddenly at his home in Anderson, Indiana.

Antarctic butterfish

The Antarctic butterfish, bluenose warehou, deepsea trevally, blue eye trevalla, bluenose sea bass, or deep sea trevalla, "Hyperoglyphe antarctica", is a medusafish of the family "Centrolophidae" found in all the southern oceans, at depths of between 40 and 1,500 m. Its length is up to about 140 cm, with a maximum published weight of 60 kg.
Antarctic butterfish have a dark blue body above and lighter blue below with large eyes (another name for this fish is big eye). Larger individuals have a bronze sheen along the flanks. 
They can grow to 1.4 m in length and over 50 kg in weight. Studies have shown that fish between 62 and 72 cm are mature and range in age between 8–12 years respectively. Mature females can produce between 2 million and 11 million eggs prior to spawning.
Blue eye mainly feed on the tunicate "Pyrosoma atlantica". However they will feed on a range of fish, molluscs, squid and crustaceans, they are also cannibalistic.
Reproduction and distribution.
Spawning appears to occur in an area north east of Tasmania during March and April.
Little is known about the egg and larval stages of blue eye. Recently Antarctic butterfish of approximately 10 cm have been found living in association with large masses of floating kelp. It is believed that as these juveniles reach 50 cm they become semi-bottom dwelling.
These young fish form schools over hard bottom at depths of around 350–450 m, moving to deeper waters as they grow.

Lingo (Quebec game show)

Lingo is a Quebec game show that ran for 439 episodes on Radio-Canada, from 1998 to 2001. It was hosted by longtime actor and radio/TV host Paul Houde.
Main game.
The object of the game is to score points by taking five guesses at a mystery five-letter word puzzle. If at any time a team makes a mistake, such as taking too long at a guess, misspelling a word, spelling a word that doesn't exist, spelling a word that is not five letters in length, repeats a word already guessed, or the word does not start with the established first letter, control passes over to the other team, who are given a free letter unless only one is missing. The team that guesses the correct word received $50.
Lingo board.
At the start of the match, both teams receive a Lingo board, with the red team playing with odd numbers and the green team playing with even numbers. 8 numbers are marked off each of their boards. Once a team successfully completes a word puzzle, they get the chance to pull two numbered balls (one per player) out of a hopper. Once they complete their Lingo board, by getting 5 in a row across, up or down, or diagonally, they get $100. If however they pull a black ball from the hopper, they lose their turn and control passes over to the other side. (The black ball is called in French "L'infâme boule noire!", which translates to "infamous black ball".)
End of match.
At some point during the match, a bell rang, signifying the match will end after the current puzzle in play. After the puzzle is solved and two balls pulled out, the team with the most money became the day's champions and goes on to the "No Lingo" bonus game. (The match will also end when either: (A) a team solves the puzzle but cannot make a Lingo as a new board requires Lingo to be made in as few as 3 pulls, or (B) when nobody solves the puzzle.) The runners-up receive a consolation prize.
Tiebreaker.
If the match ends in a tie, another five-letter puzzle will be played with the teams alternating lines until one of them correctly guesses the word and wins the match.
No Lingo.
The winners play the "No Lingo" bonus game in which they are presented with a new Lingo board with 12 numbers marked off. Before the first puzzle, they are guaranteed $50 regardless of what happens afterward. That $50 is doubled to $100 for the first puzzle. Puzzles in this part of the game are again 5-letter words with 2 letters given, the first letter of the word and a second letter somewhere else in the word. Each line used adds a Lingo ball to be drawn. If they fail to guess the word after the fifth line, they have to draw 6 balls (1 per each line plus an additional penalty ball because they completely missed the word). Once they make the required number of draws without getting Lingo, or getting a gold ball (known in French as "boule d'or") at any time (which ends that round of draws, but the ball goes back in the hopper for a future draw), they are given the option to take the $100 and quit, or continue on and play for double, going through the same procedure as before, right on up to the $1600 level. Should they avoid getting a Lingo at this point, they will return the next day to defend their championship. If there is any time left in the show, a "sprint" game for $100 a word will be played with only the first letter of each puzzle showing. However, if they do get a Lingo, they lose all the money they accumulated and go all the way back to $50, and then play the "sprint" game to build up as much money as possible until show's end. Also, by virtue of getting a Lingo here, they are retired as champions and two new teams compete the next day.

<doc id="5895458" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895458" title="Prime Minister of Brazil">
Prime Minister of Brazil

During two periods in the political history of Brazil was a parliamentary system of Government put in place, with a prime minister heading the Cabinet. 
The first parliamentary system was created by Emperor Pedro II and was maintained for the last forty two years of the imperial period.
The second occasion in which a parliamentary system was put in place was during the administration of President João Goulart in 1961, due to a constitutional amendment passed by his opponents before his inauguration. The experience of parliamentary government was very brief, as the system of presidential government was restored in a referendum in 1963.
President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire of Brazil (1847–1889).
The political position of Prime Minister of Brazil existed during the era of the Empire of Brazil, first being created in 1847, during the reign of Dom Pedro II.
Officially, the title of the Prime Minister was President of the Council of Ministers and he was referred to by the press and the people as "President of the Cabinet". Often, the title "President of the Council", a shortened version of the official style, was also employed. 
The written Constitution of the Brazilian Empire did not require the Emperor to appoint a prime minister; nor did it provide for a parliamentary system of government, instead vesting the Executive authority in the Emperor himself, and stipulating that the Emperor was to be aided by ministers that he was free to appoint and dismiss. However, Emperor Pedro II decided to appoint a president of the Council among his ministers, to lead the workings of the Government. He also chose to create a sort of parliamentary government, whereby the prime minister would be someone who could command a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower House of the Brazilian Imperial Parliament, known as General Assembly. Therefore, even without being required by the Constitution, the Emperor started to exercise his authority in a manner compatible with parliamentary government, only appointing as prime minister someone who could retain parliamentary support, etc.
However, the emperor didn't become a figurehead monarch like other heads of State in a parliamentary system. The prime minister needed to retain the political confidence both of a majority of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Emperor, who actively scrutinized the workings of the Government. Sometimes the Emperor would dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and summon new elections (a power he possessed under the Constitution), or dismiss the prime minister, due to his own political beliefs about the efficiency of the Government. Thus, the Emperor would often dismiss a prime minister, and then appoint someone else from the same party. All this led to a succession of short-lived Cabinets. The emperor retained decision-making powers with regard to the signature or veto of bills passed by Parliament, and would not always abide by the advice of his ministers. And that was seen as normal given that the monarch wasn't required by the Constitution to reign in a parliamentary system, and the establishment of one was only a limited and voluntary decision of Pedro II.
Therefore, the parliamentary system voluntarily established by Emperor Pedro II wasn't identical to the standard of a parliamentary government with a Head of State that reigns but does not govern, given that the Emperor retained part of the control over the daily affairs of his government. Thus, the parliamentary system that was put in place in the reign of Pedro II can be termed a semi-imperial Government, and can be compared to the political system of some republics, such as France, that are governed under a semi-presidential system, in which the Head of State has more than just the customary reserve powers, but there is also a prime minister who needs to maintain the confidence of Parliament in order to retain his office. 
This co-existence of a Head of State with real powers and influence with a prime minister responsible before Parliament was dubbed by many Brazilian political scientists as "parlamentarismo às avessas" (backwards parliamentarism), a criticism corresponding to their view that, in the parliamentary system created by Emperor Pedro II, the Chamber of Deputies was the weaker party, and the survival of the Cabinet depended more on the confidence of the Emperor than in that of Parliament. 
Shortcomings in party loyalty, with members of Parliament and groups of members rooting for their own interests and not always abiding by the directives of the party leadership also contributed greatly to short-lived Cabinets. Indeed, it was very common a Prime Minister to be replaced due to lack of support from his party's backbenchers, causing the Prime Minister to be replaced with somebody else from the same party, during the same Parliament. 
During the forty-nine years of Pedro II's personal reign, from 1840 until 1889 there were sixteen parliamentary elections (eleven provoked by the dissolution of Parliament by the Emperor at the Prime Minister's request, with the summoning of new elections, and five others provoked by the expiration of the term of office of the members of the Chamber of Deputies). This means that, on average, each legislature of the Chamber of Deputies had a life span slightly superior to three years. However, in the forty two years between the creation of the office of Prime Minister in 1847 and its abolition in 1889, there were thirty two appointments to the presidency of the Council, which means that prime ministerships lasted on average a little more than a year and four months. Certain politicians, however, like the Duke of Caxias, the Viscount, later Marquis of Olinda, and Zacarias Góis e Vasconcellos managed to regain the prime ministership after having lost it. Caxias and Zacarias Góis e Vasconcellos each served three times as President of the Council, while Olinda held the office of Prime Minister for a record of four times.
The president of the Council owed his position to both his party's majority in the Legislature (and to his party's willingness to support him in the Chamber) and to the Emperor, and these two sources of authority (parliamentary backing and imperial appointment) could sometimes come into conflict. 19th century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said that the "President of the Council in Brazil was no Russian Chancellor, Sovereign's creature, nor a British Prime Minister, made only by the trust of the Commons: the delegation of the Crown was to him as necessary and important as the delegation of the Chamber, and, to exert with safety his functions, he had to dominate the caprice, the oscillations and ambitions of the Parliament, as well as to preserve always unalterable the favor, the good will of the Emperor."
The shortest prime-ministership was the first of the three periods of Zacarias Góis e Vasconcellos in office, when he occupied the presidency of the Council for just a few days in May 1862 before being replaced. The longest continuous prime-ministership corresponded to the period when the Viscount of Rio Branco was in office: he served as President of the Council from March 1871 until June 1875. The Viscount of Rio Branco served as Prime Minister only once, however, and his period of service as Prime Minister is surpassed by the total duration of the four non-consecutive premierships of the Marquis of Olinda, making Olinda the longest serving President of the Council if non-consecutive time is considered.
The position of prime minister was abolished with the deposition of the Monarchy in 1889. 
List of Presidents of the Council of Ministers of the Empire of Brazil.
The proclamation of the Republic as a coup to force the removal of the Prime Minister.
The events of the Brazilian Proclamation of the Republic on November 15, 1889 started as a military coup to remove the Prime Minister; Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, who as the senior military figure in the plot, assumed leadership of the movement, was supporter of the Conservative Party, and he took part in the coup because he was invited by other officers to lead the overthrowal of the Liberal Viscount of Ouro Preto from the Presidency of the Council, but initially Deodoro did not intend to depose Emperor Pedro II. Several of his co-conspirators, however, were Republicans, and later in the day the events of the military coup progressed to the deposition of the Monarchy. The decision to establish a republican Provisional Government was taken when Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca (who had already proclaimed "Long Live His Majesty the Emperor" during the public acts of the coup) received from his republican co-conspirator Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães the false news that the Emperor intended to appoint Gaspar da Silveira Martins, a declared enemy of Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, as the next Prime Minister in the Viscount of Ouro Preto's stead. 
Once the Republic was proclaimed, a presidential Executive replaced the parliamentary system of Government.
President of the Council of Ministers of the United States of Brazil (1961–1963).
After the coup d'état that abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Brazil a republic, the system of parliamentary government was not retained. The new republic instead adopted the model of a presidential executive, except for a brief period (September 7, 1961 to January 23, 1963) during the presidency of President João Goulart.
The parliamentary system was adopted in 1961 as a compromise solution to a grave political crisis, and was again abolished, this time by plebiscite, in January 1963.
The official title of the head of the government during that period was President of the Council of Ministers, the same official title possessed by the 19th-century prime ministers of the Brazilian Empire. However, the holders of the office were informally addressed and referred to as "Premier" or "Prime Minister". Often, the expression "President of the Council", a simplified version of the official title, was also used.

Georgy Sviridov

Georgy Vasilyevich Sviridov (Russian: Гео́ргий Васи́льевич Свири́дов; his patronymic is also transliterated "Vasil'yevich", "Vasilievich", and "Vasil'evich") (December 16, 1915 – January 5, 1998) was a Soviet neoromantic composer.
Early life and youth.
Sviridov was born in 1915 in the town of Fatezh in the Kursk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Kursk Oblast) in a family of Russian ethnicity. His father, Vasily Sviridov, a sympathizer of the Bolshevik cause during the Russian Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, was killed when Georgy was four. The family moved to Kursk, where Sviridov, still in elementary school, learned to play his first instrument, the balalaika. Learning to play by ear, he demonstrated such talent and ability that he was accepted into the local orchestra of Russian folk instruments. He enrolled in a music school in 1929, and following the advice of his teacher, M. Krutinsky, came to Leningrad in 1932, where he studied piano at the Leningrad Central Music College, graduating in 1936. From 1936 to 1941, Sviridov studied at the Leningrad Conservatory under Peter Borisovich Ryazanov and Dmitri Shostakovich. Mobilized into the Soviet armed forces in 1941, just days after his graduation from the conservatory, Sviridov was sent to a military academy in Ufa, but was discharged by the end of the year due to poor health.
Musical legacy.
In 1935 Sviridov composed a cycle of lyrical romances based on the poetry of Alexander Pushkin which brought him first critical acclaim. During his studies in Leningrad Conservatory, 1936–1941, Sviridov experimented with different genres and different types of musical composition. He completed Piano Concerto No. 1 (1936–1939), Symphony No. 1 and the Chamber Symphony for Strings (1940). Later Sviridov would turn to the rich Russian musical heritage, including the folk songs, for inspiration.
Among Sviridov's most popular orchestral pieces are the Romance and the Waltz from his "The Blizzard", musical illustrations after Pushkin (1975), that were originally written for the eponymous 1964 film based on the short story from Pushkin's "The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin". A short segment from his score for the 1967 film "Time, Forward!" ("Время, вперёд!") was selected as the opening theme for the main evening TV news program "Vremya" (Время, 'time') and became the staple of Soviet life for several generations.
Poetry always occupied an important place in Sviridov's artistic universe. He wrote songs and romances to the lyrics of Mikhail Lermontov (1938, 1957), Alexander Blok (1941), William Shakespeare (1944–1960), Robert Burns (in Russian translation, 1955). Despite the popularity of Sviridov's instrumental works, both the composer himself and the music critics regarded vocal and choral music to be his main strengths. "Pathetic Oratorio" (1959) after Vladimir Mayakovsky has been called a masterful musical rendering of one of the most popular Russian revolution poet. Sviridov's prolific vocal chamber and vocal symphonic output includes Oratorio "To the memory of Sergei Yesenin" (1956), Little Cantata "Wooden Russia" (1964) after Yesenin, Cantata "Songs of Kursk" (1964), "Spring Cantata" (1972) after Nikolai Nekrasov, songs, romances, and cantatas after Fyodor Tyutchev, Sergei Yesenin, Alexander Blok,
Boris Pasternak, Alexander Prokofiev, Robert Rozhdestvensky. He also wrote one opera, "Twinkling Lights" (1951).
While Sviridov's music remains little known in the West, his works received high praise in his homeland for their memorable lyrical melodies, national flavor and mainly for great expression of Russia and Russian soul in his music.
Honors and awards.
In 1946 Sviridov was awarded the Stalin Prize for his Piano Trio, heavily influenced by Tchaikovsky. The Lenin Prize of 1960 was bestowed on the composer for his "Pathetic Oratorio". Georgy Sviridov was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1968 and 1980 and honored with the title People's Artist of the USSR. He became a Hero of Socialist Labor (1975) and was twice awarded the Order of Lenin.
Asteroid 4075 Sviridov, discovered by the Russian astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina in 1982, was named in honor of Georgy Sviridov.
Death.
The composer died of a heart attack in Moscow, where he had lived since 1956, on January 5, 1998.

Kokoro Amano

, is an AV Idol who starred in pornographic movies between 2001 and 2004 . She worked mainly for Soft On Demand and Moodyz.
Life and career.
Kokoro was born 30 August 1982 in the city of Miyako, Iwate Prefecture, Japan. She was seeking employment at the time that she was recruited for work in the AV industry. An AV scout found her in the audience of a TV gameshow. Her stage name was given to her by comedian Makoto Kitano, who interviewed her on the TV Asahi variety show "Tonight 2". Her AV debut was in the December, 2001 release "Confusion". Made for the Alice Japan label, and directed by Kazuhito Kuramoto, the video told the story of a couple, both of whom aspire to be actors. Amano's character has been secretly appearing in adult videos, and is afraid that her boyfriend will find out. Also in December 2001, she appeared on TV in an episode of the TV Asahi detective series along with fellow AV Idol Manami Yoshii.
Critics have often pointed out the documentary-inspired format of many Japanese AVs, which often begin with a lengthy interview with the main actress of the video. Amano's second video for Alice Japan, released in January 2002, and titled "Sunny Love", makes use of this format, by including her lengthy network television "Tonight 2" interview. Amano's February 2002 AV for Alice Japan, "Sealed Love", returned to the fictional narrative format of her first work. In this video, again directed by Kuramoto, she plays an employee of an IT company who has fallen in love with the best friend of her boyfriend. Some of Kokoro's later videos for Alice Japan continued in the purely fictional narrative format. In "My Lovely Nurse Sister" she plays the role of a nurse who has sex with doctors, and her brother-in-law who is a patient at the hospital where she works. 
Her July 2002 DVD for VIP, "Kokoro Amano ", is a game in which Kokoro plays the viewer's younger sister. Different endings result depending on selections made during the watching of the story. "Erotic Mind", her next AV for Alice Japan, included scenes of voyeurism, sex in public restrooms, and a threesome, while the plot of her July 2002 video, "Fallen Angel X", for the Media Station Bazooka label had scenes of saliva-swallowing and S&M.
In late 2002 she performed with the Soft On Demand (SOD) studio making the bukkake genre video "24 Hours of Bukkake Anytime and Anywhere". and later in 2003, she also starred in the "gokkun" genre in the SOD video "Gokkun Bazooka 150 Shots (Special 2003)". She retired from the AV industry in 2004.

Tetsuo Okamoto

Tetsuo Okamoto (March 20, 1932 – October 1, 2007) was a Brazilian swimmer.
Okamoto had asthma, and began to swim to treat it, at 7 years old. Only with 15 years old, when Fausto Alonso showed up, ready to mount a serious team in Yara Clube de Marília, is that Tetsuo began to train into a decent pool, under the guidance of someone with some knowledge of swimming. At that time, his training was only 2000 meters daily. In early 1949, Tetsuo had climbed several positions in the Brazilian national ranking, being cast in the South American Championship in Montevideo, his first international competition. There, he swam the three long distance races, managed to enter the finals of the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle, but went away from the podium. But his progress was only beginning, and, at the turn of the decade, happen the watershed event of his swimmer career. 
In 1949, a Japanese team made a tour in Brazil, and passed in Marília. With excellent results, including victories over the Americans, they were known as "flying fish." Okamoto was fascinated with those swimmers and received a recommendation: "if you want to have good results, would have to train a lot more: 10,000 meters daily". Thus, the preparation of Okamoto suffered a drastic transformation. At a time when the pool was unheated and he did not have goggles, Okamoto faced the cold and came out with eyes stinging with the chlorine, but carries out routine.
At the Brazilian Championship in 1950, he became champion for the first time, and its popularity and recognition began to grow. In January 1951, he became the South American record holder for the first time. He swam the 1500-metre freestyle in 19:24.3, lowering 40 seconds the Brazilian record and 13 seconds the South American record.
At the inaugural Pan American Games in 1951, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he claimed two gold medals in the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle, and one silver medal in the 4×200-metre freestyle. In the 1500-metre freestyle, broke again his South American record.
When he returned from Buenos Aires to Brazil, Okamoto received a big party in his hometown, Marília. There was a procession of open car, and awards to the new Brazilian hero. At the same time, however, thieves robbed his house, taking several belongings.
Three weeks after the Pan, he broke the South American record of 400-metre freestyle, scoring 4:41.5. The South American record of this race had never been in the hands of a Brazilian.
At the South American Championship in Lima, Peru, in March 1952, Tetsuo won the gold medal in the 400-metre, 800-metre and 1500-metre freestyle.
He was a bronze medalist at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki (1500-metre freestyle), the first Brazilian swimmer to win a medal at the Olympics. At this race, Tetsuo won his heats series with a time of 19:05.6, new South American record. At the final, he won the bronze medal with new South American record of 18:51.3. This record would last ten years.

Skylark Field

Skylark Field is a city owned, public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) east of the central business district of Killeen, a city in Bell County, Texas, United States. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a "general aviation" facility. It was formerly known as Killeen Municipal Airport.
The airport does not currently offer scheduled passenger service on commercial airlines. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, operating as Delta Connection, served this airport until August 2003, when it replaced its turboprop airplanes with regional jets which required a longer runway. In August 2004, the City of Killeen relocated the remaining airlines from Killeen Municipal Airport to new facilities at the Killeen-Fort Hood Regional Airport, which has a longer runway to accommodate larger jets and an expanded terminal to handle more passengers.
Facilities and aircraft.
Skylark Field covers an area of 180 acres (73 ha) at an elevation of 848 feet (258 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 1/19 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,495 by 100 feet (1,675 x 30 m).
For the 12-month period ending August 20, 2010, the airport had 29,700 aircraft operations, an average of 81 per day: 87% general aviation and 13% military. At that time there were 55 aircraft based at this airport: 91% single-engine, 4% multi-engine, and 5% helicopter.

Unitax

Unitax ("unified national indirect taxation") is a system of national revenue (complemented by ulitax - "unified local indirect taxation") based on non-monetary, energy value, units of assessment. Thus a revenue of £x or $y per gigajoule of primary energy entering any given economy can phase out all other taxes and raise revenue which is continuously, automatically and with hardly any paperwork, geared to standard of living, income and property. Essential safeguards are outlined in the "Resource Economics Proposition".

Film.
Based upon the novel by Otsuichi, GOTH is about two morbid high school students who share a fascination with murder. Kamiyama (Kanata Hongō) is an outwardly, friendly and popular boy who hides his potentially sociopathic nature with a carefree, happy attitude. Loner Morino (Rin Takanashi), on the other hand, does little to hide her strange nature; she never smiles, does not interact with her classmates, and wears a long-sleeved, black school uniform even during the middle of summer. While these two seem to share little in common and do not interact with each other in front of their peers, their shared interest in death and murder has turned them into an unusual duo. Initially happy to exchange books on morbid subjects, a series of recent murders spark their interest and they begin investigating the killer. This serial killer has a fondness for cheerful young women and, after severing their left hand as a trophy, displays their dead bodies in public locations to be discovered. After Morino discovers the killer’s notebook in a local café, the two use it to see the corpses for themselves before discovery and attempt to discern his identity.

Plot.
Flo is a hard worker at a big stock market company in Dinertown. She's tired of doing all the work and feeling unfulfilled. Flo quits her job, wishing she could work someplace else. She spots a run-down old diner, which she buys. She has to make enough money to fix up the diner. Later after earning more finance, she opens a new restaurant called Flo's Tiki Palace, after earning enough there she then opens a seaside diner called Go with the Flo's Fine Seafood Dining, when finished at the seaside diner she opens a dazzling newer restaurant called Chez Flo.
After having the intuition that something special will happen Flo finishes up in Chez Flo and is immediately transported above the clouds where a Shiva Goddess welcomes her and challenges her to 10 trials inside her own restaurant, the Indian Restaurant. The goddess transforms Flo into a golden banquet goddess with 4 arms (allowing her to carry double the amount she could before). Flo completes the 10 grueling trials and is congratulated by the goddess for completing the trials. The goddess then flies away to the Indian Restaurant and Flo spots a young man below working in the same business job Flo had at the start of the story and prepares to fly down intent on turning him into a waiter just like her.
Gameplay.
Gameplay involves seating customers and guiding Flo around the restaurant to serve customers. If enough money is earned after each level, the player progresses to the next. As the game progresses Flo updates the dilapidated restaurant she begins with and builds three further restaurants, which provide new settings.
Gameplay centers around catering to customers to gather as much money as possible. Flo can be moved around the restaurant to complete tasks. As customers arrive in the restaurant, the player must drag and drop them onto a table, where they sit down and read menus. Then the player must guide Flo to the table to take their order, which must be taken to the service hatch. After the chef has prepared the meal, Flo must deliver the food. When the customers are finished eating they must be taken a check, at which point the customers leave a tip and their dishes on the table, departing the restaurant. The dishes must be cleared by Flo before the next set of customers can use the table. Each successful action earns the player points, performing the same action multiple times in a row earns the player a chain bonus, which is broken once a different action is performed.
Customers have a series of hearts over their heads that indicate their mood. The longer the customer is forced to wait, the more hearts he or she loses. Each type of customer has different degrees of patience and tipping habits. Flo can perform various actions, such as talking to customers or serving them drinks, to revive these hearts. When customers lose all their hearts, they leave the restaurant, costing the player points. The goal of a level is to earn a certain number of points. There are also expert point totals for advanced players to achieve.
The game has two modes: Career mode, which follows the story of Flo, and Endless Shift, a survival mode in which the player must last as long as possible in a single level.
In the Cooking Dash variation, the player actually prepares the food as opposed to bringing the order to the chef for him to prepare it.

Harry Ashmore

Harry Scott Ashmore (July 28, 1916 – January 20, 1998) was an American journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorials in 1957 on the school integration conflict in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Life.
Ashmore was born in Greenville, South Carolina, on July 28, 1916. He attended Greenville High School and Clemson Agricultural College where he graduated with a degree in general science in 1937. He showed an early ability in journalism, having served as editor of the student newspapers at both Greenville High School and Clemson College. After graduation from Clemson, Ashmore worked as a newspaper reporter, first at the "Greenville Piedmont", and then at the "Greenville News". In 1940, Ashmore married Barbara Edith Laier, a physical education teacher at Furman University. Ashmore was accepted for a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1941. When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Ashmore left Harvard to join the United States Army, and served as an operations officer (reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel) with the Ninety-fifth Infantry Division, part of the United States Third Army. After the war, Harry Ashmore became the editorial writer at the "Charlotte News" (in Charlotte, North Carolina).
"Arkansas Gazette".
In 1947 Ashmore was recruited to be the editorial writer at the "Arkansas Gazette" in Little Rock, Arkansas. He soon became the executive editor at the paper, and gained a reputation as a moderate-to-liberal thinker. In 1951 Governor Sid McMath of Arkansas invited Ashmore to address the Southern Governors' Conference when it met at Hot Springs, Arkansas. Ashmore spoke to the governors on civil rights, a contentious subject in southern states, and newspapers around the United States reprinted the speech or excerpts from it.
Ashmore wrote the first of his eleven books in 1954. "The Negro and the Schools" was a report of a Ford Foundation study of segregated education in the South. It was published shortly before the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision ending school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education. Chief Justice Earl Warren later told Ashmore that the book was used as a source while drafting the 1955 implementation ruling known as Brown II.
Also in 1954, Ashmore came to the aid of Orval Faubus, who was running for Governor of Arkansas. Francis Cherry, the incumbent, had tried to smear Faubus by revealing that he had attended Commonwealth College, a socialist school in Arkansas. Faubus at first tried to deny the charge, but Cherry produced documentary evidence. Unhappy with Cherry's tactics, Ashmore ghostwrote a speech for Faubus to respond to the charges. The speech was successful, and is credited with saving Faubus's political career. In 1955 Ashmore took a leave of absence for a year to work on Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign.
In 1957 the Federal courts ordered integration of the schools in the Little Rock School District, starting the Little Rock Crisis. Governor Faubus defied the court order, while Ashmore editorialized for compliance with the law. This ended the friendship between the two. Ashmore became a rallying point for moderates and liberals in Arkansas, and a figure of hatred for segregationists, who labeled him a carpetbagger. In 1958 the "Arkansas Gazette" won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, "For demonstrating the highest qualities of civic leadership, journalistic responsibility and moral courage in the face of great public tension during the school integration crisis of 1957. The newspaper's fearless and completely objective news coverage, plus its reasoned and moderate policy, did much to restore calmness and order to an overwrought community, reflecting great credit on its editors and its management." In the same year Harry Ashmore won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing, "For the forcefulness, dispassionate analysis and clarity of his editorials on the school integration conflict in Little Rock." In 1959 the Arkansas General Assembly passed a resolution to rename Toad Suck Ferry to Ashmore Landing. Governor Faubus vetoed the resolution on the grounds that the name change would defame a well known landing.
Later life.
In 1959 Ashmore left the "Arkansas Gazette" and moved to Santa Barbara, California, where he joined the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. He served as President of the Center from 1969 to 1974. He also served as the editor-in-chief of the Encyclopaedia Britannica from 1960 until 1963, and afterwards as Director of Editorial Research. Ashmore received the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award Lifetime Achievement Award for 1995-1996.
In 1967 and 1968 Harry Ashmore traveled to North Vietnam with Bill Baggs (editor of The Miami News) on a private peace mission. While there, they interviewed Ho Chi Minh about what conditions would be necessary to end the Vietnam War. He speaks about his experiences in the 1968 documentary film "In the Year of the Pig".
Harry Ashmore died in Santa Barbara, California on January 20, 1998.

Hard fantasy

Hard fantasy is a sub-genre of fantasy literature that strives to present stories set in (and often centered on) a rational and knowable world. Hard fantasy is similar to hard science fiction, from which it draws its name, in that both aim to build their respective worlds in a rigorous and logical manner. The two diverge in that hard science fiction uses real scientific principles as its starting point, while hard fantasy postulates starting conditions that do not, and often cannot, exist according to currently scientific understanding.
Unlike its sister genre, the definition of hard fantasy is amorphous in practice. Some instances of the genre feature alternative geography and cultures without the presence of magic, dragons, and elves stereotypically found in many other fantasy settings. Other hard-fantasy settings may feature those elements but with a more detailed explanation for their existence.

Theridion grallator

Theridion grallator, also known as the happy face spider, is a spider in the family Theridiidae. Its Hawaiian name is ' (face-patterned spider). The specific epithet ' is Latin for "stilt walker", a reference to the species' long, spindly legs.
Appearance.
The spider is up to long. Certain morphs have a pattern uncannily resembling a smiley face or a grinning clown face on their yellow body. Each spider has a unique pattern, and the patterns differ from island to island. Some lack markings altogether.
On the island of Maui, the happy types seem to follow simple Mendelian inheritance rules, while on other Hawaiian islands the body inheritance patterns seem to be sex-limited. The variation is possibly a kind of camouflage against birds, their only natural enemies of significance, to counteract pattern recognition by predators. As the pattern may change according to what food the spider has eaten and as "T. grallator" is very small, hides during the day, and is thus not a significant prey item for any species of predator, it is more likely that the bizarre variety of patterns serves no significant adaptive purpose at all.
Ecology.
"T. grallator" lives beneath the leaves of plants, where they also spin their much reduced webs. The females guard their eggs until they hatch, and catch prey for their young. "T. grallator" hunts mainly during the evening.
Distribution.
"T. grallator" is endemic to Oahu, Molokai, Maui and the island of Hawaii in rainforests at elevations of .
Evolution.
The closest relatives of "T. grallator" are other Hawaiian species, such as "T. posticatum" and "T. kauaiense". This ""T. grallator" clade" may be more closely related to the genus "Exalbidion" than to any other species currently classified in the genus "Theridion".

<doc id="5895601" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895601" title="Economy of Texas">
Economy of Texas

The economy of Texas is one of the largest and most rapidly growing economies in the United States. As of 2013, Texas is home to six of the top 50 companies on the Fortune 500 list and 51 overall, (third most after New York and California). In 2012, Texas grossed more than $264.7 billion a year in exports—more than exports of California ($161.9 billion) and New York ($81.4 billion) combined. As a sovereign country (in 2012), Texas would be the 14th largest economy in the world by GDP (ahead of South Korea and the Netherlands). 
In 2011,Texas had a gross state product of $1.332 trillion, the second highest in the U.S. Texas's household income was $48,259 in 2010 ranking 25th in the nation, below the national average, though the ranking does not factor in the state's lower-than-average cost of living. The state debt in 2012 was calculated to be $121.7 billion, or $7,400 per taxpayer.
History.
Historically four major business enterprises shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. The first enterprise to enjoy major success in Texas was cattle and bison. In the early days of Anglo-American settlement furs and hides were the major products derived from cattle. Beef was not particularly popular in the United States. However soon Texas entrepreneurs pioneered the beef industry and demand steadily increased. The cattle industry enjoyed its greatest financial success in the later 1870s and 1880s.
Cotton production, which had been known in Texas since Spanish times, gradually increased throughout the 19th century. By the early 20th century Texas had become the leading cotton producer in the nation. By the 1920s the cotton industry was past its peak as government regulation and foreign competition took their toll.
The forests of Texas have been an important resource since its earliest days and have played an important role in the state's history. The vast woodlands of the region, home to many varieties of wildlife when Europeans first arrived, provided major economic opportunities for early settlers. They today continue to play an important role economically and environmentally in the state.
The densest forest lands lie in the eastern part of the state. In particular the Big Thicket region, just north of Houston and Beaumont, has historically been home to the most dense woodlands. The Big Thicket was mostly uninhabited until heavy settlement from the U.S. began in the mid-19th century, and was even used as a refuge by runaway slaves and other fugitives. The Rio Grande valley in South Texas was home to a large palm tree forest when Spaniards first arrived, though today very little of it remains.
The development of railroads in the eastern part of the state during the mid-19th century led to a boom in lumber production in the 1880s. This era of financial success lasted approximately 50 years finally coming to an end as Texas' forests were decimated and the Great Depression dropped prices.
In 1901 the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company struck oil on Spindletop Hill in Beaumont. Though petroleum production was not new, this strike was by far the largest the world had ever seen. The find led to widespread exploration throughout Texas and neighboring states. By 1940 Texas was firmly established as the leading oil producer in the U.S.
Texas remained largely rural until World War II though the success of the petroleum industry rapidly expanded the economy with heavy industry of many types taking root. The second world war created tremendous demand for petroleum and a variety of products that Texas was in a unique position to provide. By the end of the war Texas was one of the leading industrial states and the population had become predominantly urban. Additionally the economy had diversified sufficiently that, though petroleum was still the largest sector by the end of the war, the business community in the state was truly diverse.
The Texas economy today relies largely on information technology, oil and natural gas, aerospace, defense, biomedical research, fuel processing, electric power, agriculture, and manufacturing.
Exports.
In 2008, for the seventh year in a row, Texas led the United States in export revenues. Texas exports for 2008 totaled $192.2 billion. In 2002, the Port of Houston was 6th among the top sea ports in the world in terms of total cargo volume; "Air Cargo World" rated Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport as "the best air cargo airport in the world". The ship channel at the Port of Houston—the largest in the U.S. in international commerce and the sixth-largest port in the world.
Taxes.
According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are among the lowest in the nation, 7th lowest nationally, with state and local taxes costing $3,580 per capita, or 8.7% of resident incomes. Texas is one of only 7 states not to have a state income tax. The state sales tax rate, 6.25%, is above the national medium, with localities adding up to 2% (8.25% total). Texas does have a "back to school" sales tax holiday once a year (generally around the first weekend in August) on clothing and footwear under $100.
http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/local/
As for Texas's business tax climate, the state ranks 8th in the nation. Property taxes are exclusively collected at the local level in the state, and are generally at rates above the national average. As a whole, Texas is a "tax donor state" with Texans receiving back approximately $0.94 per every dollar of federal income taxes collected in 2005.
Tax burden.
Texas is one of the nine states of the United States with no personal state income tax. In addition, Texas does not allow any lower level of government (counties, cities, etc.) to impose an income tax. This means that, for the residents of Texas, the maximum rate of income taxation is the top rate set by the US Government. Businesses, except for sole proprietorships and partnerships, are subject to a gross margins tax.
The state sales tax is set at 6.25 percent. Cities are allowed to impose an additional 1% tax, and additional taxes not to exceed 1% may be approved by voters for any combination of county sales tax, transportation districts, economic development, and/or crime prevention. The average sales tax in Texas amounts to 8.25 percent. The state determines the items subject to sales tax, which all other entities must follow. Motor vehicle sales are subject only to the 6.25% state sales tax. Food, except for prepared food, and non-prescription medicines are among the major items exempt from sales tax.
While property taxes are among the highest in the nation, property costs are also among the lowest in the nation. Property taxes constitute the majority of revenue and are collected and kept by local governments, as the Texas Constitution specifically prohibits a state property tax. For real property, counties, cities, and school districts (along with other special districts, such as for a community college or public hospital) can also impose taxes. All property is assessed uniformly throughout the county via the county "appraisal district", and taxes are assessed based on 100% of the property's assessed value. While larger personal property items such as cars, boats, and airplanes can be subject to local taxes as well, it is far less common.
Industries.
Agriculture.
Texas has the most farms of all United States both in terms of number and acreage. Texas leads the nation in number of cattle, usually exceeding 16 million head. The sprawling 320,000 deeded acre (1,200 km²) "La Escalera Ranch", located south of Fort Stockton, Texas, is one of the largest cattle ranches in the Southwestern United States.
The state leads nationally in production of sheep and goat products. Texas is king of cotton leading the nation in cotton production, its leading crop and second-most-valuable farm product. Texas is a leader in cereal crop production. Three counties in the state—Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda—take advantage of water from the Lower Colorado River Authority to grow rice and are responsible for about 5% of annual U.S. rice production. Texas is also a large producer of watermelons, grapefruits, and cantaloupes.
Aeronautics.
Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, the center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is in Houston. It is a leading hub for the Aeronautics industry. The National Space and Biomedical Research Institute is headquartered in Houston.
The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, located nearly equidistant from downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth, is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and fourth largest in the world. In terms of traffic, DFW is the busiest in the state, third busiest in the United States, and sixth busiest in the world. The airport serves 135 domestic destinations and 40 international. DFW is the largest and main hub for American Airlines, one of the world's largest in terms of total passengers-miles transported and passenger fleet size.
Texas's second-largest air facility is Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) which is the largest hub of United Airlines. IAH offers service to the most Mexican destinations of any U.S. airport. IAH currently ranks second among U.S. airports with scheduled non-stop domestic and international service.
American Airlines, headquartered in Fort Worth, is the world's largest airline by passenger miles, passengers carried, and revenue. Southwest Airlines, is based in Dallas.
Defense.
Texas is home to two of the United States Army's largest facilities (in terms of geographic size), Fort Hood in Central Texas near Killeen and Fort Bliss near El Paso. In addition, Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio is home to the Brooke Army Medical Center, one of the Army's major hospitals and its only burn facility, and the Corpus Christi Army Depot in Corpus Christi, Texas is home to the world's largest helicopter repair and maintenance facility.
The United States Air Force operates several bases in the state – Sheppard (Wichita Falls), Dyess (Abilene), Goodfellow (San Angelo), Laughlin (Del Rio), and Lackland and Randolph (San Antonio) Ellington Airport, (Houston).
The United States Navy operates Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth (the former Carswell Air Force Base facility) as well as NAS Corpus Christi and NAS Kingsville.
Defense contracting.
Texas (specifically Dallas and Houston) has a large number of defense contractors which creates sizable employment for the state.
Two divisions of Lockheed Martin have their divisional headquarters in the DFW area –
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth (where the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program, is manufactured, as well as its successor, the F-35 Lightning II and the F-22 Raptor) and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control in Grand Prairie.
Fort Worth is also the home of Bell Helicopter Textron, which manufactures several helicopters for the military, including the V-22 and the H-1, on which final assembly is performed in Amarillo. Furthermore, three major defense service contractors (DynCorp, AECOM, and Computer Sciences Corporation) have substantial operations in Fort Worth.
Other major defense contractors with DFW presence include Boeing (Richardson), Rockwell Collins (Richardson), Vought Corporation (headquarters in Dallas; facilities in Dallas and Grand Prairie), Raytheon (plants in Garland, Dallas, and McKinney), L-3 Communications (plants in Arlington, Carrollton, and Greenville; also has a facility in Waco), BAE Systems (facility in Fort Worth), DRS Technologies (Dallas), EDS and Perot Systems (Plano), Alliant Techsystems (facility in Fort Worth), and Elbit Systems (facility and US headquarters in Fort Worth). The Defense Contract Audit Agency maintains its Central Region office in Irving.
Outside the DFW area, KBR (the former Halliburton subsidiary) maintains its headquarters in Houston, while the Southwest Research Institute is located in San Antonio. BAE Systems also manufactures the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles at its facility in Sealy, Texas.
Computer technology.
Texas is one of the major hubs in the U.S. for development of computer components and systems, as well as software. Austin, Dallas, and Houston are the major centers for this industry in Texas. The Austin area is often nicknamed "Silicon Hills" because of the concentration of semiconductor design companies including AMD, Cirrus Logic, Freescale and Silicon Labs. Dell's headquarters is located in the city's suburb, Round Rock, and major offices for Google, Facebook, EA Games, and Apple are also open in the Austin area. Austin is also the home of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at The University of Texas at Austin. Dallas is the birthplace of the integrated circuit, and by some definitions, the birthplace of the microprocessor. The North Dallas area is called the "Telecom Corridor" or the "Silicon Prairie" for the area's high concentration of Information Technology companies such as Texas Instruments, Perot Systems, and EDS, as well as telecommunications giant AT&T. San Antonio is the home of cloud computing giant Rackspace, as well as computing pioneer Datapoint. Harris County-based Compaq, was once one of the world's largest computer companies. After Compaq's merger with Hewlett-Packard, the new owner currently employs more employees in the Houston area, than anywhere else in the world.
Energy.
Texans consume the most energy in the nation both in per capita and as a whole. Since 2002, Texas has operated under a mostly deregulated electricity market (however, areas where electricity is provided by either a municipality or a utility cooperative are not always subject to deregulation).
The known petroleum deposits of Texas are about , which makes up approximately one-third of the known U.S. supply. Texas has of proven crude oil reserves. As wells are depleted in the eastern portions of the state, drilling in state has moved westward.
Several of the major oil companies have headquarters in Texas, including ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil (Houston), Exxon-Mobil (Irving), Tesoro, and Valero (San Antonio).
Texas is a global leader in the energy industry and Houston is the energy capital of the world. Since 2003, Texas state officials have created various initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund to develop the economy of Texas. Texas is a leader in alternative energy sources, producing the most wind power of any state, as well as small solar powered efforts and the experimental installation of wave-powered generators.
Texas also is home to many of the world's largest oilfield services firms including Halliburton, Schlumberger and Dresser. The state has a number of pipeline operators, such as El Paso and Dynegy, along with diversified energy firms such as TXU and Reliant Energy. The state also provides the most energy for the USA.
The recent boom in Texas energy production has left the state without the funds to maintain its current road network and as a result has begun converting paved roads to gravel.
Tourism.
Texas has a large tourism industry. The state tourism slogan is "Texas: It's like a whole other country." Tourists might enjoy San Antonio and El Paso's Hispanic culture, or Fort Worth western attractions. Galveston, Corpus Christi, and Padre Island are some of the popular Texas resort areas located on the Gulf of Mexico. Houston is Texas' leading convention city. Dallas is also one of the nation's leading convention cities. Professional and college sports are dominant in both Dallas and Houston.
Entertainment.
Texas is a top filmmaking state. Austin is now one of the leading filmmaking locations in the country. The exteriors for the popular soap opera "Dallas" were filmed on Southfork Ranch, a location near Plano, Texas. From 1995 to 2004, more than $2.75 billion was spent in Texas for film and television production. 
The Texas Film Commission was founded for free services to filmmakers, from location research to traveling. Also many Hollywood studios are relocating parts of their production divisions to the Austin and Dallas areas. 
The media conglomerate Clear Channel Communications is based in San Antonio, Texas. Pi Studios and Timegate Studios are based in the Houston area. Blockbuster Video and Cinemark Theatres are also based in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
Healthcare.
Healthcare is a growing industry in the state of Texas. The Texas Medical Center, located in southwest Houston, is the largest medical center in the world. It is home to The University of Texas Health Science Center which trains medical students and residents and includes The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, a global leader of cancer research and treatment. The medical complex also hosts a private medical college, The Baylor College of Medicine.
The University of Texas medical system has additional branches in Dallas, San Antonio, and Galveston. The South Texas Medical Center in San Antonio with nearly 27,000 employees has a $14.3 Billion economic impact on the state of Texas. In addition to these facilities, the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, the Texas A&M Health Science Center, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and El Paso provide the state with a total of nine centers of medical research.

Tom Paley

Thomas T. "Tom" Paley (born March 19, 1928) is an American guitarist, banjo and fiddle player. He is best known for his work with the New Lost City Ramblers in the 1950s and 1960s.
Biography.
Paley was born and raised in New York City. His parents were left wing activists, and he grew up hearing spirituals and political songs. After moving with his mother to California for several years in his early teens, he returned to New York and began learning the guitar and banjo, and visiting clubs where singers such as Lead Belly and Josh White performed. He also began performing, both solo and with other musicians including Woody Guthrie, and booking performances for others.
In 1953 he recorded his first album "Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachian Mountains", for Jac Holzman's then-new Elektra Records. On May 25, 1958, Paley, John Cohen and Mike Seeger played together live on air for John Dildine's weekly folk music radio show on WASH-FM: this was the first appearance of what later became the New Lost City Ramblers. Paley later said:"When we formed The New Lost City Ramblers it was the kind of thing I'd been doing for quite a few years... It didn't feel particularly revolutionary to me but I understood we had quite an impact on young people like Dylan."
Paley, both as a solo artist and as member of the New Lost City Ramblers, has been cited by many as a source and influence, among them Bob Dylan, and The Grateful Dead. He recorded nine albums as a member of the New Lost City Ramblers between 1958 and 1962.
Paley left the band when Cohen and Seeger wanted the group to become more professional and Paley refused to sign statements about his political allegiances; he was replaced by Tracy Schwarz. He formed another group, the Old Reliable String Band with Roy Berkeley and Artie Rose, before leaving the United States in 1963, when he and his wife Claudia went to live in Sweden. They remained there until 1966 when they moved to England, where Paley had increasingly been working.
Paley has subsequently toured widely, in the UK, US, Scandinavia and elsewhere. He has also performed as a member of the New Deal String Band, based in London, intermittently since the 1960s. After learning the fiddle, he released two albums of traditional Scandinavian music, "On a Cold Winter Night" (1993) and "Svenska Låtar: Swedish Fiddle Tunes" (1998), both recorded with his son Ben. His collaboration with Bert Deivert, "Beware Young Ladies!", was released in 2007. 
He continues to live in London and is still performing and recording. He is the honorary President of the Friends of American Old-Time Music and Dance (FOAOTMAD). Another album, "Roll on, Roll on", was released in 2012. He was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on 4th July 2012 at the launch party of the new album.

USS Admiral W. L. Capps (AP-121)

USS "Admiral W. L. Capps" (AP-121), an , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps (1864–1935). Unusually, the first — — served concurrently with the "Admiral W. L. Capps". "Via" a transfer to the United States Army and then back to the Navy, the ship was renamed USNS "General Hugh J. Gaffey" (T-AP-121), making her the only ship to be named for Hugh Joseph Gaffey.
Built in California.
Her keel was laid down on 15 December 1942 at Alameda, California, by the Bethlehem-Alameda Shipyard Inc., Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 679). She was launched on 20 February 1944 sponsored by Mrs. James Reed and delivered to the Navy and commissioned on 18 September 1944 with Captain N. S. Haugen, USCG, in command.
World War II Service.
Transporting troops for Pacific campaigns.
Following shakedown training along the U.S. West Coast, the transport departed San Francisco, on 23 November, bound for the southwestern Pacific Ocean. En route she visited Nouméa, New Caledonia, where she disembarked marines and took on board passengers headed for Guadalcanal. From that island, "Admiral W. L. Capps" carried another group of passengers to Espiritu Santo. She embarked almost 3500 troops at the latter port and set a course for home where she arrived on the day after Christmas.
The ship put to sea again on 21 February 1945 bound for Hollandia, New Guinea, whence she proceeded to the Philippines. The ship arrived at Leyte on 20 March and departed that island on 8 April for the United States.
After arriving at San Francisco, late that month, she moved north to Seattle, Washington, where she embarked almost 5000 troops to reinforce American units fighting on Okinawa. Sailing on 7 May, the transport stopped at Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Ulithi before reaching Okinawa on 2 July. Next she visited Saipan on 12 and 13 July, before getting underway on the latter day bound ultimately for the Panama Canal and the East Coast of the United States.
Supporting Atlantic operations.
"Admiral W. L. Capps" entered port at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 August and, while undergoing voyage repairs, received word at mid-month that hostilities in the Pacific had ended. She stood out of Norfolk on 1 September, with members of the French Navy among her passengers. After dropping them off at Marseille, France, and embarking American troops, she headed back toward the United States and arrived in Norfolk on 20 September.
Five days later, the ship once more set out for the Mediterranean Sea, this time to repatriate some 3765 former Italian prisoners of war. After stopping at Naples and Marseille, she returned to Newport News, Virginia, on 19 October. Between that time and mid-December, the ship made two more round-trip voyages to France and back, one to Le Havre and the other to Marseille, returning American servicemen home.
End-of-war operations.
On 29 December, she put to sea to return to the Pacific. At Pearl Harbor, the transport embarked troops and continued her voyage west on 16 January 1946. She disembarked one group of passengers at Yokosuka, took on almost 4700 more, and headed for Seattle on 30 January. In March, the ship made a round-trip voyage from the U.S. West Coast to Okinawa, returning to San Francisco with over 4800 troops. In April, she moved from the west coast to New York City which she reached on 24 April.
On 8 May 1946, "Admiral W. L. Capps" was decommissioned and returned to the Maritime Commission. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in June 1946.
Post-war service.
The Maritime Commission transferred the ship to the United States Army which named her USAT "General Hugh J. Gaffey". She served the Army Transport Service until 1 March 1950 when the Navy re-acquired her. Retaining her Army name, the transport was not re-commissioned, but instead was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service and manned by a civil service crew. USNS "General Hugh J. Gaffey" (T-AP-121) spent almost two decades carrying men and material to American installations throughout the Far East and the Pacific Ocean.
Korean and Vietnam War support.
She supported American troops in the Korean War in the early 1950s and performed similar service in the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s. On 4 November 1968, "General Hugh J. Gaffey" was transferred to the Maritime Administration on a temporary basis to be laid up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet facility at Suisun Bay, California.
On 31 August 1969 she was transferred permanently to Maritime Administration custody. Her name was again struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 October 1969.
Service as a barracks hulk.
In 1978 the transport was reacquired by the Navy a second time and her name reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register. Redesignated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, IX-507, "General Hugh J. Gaffey" was placed in service in November 1978 at Bremerton, Washington, to serve as a barracks ship for the crews of ships undergoing major overhaul. As of 1 January 1989, her name was still on the list of active duty service craft.
Final status.
The transport was sunk in RIMPAC 2000 EXERCISE as a missile target, 16 June 2000, position: 023° 35' 01.0" North, 159° 50' 00.2" West, depth: 2,730 fathoms

Glasgow Monday

Glasgow Monday is the 47th release, third live album, and second-ever double album release, from avant-folk/blues singer/songwriter Jandek. It is his fifth release of the year (counting the DVD version of "Glasgow Sunday") and features "The Corwood Representative" on piano and vocals, along with the same rhythm section he performed with at the shows documented on "Glasgow Sunday" and "Newcastle Sunday", bassist Richard Youngs (playing upright bass) and drummer/percussionist Alex Neilson who accents the music with chimes and echoing percussion. It was recorded live at the Center for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow, Scotland on May 23, 2005 and features a prelude and nine parts to a single song, "The Cell".
The music has classical elements, and can be called "meditative." It is also devoid of the dissonance associated with most Corwood albums, with Jandek's piano playing being compared to Erik Satie and his speak/singing staying in a mellow timbre that never moves into his atonal wail. The lyrics make references to mitochondria, "streaming into the desert", work, health, heroes, the occult (which he doesn't battle), and "possibility", continually circling back to the same question that begins and ends the album - "What do I have?".

German submarine U-735

German submarine "U-735" was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" for service during World War II. She served as a training boat preparing U-boat crews for service in the Atlantic Ocean. Her home base was Horten in Norway, from which she operated on short coastal patrols, practicing in fjords and channels for submarine warfare. A Type VIIC U-boat, "U-735" was very useful for preparing sailors and officers for service in modern boats, as opposed to the new models usually used in training.
Commissioned at Christmas 1942 in Danzig after an exceptionally long building period, "U-735" was given to Kptlt. Hans-Joachim Börner, who remained in command of the boat right up to her destruction exactly two years later, when he was killed on board his ship. Dispatched to Norway, Börner soon became an expert on the Norwegian seaways, and was able to train a large number of sailors on his practice missions from Horten.
On the 28 December 1944, RAF Bomber Command sought to eradicate the menace of submarines sailing from Norwegian bases, and launched a major raid on Horten. "U-735" was anchored in the naval harbour at Horten. When the air raid alarm came at 21.30, "U-735" eventually succeeded in leaving the harbour, having had trouble starting her diesels. At 23.30 NE of Horten she caught the full force of a bomb, sinking just outside the harbour, south of Mølen Island, with 26 men killed and ten missing, including her captain. Only one crew member survived, plus ten crew members who were on leave in Horten. She was the only U-boat to be lost in the attack. The wreck was rediscovered by a Royal Norwegian Navy sub-sea surveillance ship, in 1999. A high-resolution SAS image of the wreck made the cover of Sea Technology Magazine in June 2006 and another SAS image of U-735 [http://www.ffi.no/no/PublishingImages/sas_image.jpg is made available by the Norwegian Defence Reseasrch Establishment.

U.S. Route 9 in New York

U.S. Route 9 (US 9) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Laurel, Delaware, to Champlain, New York. In New York, US 9 extends from the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan to an interchange with Interstate 87 (I-87) just south of the Canada–United States border in the town of Champlain. US 9 is the longest north–south U.S. Highway in New York; additionally, the portion of US 9 in New York accounts for more than half of the highway's total length.
The highway's passage through the state offers a diverse sample of New York to a traveler, passing through busy urban neighborhoods, suburban strips and forested wilderness. It is Broadway in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and much of Westchester. It uses parts of the old Albany Post Road in the Hudson Valley, where it passes the historic homes of a U.S. President and Gilded Age heir. It passes the center of New York political power in downtown Albany, and the patrician grandeur of Saratoga Springs. It penetrates into the deep recesses of the Adirondack Park and runs along the shore of Lake Champlain, where it is part of the All-American Road known as the Lakes to Locks Passage.
US 9 spawns more letter-suffixed state highways than any other route in New York, including the longest, New York State Route 9N (NY 9N). Outside of the cities it passes through, it is a mostly a two-lane road, save for two expressway segments in the mid-Hudson region. For much of its southern half it follows the Hudson River closely; in the north it tracks I-87, the Adirondack Northway.
Route description.
The New York segment of US 9 can be divided into the section south of Albany, which parallels the Hudson River closely; and the portion north of Albany, which takes in a long section of the eastern Adirondacks. New York State Bicycle Route 9 follows the US 9 corridor, diverging from the route in areas not conducive to bicycling. For example, Bicycle Route 9 follows US 9W in northern New Jersey and Rockland County, crosses the Bear Mountain Bridge, and follows NY 9D and NY 301 back to US 9 in Putnam County.
New York City and the Hudson Valley.
US 9 enters New York as part of an expressway, soon becoming a surface street and major urban and suburban artery. Outside of the expressway portions, it is mostly a two- or four-lane road save for a lengthy four-lane strip that leads into one of the expressways. It runs near the river more frequently in the southern areas, but it is never very far inland. 
New York City.
The concurrency between US 1 and US 9 that began in New Jersey ends at the first exit from I-95 on the George Washington Bridge, when 9 heads north via 178th and 179th streets to Broadway. Broadway passes through the Washington Heights neighborhood and then into Inwood, the northernmost neighborhood on the island. The region in which US 9 passes through has a large Latino immigrant population. The northernmost section of the New York City Subway's underground IND Eighth Avenue Line ( train) runs along Broadway between Dyckman Street and the Inwood–207th Street terminal. On the corner of 204th Street is the Dyckman House, the only original farmhouse left in Manhattan and a National Historic Landmark.
Near the island's northern tip, at the intersection with 215th Street, the elevated IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line ( train) of the New York City Subway joins Broadway. At the very tip of Manhattan, just past Columbia University's Lawrence A. Wien Stadium, Route 9 crosses the Harlem River Ship Canal via the Broadway Bridge, into Marble Hill, the only portion of Manhattan on the mainland. The Marble Hill Metro-North station here is the first of several along Route 9. 
At or just south of 230th Street, 9, still Broadway, enters the Bronx. It draws alongside I-87, here the Major Deegan Expressway, the first of many encounters between the two roads on their northward course. At the 242nd Street station, the subway ends and Broadway runs along the west side of Van Cortlandt Park. The Henry Hudson Parkway interchange a mile up this stretch adds NY 9A to 9.
Westchester County.
The northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and 9 enters Yonkers, where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever eastward, closer to the Hudson River, remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. 9 climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes St. John's Riverside Hospital. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop. In Yonkers, Route 9 passes historic Philipse Manor house, which dates back to colonial America.
It remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for Hastings-on-Hudson, where it splits into separate north and south routes for . The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the John William Draper House, was the site of the first astrophotograph of the Moon.
In the next village, Dobbs Ferry, Route 9 has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Route 9 passes by the Old Croton Aqueduct and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Route 9 passes Mercy College, then turns left again at the center of town just past South Presbyterian Church, headed for equally comfortable Ardsley-on-Hudson and Irvington. Villa Lewaro, the home of C.J. Walker, the first African-American millionaire, is along the highway here. At the north end of the village of Irvington, a memorial to writer Washington Irving, after whom the village was renamed, marks the turnoff to his home at Sunnyside. Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Route 9 passes by historic Lydhurst mansion, a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.
North of here, at the Kraft Foods technical center, the Tappan Zee Bridge becomes visible. After crossing under the Thruway and I-87 again, here concurrent with I-287, and then intersecting with the four-lane NY 119, where 119 splits off to the east, 9 becomes the busy main street of Tarrytown. Christ Episcopal Church, where Irving worshiped, is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of NY 448, where 9 slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that 9 turns left, passing the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, another NHL. The road then enters Sleepy Hollow (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for Kykuit, the National Historic Landmark that was (and partially still is) the Rockefeller family's estate. Route 9 then passes the historic Sleepy Hollow cemetery, which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
US 9 expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with NY 117; Broadway finally ends and 9 becomes Albany Post Road. Entering Ossining's downtown, US 9 becomes Highland Avenue and continues to rise and fall, widen and narrow, through the riverside community. Route 9 passes in close proximity to Sing Sing correctional facility before heading towards Croton.
Croton Expressway.
Just after Ossining, Route 9A returns and merges with US 9 for approximately 1,500 feet (457 m) as it crosses the mouth of the Croton River and becomes the Croton Expressway. The only section built of the cancelled I-487, the highway is generally built to interstate standards. 9A leaves the freeway and returns to two lanes, following the parent route's old course, at the first exit, Croton Point Avenue in Croton-on-Hudson, where NY 129 reaches its western end. Here the modern concrete ramps of Metro-North's Croton–Harmon station, also served by Amtrak, are prominent to the west as Haverstraw Bay becomes visible. Route 9 also passes the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear power-plant that supplies power to Westchester County and New York City. The facility is visible from the majority of the northern half of the expressway.
The expressway veers inland for much of its route, preferring to follow the railroad tracks (the new Cortlandt station is visible to the west at one point), rather than the river past the promontory at Buchanan. NY 9A, as a surface street, ends at its parent at the Welcher Street exit. It continues on a reconstructed, widened section through Peekskill. Despite recent upgrades to freeway standards, the northern end of the highway still maintains a lower speed limit.
Peekskill to Poughkeepsie.
US 9 passes Dutchess Mall, a dead mall, and the historic Van Wyck Homestead before meeting I-84 in Fishkill. At the interstate exit, the road expands into a four-lane strip similar to the form it takes in Central New Jersey, complete with much commercial development on both sides. It will remain this way to Poughkeepsie. This stretch is an important, if often congested, transportation artery for the county.
Just north of I-84, 9 clips off a corner of the village of Fishkill, where the intersection with NY 52 creates a heavily congested situation at rush hours since traffic going from southbound 9 to westbound I-84 often uses it as a shortcut. The remaining miles to Wappingers Falls boast many intersections as well, but are not quite as heavy.
In the Town of Poughkeepsie, just after the northern terminus of NY 9D, 9 passes another distressed mall, South Hills and its healthier, newer counterpart, the Poughkeepsie Galleria. A mile further north, NY 113 swings to the west at a cloverleaf interchange near the IBM plant, once the region's major employer. Entering the city of Poughkeepsie, at Sharon Drive, 9 returns to expressway status once again. Two miles (3.2 km) north of Sharon, the highway connects to the US 44/NY 55 concurrency at an interchange in close proximity to the Mid-Hudson Bridge. This creates some unusual left exits, as traffic from 44/55 east wanting to go north on 9 is routed into a U-turn south of the highway, and likewise northbound drivers on 9 must get turned around to go west over the river. The limited-access highway comes to an end at the intersection with NY 9G near Marist College.
Poughkeepsie to Albany.
North of Poughkeepsie, 9 is at first a busy four-lane undivided route, with occasional turn lanes as it approaches Hyde Park, passing Marist College, The Culinary Institute of America and then the home and presidential library of native Franklin D. Roosevelt. It narrows to two lanes at the built-up area that marks the center of town, then opens up a turn lane for traffic entering the third of the town's tourist attractions, Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site.
Past Hyde Park, the road narrows to two lanes again as traffic becomes more local. The area recalls Westchester County with many wooded tracts and stone walls at roadside. Through here it has been running fairly close to the river, but after Staatsburg the highway begins to veer inland again. The land to the west, between road and river, forms the Hudson River Historic District, the largest in the country and another National Historic Landmark. Route 9 is at least east of the river when it reaches Rhinebeck, the next town along the route, where NY 308 heads off to the east, and close to the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome aviation museum.
At Weys Corners, the X-shaped intersection north of Rhinebeck, northbound traffic to the river and the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge via NY 199 typically bears left onto NY 9G. Southbound traffic, in turn, takes 199 itself to the river when the two meet in Red Hook further ahead. Two blocks north of that junction are the Village Diner, originally named the Halfway Diner since it was roughly halfway along Route 9 from New York City to Albany, and the Elmendorph Inn, a mid-18th century counterpart to the diner. North of Red Hook, the land around the road begins to open up into farms and fields, offering frequent views of the Catskill Escarpment across the river. This terrain continues into Columbia County, which 9 enters beyond Red Hook.
The road remains two lanes, with mostly local traffic and no stop signs or traffic lights, until the oblique four-way intersection in Bell Pond, into the county. Here, NY 23 joins 9 as it heads west, which in turn joins NY 9H on the northern roadway while NY 82 departs to the southeast. west, in Greenport, 9 turns northward again toward Hudson, the county seat, passing the St. Lawrence-owned cement plant whose expansion was recently blocked by community activists after two contentious years.
On the east fringe of Hudson's historic downtown, US 9 intersects the northern terminus of NY 9G and NY 23B. Route 23B runs concurrent with 9 for a short distance eastward before splitting at Fairview Avenue, which US 9 follows out of Hudson. A commercial strip with turn lane gives way after to the lightly traveled rural two-lane 9 north of Hudson. Near Stockport, Route 9 meets the southern terminus of NY 9J. Farther north, after passing through Kinderhook, home of another U.S. president, Martin Van Buren, the road passes under NY 9H at a grade-separated interchange before intersecting the northern terminus of 9H a short distance later outside Valatie. When a developer wanted to add a fifth leg to this intersection for a new shopping center, the state Department of Transportation required the developer to convert the signalized intersection to a roundabout, despite heavy local opposition.
The highway widens to four lanes with a turn lane shortly after crossing into Renesslaer County, and will remain so for most of the rest of the way to Albany, despite limited development and low traffic in some areas. Within a mile of the county line it passes under the New York State Thruway Berkshire Connector and meets the lone section of I-90 in New York not part of the Thruway system, at exit 12 southeast of Castleton-on-Hudson. north of I-90 and northwest of Nassau, Route 9 veers left to merge with US 20 in Schodack Center, and together they progress northwest toward Albany. Less than from the eastern terminus of the overlap, 9 and 20 intersect NY 150 before connecting to I-90 at exit 11.
As the roadway heads westward, it meets the western (southern for state purposes) terminus of US 4 across from a Hannaford supermarket along the busy commercial strip in East Greenbush. Shortly afterwards the first sign of the state capital, the Erastus Corning Tower, starts becoming visible. At a bluff east of the river, the entire Albany skyline comes into view as the road descends, passing the northern terminus of NY 9J south of Rensselaer. Routes 9 and 20 then cross the Hudson River via the Dunn Memorial Bridge into Albany as Corning Tower and the other buildings of Empire State Plaza loom ahead, and the two routes separate, with 20 heading west across the city.
Albany and northward.
North of Albany, US 9 starts to pull away from the Hudson corridor, eventually picking up I-87, now the Adirondack Northway.
Albany to Saratoga Springs.
After the bridge, Route 9 runs under I-787 for several blocks, then takes an offramp past the Albany Pump House to become Clinton Avenue. There it intersects the two routes which have paralleled 9 up the west side of the Hudson. At Pearl Street and the Palace Theatre, it crosses NY 32 (North Pearl Street), which continues north, and US 9W (Lark Street), which ends at the junction. Route 9 turns north on Henry Johnson Boulevard and widens to cross I-90 again via a flyover originally built for the canceled Mid-Crosstown Arterial, exiting the city of Albany in the process.
Just before reaching the northern suburb of Colonie, 9 returns to two lanes and follows Loudon Road through well-to-do residential neighborhoods past Albany Memorial Hospital and Wolferts Roost Country Club. The short NY 377 forks off to the north while Route 9 trends slightly westward. A five-way intersection marks Loudonville. Siena College in Newtonville is on the east side a mile past the junction, with the Colonie Town Hall opposite.
Continuing northward into Latham, the highway adds a middle turn lane. NY 155 intersects as the Northway draws near to the west. Beyond, the road expands to four lanes and commercial property resumes. At the Latham Circle 9 crosses beneath NY 2. A mile further north, the expressway portion of Route 7 crosses over for eastbound traffic, and then NY 9R goes off to the east, to return further north. At the junction, 9 starts to trend eastward again, away from the Northway, and finally crosses the Mohawk River into Saratoga County via the Crescent Bridge at the northernmost point of Albany County.
A new name, Halfmoon Parkway, comes with the change of county, after the town the road runs through. The eastward bent reverses itself as another state route, NY 236 forks off to the north. By the time 9 reaches the NY 146 junction in Clifton Park, the Northway is right alongside again. The roads continue running parallel courses past Round Lake as NY 67 joins 9 into Malta, leaving later at the center of town for its own exit along the Northway. Another to the north, another lettered subroute of US 9, NY 9P, leaves east for Saratoga Lake.
Route 9 itself has its first exit with the Northway, its first junction with I-87 since Tarrytown in fact, north of 9P. This full cloverleaf is the main exit for Saratoga Springs. The resort town's historic downtown is ahead, past Saratoga Spa State Park and Congress Park. Here 9, as South Broadway, begins a concurrency with NY 50 and, later, briefly, with NY 29. 9P completes its loop here, and another lettered route, NY 9N, the longest letter-suffixed route in the state, begins at the post office. Tacking eastward out of town, 9 and 50 follow Van Dam Street until 9 returns to a northerly course on Marion Avenue, which becomes Maple Avenue at the city limit.
Saratoga Springs to Lake George.
Once past the sleeve of development around the highway north of the city, 9 leaves the Albany metropolitan area as it gets less developed through Wilton and Moreau. The Palmerstown Range begins to rise on one side, anticipating the mountainous country to come. From the hamlet of Kings Station onward, what is now signed as Saratoga Road follows a straight northeast course for through more wooded countryside to the entrance to Moreau Lake State Park. A mile further on, 9 again intersects the Northway at exit 17.
Another brings it to the western end of NY 197 (Reynolds Road). US 9 continues straight ahead for the next into the village of South Glens Falls, where NY 32 (Gansevoort Road), comes in at an oblique angle from the south and merges with 9 to cross the Hudson via the Cooper's Cave Bridge for the last time, leave Saratoga County and enter the Warren County city of Glens Falls.
The two routes follow Glen Street to Centennial Circle, a five-legged roundabout in the center of the city's downtown area, where 32 leaves to the right via Warren Street and NY 9L takes Ridge Street due north. 9 continues via Glen to the northwest, becoming Upper Glen Street at the city limit. NY 254 (Aviation Road) comes in from its nearby western terminus at the Northway. The highway remains heavily developed for the next to a junction with another route beginning at I-87, NY 149. It joins with US 9 briefly before leaving to the east north of the Adirondack–Lake George Outlet Mall. Many vehicles make that turn, as 149 is the best route from the Northway into southern Vermont, to the east.
Route 9 continues to parallel the interstate. At the Queensbury-Lake George town line, a massive wooden shingle lets drivers know they have crossed the Blue Line into the Adirondack Park. The route straightens out for the next into the village of Lake George, a popular tourist destination.
It takes the name Canada Street, and NY 9N comes in from the west to run concurrently with. The two routes widen to a busy four-lane road past shops catering to a busy tourist trade. Shortly thereafter, NY 9L loops back to the parent route, after having followed the east shore of the lake that gives the village its name. At the northern end of the village of Lake George, 9N splits via Lake Shore Drive to follow the western shore, and 9 itself takes a northwesterly turn to remain parallel with the Northway.
Adirondack Park.
Past Lake George, Route 9 enters the Adirondack Park. The next of Route 9 run through the eastern section of the largest protected area east of the Mississippi, with vast tracts of Forest Preserve kept "forever wild" per the state constitution. Accordingly, 9 remains a two-lane rural road, often very close to the Adirondack Northway, a section of Interstate 87, throughout the park. Development, traffic and population are minimal, the surrounding land is heavily wooded and the two roads cover very long distances between very small towns.
After Lake George, there is another exit with the Northway, to ease access to the village by southbound traffic. US 9 remains very close to the Northway on its east side, resulting in another exit north. This serves Warrensburg, where NY 418 reaches its eastern terminus. The highway begins to move further away from the interstate, and further, NY 28 concludes its long bow-shaped route at a junction with 9.
Nearly north, at Chestertown, Route 9 meets and joins NY 8, which carries it due west almost to Loon Lake. After crossing over a southwestern bay of the lake, 9 turns right and is once again on its own, trending northeast alongside the lake's western shore to eventually reach the Northway again in . This exit serves only northbound traffic. A mile later, there is access to the other direction.
The road begins to run along the west shore of Schroon Lake, in the process crossing into Essex County. Shortly after the county line, an access road leads to I-87 again. It is from here, past the hamlet of Schroon Lake at the water's northern tip, that 9 intersects NY 74, like 254 and 149 fresh off its western terminus at the Northway. Signs at this junction use Ticonderoga, to the east, as a control city, an indication of how sparsely populated the park is.
9 remains close to the interstate for the next into the town of North Hudson, where Boreas Road provides access to the Dix Mountain Wilderness Area the southernmost in the Adirondack High Peaks region. The highway again crosses the interstate to connect I-87 to the western terminus of NY 73, the well-traveled scenic route to Keene Valley and Lake Placid. At this ornate junction, 9 is at 1,155 feet (340 m) above sea level, the highest elevation it reaches along its entire length.
The right turn takes it again to the northeast past Rocky Peak Ridge and the Giant Mountain Wilderness Area, to the hamlet of New Russia. This stretch brings the highway to Elizabethtown, the unincorporated county seat and the first settlement 9 has passed through since Warrensburg. NY 9N comes through town from the west; it and US 9 briefly overlap.
While the land remains mostly forested as the road continues its northeast course from Elizabethtown, it begins to descend somewhat as the valley of Lake Champlain draws near. 9 eventually draws close to the Northway again at Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain, the Adirondacks' most popular climbing spot. In Chesterfield, without a major highway junction are ended when NY 22 joins 9 after its exit, the first pairing of two highways that begin their journey upstate in New York City.
The two routes enter Keeseville, where in mid-village they cross the Ausable River and enter Clinton County. NY 9N reappears here, reaching its northern terminus. North of the village, the two routes split again and exchange the roles they had been playing for their entire northward journey. 9 takes the eastward fork to the lake, running close to the state's edge; while 22 will run inland from here to the border.
After Keeseville, 9 follows AuSable Chasm down to the lake shore. It crosses the Ausable and briefly re-enters Essex County long enough for the short NY 373 to provide access to the Burlington–Port Kent Ferry. A third and final crossing takes it out of the Adirondack Park.
Lake Champlain, Plattsburgh and Canada.
After 9 passes Ausable Marsh Wildlife Management Area and NY 442 comes in from the east at the small hamlet of Peru, 9 heads down to the shore of the lake itself, which it will stay close to all the way into Plattsburgh as Lakes to Locks Passage. On clear days it is possible to see Burlington across the water. Ahead lies Valcour Island. In the narrow, rocky strait between it and the shore, Benedict Arnold's hastily built fleet held off the British on October 11, 1776 in the Battle of Valcour Island in what is considered the first battle in U.S. naval history. More recent military history is apparent shortly thereafter when 9 passes now-closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base, a pillar of the regional economy Plattsburgh has struggled to replace.
When it actually enters Plattsburgh, it becomes first U.S. Avenue, then Peru Street when it passes the Old Catholic Cemetery. The Saranac River draws alongside twice before 9 takes a left turn at Bridge Street and crosses it. Just past the bridge, the highway turns left again onto City Hall Place at the center of town. Route 9 passes in front of the City Hall designed by John Russell Pope, also the builder of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington. Two more quick lefts follow past the large obelisk of Riverside Park, onto Miller and Cornelia streets, and then 9 turns right at the eastern terminus of the lengthy NY 3 to follow Margaret Street north and out of the city.
It bends northeast to return to the lake shore shortly after the city limit, following alongside Cumberland Bay. At the Dead Creek crossing, 9 widens to four lanes for the first time since the Albany area to handle the heavy traffic at the junction with NY 314, another ferry connector, just southeast of the Northway. north of the junction, after North Country Shopping Center, the highway returns to two lanes and the name Lakes to Locks Passage as it overlooks Woodruff Pond and Treadwell Bay. I-87 is visible a thousand feet (305 m) to the east across the many open fields as the two roads parallel each other's turns closely.
Another short route, NY 456, comes in from the west and terminates at 9 shortly after the right turn for Point Au Roche State Park. Continuing northward, the road deviates to the east slightly in the Town of Chazy, but returns to its previous track by the interstate at the Little Chazy River bridge. Shortly afterwards, NY 191 (Miner Farm Road) comes in from the west.
Route 9 runs straight due north, no longer taking another name, to the next major intersection, NY 9B (Lavalley Road), its last sub-route. 9B does not terminate but instead runs to the lake-shore and eventually north to Rouses Point. A bend slightly to the west, closer to the Northway, brings the next stretch to 9's last major intersection, US 11, just south of Champlain.
US 9 winds through the quiet border village as its Main Street, turning west-northwest near Champlain's northern boundary to make its last water crossing over the Chazy River. The route, still known as Main Street, heads northwest towards the Northway to follow it for the last , passing a few customs brokerages towards its official end at the on-ramp to the last exit. Traffic to Canada must get on I-87 here.
The roadway continues as the East Service Road, unsigned NY 971B, for another . This was the former route of US 9 to the border prior to the construction of the Northway. It is devoid of any development save some long vacant and abandoned lots, finally ending in a parking lot south of the border from which the Canadian customs station at the south end of Autoroute 15 is visible.
History.
Origins.
Much of what is now US 9 in New York was assigned an unsigned legislative route designation by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route 2 joined modern US 9 at Archville (north of Tarrytown) and followed it north to Croton-on-Hudson, where it turned off to the northeast on modern NY 129. The legislative route rejoined what is now US 9 at Peekskill and remained on it to Valatie, where it met Route 1. Route 2 ended here while Route 1 continued north to Albany on current US 9. From Albany to Clifton Park and from South Glens Falls to Riparius, modern US 9 was part of Route 25. At Riparius, Route 25 met Route 22, which utilized what is now US 9 from Riparius to Elizabethtown and from Keeseville to the town of Champlain. While modern US 9 travels directly from Elizabethtown to Keeseville and bypasses Rouses Point to the west, Route 25 used current NY 9N between Elizabethtown and Keeseville and served Rouses Point via modern NY 9B. Routes 2 and 25 were realigned slightly on March 1, 1921, to utilize the modern US 9 corridor from Croton-on-Hudson to Peekskill and from Saratoga Springs to South Glens Falls, respectively.
When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the general routing of modern US 9 was designated as NY 6, which went from the New York City line at Yonkers north to the Canadian border near Rouses Point. From New York City, NY 6 followed current US 9 north to Tarrytown, where it joined legislative Route 2 and continued north through Valatie to Albany via legislative Routes 1 and 2. North of Albany, NY 6 served Cohoes, Mechanicville, and Round Lake via modern NY 32 and NY 67. At Round Lake, NY 6 rejoined the path of current US 9 and headed north to Saratoga Springs. Past Saratoga Springs, NY 6 continued to Rouses Point on legislative Routes 22 and 25. NY 6 had two spur routes: NY 6A in Westchester County and NY 6B in Rensselaer and Saratoga counties.
Designation.
In the original 1925 plan for the U.S. Highway System, US 9 was designated along the west bank of the Hudson River from the New Jersey line to Albany, utilizing then-NY 10. North of Albany, US 9 mostly followed NY 6 to Canada. The lone deviation was from Elizabethtown to Keeseville, where US 9 was routed on a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. NY 6 east of the Hudson (up to Rensselaer) and a further extension to Glens Falls via Troy, Mechanicville, and Schuylerville was designated as US 109. The alignment of US 9 within New York remained unchanged in the final system alignment approved on November 11, 1926. However, when US 9 was commissioned in New York in 1927, the US 109 designation had been dropped and was signed instead as US 9E, but only up to Waterford. The segment on the west bank of the Hudson from New Jersey to Waterford was redesignated as US 9W, with the split routes meeting in Waterford. From there, unsuffixed US 9 began (still along NY 6) and went up to the Canadian border via Rouses Point as planned in 1925.
The former routing of NY 6 between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, bypassed by US 9, became NY 9W at this time. A shorter, more inland alternate route between Albany and Round Lake was designated as NY 9C sometime in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the "E" suffix was dropped from all of US 9E south of East Greenbush—making it part of US 9—while US 9W was truncated southward to end in Albany. At the same time, US 9 was realigned between Albany and Round Lake to use what had been NY 9C. The Waterford–Mechanicville portion of US 9's former routing and the segment of US 9E between East Greenbush and Waterford became part of an extended US 4. The remainder of the old riverside route south of Waterford became part of NY 32 while the Round Lake–Mechanicville segment of old US 9 became part of NY 67.
Realignments.
US 9 (and US 9E before it) originally crossed into New Jersey via the Edgewater Ferry in Harlem. It was shifted northward onto the George Washington Bridge when it opened in 1934. In mid-December 1934, US 9 was signed within New York City for the first time, as were several other U.S. Highways and state routes. US 9 followed the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan, where it continued east on 179th Street to Broadway. Here, US 9 turned north as it does today, following Broadway through Manhattan and The Bronx to Yonkers. The route was moved from 179th Street to the Cross Bronx Expressway following the completion of the highway in the vicinity of the eastern bridge approach.
In the mid-1940s, the northern end of US 9 was realigned to enter Canada via Champlain instead of Rouses Point. The old route through Rouses Point became NY 9B. In the mid-1960s, the Adirondack Northway was completed in the vicinity of Champlain, supplanting the northernmost of US 9. US 9 initially overlapped with I-87 from exit 43 to the Canadian border; however, it was truncated to end at exit 43—the last interchange before the border—in the 1970s. Part of US 9's former routing to the border was retained as a service road and was designated as NY 971B, an unsigned reference route.
Croton Expressway.
Since the 1940s, an expressway along the US 9 corridor on the east bank of the Hudson River had been planned. Part of the route later became the New York State Thruway (up to Tarrytown). In 1956, there were plans to continue the expressway further north to I-84 in Beacon and beyond. This was one of the proposed alignments for I-87.
In early 1965, this unconstructed expressway was assigned the designation I-487, allowing a commercial-vehicle-accessible means of travel on the east side of the Hudson River. By 1967, strong resident opposition caused the segment from Peekskill to Beacon to be cancelled. In 1971, the section from Tarrytown to Ossining had also been cancelled due to lack of public support. The only portion that was ever built was the section from Crotonville to Peekskill, and was later named the Croton Expressway. The Croton Expressway opened in 1967 with the US 9 designation. The original surface alignment of US 9 became an extension of NY 9A.
Other developments.
In Albany, US 9 was planned to be upgraded to an expressway. It was to run west from the Dunn Memorial Bridge along the South Mall Arterial (co-signed with US 20), then north along the northern half of the Mid-Crosstown Arterial. The southern half would carry US 9W. The Mid-Crosstown Arterial would have begun at the junction of I-787 and the New York State Thruway, connect with the South Mall Arterial at an underground interchange at Washington Park, and continue north to a junction with I-90. The only portion that was actually constructed was in the vicinity of the I-90 interchange (exit 6).
A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2009 found that US 9 was the deadliest highway in Dutchess County, with 47 fatal accidents on the road in the 1994–2008 period. Police in the town of Poughkeepsie blamed it on the increasing commercialization of US 9 south of the city of Poughkeepsie.
Suffixed routes.
US 9 has had 19 suffixed routes bearing 17 different designations. Most are still in place; however, nine have been removed or renumbered. All of the routes were assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York unless otherwise noted.

(which resulted from the merger of "Winthrop Chemical Company Inc." and "Frederick Stearns & Company"). It was formerly known as "Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals", whose primary product lines included diagnostic imaging agents, hormonal products, cardiovascular products, analgesics, antihistamines and muscle relaxants.
Chemical compounds produced by this company were often known by their manufacturing code which consisted of the abbreviation WIN (for Winthrop) followed by a number. For example, WIN 18,320 was nalidixic acid, the first quinolone antibiotic.
History.
1910s.
The Company was established in 1901 (then called "Neuralgyline Co.") in Wheeling, West Virginia, by Albert H. Diebold and William E. Weiss, a pharmacist. At the end of World War I in 1918, Sterling purchased the US assets of a German company now known as Bayer AG for US $5.3 million. This purchase was directed under the Alien Property Custodian Act. In 1919, Sterling sold its dye division for $2.5 million to the "Grasselli Chemical Company" (based in Linden, New Jersey), which employed many former Bayer personnel.
1920s.
A 1920 agreement between Sterling and Bayer AG granted Sterling the rights to the "Bayer" brand to sell aspirin. In return, Bayer was allowed back into its former Latin American markets. In 1922, 50% of Sterling's new holding company, "Winthrop", was given to the German Bayer company, while the American Bayer retained the rights to use Bayer brand. In 1923 Sterling purchased a 25% interest in The Centaur Company, manufacturer of Charles Henry Fletcher's, Fletcher's Castoria (New York Times, Feb 9, 1923, Page 24, Col 1).
1940s.
In 1940, a cross-contamination from equipment sharing resulted in Winthrop Chemical producing contaminated sulfathiazole tablets contaminated with phenobarbital. Each sulfathiazole tablet was contaminated with about 350 mg of phenobarbital. An investigation by US Food and Drug Administration and the findings resulted in actions. The incident was influential in the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practices for drugs.
1960s to 1970s.
In 1967, Sterling Drug acquired Lehn & Fink, the makers of Lysol, Resolve, and D-Con. In 1974, Sterling opened a manufacturing plant in McPherson, Kansas. The various companies which would eventually acquire Sterling chose to keep the factory open.
1980s to 1990s.
In 1988, Sterling was acquired by Eastman Kodak for $5.1 billion. In 1993, Eastman Kodak/Sterling Winthrop partnered with a French pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi (now known as Sanofi Aventis). In June 1994, Eastman Kodak sold the prescription drug business of its Sterling Winthrop subsidiary to Sanofi for US $1.675 billion and the return of Kodak's minority stake in Sterling Health Europe. A week later, Sanofi announced that it was not interested in the diagnostic imaging business, which it sold to thee Norwegian company Hafslund Nycomed AS for US$450 million.
In August 1994, Kodak sold the remainder of Sterling Winthrop, including its over the counter drug business which had been generating about $1 billion in revenue annually, to the British firm SmithKline Beecham for US $2.925 billion cash.
Bayer was a losing bidder for the purchase of Sterling Winthrop, but in September 1994, it purchased the over the counter division of Sterling Winthrop in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico from SmithKline Beecham for $1 billion. Bayer also re-acquired the brand rights to "Bayer Aspirin" name it had lost because of World War I.
Spinoffs from the sale of Sterling include Starwin Products, created in 1987 from Sterling’s original branch in Ghana. The Lehn & Fink division was acquired by Reckitt & Colman (now Reckitt Benckiser) at the time of the deal.

Musique mesurée

Musique mesurée, or "Musique mesurée à l'antique", was a style of vocal musical composition in France in the late 16th century. In "musique mesurée", longer syllables in the French language were set to longer note values, and shorter syllables to shorter, in a homophonic texture but in a situation of metric fluidity, in an attempt to imitate contemporary understanding of Ancient Greek music. Although this compositional method did not attain popularity at first, it attracted some of the most famous composers of the time. Its basis in a desire to re-create the artistic ethos of Ancient Greece, especially in respect to text declamation, had a strong similarity to contemporary movements in Italy, such as the work of the Florentine Camerata which engendered the first operas, and brought about the beginning of the Baroque era in music.
History.
Pieces written as "musique mesurée" were settings of the poetical form known as "vers mesurés". Beginning in the late 1560s in Paris, under the direction of Jean-Antoine de Baïf, a group of poets known as the Pléiade attempted to recreate the metrical effect of ancient Greek and Latin poetry in French, using the quantitative principles of those languages. The attempt was more than an academic one: Baïf and his associates, horrified by the barbarity of the age, including the bloody religious wars which raged throughout the last decades of the century, sought to improve mankind by bringing back the ancient diction, which was believed to have had a positive ethical effect on its hearers. For this attempt they had the approval of the current king of France, Charles IX, and they met in secret to plan their musical revolution. Baïf, with the royal patent, founded the "Académie de Poésie et de Musique" in 1570, along with his intimate musical associate Joachim Thibault de Courville. Poet Pierre de Ronsard was also involved in the group.
As originally planned, the members of the "Académie" would be in a hierarchy of two grades: first, the composers and singers, known as the "professionnels", and after that, the gentleman listeners, known as the "auditeurs", who were also to provide financial backing for the enterprise. Aside from this small group of aristocrats, no one else was invited. The concerts took place at Baïf's house in Paris: Charles IX himself, who provided much of the patronage, was often present.
Some of the house rules have been recorded. There was to be no talking, or disturbances of any kind, during the singing, and anyone who came in late had to wait until the end of a piece to be seated – rather like modern concert-hall etiquette. Musicians were to rehearse every day, and no music was to be copied or taken away from the area of performance. The music was so closely guarded, at least during the early years of the "Académie", that no music of the originating composer – Courville – is known to have survived.
The "Académie" was short-lived, and probably did not survive after 1573, the year of the death of Charles IX. Another similar group, the "Académie du Palais", which met at the Louvre after 1573 with the backing of the new king, Henri III, seemed to carry on some of the work of the previous group, but its aim seems to have been more to debate philosophical issues than to reform humanity through reviving Ancient Greek and Latin poetry and music. The activities, if any, of the original Académie after this time are poorly-documented: while the musicians continued to meet, it is not known if they met in a formal setting, as they had prior to the death of Charles IX. This was during a period of increasing religious turmoil, ending in the fighting in Paris in 1589, and the assassination of the king; associations of humanists such as the "Académie", which included both Catholics and Protestants, became increasingly difficult (Baïf, a Catholic, even wrote a sonnet in 1572 praising the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; Claude Le Jeune, a Protestant, was nearly murdered during the siege of Paris in 1589).
Even though the original "Académie" had faded away within a few years of its founding, several prominent composers found the concept of "musique mesurée" to be so attractive as to make it their primary compositional method. The most famous of these was Claude Le Jeune, followed by Jacques Mauduit, Eustache Du Caurroy, Nicolas de la Grotte, and Guillaume Costeley.
Musical style.
When "musique mesurée" first appeared, it was used mainly in French secular songs known as chansons. Most of the chansons written in the style were for five voices, unaccompanied, although instruments began to be used as accompaniment before long. Typically they consisted of a strophe and a refrain; the refrain would have the same music each time it recurred. As composers realized the adaptability of the musical style to other forms, they began to employ it elsewhere, for example in sacred music, such as psalm settings.
The texture of the music was almost uniformly homophonic, with all the voices singing essentially the same rhythm. The repeating pattern of longs and shorts, following the poetry, was irregular, leading to the perception to a modern ear of irregular meters. Occasional short melismas – decorative passages to ease the monotonous rhythm – appeared in many of the parts, especially in the work of Claude Le Jeune.
Long and short syllables were invariably set in a 2:1 relation, for example quarter-notes on the longs and eighth-notes on the shorts. This was in order to mirror long and short syllables used in classical poetry, which in contemporary poetry would be stress accents. In modern notation, the meters would be irregular; often music in the "musique mesurée" is left unbarred in modern transcription, or given bar lines only at the end of phrases.
In addition to their use of ancient metres, composers of "musique mesurée" also used later interpretations of classical musical modes in order to move the emotions of their listeners, as it was described in ancient Greek sources.
Influence.
While "musique mesurée" was created and sung by a small group of people for a limited audience, and for the most part in secret, it was to have a profound effect on French music for the next hundred years. The "air de cour", the secular style of song which dominated the musical scene in France beginning in the 1580s, used the principles of "musique mesurée" with the difference that it usually used rhyming verse. In addition, even in the late 17th century, the influence of "musique mesurée" can be seen in the style of French recitative, both in opera and in sacred music.
Composers that continued using the methods of "musique mesurée" into the 17th century included Jacques Mauduit, who used it for creating large works for mixed vocal and instrumental forces, roughly in the Venetian style, and Eustache Du Caurroy, who used the method for psalm settings. Marin Mersenne, in his "Harmonie universelle" of 1636-7, praised Du Caurroy as the finest practitioner of the style.

Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion

The Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion is a large, heavy-lift cargo helicopter currently being developed by Sikorsky Aircraft for the United States Marine Corps. The design features three engines, new composite rotor blades, and a wider cabin than previous CH-53 variants. It will be the largest and heaviest helicopter in the U.S. military. Two hundred helicopters are planned to be delivered at a total cost of over $23bn. Ground Test Vehicle (GTV) testing started in April 2014 with flight testing due to start later in 2014.
Development.
H-53 background.
The CH-53 was the product of the US Marine Corps' "Heavy Helicopter Experimental" (HH(X)) competition begun in 1962. Sikorsky's S-65 was selected over Boeing Vertol's modified CH-47 Chinook version. The prototype YCH-53A first flew on October 14, 1964. The helicopter was designated "CH-53A Sea Stallion" and delivery of production helicopters began in 1966. The CH-53A is equipped with T64-GE-6 shaft turbine and has a max gross weight of 46,000 lb (20,865 kg).
Variants of the original CH-53A Sea Stallion include the RH-53A/D, HH-53B/C, CH-53D, CH-53G, and MH-53H/J/M. The RH-53A and RH-53D were used by the United States Navy for mine sweeping. The CH-53D included a more powerful version of the General Electric T64 engine, used in all H-53 variants, and external fuel tanks. The US Air Force's HH-53B/C "Super Jolly Green Giant" were for special operations and combat rescue. The Air Force's MH-53H/J/M Pave Low helicopters were the last of the twin engined H-53s and were equipped with extensive avionics upgrades for all weather operation.
In October 1967, the US Marine Corps issued a requirement for a helicopter with a lifting capacity 1.8 times that of the CH-53D and would fit on amphibious assault ships. Before this Sikorsky had been working on an enhancement to the CH-53D, under the company designation "S-80", featuring a third turboshaft engine and a more powerful rotor system. Sikorsky proposed the S-80 design to the Marines in 1968. The Marines considered this a good, quick solution, and funded development of a testbed helicopter. Changes on the CH-53E also included a stronger transmission and a fuselage stretched 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m). The main rotor blades were changed to a titanium-fiberglass composite. A new automatic flight control system was added. The tail configuration was also changed to a larger vertical tail with the tail rotor tilted slightly to provide some lift in hover.
In 1974, the initial YCH-53E first flew. Following successful testing the initial production contract was awarded in 1978, and service introduction followed in February 1981. The US Navy acquired the CH-53E in small numbers for shipboard resupply. The Marines and Navy acquired a total of 177. For the airborne mine countermeasures role, the Navy later ordered a CH-53E version designated "MH-53E Sea Dragon" with enlarged sponsons and fuel tanks for greater fuel storage. The MH-53E began to be used by the Navy in 1986. The Navy obtained 46 Sea Dragons.
CH-53K.
The US Marine Corps had been planning to upgrade most of its CH-53Es to keep them in service, but this plan stalled. Sikorsky then proposed a new version, originally the "CH-53X", and in April 2006 the USMC signed a contract for 156 aircraft as the "CH-53K" valued at $18.8 billion with deliveries to be completed by 2021. The Marines were planning to start retiring CH-53Es in 2009 and needed new helicopters very quickly as some aircraft would start hitting their structural life limits in 2011-12. Flight testing of the CH-53K was expected to begin in 2011.
The CH-53K is a general redesign of the CH-53E. The main improvements are new engines and cockpit layout. The CH-53K will have over twice the lift capacity and radius of action of the CH-53E, and a wider cargo hold to allow it to carry a Humvee internally. The CH-53K will feature new stubby composite sponsons to cut overall width, giving the helicopter a narrower footprint for shipboard operations. It will also be equipped with a new composite rotor blade system, with technology similar to that currently found on the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. The CH-53K will use the General Electric GE38-1B engine. This engine beat out the Pratt and Whitney Canada PW150 and a derivative of the Rolls-Royce AE 1107C-Liberty used on the V-22 Osprey.
Sikorsky has announced its major subcontractors: Aurora Flight Sciences (main rotor pylon), ITT Integrated Structures (tail rotor pylon and sponsons), GKN Aerospace (aft transition), Onboard Systems International (external cargo hook system), Rockwell Collins (avionics management system), Sanmina-SCI Corporation (Intercommunications System), and Spirit AeroSystems (cockpit and cabin).
In August 2007, the USMC increased its order of CH-53Ks from 156 to 227. In 2007, first flight was planned for November 2011 with initial operating capability (IOC) by 2015. When the CH-53K enters service, it will serve as the USMC's heavy lift helicopter with the MV-22 (medium lift) and UH-1Y (light lift). RAND released a report in 2007 on seabasing that suggested a higher ratio of CH-53Ks to MV-22s would reduce deployment times from naval ships.
In 2008, design work was well underway. Progress was being made in weight reduction efforts to meet operational requirements. Increases in engine performance and rotor blade improvements are options to help meet requirements if needed. The rotor mast tilt angle was decreased and components shifted to ensure the center of gravity does not shift too far rearward as fuel is burned. 
On 22 January 2010, Sikorsky Aircraft opened a $20 million Precision Components Technology Center in Stratford, Connecticut which will focus on production of the CH-53K. This facility will produce the rotating and stationary swashplates, main and tail rotor hubs, and main rotor sleeves among other parts. On 3 August 2010, the CH-53K passed Critical Design Review (CDR), and the program is ready for test production. However, the IOC fielding date was deferred to 2018. Sikorsky had proposed to build four pre-production aircraft for operational evaluations.
On 4 December 2012, Sikorsky delivered the first CH-53K, a Ground Test Vehicle (GTV) airframe. It was put through many hours of powered ground checks. Preliminary tests included calibrating the aircraft's fuel system and attaching measuring devices at various test locations on the airframe to record temperature, aerodynamic loads, pressure, and vibrations. Two additional static ground test articles underwent structural testing at the company's main manufacturing plant in Stratford, Connecticut. 
In January 2013, the program was estimated to cost US$23.17 billion after procurement of the planned 200 CH-53K helicopters. In April 2013, the U.S. Navy program manager commented that development of the CH-53K was "proceeding so well" that it might become operational ahead of schedule. The first flight vehicle was scheduled for delivery in late 2013; flight testing is planned for 2014 and a production decision is expected by August 2015.
On 31 May 2013, the Navy awarded Sikorsky a $435 million contract to deliver four prototype CH-53Ks for operational evaluation and mission testing; all four are expected to be delivered by March 2017.
Israeli Air Force has shown strong interest in purchasing the CH-53K to replace its existing CH-53 fleet. In 2009, the service said it would evaluate the new variant after it flies.
On 1 October 2013, Sikorsky issued an $8.5 million contract to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for the design and development of maintenance training systems for the CH-53K. The contract includes a full-fidelity Maintenance Training Device Suite (MTDS) and a Helicopter Emulation Maintenance Trainer (HEMT) for the Marine Corps. The full-fidelity MTDS provides a true-to-life environment for training and evaluating the maintainers of multiple subsystems on the CH-53K platform. It supports maintenance training as well as remove-and-replace training for avionics systems, electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and other mechanical subsystems. The HEMT uses a 3D virtual environment to support maintenance training scenarios. It will provide Marine CH-53K Enlisted Aircrew and maintainers with an accurate environment to train functional tests, fault isolation, troubleshooting, and remove and installation for 27 subsystems.
On 24 January 2014, the CH-53K GTV ignited its GE38-1B engines and spun the rotor head without rotors attached. Engine ignition is a significant step after independent subsystems testing had been completed. Low-rate production is planned to proceed from 2015 to 2017. The CH-53K is planned to achieve initial operating capability (IOC) in 2019, with full-rate production commencing sometime between then and 2022. The USMC is planning for eight active CH-53K squadrons, one training squadron, and one reserve squadron. In April 2014 testing with blades attached began, and systems integration is to be next. Flight tests are expected at the end of 2014, lasting 3 years. Eventually four engineering aircraft will fly 500 hours each.
On 5 May 2014, General James F. Amos announced during the official rollout that the CH-53K will be called the "King Stallion".
Design.
The CH-53K is a general redesign with new engines and cockpit layout. The CH-53K will use General Electric T408 (GE38-1B) engines rated at each and will be able to fly faster than its CH-53E predecessor.
It will feature a new digital glass cockpit with fly-by-wire controls, a new elastomeric hub system, and composite rotor blades to improve "hot and high" performance. The gearbox assembly weighs around ; by itself heavier than a Blackhawk. The CH-53K will also include an improved external cargo handling system, survivability enhancements, and improvements to extend service life. The cabin will be long by wide by tall. Its cabin will be wider and 15% larger, but will have new shorter composite sponsons.
The CH-53K is to surpass the capability of the CH-53E by carrying nearly double the external payload of over the same radius of . The CH-53K's payload reaches a maximum of . The CH-53K's maximum gross weight will be , which is increased over the CH-53E's . The CH-53K will keep approximately the same footprint as the CH-53E.
The CH-53K can carry two 463L master pallets, eliminating the need to break apart pallets between airlifter and helicopter.
The design requirements were 'frozen' in 2009-10 and not changed since.

National English Literary Museum

The National English Literary Museum (NELM) houses extensive archival material relating to Southern African English Literature. It is located in Grahamstown. NELM has principally three collections: manuscripts, books and journals, and press clippings. The museum also conducts many outreach programmes (mainly focussed on school pupils and university students) aimed at promoting and creating awareness of South Africa's rich literary heritage. 
History.
The museum was established in 1972. Prof Guy F Butler, the Head of Department of the Rhodes University English Department and himself a poet, became aware of the need for the manuscripts of South African authors to be collected. His collection of his and other writers' material soon became too large for the cupboard he at first housed it in. By an Act of Parliament, NELM was eventually born. The NELM collections currently occupy three adjacent buildings in Beaufort Street.

Clevedon Shore

Clevedon Shore () is a 0.38 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest adjacent to the Severn Estuary at Clevedon, North Somerset, notified in 1991.
It is the side of a mineralised fault, which runs east-west adjacent to the pier, and forms a small cliff feature in Dolomitic Conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulfides. The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, Covellite and other Copper sulfides.
The site is listed as a Geological Conservation Review site as several of the minerals found here are rare, in particular the beaudantite. The presence of copper and arsenic is unusual for the Mendip district.

D'

The sensitivity index or d' (pronounced 'dee-prime') is a statistic used in signal detection theory. It provides the separation between the means of the signal and the noise distributions, compared against the standard deviation of the noise distribution. For normally distributed signal and noise with mean and standard deviations formula_1 and formula_2, and formula_3 and formula_4, respectively, d' is defined as:
An estimate of d' can be also found from measurements of the hit rate and false-alarm rate. It is calculated as:
where function "Z"("p"), "p" ∈ [0,1], is the inverse of the cumulative Gaussian distribution.
"d' " is a dimensionless statistic. A higher "d'" indicates that the signal can be more readily detected.

Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch

Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, jure uxoris Earl of Menteith (died 1258) was the son of William Comyn, Justiciar of Scotia and Mormaer or Earl of Buchan by right of his second wife. 
Life.
Walter makes his first appearance in royal charters as early as 1211–1214. In 1220, he accompanied King Alexander II of Scotland during the latter's visit to York. He appears as "Lord of Badenoch" as early as 1229, after the defeat of the "Meic Uilleim" by his father. 
Like his father, Walter was given the hand of an heiress, Isabella, Countess of Menteith. 
By 1234, Isabella had inherited the Mormaerdom of Menteith, and so Walter became Mormaer or Earl of Menteith by right of his wife ("jure uxoris"). 
Walter appears to have had a son named Henry who witnessed a charter, dated to 1250, of Maol Domhnaich, Mormaer of Lennox. 
His daughter Isabel was given in marriage to Gilchrist Mure.
Walter was one of the leading political figures in the Kingdom of Scotland, especially during the minority of King Alexander III, when, along with Alan Durward, he essentially ran the country. 
He died suddenly in either the October or November of 1258. 
By this time, his son Henry must have been dead. 
Isabella remained countess until 1260–1261, when Walter Stewart, husband of Isabella's sister Mary, seized the province. 
As Walter had no surviving male children, the Lordship of Badenoch passed to Walter's nephew John. John was unable to inherit Menteith.
He is remembered primarily in the proverbial expression "Walter of Guiyock's curse", encountered in Sir Walter Scott's Rob Roy, under the English and Lowland form of his name, Walter Cuming, where it appears in chapter 29: 
The origin of this is related in Sir Walter Scott's note at that page:
An accident such as this was supposed to be a curse akin to that dealt upon Walter Cuming for his sins. It was thus that the expression originated.

WRST-FM

WRST-FM (90.3 FM) licensed to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is the student managed radio station located at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh.
History.
WRST started programming on April 20, 1966 at 6pm. Originally located at 88.1FM with 10 watts of power, WRST was only on the air for four hours each week night. The first song played on WRST was The Mamas & the Papas "Monday, Monday". Doctor Robert "Doc" Snyder was hired by the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1964 to start a broadcast media program and as part of his duties he established a radio and TV station (Titan TV). In 1966, Frank G. Kilpatrick moved from California to be the UW-O manager of the station as well as teach Radio Broadcasting to the students. He had been Vice President of KXRX in San Jose.
WRST's call letters stand for "Radio Station of the Titans". However, some rumors around campus suggest that the call letters stand for "Robert Snyder's Toy", after the stations creator. Originally the call letters were supposed to be WSUO "Wisconsin State University Oshkosh" to be consistent with other state university radio stations, but those call letters were already taken and WRST was chosen.
The Fuller Goodman Lumber Company served as the station's first studios. An antenna was located on the roof of the Gruenhagen Conference Center. In 1971, production and transmission was moved to the Arts and Communication center and the signal frequency changed from 88.1 FM to 90.3 FM.
In 1992, Director of Radio Services Ben Jarman established an affiliation with the Wisconsin Public Radio Ideas Network. This was done to cover programming during the hours students are in class and over breaks from the academic year when staffing became a problem at WRST. The affiliation continues to this date.
On April 5, 2005, at 2:08pm WRST began streaming locally produced programming online. The original stream and streaming server were set up by Joshua Werner. 
In 2006, WRST celebrated its 40th anniversary with a week of celebration. Also in 2006 WRST completed a studio demolition and remodel to make the studios fully ADA compliant. 
Future plans are to bring more studio equipment up to date in the production studios, to add automation software to better train students for work at other stations and to add an IBOC digital radio transmitter to start broadcasting in high definition.
About WRST.
Students at WRST are responsible for most management aspects of the station and fully staff it. Professional supervision is provided by the Director of Radio Services and Director of Engineering who provide legal and technical guidance to the students. 
Programming from WRST is shared half time with Wisconsin Public Radio's "Ideas Network" which runs from 2am-1pm daily. Student shows are on the air from 1pm-2am and provides a wide variety of music, news and talk programming along with Sports coverage of UW-Oshkosh Athletics. 
Current WRST Programming Schedule
Since 1989, Sociology professor Dr. Gerry Grzyb, called "Dr. Christmas" on-the-air, has been hosting a yearly Christmas music program on WRST the week after the fall semester concludes in December. The "Dr. Christmas Show" is proclaimed the most diverse Christmas music program in America.

<doc id="5895843" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895843" title="Yeongeunmun">
Yeongeunmun

The Yeongeunmun (literally "welcoming gate for obligation") was a historical gate located in present Hyeonjeo-dong, Seodaemun-gu, in the northwestern part of Seoul, South Korea. It was built in front of Mohwagwan (hangul: 모화관, hanja: ) during the Joseon Dynasty where envoys dispatched from Ming and Qing China were received as diplomatic guests. 
In 1896, the gate was demolished along with Mohwagwan one year after the First Sino-Japanese War ended, which was a war between China and Japan primarily for the control over Korea. The Korean independence activist Seo Jae-pil (known as Philip Jaisohn) built the Independence Gate on the site with the desire towards inspiring the spirit of independence in Korea.
History.
The Yeongeunmun Gate was located just outside the Donuimun (돈의문, 敦義門, West Gate) of the walled capital city of Hanseong (present-day Seoul). It was situated on the road from Seoul to Beijing, adjacent to the Mohwagwan. Its nearest post station was the Hongjewon (홍제원, 弘濟院).
Embassies were occasionally sent to Joseon by the emperor of the Ming Dynasty to announce imperial succession, investiture of a crown prince and others. When they reached the Hongjewon, they took off their traveling clothes and changed into formal attire. The next day, they received a reception from the king himself in front of the gate. The rite performed by the king two times in history of Joseon. After Ming China envoys move off to the gate, King Jungjong performed a rite, in direction of the Ming Dynasty emperor. This ritual ceased in 1634.
The Mohwagwan was first built in 1407 as "Mohwaru" (모화루, 慕華樓) and then renovated in 1430. It was located adjacent to the Mohwagwan, a gate with rosewood pillars was built on the road.
In 1537 the gate was rebuilt in accordance with Ming Dynasty customs. Being roofed with blue tiles and had "Yeongjomun" (literally gate of welcoming imperial decrees) written on the front tables. In 1539 it was renamed to "Yeongeunmun" because the name of "Yeongjomun" was accused by the Ming Dynasty ambassador Xue Tingchong (薛廷寵). He claimed that since the imperial envoys carried imperial orders (勅), imperial decrees (詔), and imperial gifts, it was inappropriate to mention only imperial decree. The tablet was written by Zhu Zhifan (朱之蕃), who came to Joseon as an ambassador in 1606.
As a result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895), Qing China recognized the "full and complete independence and autonomy" of Joseon Korea. In the next year Yeongeunmun was demolished leaving its two stone pillars. In front of the remnant, the Independence Gate was built by Philip Jaisohn.
Location.
Seodaemun Independence Park, including the remnants of Yeongeunmun, is easily accessed from exits 4 or 5 of the Dongnimmun Station on Seoul Subway Line 3.

Pre-game show

A pre-game show or pregame show is a TV or radio presentation that occurs immediately before the live broadcast of a major sporting event. 
Contents may include:
 The networks that broadcast the NFL were the first networks to create and air pre-game shows. CBS was the first to broadcast a sports pre-game show in 1964, when the network launched a 15-minute regional sports program that interviewed players and coaches and featured news and features about the league. The show aired immediately before games on CBS. The shows originated in studio and live from the fields, and featured broadcaster Jack Buck. In 1967, the show grew to 30 minutes in length and in 1976, aired a new 90-minute “Super Bowl Special” before Super Bowl X. The show moved to two hours long in 1984 and featured 11 broadcasters, 13 producers and four directors.
FOX created its own pre-game show when it won the rights to broadcast NFC games in 1994. The network hired James Brown to host the show and brought on analysts such as Terry Bradshaw to lead the coverage. In 2006, Brown left the network to return to CBS and host their pre-game show, NFL Today.
NBC launched its own version of a pre-game show – Grandstand – in 1975, and not only featured NFL programming, but other sporting events around the nation. The show led up to the NFL’s 1 p.m. games but covered college football, golf, tennis and many other sports and topics. The network hired Jack Buck to host the show and the show didn’t just preview that day’s NFL games but did investigative pieces on a variety of topics. 
Starting from Wrestlemania 28 WWE have aired a monthly live half an hour pre-show on YouTube before each of their PPVs featuring a match, an interview and the hype for the subsequent PPV.
Pre-game shows generally run for 30 minutes to one hour, though for some big events such as the Super Bowl, a pre-game show has run up to six hours in length. While most pre-game shows are done in a studio (sometimes with live shots to someone at the event itself), some shows travel to certain locations to broadcast – the most famous being ESPN’s “College Gameday” pre-game show, which broadcasts live from various different college campuses for football and basketball games.

Jacob Barker (1779–1871) was an American financier and lawyer.
He was born in Swan Island, Maine, in 1779, of Quaker parentage. He went to New York at the age of 16, engaged in trade, and soon amassed a considerable fortune. Beginning in 1811, Fitz-Greene Halleck was employed by him for twenty years. Early in the War of 1812 he was instrumental in securing a loan of $5,000,000 for the national government. In 1815, he founded the Exchange Bank of New York. He was a member of the New York State Senate in 1816. Subsequently he became interested in many other large financial institutions in the city, including the Life and Fire Insurance Company, on the failure of which in 1826 he, with a number of others, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to defraud. At first he acted as his own lawyer, however, eventually eminent attorneys Benjamin F. Butler and Thomas Addis Emmet (1764–1827) were counsels for his defense. The jury disagreed on the first trial and convicted Barker on the second trial; but an appeal was granted and the indictment was finally quashed.
He removed to New Orleans in 1834, became prominent in financial circles, was admitted to the bar, and practiced with success in insurance cases. In the 1840s he collaborated with Rowland G. Hazard to secure the release of free African-Americans who were being illegally detained in Louisiana under the assumption they were escaped slaves. At the close of the American Civil War he was elected to the United States Senate, but Louisiana not having been readmitted to the Union, he was not allowed to take his seat. In 1867 he was declared bankrupt and spent the last few years of his life with his son in Philadelphia.
Barker published "The Rebellion: Its Consequences and the Congressional Committee, Denominated the Reconstruction Committee, with their Action" (1866).

Hacham Uriel Davidi Khansari (1922- December 24, 2006) was a famous Jewish (Judæo-Khunsari) religious leader and theologian, who was born in Khansar (Iran) and died in the Neve Yaakov section of Jerusalem, Israel, where he had spent the last 12 years of is life. He was descended from a long line of rabbis who preceded him in leading the Jewish community in Iran. Born to Hacham Meir Davidi, he continued the tradition of a learned scholar and after moving to Tehran, became a more prominent community leader in his own right. In the late 1970s, Davidi, along with the late chief rabbi, Hacham Yedidia Shofet, made annual visits to the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as representatives of the Jewish community. In 1979, shortly after the Islamic revolution, Davidi and Shofet, along with a few other members of the Jewish community of Tehran, met with the new leadership of the Islamic Republic in order to preserve the rights of the Jewish community. Among Persian Jews, he has been known as "Hacham Uriel". 
Hacham Uriel Davidi served as the chief rabbi of Iran after Hacham Shofet left, from 1980 to 1994. He gave weekly religious lectures on Saturday afternoons in Tehran's Darvaz-e Dolat Synagogue during this time. He also performed wedding ceremonies and functioned as a 'mohel'. 
On January 17, 1994, he moved to Jerusalem, Israel.
One of his sons is Rabbi Nissim Davidi, the Kashrut Administrator of the Rabbinical Council of California in Los Angeles, California. He is also a certified mohel as his father and paternal grandfather were before him.

Post-game show

A post-game show or postgame show is a TV or radio presentation that occurs immediately after the live broadcast of a major sporting event.
Contents may include:
Postgame shows are generally shorter and less structured than pre-game shows, especially for national broadcasts. In many cases, especially in prime time matchups, there may be virtually no post-game show at all. This is partially due to the unpredictability of the length of a typical sporting event, which can vary in length by a considerable amount depending on clock stoppages and overtime. The post-game show is expected to fill the gap between the end of the game and the start of regularly scheduled programming.

In September 2012, Pataky won €310,000 in Spain's supreme court against publishing group Ediciones Zeta. In March 2007, "Interviu" magazine, owned by the Zeta, published topless photos of Pataky that had been taken with a long lens while Pataky was changing clothes during a topless photoshoot (with her hands covering her breasts) for "Elle" magazine. The Zeta group said it would appeal the decision.

Mike Bassett

Michael "Mike" Bassett is a fictional character played by Ricky Tomlinson. Bassett's first appearance was in the 2001 film . The film takes the form of a fly-on-the-wall fictional documentary (mockumentary) following Bassett as he starts his international management career.
Bassett also appeared in a 2004 ITV British TV comedy series titled .
In 2014, it was announced that Bassett would return in a sequel to titled "Mike Bassett: Interim Manager".
Playing career.
As a footballer he played for 14 different clubs in 9 different positions including Goalkeeper.
Managerial career.
Colchester United.
Bassett got his big break after being offered the Assistant Manager job at Colchester United before becoming the permanent Manager along side Lonnie Urquart (Assistant Manager) and Dave Dodds (Coach).
Norwich City.
Bassett spent three years at Norwich winning the 'MrClutch Cup', beating Leicester City 3-2, before being offered the England job for the 2002 World Cup in Brazil.
England.
Following the unexpected heart attack of the England manager the search was on for his replacement before the 2002 World Cup in Brazil. After an initial search most people who seem qualified for the position have the good sense to turn it down, and so the responsibility fell to Bassett. After stunning losses to Poland and Belgium, Bassett went from a fan favourite to one of the most hated men in England. Despite Bassett's ineptitude, England managed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup tournament on goal difference thanks to group opponents Turkey losing their final game.
Bassett suddenly goes from villain to hero overnight, and the following year England head to Brazil with a new found optimism. The optimism around England's campaign soon evaporated after a 0-0 draw with Egypt, in which England failed to even so much as make a shot on goal. Needing a result against Mexico, Bassett opted to change to an unusual new formation which proves to be ineffective as England go on to lose 4-0. Bassett's last opportunity at saving his job was by beating Argentina - despite the fact that Argentina had drawn one and won one game and had a far better goal difference, England could still beat them into the knock-out stages, since World Cup group placings are decided on head-to-head results and not goal difference.
Nearing full time and with the score still 0-0, Bassett decided to give the dice a last throw and send on striker Kevin Tonkinson. He immediately scores a very controversial goal. This sends England through to the knockout stages, where they overcame France before exiting at the hands of Brazil in the semi finals. After an eventful but successful World Cup campaign Bassett vowed to stay on as England manager for "Four more years!".
Following on from , Bassett then appeared in Series.
After an unsuccessful European qualifying campaign, Bassett is axed by England.
Newcastle, Norwich & Colchester.
Following the England sacking Bassett went on to be sacked by Newcastle, Norwich and Colchester in quick succession before getting the call to manage his boyhood club, Wirral County.
Wirral County.
After a terrible start to the league campaign Wirral County and Bassett find them selves in a relation battle. Wirral's last game of the season was against local rivals Chester City, who needed a win in order to secure a play-off spot. Chester beat Wirral by 2-0 but fortunately Mansfield lost 6-1, allowing Wirral to survive on goal difference. At the end of Bassett leaves the club in Dave Dodds hands and sets off to Spain with Karine.
In 2014, Bassett's return was announced with the sequel film to titled "Mike Bassett: Interim Manager".
Iranian Women’s Football Team.
Ten years after steering England to the semi-final at the World Cup, Bassett’s returned to the international fold as Head Coach of the Iranian Women’s Football Team. "Unfortunately for Bassett, he unwittingly offends the locals and finds himself doing an Argo-style runner to Ayatollah Khomeini Airport, with a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand and a fatwa on Harry Redknapp’s head".
England Interim Manager.
Jorgen Mannstein, England team manager and German wunderkind, offers Bassett the assistant manager’s Job, working as an intermediary between the entirely German back-room staff and the English players. Bassett then gets a lucky break when Mannstein jumps ship to manage the Germany national football team, plunging the England set-up into turmoil. Bassett finds himself anointed Interim Manager to take the team through the 2014 World Cup finals.
Personal life.
Bassett is married to wife Karine and they have a son called Jason who left Loughborough University for drama school.

<doc id="5895924" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895924" title="Decorative box">
Decorative box

A Decorative box is a form of packaging that is generally more than just functional, but also intended to be decorative and artistic. Many such boxes are used for promotional packaging, both commercially and privately. Historical objects are usually called caskets if larger than a few inches in more than one dimension, with only smaller ones called boxes.
Gift box.
Traditionally gift boxes used for promotional and seasonal gifts are made from sturdy paperboard or corrugated fiberboard. These boxes normally consist of a base and detachable lid and are made by using a die cutting process to cut the board. The box is then covered with decorative paper. Gift boxes can be dressed with other gift packaging material, such as decorative ribbons and gift tissue paper.
Work box.
The most common type of decorative box is the feminine work box. It is usually fitted with a tray divided into many small compartments for needles, reels of silk and cotton, and other necessaries for stitchery. The date of its origin is unclear, but 17th-century examples exist, covered with silk and adorned with beads and embroidery.
No lady would have been without her work box in the 18th century. In the second half of that century, elaborate pains were taken to make these boxes dainty and elegant.
Work boxes are ordinarily portable, but at times they form the top of a stationary table.
A jewelry box, also known as a casket, is a receptacle for trinkets, not only jewels. It may take a very modest form, covered in leather and lined with satin, or it may reach the monumental proportions of the jewel cabinets which were made for Marie Antoinette, one of which is at Windsor Castle, and another at the Palace of Versailles; the work of Schwerdfeger as cabinetmaker, Degault as miniature-painter, and Thomire as chaser.
Snuff box.
Snuff boxes are made in two sizes, ones for the pocket and communal boxes made for table use. Pocket boxes are usually made to hold a few grammes of snuff for immediate consumption. The best have well fitting lids that ensure unwanted air does not penetrate the box, although wholly air-tight boxes are a rarity. The principle role of a pocket box is to keep a day or two's supply of snuff in good condition with the bulk being kept in an airtight container. Table boxes are still to be found in the mess of certain old regiments - often in the traditional 'ram's head' style - and a communal snuff box is still kept in the House of Lords in the UK parliament.[[Image:Copper snuffbox.jpg|thumb|Coffin-shaped snuff box made from sheet copper, raised, tinned inside and engraved. It is English and is dated 1792. Victoria and Albert Museum, London
One of the more functional types of decorative boxes is the snuff box. Snuff boxes are made in pocket sizes - holding a few grammes for immediate consumption - and as larger, table boxes. Whilst snuff does not enjoy the popularity it once did, it is gradually re-gaining popularity due to the demonisation of smoking and snuff boxes are still made in surprising numbers. Since prolonged exposure to air causes snuff to dry out and lose its quality, pocket snuff boxes are designed to be nearly airtight containers with strong hinges, generally with enough space for a days' worth of snuff only.]]
People of all social classes used these boxes when snuff was at its peak of popularity and the wealthy carried a variety of fancy snuff-boxes created by craftsmen in metal-work, jewellers and enamellers. Some of these were rich in detail and made from precious or expensive materials such as gold, silver and ivory and were often adorned with artwork, gems and precious stones. Boxes made for the poorer snuff takers were more ordinary; popular and cheap boxes were made in papier-mâché and even potato-pulp, which made durable boxes that kept the snuff in good condition. Alloys that resembled gold or silver were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries such as the "ersatz" gold Pinchbeck and the silver look-alike, Sheffield Plate.
Other popular materials used in making these boxes include:
The lids were often adorned with a portrait, a classical vignette, portrait miniature, hardstone inlays, or micromosaic panel. Some of the most expensive just used subtly different colours of gold. Perhaps the most widely used semi-precious metal was silver and snuffs of all shapes and sizes were made in that metal during snuff's great popularity.
Even after snuff-taking ceased to be a general habit, the practice lingered among diplomats, doctors, lawyers and other professionals as well as members of professions where smoking was not possible, such as miners and print workers. Monarchs retained the habit of bestowing snuff-boxes upon ambassadors and other intermediaries as a form of honor. As Talleyrand explained, the diplomatic corps found a ceremonious pinch to be a useful aid to reflection in a business interview. At the coronation of George IV of England, Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, the court jewellers, were paid £8,205 for snuff-boxes for gifts to foreign representatives.
Today snuffboxes are collected at many levels – the high-end of the market being reserved for gold boxes that have been jewelled or have original art work on them, or boxes with provenance linking them to world figures, such as Napoleon or Lord Nelson. Some of the most expensive are French and German 18th century examples, and the record auction price for a German box is £789,250 (about US$1.3 million), bid in 2003 at Christie's in London.
Modern snuff boxes are made from a variety of woods, pewter and even plastic and are manufactured in surprising numbers due, largely, to snuff's resurgence amongst tobacco connoisseurs and smokers. This has been driven by online special interest sites such as Snuffhouse.org and a new generation of retailers. New silver snuff boxes are still marketed by the companies Ari. D. Norman and Regnas.
Strong box.
A strong-box is a receptacle for money, deeds and securities. Its place has been taken in modern life by the safe. Some have extremely elaborate locks, such as Sir Thomas Bodley's strong-box in the Bodleian library, which has a locking mechanism in the under-side of the lid.
Knife box.
In the Middle Ages people usually brought their own cutlery with them when eating away from home, and the more expensive types came with their own custom-made leather cases, stamped and embossed in various designs. Later, as cutlery became provided by the host, decorative cases, especially for the knives, were often left on display in the dining-room.Some of the most elegant and often ornate were in the styles of Robert Adam, George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. Occasionally flat-topped containers, they were most frequently either rod-shaped, or tall and narrow with a sloping top necessitated by a series of raised veins for exhibiting the handles of knives and the bowls of spoons. Mahogany and satinwoods were most common, occasionally inlaid with marquetry, or edged with boxwood which was resistant to chipping. These receptacles, often made in pairs, still exist in large numbers; they are often converted into stationery cabinets. Another version is an open tray or rack, usually with a handle, also for the storage of table cutlery.
Bible box.
A Bible box is a box made to hold a Bible. These boxes started being manufactured in the 17th century.
Étui.
An (from the French, for keeper or holder) is a woman's ornamental case, usually carried in a pocket or purse. It holds small tools for daily use such as folding scissors, bodkins, sewing needles, hairpins, tweezers, makeup pencils, etc. Some étuis were also used to carry doctors' lancets. These boxes were made of different materials such as wood, leather, ivory, silver, gold, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, and shagreen. Faberge created the Necessaire Egg as an étui.
Wooden wine box.
Wooden wine boxes, also known as wooden wine crates, are used to ship and store expensive wines in transit and cellarage. Most wineries that use wooden boxes burn their logo and designs on the front panel. Originally intended as purely practical items, these panels or the whole box are often used by bars or wine collectors as decorative pieces for their bars or wine cellars. A typical wooden wine box holds either six or twelve 750 ml bottles.

Morris Kight

Morris Kight (born November 19, 1919, Comanche County, Texasdied January 19, 2003, Los Angeles, California) was a gay rights pioneer and peace activist, based in Los Angeles. He is considered one of the original founders of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement in the United States.
Biography.
Early life.
Kight was born and grew up in Comanche County, Texas. He graduated from Texas Christian University and graduated in 1941 with a degree in personnel administration and public administration.
From 1941 until 1958, Kight lived in northern New Mexico, where he and many other gay people were active in Adlai Stevenson's campaign in the 1952 presidential election. The presence of many gay people in Stevenson's campaign led to the spreading of a rumor that Stevenson was gay.
While in New Mexico, Kight married and had two daughters, Carol Kight-Fyfe and Angela Chandler. He only shared that information with his closest friends, apparently believing that would diminish his credibility as a spokesman for gay rights.
Kight also acted while he was in Albuquerque. From 1950 to 1955, he was involved in the "Summerhouse Theater" and the "Old Town Players" in Albuquerque. The two companies brought in many actors from California, and Kight was able to read some of the new "Homophile" organizations' pamphlets and circulations that these actors brought with them. This was his first exposure to groups like the Mattachine Society, which he considered elitist.
Labor and civil rights activities.
Kight was active in many political, civil rights, and labor rights groups. As early as the 1940s, he was involved in organizing the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union. After moving to Los Angeles, he kept up his involvement in varied rights groups. This work led to the first protest groups he himself founded: the "Dow Action Committee" in 1967. The Committee protested the chemical company, including its production of Agent Orange and its use, during the Vietnam War.
Kight's strong beliefs sometimes put him at odds with members of the gay community. In 1977, Kight began what became a national Coors boycott to expose how the Coors Brewing Company used its millions to finance union busting legislation and anti-gay politicians. Morris infuriated organizers of Outfest the year the festival accepted Coors funding. He organized a demonstration in front of the event, using the opportunity to educate the community about the ways anti-gay corporations try to clean up their public image by funding cash-starved gay organizations and events.
Morris persevered and Outfest no longer accepts Coors funding.
Gay rights activities.
In 1958, Kight moved to Los Angeles, where he was the founder or co-founder of many gay and lesbian organizations. The first such organization was the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) in October 1969, the third GLF in the country (after New York and Berkeley). The name was used to show solidarity with the Vietnamese National Liberation Front. By the next year, there were over 350 GLF organizations around the country.
He also co-founded Christopher Street West gay pride parade in Los Angeles in 1970, Aid For AIDS in 1983, and the Gay Community Center in 1971, (now the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center), the Stonewall Democratic Club in 1975, and many others. Kight remarked that creating the Community Center was the achievement of which he was most proud.
Kight brought his experiences in political action into the realm of gay rights. One of the first actions by the LA GLF was against a local eatery called Barney's Beanery. The restaurant, located in West Hollywood, not only had a sign above bar that said “Fagots Stay Out”, but also printed up matchbook covers with the same saying. Kight, along with Troy Perry and 100 activists protested outside, sending in protesters occasionally to order coffee and take up space at the tables. The protest was initially successful - the owner eventually handed Kight the sign in front of news cameras. But after the media left the owner replaced the sign, where it remained until West Hollywood's first lesbian mayor, Valerie Terrigno, took it down when the city council passed an anti-discrimination ordinance. Perry vowed at the initial protest to never set foot in the place again until the owner apologized, which finally happened in 2005. The new owner, David Houston, has apologized and, among other methods to reach out to the gay community, holds monthly lunches for disadvantaged gay youth.
He served on the County of Los Angeles Human Relations Commission for two decades.
In 2003 the City of Los Angeles dedicated the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and McCadden Place, in Hollywood, California as "Morris Kight Square." This location was selected as it was the stepping off point for Christopher Street West, the very first street-closing gay pride parade in the world.
Twilight Years.
Toward the end of his life, Kight had several strokes that slowed him down.
There is a Chinese magnolia tree and a bronze plaque dedicated to him at the Matthew Shepard Triangle in West Hollywood. Morris Kight used to visit this park weekly to tidy up the area, water and plant new flowers. He encouraged others to do the same.
On November 16, 1998, just before his 79th birthday, the City Council of West Hollywood presented him a Lifetime Achievement Award
In September 2001, he made a video documentary with West Hollywood Public Access host James Fuhrman called “Early Gay and Lesbian History in Los Angeles”, which included his recollections of the Beanery protest and other actions.
He had a longtime companion named Roy Zucheran.
Three days before his death, he donated his memorabilia and archives to the National Gay and Lesbian Archives in Los Angeles. UCLA also has possession of some of his archives.
He died peacefully at the Carl Bean Hospice in Los Angeles, on January 19, 2003.

Devil's Got Your Gold

"Devil's Got Your Gold" is the debut album by Frank. Released 7 August 2006. A week after the release of their debut single "I'm Not Shy". It features, amongst others, tracks featured in Frank's show "Totally Frank" on Channel 4's T4.
The album was recorded in Los Angeles in 2005. Seven of the tracks are co-written by Frank, alongside Brian Higgins and Xenomania, who also produced it. Tracks one and five were also covers of Xenomania's "vanity act" Mania.
The album was released in Summer 2006, reaching a disappointing #110 on the UK Charts. The album sold less than 900 copies in the UK due to poor promotion by label Polydor, and because of that and the disappointing chart result of the single, the album hasn't been released in Ireland. This band have since announced that they have been dropped from their record label and have split up.

Mike Quigley (politician)

Michael "Mike" Quigley (born October 17, 1958) is the U.S. Representative for , serving since the April 7, 2009 special election. The district includes most of Chicago's North Side, as well as several of the city's western suburbs. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Quigley is a former member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, where he represented Chicago's northside neighborhoods of Lakeview, Uptown and Rogers Park. He also teaches environmental policy and Chicago politics at Loyola University Chicago.
Early life, education, and early political career.
Quigley was raised in Carol Stream, Illinois where he graduated from Glenbard North High School in 1977. He then attended Roosevelt University where he earned his bachelor's degree. Quigley moved into the Lakeview area of Chicago in 1982 and became involved in community activities. He attended the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where he earned a juris doctor, and the University of Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in public policy. 
Quigley was first elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1998. During his tenure he has gained a reputation as a reformer as he opposed tax hikes supported by Cook County Board President John Stroger, and later his son and successor Todd Stroger. He contended the county could operate more efficiently and he presented reports to support the position. Quigley also challenged the practice of finding jobs for Democratic officials with the Cook County Forest Preserve District.
Quigley and his wife Barbara have two daughters, Alyson and Meghan.
U.S. House of Representatives.
Elections.
In early 2009, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman Rahm Emanuel of decided to resign in order to become the White House Chief of Staff to newly elected President Barack Obama. The vacancy lead to the special election to succeed him. Quigley was one of twelve candidates to file for the special Democratic primary. Mike was endorsed by the "Chicago Sun-Times", which called him "a constant advocate for fiscal responsibility and a watchdog against waste and corruption". He was also endorsed by the "Chicago Tribune", which cited Quigley's efforts to improve county government, noting "If Quigley's ideas had all been put in place, the county would not be crying now for more money". He won the March special primary with 22% of the vote. The candidate who ranked second, State Representative John Fritchey received 18% of the vote, four points short. After that, Quigley won the April special election with 69% of the vote.
Quigley won re-election to his first full term in 2010 with 71% of the vote.
After redistricting, his district was placed with fellow U.S. Congressperson Republican Judy Biggert and became slightly less safe. However, Biggert decided not to run for re-election in the 5th, as the district is still safely Democratic as Obama won the district with 70% (down three points from the current 5th) and 2010 Democratic U.S. Senator nominee Alexi Giannoulias won carried the 5th with 55% of the vote. No Democrat has filed to run against him. Only one Republican filed, self-employed businessman Dan Schmitt.
Tenure.
In May 2011, Quigley sponsored an amendment to the Patriot Act prohibiting the sale of weapons to those on the FBI’s Terrorist Watch List. Quigley believed that the Republican limitation of civil liberties under the Patriot Act contradicted their unwillingness to limit Second Amendment rights. This bill, proposed as an amendment to the Patriot Act, came under fire from House Republicans Reps. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin and Louie Gohmert of Texas who argued that this would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those mistakenly placed on the Terrorist Watch List. However, in a vote dictated by political party, the bill lost 21–11 with the House Judiciary panel.
Quigley has received a rating of 100 (on a scale of 1 to 100) from the American Public Health Association, indicating his strong support of healthcare legislation. In April 2011, Quigley voted against Paul Ryan’s budget plan (which involved budget cuts to Medicare as well as decreased government funding to help citizens procure health insurance). Also in April 2011, Quigley voted against repealing the “Prevention and Public Health” fund, a fund focused on Community and Clinical Prevention of chronic diseases, as well as allotting money towards healthcare infrastructure and research. Quigley also voted for increases in government spending on physical and occupational therapy.
A Sierra Club member since high school, Quigley initially joined politics because of his desire to help the environment through legislation. Quigley has enacted this desire through supporting the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a 2009 bill to create an emissions trading plan which passed in the House of Representatives but was defeated in the Senate. Quigley also introduced the Federal Birdsafe Buildings Bill, a 2011 initiative to make all buildings built by the General Services Administration built with the maximum amount of bird-safe materials and features. In April 2011, Quigley voted to prohibit invasive research on great apes.
Quigley is a supporter of veterans' benefits and has worked to improve healthcare and education opportunities for them. His district office is also known to make services available to veterans whenever they should need it, such as helping one veteran receive medals that he had been waiting for over twenty years to receive. In 2013 Quigley introduced a bill to the House to prevent Veterans from entering into debt to pay for tuition before GI benefits are received. He hopes to provide even greater educational opportunities to veterans with this bill.
Quigley supports abortion on demand, and voted against banning federal health coverage for abortions. Quigley also supports federal funding for family planning and education, as well as creating more preventative steps to avoid unwanted pregnancies altogether.
Quigley is a supporter of LGBT rights and showed his support in 2012 by participating in National Coming Out Day as a show of solidarity. He has called for the FDA to revoke its ban on allowing blood donations from gays.

Hertfordshire bus route 84

Hertfordshire bus route 84 is a commercial bus service, operated by Metroline, in London and Hertfordshire, England.
The route runs between New Barnet in North London and St Albans in Hertfordshire. Transport for London Bus Passes, Travelcards and Oyster Pay as you Go are no longer accepted on any part of the route.
History.
The route began operation on 3 August 1912 between Golders Green and St Albans, and was operated by the London General Omnibus Company as a feeder service to the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway which at that time terminated at Golders Green.
Potters Bar Bus Garage was operated by Central Buses. The 84 used to reach further into London: in 1936 it ran from St Albans to Golders Green, albeit omitting Potters Bar itself by running via New Road. Meanwhile, new trolleybus route 645 started in August 1936, running between Edgware and North Finchley via Cricklewood, and in June 1938 was extended to Barnet, thus duplicating the 84 over this section. A wartime economy took place from May 1940, with the 84 withdrawn south of Whetstone, being diverted to Arnos Grove instead. Some weekend journeys on the route ran to Walthamstow.
The route was cut back to New Barnet in the 1960s. Buses were also diverted to operate through Potters Bar, and the route now provides the main service between there and Barnet. The route is not a Transport for London contract, but enters Greater London for a short section.
School Route 84X was introduced in September 2006, providing extra double-deck journeys between New Greens and New Barnet Station (running non stop between South Mimms and Barnet). This service was withdrawn on 9 June 2008, and replaced by an additional journey on route 84 to St Albans Girls School.
In 2007 the double-deck step entrance Volvo Olympians were replaced by single-deck Dennis Dart SLFs to allow the route to become low floor, and given up to 2008 to allow sufficient time to convert to low-floor. In June 2008 the Dennis Dart SLF / Plaxton Pointers were replaced by brand new single door 10.8m long Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Darts. The Volvo Olympians were withdrawn, thus this is the last bus route in London to be converted to wheelchair-accessible. These were unusual to London in having LED destination displays. The Sunday afternoon service was increased to every 45 minutes from 8 June 2008.
On 2 January 2012, the route no longer accepts Transport for London tickets, including bus passes, Oyster Pay as you Go users and Travelcard holders. Holders can however obtain a discounted cash fare (£1.35 as of Jan 2012) on production of such tickets.

Digital Life

Digital Life is a research and educational program about radically rethinking of the human-computer interactive experience. It integrates digital world (information & services) and physical world (physical objects/environment). It makes interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects & environments monitor user and (proactively) present information & services relevant to user’s current needs/interests)
The program is to use information technology to augment physical environments and objects around the people that can draw attention. When one is walking around town, for example, the system points out buildings/places of particular interest to a user. The program is also to augment reality in order to provide a composite view for the participants: a mix of a real scene with the virtual scene that augments the digital environment with interactive information.
The Program was originally initiated by MIT Media Lab as: Digital Life is a multi-sponsor, Lab-wide research consortium that conducts basic research on technologies and techniques that spur expression as well as social and economic activity. They first explore the design and scalability of agile, grassroots communications systems that incorporate a growing understanding of emergent social behaviors in a digital world; the second considers a cognitive architecture that can support many features of “human intelligent thinking” and its expressive and economic use; and the third extends the idea of inclusive design to immersive, affective, and biological interfaces and actions.

Yamaha FZR1000

The Yamaha FZR1000 is a motorcycle produced by Yamaha from 1987 to 1995. The 1989 version, crowned the ""Bike of the Decade"" by "Cycle World", had 0-60 acceleration of 2.9 seconds, and a top speed of over 167 mph. 
The unique feature that gave the 1989 and onward models their Exup name (for Exhaust Ultimate Power Valve) was Yamaha's four-stroke power valve system, a servo motor-driven exhaust valve. This allowed large bore exhaust header pipes (for excellent gas flow at high engine speeds) coupled with the valve restricting flow at lower revs, to speed the gas through. It gave pulling power from low revs, seamlessly, up to the red line at 11,500 rpm. It also allowed extremely radical high lift cams that gave a very lumpy idle when unplugged in the open position or when using a full aftermarket exhaust. Yamaha used this valve system on the YZF models which followed (Thunderace) and the R1 models from 1998.
History.
In some countries old stock was carried on to sell in later years, notably 1996 models which are identical to 1995.
End of line.
The FZR1000 quickly went out of production following the 1994 introduction and sales success of the Supersport series, led by 1992's introduction of the Tadao Baba developed Honda Fireblade. 
It was not until the 1998 development of the Yamaha YZF-R1 that Yamaha again caught up.

Individual Address Block

The Individual Address Block (IAB) is a block of identifiers that is formed by concatenating a 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) that is owned "by the IEEE Registration Authority" with an additional 12-bit extension identifier that is assigned "by the IEEE Registration Authority" and then reserving an additional 12 bits for use by the assignee. The resulting 48-bit identifier uniquely identifies the assignee of the IAB and provides 4096 unique numbers for use by the organization that purchased the IAB. The assignee may create unique identifiers by concatenating a 12-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchases the IAB in the bit positions occupied by the 12 additional bits mentioned previously. The purpose of the IAB is to allow organizations to purchase smaller blocks of identifiers at a reduced price.

Drusillas Park is a small zoo near to Alfriston, in East Sussex, UK. Its exhibits are targeted towards children between 2 and 10 years old. It is owned by Laurence and Christine Smith, who bought it from the previous proprietor in 1997. It attracts between 350,000 and 370,000 visitors per year.
The zoo is home to both wild and domestic animals, including ring-tailed lemurs, meerkats, and penguins. There are many hands-on activities, an adventure play area separated for different age groups, an indoor soft play centre, and a Thomas & Friends train that runs daily. There are also cafes, shops, and a restaurant.

Other exhibits include Pet World, Lemurland, a small farmyard, and a walk-through lorikeet aviary where you can feed nectar to the birds.
The 'Zoolympics challenge' lets children compare their abilities (to drag, hang on, jump, shout, run, and hold their breath) against a variety of animals, and record them in a booklet given free at the entrance. Children can also get 'stamp books' to stamp using tick shaped stamps found around the enclosures.
The adventure play area has swings, slides, and climbing walls, and has been separated into Go Bananas! for children under six and Go Wild! for older children. The indoor soft play centre includes a cafe selling drinks and snacks. An interactive maze, Eden's Eye, lets children discover different worlds, as helped along by a series of clues and mythical creatures.

Generation O!

Generation O! (also called "G.O!" by fans) is an animated children's television series made by the now defunct Sunbow Entertainment, a division of Sony Wonder, with co-production provided by Wang Films in Taiwan and Ravensberger in Germany. There are also international versions of the series called "Molly O!". Generation O! was originally called "Molly O!" and was created by David Hale, Tim Newman and James Proimos, based on an original idea by Hale and Newman. Executive Producers were Carole Wietzman, Martha Ripp and Ken Olshansky. The Creative Producer and Director was Mike Milo and the Line Producer was Jodey Kaminsky-Cashman. Most of the episodes were written by Suzanne Collins, author of the bestselling series The Underland Chronicles and The Hunger Games trilogy. John Hardman was the production exec at the Kids WB.
The show's visual design was based on Proimos's unique style. Every episode had at least one song and music video, which would be related to the episode's plot. For example, in one episode Molly gets mad at her brother and ends up writing a song called "Girls Rule, Boys Drool" in retaliation. Most of the songs used in the series were penned by Hale and David Buskin.
This show aired from 2000 to 2001 on YTV and The WB. Kids WB aired it as part of their "Fraturdays" block. Only 13 episodes were ever created. Like all the other shows on Kids WB as seen in the USA, the show is closed captioned by the National Captioning Institute. In Latin America the show premiered on Nickelodeon on 2001, but was removed in early 2003. In the United Kingdom the series was screened on the Disney Channel, but curiously unlisted in the schedules and after midnight.
Plot.
"Generation O!" focuses on the character of Molly O, an 8-year-old rock star and the lead singer of the band "Generation O!" along with bassist Nub, guitarist "Eddie" (Molly's cousin Edwina), drummer Yo-Yo (a kangaroo), and manager Colonel Bob. Molly also spends time with her best friend Chadd, and tries to avoid her pesky brother Buzz.

Music for "Generation O!" was performed by alternative rock band Letters to Cleo, who wrote the title theme song.

Rampur, Himachal Pradesh

Rampur Bushahr is a city and a municipal council in Shimla district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It is 130 km from Shimla well connected with National Highway which passes through Narkanda (attitude 2708m).
History.
The principality of Bashahr (also known as Bashahar, Bushahar, Bushahr) was once among the largest of the twenty-eight Shimla Hill States under the administration of the British Raj keen to invest on regional and transcontinental trade and exploit Himalayan resources. It bordered on the north with Spiti, on the east with Tibet, on the south with Garhwal, and on the west with Jubbal, Kotkhai, Kumharsain, Kotgarh, and Kulu. Caught in the machinations of the British imperial enterprise, it was subjected to political-cum-economic vicissitudes, acceding to the Indian Union in 1947. On the 8th March 1948, along with twenty other princely hill States of Punjab and Shimla, Bashahr signed an agreement which resulted in its inclusion in the Indian State of Himachal Pradesh.
Rampur, a small township situated at 1,005 meters on the left bank of the Sutlej, served as Bashahr’s winter capital. Being well connected with major trading routes that joined Indian markets with Central Asia and Tibet, it buzzed with mercantile activity, especially in November during the Lavi fair, the largest trading event in the north Himalayas attracting traders from Kashmir, Ladakh, Yarkand, and the Indian mainland. Concerning the origins of the Rampuri fair, the Census of India (1961) reports:
""About three hundred years ago during the regime of Raja Kehar Singh of Bushahr, a trade treaty was signed between the Bushahr State and Tibet…Horses from Tibet and swords from Bushahr were exchanged in token of this friendship. It was written in the treaty that their friendly relations would continue till this time…Since then, it is presumed that trade relations increased and eventually Lavi fair was held."” 
Rampur was also located along pilgrimage routes to sacred sites in western Tibet shared by Hindus, Bön and Buddhists alike, i.e., Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar. Missionary and pilgrimage activities, intensified by trading possibilities, created the conditions for Tibetan Buddhism to take a firm stronghold in these borderland regions. Twenty-two kilometres from the village of Namgya in upper Kinnaur, laid the Shipki pass which linked caravan routes to and from western Tibet. This treacherous transcontinental passage must have been in use from ancient times, for among the ruined castles reported by Francke at Shipki village, there were no living memories of the origins of mKar gog, the oldest of them built above the village in cyclopean style.Rampur also have Hydo electric projects like NJPC and Rmpur Project bye SJVNL A second castle, known as Seng ge mkhar, is said to have received its crooked ground plan “through a race round its base executed in opposite directions by a poisonous snake and a scorpion,” and was built, in all probability, during the Ladakhi occupation of mNga’ ris by orders of King Seng ge rnam rgyal (1570–1642) and called after him.It is 30 km from SAINJ.

Smile (Lily Allen song)

"Smile" is the debut single by British recording artist Lily Allen from her debut studio album "Alright, Still" (2006). It was written by Allen, Iyiola Babalola and Darren Lewis in 2004, while sampling The Soul Brothers' "Free Soul". The song was released as the lead mainstream single of the album in March 2006. After signing a contract deal with Regal Recordings and gaining popularity on the social network website Myspace with demo songs, Allen released a limited edition of "LDN" to promote her work and afterwards announced the release of "Smile".
The song incorporates rocksteady music, as the lyrics tackle her dealing with the betrayal of her boyfriend, while enjoying his misery. Most contemporary critics complimented the song, noticing the confidence it hides and the carnival-esque, yet melancholy, theme. On the other hand, some considered it was not one of the album's best tracks and it makes the singer a "theoretical pop princess". The single peaked inside the top 40 of the charts of some European countries and Australia, while staying on the summit of the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks and ended the year as the country's 11th most successful song. It is also charted on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100, where it was certified gold.
For promotion, "Smile" was re-recorded in Simlish and played on shows; it also received its own answer song. The accompanying music video portrayed a revenge theme, with Allen hiring a posse to beat her ex-boyfriend. It was directed by Sophie Muller and, afterwards, banned on MTV due to obscene language. The song was performed live many times, including on talk shows, her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour, though Allen claimed to be "sick" of it. In 2008, it won a Pop Award at the London Broadcast Music Incorporated Awards.
Background.
After meeting George Lamb on a holiday in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later introduced the singer to production duo Future Cut, with whom she had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, "The Observer Music Monthly" took interest. Few people outside of her label's A&R department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. "Smile" was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever!
"Smile" was released as a single, and the maxi single format for it contains two B-Sides, "Absolutely Nothing" and "Cheryl Tweedy", which Allen struggled to get on the album, but lost them in favour of "Take What You Take". The latter is a satirical song about celebrity, finding the commercial promotion side of the celebrity machine uncomfortable, while mentioning Girls Aloud member Cheryl Tweedy, but argued she doesn't "have anything against her".
Music structure and lyrics.
Musically, "Smile" is a bubbly, mid-tempo tune with "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, singing in a light falsetto, while the organ riff contains a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song "Free Soul" by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. She and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano were used for the background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," thus creating a contrast between "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.
Critical reception.
According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals singer's spite", while she keeps "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it by the way she sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". "Blender" reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called "Smile" an "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" and went on to say that the theme of the song is melancholy, "set against breezy beats", and while not being "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from "Rolling Stone" gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a "breezy sha-la-la lilt that just made the song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.
The reviewer from "NME" considered that the song sashays along with sass, while still remaining charming, and said that though it doesn't mark Allen out as excellent dating material, as a soundtrack to the summer, "it’s a dead fackin’ cert". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called "Smile" just as good as "LDN", "its loose reggae arrangement augmented by the clever sample of Jackie Mittoo’s piano from the Soul Brothers’ 60s rocksteady tune "Free Soul", as Allen sings bitterly about her ex, with just a hint of vulnerability at first, before going to her friends for reassurance, and confronting the guy during the chorus with a mean-spirited confidence that has us cheering inside". While John Murphy of MusicOMH praised the song and its "gently lilting reggae rhythm", Priya Elan from "NME" considered that the Althea & Donna groove of "Smile" is what made fans "fall for her in the first place". The former argued that "even people who profess to hate pop music will secretly be tapping a foot to it and claiming it is just downright perfect pop for lolling around during the lazy warm, guaranteed to cheer the listeners up, no matter how down they're feeling". Other reviews came from "The Guardian" reporter Sophie Heawood, who didn't consider the song as Allen's greatest effort, but still thought she was far better than being called "the female Mike Skinner".
In October 2011, "NME" placed it at number 104 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".
Commercial performance.
"Smile" was released to the iTunes Store in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2006 and spent its first week at number 1 on the iTunes chart, before entering the main UK Singles Chart at number thirteen, based on download sales alone. The next week, on the issue of 15 July 2006, it rose to the summit of the chart, selling 39,501 copies, knocking Shakira's Hips Don't Lie off the top spot and spending two consecutive weeks there. It later descended to number four, being replaced by McFly's Please, Please. It was her very first single in her home country's main charts, following a top 40 entry with the limited release of "LDN" the same year. It ended 2006 as UK's 11th best selling single of the year. Allen was surprised at the success of it, stating: "Of course, I never thought the record would chart - I didn't even think I'd get a record contract". She was named "one of the brightest hopes for domestic crossover rap" because of this single. The song shared similar success in Ireland, where it debuted on the issue of 6 July 2006 and peaked inside the top ten at six, holding on the chart for nine weeks. In mainland Europe, it broke the top 40 of most countries, but wasn't as successful as in the singer's home country. Notable successes were ten on the Dutch Top 40, sixteen on the French Singles Chart and 21 on the Swiss Singles Chart. Across the ocean, "Smile" reached 14 on the ARIA Charts and in New Zealand peaked inside the top ten at six.
In North America, the song only managed to peak at 49 on the main Billboard chart in the U.S. on the issue of 24 February 2007 and spent 12 weeks on the chart. On the same week, it climbed to 29 on the Hot Digital Songs and, later in May, reached 35 on the Pop Songs and 20 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks. Despite its low position, "Smile" managed to slowly sell over 500,000 copies in paid digital download and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 9 February 2009. It also peaked at 86 on the Canadian Singles Chart.
Music video.
The song's music video was released on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, similar to that of the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.
After the video was banned on MTV in the United Kingdom, Allen commented regarding this in an inverview:I got really offended when my single 'Smile' got banned after-school hours from MTV in the U.K. because it had the word fuck in it. They said, 'We don't want kids to grow up too quickly.' But then you have Paris Hilton and the Pussycat Dolls taking their clothes off and gyrating up against womanizing, asshole men, and that's acceptable. You're thinking your kids are gonna grow up quicker because they heard the word fuck than from thinking they should be shoving their tits in people's faces?
DJ Ron Slomowicz of About.com criticised the music video, saying it was "mean-spirited", it would "alienate any sort of club fan base she might discover", and that if a male "had his friends beating up his ex-girlfriend, trashing her living space, drugging her and destroying her possessions, he would be branded as violent" and would be shunned, thus questioning the singer's taste level.
Live performances and promotion.
On the day the single was released, Allen appeared on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge with DJ Jo Whiley, performing an acoustic version of "Smile", and a cover of The Kooks' song, "Naïve". At the Secret Garden Party, in September 2006, Allen made a rendition of the song and afterwards stated: "The festival was well good, particularly as Lester, my ex, who I wrote 'Smile' about, and subsequently sold his story to the papers, had a tent called 'the shit tent' positioned directly opposite the main stage. So he and his new girlfriend had no option but to watch me perform to a couple of thousand people singing 'Smile' back to me. Oh, it's the little things eh!"
"Smile" was performed live as part of the setlist of Allen's 2007 concert tour. During the 2007 South By Southwest music festival, Allen said "I'm so sick of this song, but I'll play it for you, Austin" before singing it. On 3 February 2007, the singer was invited as a musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" and played this single and "LDN". In 2009, it was on the setlist of Allen's 2009 concert tour, as part of the encore.
In popular culture.
Covers.
"Smile" received its own answer song when rapper Example recorded a track called "Vile" in 2006, from "We Didn't Invent the Remix", with tongue-in-cheek lyrics written from the boyfriend's perspective. While it also features elements from Keith Allen's single "Vindaloo", Example added "I think Lily has heard the track. I gave it to her producer to play to her. We just did it for a laugh. Hip-hop artists take life too seriously." Upon hearing the reply single, Chris Moyles, from BBC Radio 1, recorded his own parody version of the song for "The Chris Moyles Show".
Allen herself re-recorded the single in Simlish, the fictional language used in "The Sims" games, to help promotion. The Simlish version was used in the "Sims" expansion pack "" soundtrack, and Allen also had her own character in the game. She declared: "Recording 'Smile' was a great experience for me. Sometimes revenge can be fun. But getting to sing it again Simlish came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of "The Sims" games are a perfect fit for the song. I was laughing the entire time!" Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.
Media.
"Smile" appears on another video game soundtrack, that of , which is a theme park simulation. Among other citations, the song is present in the film "He's Just Not That Into You" and featured on the 2007 Judd Apatow's film "Knocked Up" and on the soundtrack. In 2009, the season one episode "Mattress" of the Fox musical comedy/drama "Glee", "Smile" was covered by the character Rachel, voiced by Lea Michele; the version was made available as an iTunes single download and was later included on the second volume of the .

Genocide Superstars

Genocide Superstars (often referred to as or shortened to Genocide SS) was a Swedish hardcore punk, rock n' roll band. The band was formed in 1994 in Örebro, Sweden. The lyrics, themes and surrounding artwork (usually presented in a very post-modernistic, "cartoonish" way) tended to revolve around an overkill of "macho" subjects such as violence, totalitarianism, alcohol use, women and motorcycles. Despite the name, the band had nothing to do with national socialism, and never approved of such opinions. As the members were veteran parts of the 90's crust/hardcore movement in Sweden, chance is the opposite is true; rather than having right-wing sympathies, they were strongly against it.
Guitarist/vocalist Mieszko Talarczyk was one of the victims of the 2004 tsunami, and the band announced on their Myspace page that they had disbanded, as had Talarczyk's other band, Nasum. There is to date no plans whatsoever for the rest of the band to play and record together again, at least not under the name Genocide SS.

<doc id="5896189" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5896189" title="Aircraft seat map">
Aircraft seat map

An aircraft seat map or seating chart, is a diagram of the seat layout inside a passenger aircraft. They are often published by airlines for informational purposes, and are of use to passengers for selection of their seat at booking or check-in.
Seat maps usually indicate the basic seating layout, the numbering and lettering of the seats, the location of the emergency exits, lavatories, galleys, bulkheads and wings. Airlines which allow internet check-in frequently present a seat map indicating free and occupied seats to the passenger so that they select their seat from it.
In addition to the published seat maps from airliners, there are a number of independent websites which also publish seat maps along with reviews of individual seats, noting the particularly good (extra legroom, quiet cabin, etc.) or bad (lack of recline, unusually cramped, missing window, etc.) seats.
Seat maps published by airlines.
Most of the airlines publish the seat configurations for their aircraft, but the quality of these seat maps is sometimes questionable. Some of the details and information about seats are confusing. Usually airlines do not publish seat maps for every aircraft, only for the larger aircraft and for the ones flying on frequent routes.
When passengers complete an online booking, or check in online, they are often also presented with an aircraft seat map, however this data is sourced from the original text-only seat maps on computer reservation systems such as Sabre where the seatmap is simply held as a two-dimensional array and as such can only display a grid of seats, as opposed to the more ingenious layouts now used in First and Business Class.
Nichols et al. (2013) have reported that when people book seats on-line, they exhibit a leftward preference for seats on an aircraft, but a rightward preference for seats at the theatre.
Seat maps published by specialized websites.
In addition to those published seat maps which can be found on airline websites, there are some other websites that publish aircraft seat maps for almost all commercial carriers. Seat maps that can be found on these sites usually have more details and on some websites you can find comments from other passengers with advantages and disadvantages about each seat.
The accuracy and editorial independence of specialised websites showing seat maps have also been questioned. Seatguru has come under scrutiny since it was sold to the online booking agent Expedia for $1.2m, and Expedia now use the seatguru information when selling seats. As a result, seatguru has received some criticism for presenting seat maps which are inaccurate and where no one from the company has travelled on the aircraft; for example showing bars on aircraft where there are none (on the Singapore A380) or seat rows that don’t exist (on the Emirates A380).
The latest generation of user-generated airline seatmaps include comments from frequent flyers, and one specialised website has gained access from airlines to take pictures of every seat, and sit in them to write specific recommendations, alongside the detailed seat maps.
Seat designation.
On many aircraft, the rightmost seats have letter designations HJK, skipping the letter I. This is because each seat has a row number followed by letter. Letters that confuse with numbers must be avoided. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was the first to implement this, avoiding I (1), O (0) and S (5). The remaining letters are called the DEC alphabet.
Occasionally, aircraft with a seating structure of 2+2 may letter the seats as "ACDF" to keep with the standard of A/F being window and C/D being aisle on short-haul aircraft (which generally have 3+3 seats).
In First and Business class cabins, the seat letters for the window seats will typically be the same as in coach, with some letters skipped in between as there are fewer seats per row. For example, if economy cabin is ten across, labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK, the Business Class cabin might be labeled AC-DG-HK for a six across layout, with A-DG-K for a four across First Class. One notable exception to this is Delta Air Lines, who uses sequential letters regardless of cabin layout on all aircraft (AB-CD-EF in Business Class and ABC-DEF-GHJ in Economy).
Some airlines omit the row number 13. For example Lufthansa, (as shown e.g. on the Lufthansa A321/100 seating plan) reputedly because of a widespread superstition that the number 13 is unlucky. Emirates used to have a row 13, but on their latest A380 aircraft have removed it (as shown on Emirates A380-800 seating plan). British Airways are less superstitious, and their seat maps for A320 aircraft shows a row 13.

Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose

Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose (CDM) is located on Woz Way in downtown San Jose, California. Woz Way is named after Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer, whose nickname is "Woz," and who was the single largest private donor during the original capital campaign that funded the Museum.
Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose has been ranked by Child Magazine as one of the top 10 children’s museums in the U.S. and ranked by the London Observer as one of the top 5 science centers in the world.
The Museum opened its doors in 1990, and over 6 million visitors have attended. The Museum builds and displays interactive exhibits that they believe respond to children's diverse educational needs. The purple building was designed by Mexico City-based architect Ricardo Legorreta.
The Museum’s signature programs such as BioSITE and Discovery Youth encompass the broad themes of community, connections and creativity. These programs are intended to provide facilitated, focused, and sustained learning. The Museum’s goal is to create interactive exhibits that invite self-directed, open-ended explorations.
In a redevelopment plan released in November 2008, the city of San José has stated its intentions to put forth five million dollars in funds, which will allow the museum to expand by 2013. Plans are to add a new baby mammoth exhibit.
Discovery Youth.
Discovery Youth is a fun program where youth from grades 5 to 12 have fun learning and helping in the museum. They do many projects in computers with programs like Photoshop, Premiere Elements, Flash Creator and many more donated by the Adobe company. They make fun little arts and crafts in the museum on Saturday from 10am to 1pm for the museum visitors. They even have their own website: [http://www.getchy.com]
Summer Of Service (SOS).
The Summer of service program is a fun summer program where kids entering 7th to 10th grade help out the community. They do a lot of work at many service sites like Sacred Heart Community Center, Resource Area For Teaching (RAFT), Second Harvest Food Bank, and many more. The program opened its doors on the summer of 1997 and it was led by Lisa Ellsworth, Jessica Intrator, Brian Hames, Ryan Smith, Jennifer Gamurot, and David Chau. This program is split into five teams; all of which have their specialty. 
BioSITE.
BioSITE was launched by the Museum in 1993 as a unique 
"action-science" education program. Currently the program engages 1,500 students each school year in the importance of environmental responsibility and inspires the love of science through authentic field research conducted biweekly in the Guadalupe Watershed. This program is intended to take science learning out of the classroom and moves it into the real world. The students are given the experiences of biologists, conducting research along the river. Their research is monitored at the Coyote Creek Ranger Station.

St Mungo's Academy is a Roman Catholic, co-educational, comprehensive, secondary school located in Bridgeton, Glasgow. The school was founded in 1858 by the Marist Brothers religious order. The school has a reputation for academic achievement and sporting excellence, particularly in football.
History.
The Founding.
St. Mungo’s Academy was founded by the Marist Brothers in 1858 at 96 Garngad Hill, Glasgow to educate poor Catholic boys, largely the sons of immigrants from Ireland. The school was named after the patron saint of Glasgow, Saint Mungo, and had ambitions to create a Catholic professional class by educating the boys to secondary level and prepare them for university studies. In this it had a good level of success, as well as providing a steady stream of boys wishing to pursue a career in the priesthood or other religious orders.
Marist Brothers played a large role in shaping the educational and social life of the Catholic residents of Glasgow in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to founding St.Mungo’s Academy they were active in the running and staffing of the primary schools of St. Mungo’s, St. Alphonsus’, St Patrick’s, St Mary’s and the Sacred Heart as well as the Junior Secondary schools of St. Mark’s and St. Mary’s. A Marist Brother, Brother Walfrid, also founded Celtic F.C. in 1888.
1860-1949.
After only two and half years the school moved to St. Mungo Street, Townhead, and in 1883 overcrowding led the school to move again, this time to Parson Street also in Townhead where it remained until 1973. In the wake of the Education Act of 1918 the demand for admission to the school surged. In 1919 the school was absorbed into the state system, while retaining its Roman Catholic character under the running of the Marist Brothers. 
The school roll increased from 350 to 580 and within 10 years stood at 1,147. With access to the school opening up, more lay teachers were recruited. These included the brothers Colm and Willie Brogan. Until the 1930s many boys who attended the school came from beyond Glasgow. Pupils travelled daily from Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Stirlingshire, Ayrshire and Dunbartonshire due to the lack of Catholic secondary schools in these parts.
During these years the school population also reflected a migration into the city from the Highlands, Italy and after the Second World War, Poland. During this period former pupils began to return to the school to teach. 
In 1923 the school motto 'Nil sine labore' was included in the new badge. The motto came from two lines in one of Horace’s Satires ‘Nil sine magno, Vita labore dedit mortalibus’. The motto means "Nothing without work".
As a result of the increasing numbers of pupils a new annex, St. Kentigern's (formerly Alexander's School) in Duke Street, was purchased. St. Mungo's Academy was transferred to Glasgow Corporation in 1918 and nominal fees were abolished in 1928. Before the Second World War St. Mungo's was not a neighbourhood school but a selective one with a highly competitive entrance exam. 
According to at least 108 former pupils were killed during World War II. One of those, John Gerard Woods, was posthumously awarded the M.C. in 1945 for gallant and distinguished service in Burma. Over half of the school's casualties saw service in the RAF. There is a war memorial located in the school.
1950-1998.
Further increases of the school population in the early 1950s required the use of additional annexes, including, directly across the road, Barony Street (the former Martyrs' Public School, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), Kennedy Street Primary School (built in 1875) which was shared with the City Public School, and Rigby Street in Carntyne which in 1954 housed two "prep" (preparatory) classes and two first year and two second year classes, under the local headship of Mr. Sweeney. Brother Clare (the historian James E. Handley) was the overall headmaster of the Academy at this time. The Rigby Street annexe was later used by St. Gregory's Secondary Cranhill.
During the late 1960s the Secretary of State for Scotland, William Ross, mandated changes to Scottish secondary education. Glasgow Corporation was committed to this system of rigid catchment areas using existing and planned new facilities. As a result, in 1967 St. Mungo’s Academy was facing a future without a catchment area as soon as four new Catholic secondary schools would be completed to service its districts. In addition, the school lacked facilities and was overcrowded. 
Despite these changes the school headmaster, Brother Kenneth, still contended that the school had a role to play and wished to continue its selective recruitment policy in order to create a centre of excellence for providing Catholic community leaders. At this time Catholics tended to occupy the lower half of the class group in Glasgow.
In 1973 the buildings in Parson Street were declared unsafe and work began on the new school in Crownpoint Road. The next year part of the buildings in Parson Street were demolished, though some still remain. Old school registers were destroyed in a fire in December 1975.
The school rehoused to new premises in Hanson Street part of the Central College of Commerce for a short period before the move to the newly built school in Crownpoint Road, Bridgeton, in 1976. At this time St Mungo’s Academy was still a boys school run by the Marist Brothers but over the following years the Brothers moved to other work and by 1988 when the first girls arrived from Our Lady and St Francis Secondary School the Brothers had passed control of the school to lay staff.
By 1989 the school was a comprehensive, co-educational state Roman Catholic school, still called St Mungo’s Academy with equal numbers of boys and girls.
1999-present.
Since August 1999 the school has been part of an education pilot project in which it works very closely with its associated primary schools, some nursery schools and other agencies such as Health, Social Work, Careers and Psychological services. It is known as the St Mungo Learning Community and has considerable autonomy with a devolved budget to organise its own affairs. The aim is to reduce administration in individual schools, leaving more time for teaching and learning and work with other agencies in addressing pupils' needs. In October 2001 staff and pupils transferred to a new purpose built school.
In 2005, the school comprised 29 general classrooms, 7 dedicated ICT teaching areas, 10 science labs, 4 technical rooms, 4 art and design rooms, 3 home economics rooms, 3 music rooms, 2 gymnasia, a drama studio, a games hall, and a purpose built oratory.
Physical education facilities include 4 indoor areas and a new all-weather sports pitch, all used extensively by the local community.
In 2005, 937 pupils were enrolled in the Academy, of which 353 had learning difficulties, 19 had special educational needs and 11 spoke English only as a second language.
The school motto was updated in 2006 to 'Bringing Out The Best'.
The 150th anniversary of the founding of St. Mungo's Academy was celebrated in April 2008 at a dinner in a Glasgow hotel. Pride of place at the dinner went to the then 100 year-old Alasdair McCann, a Govan native, living in Galway. An icon of Saint Marcellin Champagnat, founder of the Marist Brothers was unveiled at a celebratory mass, at St. Mungo's Church, Townhead, in June 2008.
In 2012 'The Mungo Boys', a play based on the reunion of six, former St Mungo's Academy boys, meeting again 40 years after they left the school in 1968 played at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The play was described as "a funny but gentle heart-warming record of youthful naivety, hope and optimism; a story of six pals who, to paraphrase the school motto, achieved nothing without work - but never lost the dream." 
Sports.
Athletics, rugby union and football were the main sports pursued by the school. 
The athletics team participated in both track and field and cross country city and national competitions, often with success. 
The rugby teams were established in 1934-5 
and operated in the years before national schools competitions in Scotland. The teams played a series of matches each season against other rugby playing schools in the Greater Glasgow area.
The football teams were the most successful school sports team and were a source of pride to both pupils and teachers. The school first XI won the Scottish Secondary Schools’ Shield in 1915 at the first time of competing. As the school population grew other age group teams were established. Over the years the teams were successful in both Glasgow and District secondary schools’ championships as well as in national championships.
The last national title was won in 1990 in the Scottish Secondary Schools’ Shield Under 18 Championship Final.
In total the school football teams have won 16 Scottish Schools Championships at all age grades. 
The football teams have also won 47 Glasgow School Championships and 18 Glasgow Cups.

Benjamin Milam

Benjamin Rush "Ben" Milam (October 20, 1788 – December 7, 1835) was a leading figure in the Texas Revolution. Milam County, Texas was named in his honor, as were the Ben Milam Hotel in Houston and the Milam Building in San Antonio. He was born in Kentucky.
Early life.
Milam was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, on October 20, 1788. He was the fifth of the six children of Moses Milam and his wife, Elizabeth Pattie Boyd. 
Milam had little or no formal schooling. He enlisted as a private in the 8th Regiment of the Kentucky Militia, but eventually was elected a lieutenant. He served in the War of 1812.
Early Years in Texas.
In 1818, after learning of the trading opportunities with the Indians of the upper Red River, Milam traveled to Coahuila y Texas to trade with the Comanches. While there, he met David G. Burnet, who at the time was living with the Indians in an attempt to get over his tuberculosis. In New Orleans in 1819, Milam met José Félix Trespalacios and James Long, who were planning an expedition to help the revolutionaries in Mexico gain their independence from Spain. Milam joined Trespalacios and was commissioned a colonel by him.
In Puerto Vallarta and Mexico City, Trespalacios and Milam met the same reception Long had previously received. The non-revolutionaries had them jailed. While in prison, Long was mysteriously killed (reportedly shot by a guard), and Milam blamed Tresplacios. Milam was again imprisoned for threatening to kill Tresplacios. Milam and his friends were sent to Mexico City where Agustín de Iturbide ordered all of them shot. Milam and the others were imprisoned until the fall of 1822, when they were released, thanks to the influence of Joel R. Poinsett, U.S. Commissioner of Observation to Mexico. Poinsett secured their freedom and, with the exception of Milam, all were returned to the United States on the sloop-of-war USS John Adams (1799).
By the spring of 1824, Milam had returned to Mexico, which was adopting the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and a 
republican form of government. Milam was granted Mexican citizenship and commissioned a colonel in the Mexican army.
Texas Revolution.
From 1800 to 1820, Milam was Arthur Wavell's partner in a silver mine operation in Nuevo León. The two also obtained "empresario" grants in Texas. In 1829, Milam intended to organize a new mining company in partnership with David Burnet, but failed due to a lack of funds. In 1835, Milam went to Monclova, the capital of Coahuila y Texas to urge the new governor, Agustín Viesca, to send a land commissioner to Texas to provide the settlers with land titles. However, before Milam could leave the city, word arrived that Antonio López de Santa Anna had overthrown the representative government of Mexico and established a dictatorship. Governor Viesca fled with Milam, but both were captured and imprisoned at Monterrey. Milam eventually escaped, thanks to sympathetic jailers who gave him a horse and let him escape. 
By chance, he encountered a company of Texas soldiers commanded by George Collinsworth, from whom he learned of the movement in Texas for independence. Milam joined them, helping to capture Goliad on October 10. He wrote: "I assisted Texas to gain her independence. I have endured heat and cold, hunger and thirst; I have borne losses and suffered persecutions; I have been a tenant of every prison between this and Mexico. But the events of this night have compensated me for all my losses and all my sufferings."
He then marched with them to join the main army in capturing San Antonio. On November 18 Stephen F. Austin resigned command of the Texan forces at San Antonio to fulfill his mission to the United States as a commissioner. Edward Burleson was elected on November 24 by the volunteers to take Austin's place and then commissioned as commander of the volunteer army by the provisional government on December 1.
While returning from a scouting mission in the southwest on December 4, 1835, Milam learned that a majority of the army had decided not to attack San Antonio as planned, but to go instead into winter quarters. Burleson and his council of officers were reluctant to attack, and the next day at 3 pm, Milam went to Burleson’s tent to ask permission to call for volunteers to storm the city. Burleson had little choice but to go along with Milam's plan. Milam was convinced that putting off the final assault on San Antonio would be a disaster for the cause of independence. He then made his famous impassioned plea: "Who will go with old Ben Milam into Bexar?" Three hundred volunteered to attack at dawn on December 5.
The Siege of Bexar.
Plans were quickly made. The men would form at an abandoned mill, Molino Blanco or Zambrano's mill, at 3 a.m., while Burleson was to hold the rest as a reserve. At the same time, Captain James C. Neil was to open fire with two cannons on the Alamo to distract the Mexican soldiers.
On December 7, 1835 Milam, standing with Frank Johnson and Henry Karnes near the Veramendi house, was shot in the head by a Mexican rifleman and killed instantly. He fell into the arms of Samuel Maverick. He had been trying to observe the San Fernando church tower with a field telescope given to him by Stephen Austin. Robert Morris was chosen to take over Milam’s command of the first division.
The Mexican Army lost more than 400 killed, deserted or wounded in the ensuing battle. Texan losses were only 20 to 30 killed. The siege ended on December 9, 1835 when Martín Perfecto de Cos sent a subordinate to negotiate a truce with the Texans. Morris gave Cos and his troops six days to leave the Alamo. Burleson provided the Mexican Army with as much supplies as he could spare, and the Mexican wounded were allowed to remain behind to be treated by Texan doctors.

Career.
He made his debut in 1960 but only drove a handful of races per year until 1967 when he drove 21 of the 49 races for Red Sharp and finished 32nd in points. He improved to 27th for Sharp the next year and drove his own car in 1969 to a 28th place finish. He did win the 1969 Snowball Derby in his late model car. In 1970 he drove for James Hanley and finished 20th in points. 1971 was his best season when he drove his own car to 13 top tens and a 16th place points result. 
At the 1971 during the 1971 Volunteer 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, Hassler was a relief driver for race winner Charlie Glotzbach. It was not an official win for Hassler and its only one of three instances where two drivers drove the winning car in a NASCAR premier series race.
Hassler died in a crash during the first Daytona 500 qualifying race in 1972 at the age of 36 and the peak of his career. The accident happened on Lap 19 and was started when the car of David Ray Boggs cut a tire.
Hassler is prominently featured in the 1975 book "The World's Number One, Flat-Out, All-Time Great Stock Car Racing Book" by Jerry Bledsoe.

Pete Peterson (baseball)

Harding William "Pete" Peterson (born October 17, 1929 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey) is an American retired catcher and general manager in Major League Baseball. He is the father of Milwaukee Brewers pitching coach Rick Peterson. During his playing days, he was more commonly known as Hardy Peterson.
Biography.
A graduate of Rutgers University, where he was a full season starter on the third-place College World Series team in 1950 and second-team College All American that same year, Peterson spent the first three-plus decades of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a minor and MLB player, minor league manager, farm system director and general manager. 
A right-handed batter and thrower, he appeared in 65 major league games over four seasons (1955; 1957–59) and batted .273 with three home runs in limited service, due to a two-year stint in Korea with the U.S. Army. Peterson and is also noted for appearing in the historic last games played at both the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field in September of . He was 2-for-5 with two runs batted in against the Giants at the Polo Grounds, twice driving home Roberto Clemente. His playing career was effectively ended as the result of a broken arm suffered in a home plate collision at Wrigley Field in early . Later in 1959 he began his managing career at the Class B level and reached Class AAA in 1967 as skipper of the Pirates' top farm club, the Columbus Jets of the International League.
From 1968 through 1976, he directed Pittsburgh's highly productive farm system and, when longtime general manager Joe L. Brown retired following the 1976 campaign, Peterson succeeded him, splitting duties with longtime executive Joe O'Toole, who handled business matters. One of his first (and most noted) moves was the 1976 trade of catcher Manny Sanguillén and cash to the Oakland A's for manager Chuck Tanner. On Peterson's watch, the Pirates remained consistent contenders and in 1979 won the National League pennant and defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles in a seven-game World Series. That Bucs' team, led by Hall of Fame slugger Willie Stargell, was augmented by two bold in-season trades made by Peterson. Frustrated with Frank Taveras' defensive inconsistency, Peterson dealt the erratic shortstop to the Mets for Tim Foli. Later in the season, he put together a package of three pitchers and acquired two-time National League batting champion Bill Madlock from the San Francisco Giants.
The Pirates faded from contention in the early 1980s and by 1985 the team — rocked by a drug scandal among its players — was put up for sale. Peterson was fired early in the 1985 season after a series of missteps, which included the acquisitions of veterans Amos Otis, Gene Tenace and George Hendrick. Peterson eventually joined the New York Yankees, where he worked in their front office and served one season (1990) as the club's general manager. His firing was the last official act of George Steinbrenner before Steinbrenner's suspension from baseball as a result of the "Dave Winfield scandal."
He spent the remainder of his career as a consultant/major league scout for both the San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays organizations, and fully retired from baseball in 1995.
He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, as well as the Rutgers University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997.
As of July 2008, Pete is currently in good health, resides on the Gulf Coast of Florida in the Tampa area, and is an avid and talented golfer.

Rod Funseth

James Rodney "Rod" Funseth (April 3, 1933 – September 9, 1985) was an American professional golfer who played on both the PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the Champions Tour).
Amiable and low-key but less than confident, Funseth was one of longest hitters and fastest players of his era, but better known for a pessimistic attitude toward his game, He claimed that his "I'll never be able to make that shot" mental attitude of lowered expectations helped motivate him to play better. He was especially self-deprecating on his lack of putting prowess.
Early years.
Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, Funseth's father was a men's clothing store operator and salesman, born in Sweden. Rod competed with his older brother Carl for city junior titles and graduated from North Central High School in 1951. Funseth briefly attended the University of Idaho in Moscow to study civil engineering, but did not graduate. He was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
Funseth returned to Spokane after a semester and worked in various jobs in Washington while competing as an amateur. One of these brief jobs was as a civilian draftsman at the Bremerton Navy Yard, west of Seattle. He won the British Columbia Amateur in 1956 and turned pro that fall, first in Palm Springs, California. In 1959, Funseth became an assistant pro under Masters champion Claude Harmon back east at Winged Foot, north of New York City and later at Thunderbird in Palm Springs. Funseth entered a handful of tour events in 1962, and received sponsorship of $800 per month from Spokane's Athletic Round Table (ART) in 1963 to allow him to play full time. He played out of Esmeralda, a municipal course in east Spokane built in the mid-1950s. It was initially funded by ART (land and clubhouse) and was named for the group's mascot, a grinning cartoon mare. Funseth had the smiling horse insignia on his tour bag for several years, which invited frequent inquisitions. Keeping meticulous records of all his earnings, he reimbursed the ART to the last dollar.
PGA Tour.
Funseth played full-time on the PGA Tour from 1963 through 1979 and won three tour events. The first was the Phoenix Open Invitational in 1965 at the Arizona Country Club, which came a week after losing a final round lead at the Bob Hope Classic in Palm Springs. Funseth's second win came eight years later at the Glen Campbell-Los Angeles Open, the season-opener in 1973 at Riviera. His final PGA Tour win came at age 45 in 1978 at the Sammy Davis Jr.-Greater Hartford Open, which paid for his horse barn.
His best finish in a major championship was just months earlier, a tie for second at the Masters, one stroke behind Gary Player. Funseth was in the last pairing on Sunday and had a three-under 69, but Player carded a record-tying 64 (−8) for his third green jacket. Funseth birdied the par-5 15th hole, but parred the last three, with a putt left on the lip at the 16th and another narrowly missing on the final hole to force a playoff.
Funseth was known on tour as an avid fisherman, a passion shared by Johnny Miller, his next-door neighbor in Napa, and Jack Nicklaus. The three played in an exhibition golf match in Spokane in 1975, a rarity for Nicklaus at the time.
Senior Tour.
Funseth became eligible to play on the Senior PGA Tour after reaching age 50 in April 1983. He had a great deal of immediate success, winning the unofficial Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf (team event with Roberto De Vicenzo) in early May, and a nine-stroke victory at his tour debut at the Hall of Fame Tournament three weeks later in North Carolina at Pinehurst No. 2. Funseth also finished second to Billy Casper in a sudden-death playoff at the U.S. Senior Open in July.
Cancer.
His career on the over-50 tour was cut short by terminal cancer, attributed to exposure to asbestos at the navy yard in Bremerton in his late teens. Told by physicians in January 1984 that he had four months to live, Funseth continued to play well on tour, and returned to defend his team title at the Liberty Mutual Legends in late April. He competed in 17 events in 1984, with three runner-up finishes and nine in the top-10, despite losing weight and strength. Funseth won a match play event in October in Maine, besting Bob Toski 2-up in the final for a winner's share of $30,000. Although a non-tour event, it included most of the top senior players of the day.
Death.
Funseth's condition declined in 1985 as his body weight was reduced to by September and his breathing assisted with oxygen. He died at age 52 at his home in Napa, California, beside the 12th hole of the Silverado Country Club, next door to friend Johnny Miller. In 1999, he was inducted posthumously into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame.
Personal.
Funseth was survived by his wife Sandi (née Hawkins), a former competitive water skier from San Diego, and their two children, Lisa and Mark, in their late teens. He met Sandi during the rainy Crosby event at Pebble Beach in January 1965, when she was a spectator in a long leg cast (from a snow skiing accident) and had been offered shelter in a tournament tent. They were married later that year.
