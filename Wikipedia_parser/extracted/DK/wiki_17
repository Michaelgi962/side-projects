Sings the Ballads of the True West

Sings the Ballads of the True West is a conceptual double album and the 22nd overall album released by country singer Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in 1965 (see 1965 in music). Covering twenty individual songs, the album, as its title suggests, contains various ballads and other songs on topics related to the history of the American Old West. This includes Carl Perkins' "The Ballad of Boot Hill", "Streets of Laredo", and the sole single from the album, "Mr. Garfield", describing the shock of the population after the assassination of President James Garfield. One of the songs, "25 Minutes to Go", would later be performed at Folsom Prison and appear on Cash's famous "At Folsom Prison" recording in 1968. "Sings the Ballads of the True West" was re-issued in 2002 (see 2002 in music) through Legacy Recordings, with two bonus tracks, one of which is an instrumental version of a track available on the album.

Percy Sonn

Percival Henry Frederick Sonn (25 September 1949 - 27 May 2007) was a South African lawyer and cricket administrator. Sonn became the sixth president of the International Cricket Council, the most senior role at cricket's world governing body, in July 2006. He was the first ICC president from Africa, serving until his early death. 
Early life.
Sonn was born in Oudtshoorn, near Cape Town in South Africa, one of seven brothers. He was educated at Belgravia Senior Secondary School, and read law at the University of the Western Cape. He became an attorney and advocate. He worked as a public prosecutor, and as a legal adviser to the South African Police Service, becoming a senior counsel, acting judge, and deputy director of public prosecutions. He was previously chief executive officer of a forensic investigation company. 
He formed and headed the Directorate of Special Operations, responsible for investigating serious offences, including organised crime and drug trafficking.
Cricket career.
Sonn played as an off-spinner for Maitland and Parow Cricket Union. He never played first-class cricket. He started out in cricket administration at his local club in Belville, in Cape Town, because he was virtually the only person at the club who could read and write, moving on to become vice president of the non-white Western Province Cricket Board under Hassan Howa from 1974 to 1983, and then president from 1990 to 1992. He was also a vice-president of the racially segregated South African Cricket Board. 
Sonn played a crucial role when South Africa returned to world cricket after the fall of apartheid in 1991, and was president of the United Cricket Board of South Africa for three years until 2003. He also served on the UCB's management committee. 
He advocated the quota system, to increase the representation of non-white players in the South African cricket team. He overruled the selectors in 2002, directing that (non-white) Justin Ontong should play against Australia instead of (white) Jacques Rudolph. 
Sonn became vice-president of the ICC in 2004, and was due to succeed Ehsan Mani as the sixth president of the ICC in June 2005, but Mani's term of office was extended by one year, and Sonn finally took office in 2006. His two year term had been extended by an additional year in March 2007 when the ICC was unable to decide between David Morgan and Sharad Pawar as his successor. In failing health, he took little part in the 2007 Cricket World Cup after delivering a speech at the opening ceremony in Jamaica. 
On 22 May 2007 he was reported to be critically ill at Durbanville Medi-Clinic. He was admitted to intensive care after complications following minor colon surgery the previous day. The surgery had originally been scheduled for February. He died five days later. He was survived by his wife Sandra, and their two sons and one daughter.
Controversy.
A controversial figure, particularly over his support for racial quotas in South African national teams, Sonn is felt by many to have been the wrong choice for leadership of the ICC, especially after he was forced to issue a public apology following allegations that he was drunk and disorderly at a 2003 Cricket World Cup game between India and Holland.
According to a report in the South African newspaper "Beeld", racing driver Sarel van der Merwe witnessed how Sonn "literally fell out of his pants" and staggered about among the private suites at Boland Park, where the match was being played. The newspaper quoted van der Merwe as saying: "One could see that the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, who was there as his guest, was most embarrassed." 
Despite the incident, Sonn became an ICC vice-president in 2004 and succeeded to the presidency two years later.

Carl Brigham

Carl Campbell Brigham (4 May 1890 – 24 January 1943) was a professor of psychology at Princeton University's Department of Psychology and pioneer in the field of psychometrics. His early writings influenced the eugenics movement and anti-immigration legislation in the United States, but he later disowned these views. He was a chairman of the College Board from 1923 to 1926 and was the creator of the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Early life, family and education.
Carl Campbell Brigham was born 4 May 1890 in Marlborough, Massachusetts to Charles Francis Brigham and Ida B. (Campbell) Brigham, the third of four children. His family has roots in early Massachusetts Bay Colony with ancestors that included Thomas Brigham (1603–1653) and Edmund Rice (1594–1663). Brigham earned all of his degrees (B.A., M.A. and Ph.D.) at Princeton University. He married Elizabeth G F Duffield on 10 Feb 1923 and they had a daughter, Elizabeth H. Brigham (b. 1926).
Career.
At the outbreak of World War I, Brigham joined the military and was commissioned as 1st Lieutenant in the Sanitary Corps, psychological service from Oct. to Dec 1917 at Camp Dix. He was then assigned to Surgeon General's office in Washington DC with the group of psychologists revising army examinations to aid in selection off officer candidates. Jan to Mar 1918 he was at Camps Meade, Lee and Gordon, for psychological experiments. In April 1918, he was assigned the Tank Corps, but he never served overseas.
After the war in 1920, Brigham joined Princeton as a faculty member, and he collaborated with Robert Yerkes' from the Army Mental Tests and published their results in the influential 1923 book, "A Study of American Intelligence" authored by Brigham with the forward by Yerkes. Analyzing the data from the Army tests, Brigham came to the conclusion that native born Americans had the highest intelligence out of the groups tested. He proclaimed the intellectual superiority of the "Nordic Race" and the inferiority of the "Alpine" (Eastern European) and "Mediterranean Races" and argued that immigration should be carefully controlled to safeguard the "American Intelligence." Nothing troubled Brigham so much however, as miscegenation between blacks and whites, as Brigham believed "Negroes" were by far the most intellectually inferior race.
Though he later in 1930 denounced his expressed views on the intellectual superiority of the "Nordic Race" and specifically disowned the book, it had already been instrumental in fueling anti-immigrant sentiment in America and the eugenics debate. It was used most effectively by Harry Laughlin in the 1924 congressional debates leading to anti-immigrant legislation. 
Brigham chaired the College Board commission from 1923 to 1926, leading to the creation of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, now simply called the SAT Reasoning Test.
Brigham died 24 January 1943 in Princeton.

Mrs. Harris

Mrs. Harris is a 2005 American drama film written and directed by Phyllis Nagy. The teleplay, based on the book "Very Much a Lady" by Shana Alexander, focuses on the tempestuous relationship between Herman Tarnower, noted cardiologist and author of the "New York Times" bestseller "The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet", and headmistress Jean Harris. Produced by HBO Films, it was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005 before being broadcast by the cable network in February 2006.
The film stars Annette Bening as Jean Harris, and Ben Kingsley as Herman Tarnower; Cloris Leachman also stars as Tarnower's sister, and Chloë Sevigny plays his secretary and lover. The film also features a cameo performance by Ellen Burstyn as one of Tarnower's previous girlfriends; Burstyn played Jean Harris herself in the 1981 made-for-television movie, "The People vs. Jean Harris".
Plot.
On a stormy night in March 1980, a distraught Jean Harris arrives at the baronial Purchase, New York home of Herman Tarnower following a five-hour drive from McLean, Virginia. Her goal is to commit suicide beside the pond on his estate after confronting her former lover, who spurned her in favor of his considerably younger secretary-receptionist Lynne Tryforos. When she removes a gun from her handbag, Tarnower attempts to take it away from her, and in the struggle he accidentally is shot and collapses. Because the phone isn't working, Jean drives off to seek help from a neighbor, only to return to the house when she sees a police car heading in that direction.
The film then follows divergent paths, using flashbacks and flashforwards to tell the story of the couple's initial meeting, their evolving and eventually faltering relationship, the night of the shooting, and Jean's consequent trial for murder. A divorced mother of two sons, she tends to be complacent in both her personal and professional lives, the ideal target for Herman, a vulgar man with the need to be in total control of everyone and everything. He proposes marriage and presents Jean with a ring she feels is embarrassingly large and overly gaudy for the headmistress of a private girls' school. As time passes, she presses him to set a wedding date, until he finally confesses he has changed his mind about marrying her, primarily because he has no interest in playing the role of father to her sons. Jean attempts to return the ring but he insists she keep it and, instead of allowing her to make a clean break from the relationship, he continues to manipulate her by taking advantage of her need for a dominant presence in her life. By prescribing numerous medications to which she becomes addicted, he forces her to become both physically and emotionally dependent upon him while flaunting his many affairs with other women.
During Jean's trial, a flashback to the night of the shooting shows it in a very different light from the earlier portrayal. An angry Jean willfully and methodically shoots Herman and coldly watches him writhe in pain, but on the witness stand she insists it was an accident. Her staunch refusal to allow attorney Joel Aurnou to portray her former lover in a bad light prevents him from presenting any details that would support a defense of extreme emotional disturbance, and she is found guilty and sentenced to fifteen years to life in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
Production.
This was the second television movie about the Harris murder trial, following "The People vs. Jean Harris", which aired in 1981 shortly after the verdict was rendered. In the earlier film, Harris was portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, who makes a cameo appearance in "Mrs. Harris" as Gerda Stedman, one of Tarnower's many lovers. Her performance, which consists of two lines of dialogue totaling 38 words and lasts 14 seconds, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. "USA Today" reported when asked about her reaction to the nomination by AP Radio, Burstyn responded, "I thought it was fabulous. My next ambition is to get nominated for seven seconds, and, ultimately, I want to be nominated for a picture in which I don't even appear."
In addition to Burstyn, Brett Butler, Lee Garlington, Jessica Tuck, Lisa Edelstein, John Rubinstein, Heidemarie Fuentes and Larry Drake also make brief appearances in the film.
Critical reception.
Dennis Harvey of "Variety" called the film "competent rather than inspired" and added, "Phyllis Nagy's film directorial bow is an uneven affair, lacking the panache that elevated ripped-from-headlines pics like "Reversal of Fortune" above telepic level . . . film doesn't seem sure just what approach to settle on: Elements of mystery, social satire (Nagy does have some bright lines up her sleeve), psychological horror story, black comedy, and straightforward tragic love story all jostle without complementing each other or achieving a successful kaleidoscope effect. The latter may be Nagy's goal, but she's not yet an accomplished enough filmmaker to pull it off. Despite particularly sharp assists from her designers in nailing the nouveau riche couture and decor of the eras covered, the movie's own style alternates between pedestrian and overreaching . . . Nevertheless, tale and execution are both colorful enough to hold attention. Bening . . . hits all the right individual notes of pluck, passion, and tether-snapping, even if the hectic script doesn't let them form a coherent arc. Kingsley easily puts across the kind of masculine appeal that can exist in tandem with empathy-challenged callousness."
Awards and nominations.
The film was nominated for twelve Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Made for Television Movie, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for Annette Bening, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for Ben Kingsley, and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for Cloris Leachman in addition to Ellen Burstyn, but lost in all categories.
The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or TV Film and the Satellite Award for Best Television Film. Bening was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Miniseries or TV Film, the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Miniseries or Television Film, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie. Kingsley was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Miniseries or TV Film, the Satellite Award for Best Actor - Miniseries or Television Film, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie.
The American Cinema Editors nominated the film for Best Edited Miniseries or Film for Non-Commercial Television, and the Costume Designers Guild nominated it for Outstanding Costume Design for Television Movie/Mini-Series.
The Casting Society of America honored the film for Best Film of the Week Casting.
DVD release.
HBO Home video released the film in anamorphic widescreen format on DVD on August 1, 2006. It features audio tracks in English and Spanish and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French. Bonus features include commentary by Annette Bening, Ben Kingsley, and writer-director Phyllis Nagy and "Mrs. Harris For the Record: Firsthand Accounts", which includes brief interviews with some of the real-life principals involved in the story, including Jean Harris.

Utilization management

Utilization management is the evaluation of the appropriateness, medical need and efficiency of health care services procedures and facilities according to established criteria or guidelines and under the provisions of an applicable health benefits plan. Typically it includes new activities or decisions based upon the analysis of a case.
Utilization management describes proactive procedures, including discharge planning, concurrent planning, pre-certification and clinical case appeals. It also covers proactive processes, such as concurrent clinical reviews and peer reviews, as well as appeals introduced by the provider, payer or patient.
As pre-certification and concurrent review of cases grew, utilization management spun out of utilization review. While not synonymous, health care professionals tend to use the terms as interchangeable (pre-certification and prospective). The difference is utilization management is prospective and intends to manage health care cases efficiently and cost effectively before and during health care administration. Utilization review is more retrospective considering whether health care was appropriately applied after it was administered.
There are four basic techniques in utilization management:

Lyman High School

Lyman High School is a public high school located in Longwood, Florida, a city located approximately 10 miles north of Orlando. The school, founded in 1924, has been consistently ranked among the best in the state by the Florida Department of Education. For the 2012-2013 school term Lyman High School garnered a straight 'A' average, the best in the district, as a result of extremely high student scores on the Florida Comprehension Assessment Test. In 2014, it was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the 27th best high school in the state of Florida and the overall best high school in Central Florida. It was ranked by Newsweek as the 204th best high school in the United States in 2010. The school was also named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 1982. The school is operated by Seminole County Public Schools.
History.
The school's namesake, Howard Charles Lyman, arrived in the area upon the invitation of Congressman Charles Delemere Haines. After Seminole County voted to separate from Orange County, in 1920, the Lymans and other citizens of the area voted to incorporate the city of Altamonte Springs. By 1923, it became apparent that the established school houses in the area did not adequately meet the needs of the growing population.
At a board of trustees meeting it was suggested that the cities of Lake Mary, Longwood and Altamonte Springs consolidate and create one school building. Because of its distance from the other two cities, Lake Mary opted to create its own school, while the cities of Longwood and Altamonte Springs consolidated into one school.
Construction of the new school began in 1924. Howard Lyman died a few days before the construction of the school began. In appreciation of his work, the school was named after him. Lyman School opened in September 1924 with Howard Douglas as the principal. By 1926, the school had become an accredited junior high school, and enrolment had increased to a degree where it was necessary to add six rooms to the building. In 1929, Lyman School was accredited through the twelfth grade under the leadership of W.J. Wells, Jr.
Lyman School was renamed Lyman High School in 1963 when it became an accredited institution under the leadership of Carlton D. Henley. Three years later, Lyman High School became fully integrated, admitting its first black students in 1966. In 1969, Lyman High School moved to a newly constructed state-of-the-art campus approximately 1/4 mile to the north, while the former Lyman campus became R. T. Milwee Junior High School, named after Rayburn T. Milwee, Sr., a former Lyman teacher (1939-1949), Lyman principal (1949-1952) and Superintendent of Seminole County Schools (1952-1967). As originally envisioned, Milwee Junior High School was to become a second junior high for grades 7 through 9, feeding into Lyman along with the pre-existing South Seminole Junior High School in Casselberry. Students residing in Milwee's catchment area that were already attending South Seminole Junior High were allowed to continue attending that school and Milwee was initially established with only a 7th grade.
In 1970, Seminole County transitioned to a "middle school" concept and all existing junior high schools were redesignated as middle schools. Under this concept, all elementary schools would now incorporate mandatory kindergarten programs and accommodate students in grades K through 5. Middle schools would incorporate 6th grade students formerly in the elementary schools and accommodate grades 6 through 8. Finally, 9th grade programs previously resident in the junior high schools would transfer to the senior high schools, making all high schools grade 9 through 12 institutions. However, explosive population growth in South Seminole County during the 1960s made such a transition less than optimal. During the 1970-71 academic year, the inclusion of 9th grade students from the former South Seminole Junior High School mandated "double sessions" for the first time in Lyman High School's history. Under double sessions, approximately 50% of Lyman's students began class at 7:00am, finishing at 1:30pm. At 11:30am, the second cohort of students would arrive, finishing at 6:00pm. The comparatively new Lyman campus, originally constructed for approximately 1500 students, now housed well in excess of 2,000, especially during peak loading between 11:30am and 1:30pm, mandating the installation and use of numerous portable classrooms on the campus.
In June 1971, Milwee Middle School was closed and its 7th and 8th grade students transferred to newly completed Teague Middle School near Forest City. The former Milwee Middle School/original Lyman campus then became a "satellite campus" of Lyman High School for the 1971-72 academic year, providing additional classroom facilities for primarily 9th and 10th grade students. It was not unusual for students, especially 10th grade, to have classes on both campuses, commuting between both via shuttle bus or on foot in a manner similar to college/university students. The following academic year, 1972–73, all Lyman students returned to the main campus. That same year, Lake Brantley High School was established with 9th and 10th grade students, using the former Milwee-"cum"-Lyman "satellite campus" until its permanent facility in Forest City was completed in mid-1973. Lyman's last "3 year program" (grades 10-12) class graduated in 1973 and its first "4 year program" (grades 9-12) class graduated in 1974. The 1974 class was also Lyman's then-largest ever graduating class at that time, numbering over 740 students. It was also the last graduating class whose population contained students from nearly all of South Seminole County, to include the entire catchment area for Lake Brantley High School, the entire catchment areas for the later constructed Lake Howell High School and portions of the catchment areas for the later constructed Lake Mary High School and Winter Springs High School.
As principal from 1963 through 1994, Carlton Henley was primarily responsible for bringing approximately $900,000 in grant money to Lyman High School and Seminole County. Henley also developed one of the most highly technological high schools in the state, as well as the institution of the double-period schedule for students, a dropout prevention program, a staff development program for teachers, and provided leadership for the development of the most comprehensive athletic facility of any high school in the state. In 1984, he was named Florida Principal of the Year. Principal Henley retired in 1994 after more than 30 years at the helm of Lyman High School. Entering local politics, he is currently a County Commissioner representing District 4 on the Seminole County Board of County Commissioners.
The end of the Henley years had ushered in a new era for Lyman. This included the 75th Anniversary celebration in 1999 with the creation of the Lyman High School Hall of Fame and, in 2000, the creation of the Lyman High School Institute for Engineering.
Institute for Engineering.
Lyman High School houses a magnet program called the Institute for Engineering, having an engineering emphasis on mathematics and science. It is an academic and technology related program designed to prepare students for advanced educational and job related experiences in fields related to engineering. Each student that wishes to "graduate" from The Institute for Engineering must complete a seventy (70) hour internship at a selected site coinciding with their specialization.
Within the Institute for Engineering there are five areas of specialization: aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, bioengineering, computer modeling and simulation, and architectural engineering and design. During the freshman year, students in the Institute are required to choose a specialization to pursue for the rest of their high school career.
Athletics.
The Greyhounds participate in over 20 athletic programs of the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA). The school competes in Division 6A and offers programs for both, boys and girls and includes freshman, junior varsity, and varsity sports.
Fall sports offered include football, swimming, golf, girls' volleyball, cross-country, and bowling.
Winter sports offered include basketball, wrestling, and soccer.
Spring sports offered include baseball, track and field, softball, boys' volleyball, tennis, water polo, and lacrosse.

Half the World Away

"Half the World Away" is a song by English rock band Oasis. It is well known as the theme tune to the popular BBC sitcom "The Royle Family".
The song was written by Oasis' lead guitarist Noel Gallagher, who also provides lead vocals. The song is a slow acoustic tune with plodding keyboards, and the lyric - much like "Rock 'n' Roll Star" - expresses a desire to leave a stagnant life in a boring city. The song is primarily in C Major.
Recorded at The Congress House Studio, Austin, Texas in October 1994, "Half the World Away" was first released as a B-side to "Whatever" on 18 December 1994, reaching #3 in the UK charts.
In 1998 the song was included in "The Masterplan"; a collection of Oasis' best b-sides. The collection was a success, peaking at #2 in the UK charts. The track is also included on Oasis' compilation album "Stop the Clocks", which also reached #2.
Background.
It was Oasis' sound engineer Mark Coyle who introduced the band to Burt Bacharach's song "This Guy's in Love with You". Coyle was in charge of musical intake while on tour, and this song was often played during his eclectic sets. It was drummer Tony McCarroll who pointed out that the song's drum shuffle could be adapted for one of Oasis' acoustic numbers. After a while ""instead of adapting the drum shuffle, Noel seemed to have adapted the whole song and renamed it Half The World Away"". Despite the input and being able to play the pattern well, McCarroll (along with the rest of the band) were invited to leave the studio for a break, but it turned out being just an excuse so Gallagher could record the drum track himself.
In interviews, Gallagher - who is famous for "borrowing" from other musicians – has admitted the tune to "Half the World Away" was adapted from "This Guy's in Love with You" by Bacharach and Hal David. He commented "It sounds exactly the same. I'm surprised he hasn't sued me yet!" Gallagher sang "This Guy's in Love with You" live in 1996 at a Burt Bacharach concert at the London Festival Hall while Bacharach accompanied him on piano and conducted the orchestra.
The Royle Family.
The song gained mass public exposure when it was selected by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash to be the theme tune to their sitcom "The Royle Family". The series revolved around the sitting room of a lazy working-class family and was set in Manchester, the hometown of Oasis. Although it had modest beginnings, the series soon became a cultural phenomenon in England and its theme became well known. The opening credits of the series edited together the first stanza of the first verse and the second stanza of the first chorus. The end credits, which would cut in immediately after the final joke of the episode - so as to add weight to it - began with the second stanza of the final chorus and would see the song through to the coda. When Gallagher was originally approached about using an Oasis song for a series about a working-class family in Manchester, he suggested "Married with Children" and was confused when "Half the World Away" was chosen. On tour in America when "The Royle Family" was first screened, he claims the penny did not drop until he returned to the United Kingdom to find the series a huge success and viewed it, feeling the song was perfect for the series. He now claims not to think of "Half the World Away" as an Oasis song, but rather as the theme tune to "The Royle Family".
Personnel.

Bishop Moore High School

Bishop Moore Catholic High School is a private Roman Catholic high school in the College Park neighborhood of Orlando, Florida. It remains the only Catholic high school in Greater Orlando. It is located within the Diocese of Orlando. The school was built in 1954 and was named after Bishop John Moore; he was the second bishop of the Diocese of St. Augustine, which had been the only diocese in Florida prior to the creation of the Archdiocese of Miami (1958).
John Moore was born in County Westmeath, Ireland and moved to Charleston, South Carolina at the age of 14. He served as Bishop of St. Augustine from 1877 to 1901. Moore was very influential in the expansion of Catholic schools in Florida and recruitment of religious nuns and priests to meet the ministerial needs of the diocese.
The school sits on a campus adjacent to Little Lake Fairview. There are multiple campus buildings. An extensive renovation and expansion occurred 7 years ago with the addition of a new gymnasium complex, administrative building, library complex, band room and class room space. Loretta Hall and the Massaro Science Wing were restored. The landmark "Golden Dome" remains in use as a secondary gymnasium. Most of the buildings are original to the campus, with new additions being added into science labs in summer 2011.

Douglas Sutherland

Douglas Chalmers Hutchinson Sutherland (1919 – 28 August 1995) was a British author and journalist, who was born at Bongate Hall, Appleby-in-Westmorland, in 1919. He always joked that the error of judgement in his not being born in Scotland was compensated for a year later by his family's moving to live in the remote island of Stronsay in Orkney.
Background.
The family later moved to Aberdeenshire, and Sutherland followed his elder brother to Trinity College, Glenalmond. He joined the army in 1938 as a Private with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, though Sutherland was later commissioned into the King's (Liverpool) Regiment, and saw active service during the Second World War, for which he was awarded the Military Cross, twice being mentioned in Despatches. In 1945, he was posted to Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group Headquarters at Bad Oeynhausen, where he joined the Allied Liaison Branch, and was an observer at the Nuremberg Trials.
Career.
Returning to London at the age of 26, Sutherland would observe that his first challenge as a civilian was sartorial. To this end, he was helped by Oscar Hammerstein, the American lyricist, who was a friend of his first wife Moyra Fraser, then a ballet dancer. Hammerstein presented him with his cast-off suits, and thus attired, he began working as a journalist for the "Evening Standard", and later, the "Daily Express".
Sutherland's life during this period is affectionately depicted in "Portrait of a Decade", where he recalls many of the colourful characters of 1950s London, centred on Muriel Belcher's famous Colony Club in Dean Street, Soho. However, he is best remembered for his best-selling humour series which began with "The English Gentleman", and was followed by "The English Gentleman's Wife/Child/Mistress", and "The English Gentleman Abroad". Although he later claimed that the English Gentleman no longer existed, his observations on the species remain classic period commentaries.
But there was also a deeply serious side to his writing. His highly-acclaimed biographies feature such widely contrasting personalities as the sporting Earl of Lonsdale ("The Yellow Earl"), and, with Jon Connell, founder of "The Week" magazine, the life of the international fraudster Emil Savundra, which won the Crime Writer's Silver Dagger Award for the best non-fiction crime book of the year.
In 1963, with Anthony Purdy, he published a book called "Burgess and Maclean". At that time he had identified with total certainty that the fourth shadowy figure involved in the notorious spy ring of the 1950s was Sir Anthony Blunt. So sure was Sutherland that in the course of his research he approached Blunt for a meeting over a drink at the Travellers Club in London. Blunt's response was to threaten legal action should his name appear anywhere connected with the case. Further pressure was then placed on the authors from the highest level, and Sutherland and Purdy were obliged to suppress their information for reasons of national security. After Blunt's exposure some twenty years later, Sutherland immediately released "The Fourth Man", the first full uncensored account of the intrigue.
Having married three times, Sutherland settled in Scotland with his third wife Diana. His latter years were marred by a dispute over the publishing royalties of the English Gentleman series, and he died at South Queensferry on 28 August 1995. His children include architect Charlie Sutherland, choreographer James Sutherland, comedy performer Jojo Sutherland and curator Adam Sutherland, director of Grizedale Arts.

Seaforth Sands railway station

Seaforth Sands was a terminus station located on the Liverpool Overhead Railway at Seaforth, west of Crosby Road South, Knowsley Road and Rimrose Road junctions.
The station opened on 30 April 1894, as a northern extension from Alexandra Dock (LOR).
With the LOR's second northern extension to Seaforth & Litherland on 2 July 1905, a 'through' station was opened by the same name, the former station then only being used at peak times. This was later demolished and replaced by a large carriage shed.
It was the last overhead station before the junction with the North Mersey Branch. The weight gauge meant that while LOR trains could operate on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway electrified network, the reverse was not true.
As LOR trains ran at a lower voltage than the Lancashire and Yorkshire electric trains, LOR trains were permitted to operate with their motors in series mode only on the North Mersey Branch.
The station was victim to a serious arson attack in early 1956. However, the station closed, along with the rest of the line on 30 December 1956. No evidence of this station remains.

The Outfoxies

The Outfoxies (アウトフォクシーズ) is a 1995 arcade game by Namco that depicted several professional hitmen secretly set against each other by a held-in-common client "Mr. Acme". Acme and his wife had hired each of them to assassinate a wealthy art collector, then arranged for them to kill each other to ultimately avoid having to pay their fee.
Gameplay.
The gameplay has you thrown into a particular hitman's home turf and you must use every weapon imaginable as well as anything you can find in the environment (including the environment itself) to try to kill your competitor. Weapons can be typical like a rocket launcher or machine gun or absurd like a clown cannon or a bowl of hot soup. Despite dealing with a competition about murder, the game has a levity to it in all aspects.
The levels are also a star part of this game as they are varied and, in many cases, will begin to collapse as time goes on. This means that if the player doesn't kill his competition in a set amount of time the level will literally start crumbling around you. The levels take place in various interactive locations, involving inside a plane, a moving train, an office building or even at the circus.
Soundtrack.
Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Outfoxies : Namco Game Sound Express Vol.20 - VICL-15042) on 21/06/1995.

<doc id="5875430" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875430" title="Joseph Colon Trabotto">
Joseph Colon Trabotto

Joseph Colon ben Solomon Trabotto, also known as Maharik, (c. 1420, Chambéry – 1480) was a 15th-century rabbi who is considered Italy's foremost Judaic scholar and Talmudist of his era.
Early years.
Colon (whose name is related to the French word "", or 'dove') was a scion of the Trabotto family, which was known for its large number of scholars. After the final expulsion of Jews from the French Kingdom in 1394, his family emigrated first to the Franche-Comté and subsequently settled in the city of Chambéry, the capital of the Duchy of Savoy, which was home to a significant population of rabbinic scholars. Among these were Yohanan Treves, the last chief rabbi of France and Yeshaya Astruc ben Abba Mari. 
The exact year and place of Joseph Colon's birth cannot be determined, but is estimated to be at the beginning of the 1420s in Chambéry, a city whose Jewish population was overwhelmigly made up of individuals of French, rather than German, origin. It was within this ambience that the young Joseph Colon received his Talmudic education, which was heavily imbued with the style, traditions and Talmudic methodology of medieval French Jewry. Chiefly, he studied under the tutelage of his father, Solomon Trabotto, a noted Talmudist and Kabbalist, though he does refer to others as his teachers, and recalls participating in learned discussion with other local scholars. Colon left Chambéry in the early 1450s and settled in the Italian Piedmont, which had become part of the Duchy of Savoy. This move was the result of a combination of new opportunities on the other side of the Alps, combined with increasing anti-Judaism in Trans-Alpine Savoy. It was not, however, as Grätz claims ("Gesch." 3d ed., viii. 253), a consequence of the expulsion of the Jews from Savoy, which only occurred in 1471. For a time he led a wandering life, and was forced to gain his living by teaching children.
Travels and growing fame as scholar.
About 1469 Colon officiated as rabbi in Piove di Sacco, in Venetian territory and continued on to Mestre, near Venice. Subsequently he was rabbi at Bologna and Mantua and, according to a report in Gedaliah Ibn Yahya's Shalshelet ha-Qabbalah, became embroiled in a quarrel with Rabbi Judah Messer Leon, both being banished by the authorities. Thereupon he relocated to Pavia. At the same time Colon's decisions in civil as well as religious questions were sought from far and wide—from German cities, such as Ulm and Nuremberg, as well as from Constantinople. He wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch, and novellæ on the Talmud and on the legal codex of Moses of Coucy, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol. His major legacy were, however, his responsa. These were collected after his death by his son-in-law Rabbi Gershon Treves, and by one of his pupils, Hiyya Meïr ben David and were published in Venice in 1519 by Daniel Bomberg. They were subsequently republished many times. In 1984, E. D. Pines published fifty new responsa from manuscript. Many more of his responsa remain unpublished.
Responsa.
Colon's responsa are among the classic productions in this field of rabbinic literature and exercised tremendous influence on the subsequent development of Jewish Law or Halakhah. His decisions had massive influence upon all subsequent legal development. His influence is particularly notable in the Ashkenazic orbit, as reflected in Moses Isserles' glosses on the Shulhan Arukh. Colon's responsa were the central pillar of later Italian halakhah, and there is scarcely an Italian rabbi of the 16th, 17th and 18th century who does not quote him. These responsa are distinguished by his encyclopedic knowledge and methodical analysis of sources. He attempts to identify the basic principles underlying his sources and to elucidate the conceptual framework within which he renders his rulings. His legal method also resembles the mode of analysis known as pilpul. Established custom (or minhag) played a unique place in his thinking and he defines its authority. In this context, he served as the defender of a uniquely French school of Ashkenazic Law and Lore. The Mishneh Torah of Maimonides enjoys a preeminent place in his writings. His extensive comments thereupon, scattered throughout his responsa and lecture notes, helped to set the agenda for later scholars. Colon's responsa are marked by tremendous deference to authorities of the past. Hesitating to decide between them, he resorted to methods of legal determination which removed or minimized this necessity (e.g. Halakha k’Bathra’i). 
Colon's self-confidence is remarkable. He had a strong regard for right and justice. Firmly, though respectfully, he reproved Rabbi Israel Bruna, the foremost German talmudist of his time, for overstepping the bounds of his authority. Responsum No. 4, addressed to the congregation of Regensburg, is highly important. A number of Jews of that community having been falsely accused, and a sum of money having to be raised for their ransom, the surrounding places and neighboring communities refused to contribute, at least insofar as it was a question of paying a fixed tax instead of making voluntary contributions. Colon decided that the communities in question could not refuse to pay their share, since the same false accusation might be made against them also, and if the accused in this case were proved innocent and ransomed, they would then be safe from danger.
Dispute with Capsali.
It was natural that a man of Colon's stamp should sometimes be carried too far in his zeal for truth and justice; and this happened in his dispute with Capsali, the "ḥakam-bashi" (Hakham-bashi, or Chief Rabbi) of Turkey. Having been falsely informed by an emissary ("meshullaḥ") on behalf of the people of Jerusalem, that Capsali was very lax in divorce decisions, and that he had declared that the betrothed of a man who had become converted to Christianity should be considered as single, and that he had declared an engagement void because it had not been entered into according to the laws of the community, Colon, in order to establish the sanctity and inviolability of marriage beyond the power of any individual rabbi, wrote three letters (Responsa Nos. 83, 84, 85) to the president and leaders of the community of Constantinople. The responsa threatened to place Capsali under the ban if he did not recall his decisions and do public penance; and at the same time making it understood that in no case would Capsali ever again be allowed to fill the office of rabbi (Responsum No. 83). 
This decree of an Italian rabbi pronounced against a Turkish colleague was an unprecedented attack on the rights of the community, and provoked the righteous indignation of the Jewish social order in Constantinople—all the more as it proved to rest upon a groundless and vulgar calumny. Capsali, conscious of having been maligned, did not mince matters in answering Colon's letters; and a bitter discussion arose between the two men, in which the leading rabbis of Germany, Italy, and the Orient took part. It is characteristic of Colon that as soon as he became convinced that he had been the victim of an intrigue, and so had done injustice to the ḥakam bashi, he did not hesitate to make amends. On his deathbed, he commissioned his son Perez to go to Constantinople and ask, in his father's name, the forgiveness of Capsali.
Trabotto died in Pavia at the age of about sixty. Most references agree on his year of death, although one lists it as 1484, four years later than generally accepted.

<doc id="5875450" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875450" title="Radha Krishna">
Radha Krishna

Radha Krishna (IAST , Sanskrit राधा कृष्ण) are collectively known within Hinduism as the combination of both the feminine as well as the masculine aspects of God. Krishna is often referred as "svayam bhagavan" in Gaudiya Vaishnavism theology and Radha is Krishna's supreme beloved. With Krishna, Radha is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess, for it is said that she controls Krishna with Her love. It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha "enchants even Him. Therefore She is the supreme goddess of all. Radha Krishna".
While there are much earlier references to the worship of this form of God, it is since Jayadeva Goswami wrote a famous poem "Gita Govinda" in the twelfth century of the Common Era, that the topic of the spiritual love affair between the divine Krishna and his devotee Radha, became a theme celebrated throughout India. It is believed that Krishna has left the "circle" of the rasa dance to search for Radha. The Chaitanya school believes that the name and identity of Radha are both revealed and concealed in the verse describing this incident in Bhagavata Purana. It is also believed that Radha is not just one cowherd maiden, but is the origin of all the gopis, or divine personalities that participate in the rasa dance.
Name.
RadhaKrishna "cannot be broken into two" – Krishna (Devanagari:कृष्ण), the eighth incarnation (Avatar) of Vishnu., and his shakti Radha (Devanagari: राधा)such was the love of Radha towards Krishna that they became one. Krishna in Vrindavana is sometimes depicted with Radha standing on his left, on whose bosom sits Lakshmi.
Shakti and Shaktiman.
The common derivation of "shakti" and "shaktiman", i.e. Female and male principle in a god implies that shakti and shaktiman are the same. Each and every god has its partner, 'betterhalf' or Shakti and without this Shakti, is sometimes viewed being without essential power. It is a not uncommon feature of Hinduism when worship of a pair rather than one personality constitutes worship of God, such is worship of Radha Krishna. Traditions worshiping Krishna, as "svayam bhagavan", who is male, include reference and veneration to his Radha, who is worshiped as supreme. It's an accepted view that union of Radha and Krishna may indicate the union of Shakti with the Shaktiman, and this view exists well outside of orthodox Vaishnavism or Krishnaism. The Radha Krishna Ashta Shakthi Mandir at the Parashakthi Temple in Pontiac, Michigan, USA depicts this principle with Shri Radha Rani symbolizing Ashta (Eight) Shakthis of Shaktiman Lord Shri Krishna.
Philosophy.
From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy ("shakti") implies a divine source of energy, God or "shaktiman". "Sita relates to Rama; Lakshmi belongs to Narayana; Radha has Her Krishna." As Krishna is believed to be the source of all manifestations of God, "Shri Radha, His consort, is the original source of all "shaktis"" or feminine manifestation of divine energy.
A number of interpretations according to traditions possess a common root of personalism in the understanding of worship. Specifically Caitanyaite Gaudiya Vaishnava doctrine and mission is fiercely "personalistic," proclaiming the supremacy of Krishna, the identification of Caitanya as Radha-Krishna, the reality and eternality of individual selves, and a method for approaching the absolute reality and the Deity as a person first and foremost.
Jiva Goswami in his "Priti Sandarbha" states that each of the Gopis exhibits a different level of intensity of passion, among which Radha's is the greatest.
In his famous dialogs Ramananda Raya describes Radha to Caitanya and quotes, among other texts, a verse from Chaitanya Charitamrta 2.8.100, before he goes on to describe her role in the pastimes of Vrindavana.
The central pivot point of the theology is related to the word rasa. The theological use of the word can be found very early, about two thousand years before the Nimbarka or Caitanya school, in a phrase that the tradition frequently quotes: "Truly, the Lord is "rasa"" ("raso vai sah") of Brahma sutras. This statement expresses the view that God is the one who enjoys the ultimate rasa or spiritual rapture, emotions.
Traditions.
Radha Krishna are worshiped in the following traditions of Hinduism:
Bisnupriya Manipuri Vaishnavas.
King Gareeb Nivaz ruled from 1709 to 1748 and was initiated into Vaishnavism of the Chaitanya tradition, which worships Krishna as the supreme deity, "Svayam bhagavan". He practiced this religion for nearly twenty years. Preachers and pilgrims used to arrive in large numbers and cultural contact with Assam was maintained.
The Manipuri Vaishnavas do not worship Krishna alone, but Radha-Krishna. With the spread of Vaishnavism the worship of Krishna and Radha became the dominant form in the Manipur region. Every village there has a Thakur-ghat and a temple. Rasa and other dances are a feature of the regional folk and religious tradition and often, for example, a female dancer will portray both Krishna and his consort, Radha, in the same piece.
Bhagavata.
In Vedic and Puranic literature, Radhas and other forms of the root ">rAdh" have meaning of ‘perfection’, ‘success’ and even ‘wealth’. Lord of Success, Indra was referred to as "Radhaspati". In references to Mahavishnu as the Lord of Fortune and freely used by Jayadeva as "Jaya Jayadeva Hare" – the victorious Hari, and ‘"Radhaspati"’ all found in many places. The word Radha occurs in the Atharva Veda, Taittiriya BrAhmana and Taittiriya Samhita.
Charlotte Vaudeville, in the article "Evolution of Love Symbolism in Bhagavatism" draws some parallel to Nappinnai, appearing in Godha’s magnum opus Thiruppavai and in Nammalwar’s references to Nappinnani, the daughter-in-law of Nandagopa. Nappinnai is believed to be the source of Radha’s conception in Prakrit and Sanskrit literature although their characteristic relations with Krishna are different. In the ritual dance called Kuravai, Krishna dances with his wife Nappinnai.
"It is a complex relationship, for the devotee is the ‘same as and yet different from’ the Lord, and so even in the joy of union there is the pain of separation. Indeed, the highest form of devotion, according to Yamunacarya, comes not in union but after the union, in the ‘fear of new separation’."
Yasastilaka Champukavya (AD 959) all make references to Radha and Krishna well before Jayadeva's period. There are elaborate references to Radha in Brahma vaivarta and Padma Puranas.
Gaudiya Vaishnava.
Gaudiya Vaishnava, as the name suggests, usually refers to the region of Bengal. Early Bengali literature gives a vivid description of the depiction and evolution of understanding of Radha and Krishna. It is believed, however, that the source of Jayadeva Goswamis heroine in his poem Gita Govinda remains a puzzle of the Sanskrit Literature. At the same time there are well documented references to works earlier than Gita Govinda, which some count to be more than twenty. The figure of Radha is one of the most elusive in the literature of Sanskrit; she is described only in a few selected passages of Prakrit or Sanskrit poetry, a few inscriptions and a few works on grammar, poetry and drama. Jayadeva has referred to them and created an exquisite lyrical poem of passionate devotion in the twelfth century, and from this poetic beginning a huge movement specific to Bengal began.
Baru Chandidas is a poet notable for being a prominent Early Middle Bengal historical figure; the date of his poem "Srikrsnakirtana" is still under question however the text remains one of the most important evidences of early portrayal of the popular story of "Lord Krishna's love for the cowherd girl Radha" in Bengali literature and religion. The 412 songs of "Srikrsnakirtana" are divided into thirteen sections that represent the core of the Radha-Krishna legendary cycle,
with many variants providing excellent comparative material. The manuscript clearly suggests that the songs were meant to be song, and implies particular "ragas" for the recitation. There is considerable debate as to the authenticity of the text that has significant religious meaning.
In this Bengali tradition of Caitanya Vaishnavism metaphysical status and Radha-worship is considered to be established by Krsnadasa in his Chaitanya Charitamrta where he represents the doctrine that prevailed among the Vrindavan Caitanyaites following Caitanya's demise in 1533. It is believed that Krishna, desiring to experience fully what it is like to love Krishna as Radha does, has appeared as Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And what Radha (appearing as Caitanya) does in her longing for Krishna is to chant his names.
One of the self manifested Deities established by Gopala Bhatta Goswami is called Radha Ramana, it is not surprising that Radha Ramana is seen as not only Krishna but also as Radha-Krishna. And worship in his temple, located in the centre of Vrindavana is a perpetual daily affair, involving several prescribed events throughout the day, with the goal of being theoretical and remote, but with aspiration of the possibility to attend and associate directly with Radha and Krishna.
Nimbarka sampradaya.
The Nimbarka sampradaya worship of the youthful Krishna, alone or with his consort Radha, is one of the earliest dating at least to the 12th century, just as Rudra Sampradaya does. According to Nimbarka, Radha was the eternal consort of Vishnu-Krishna and there is also a suggestion, though not a clear statement, that she became the wife of her beloved Krishna. It should be noted that Nimbarka rescues Radha from the presumed immoral implication of much of the literature, and gives to her a dignity unattained elsewhere.
The Nimbarka Sampradaya founded by Nimbarka is one of the four bonafide Vaishnava traditions. Lack of evidence due to the destruction of Mathura and Vrindavan in the 13th Century and 14th Century has meant that the true dates and origins of this tradition are shrouded in mystery and await investigation.
Nimbarka, who is widely held by scholars such as Satyanand Joseph, Prof. Rasik Bihari Joshi, Prof. M. M. Aggrawal etc., to be at least of the same time or before the appearance of Shankaracharya, was the first acharya to worship Radha along with Krishna in Sakhi Bhava Upasana method of worship. In his Vedanta Kamadhenu Dashashloki, it is clearly stated that:-
"ange tu vaame vrishabhaanujaam mudaa viraajamaanaam anuruupasaubhagaam.
sakhiisahasraih parisevitaam sadaa smarema deviim sakalestakaamadaam." verse 6.
The left portion of the body of the Supreme Lord is Shrimati Radha, seated blissfully, as beautiful as the Lord Himself; who is served by thousands of gopis: we meditate on the Supreme Goddess, the fulfiller of all desires.
This theme was taken up by Jayadeva Goswami and other poets of the time who saw the inherent beauty and bliss which constitute this philosophy.
In this sampradaya, the significance of Radha is not less than the significance of Sri Krsna. Both are conjointly the object to be worshiped in this school of Nimbarka, who is also one of the first commentators on Brahma Sutras under the name "Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha". The later acharyas of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in the 13th and 14th centuries in Vrindavana composed much literature on the Divine Couple. Swami Sri Sribhatta, the elder god-brother of Jayadeva composed the Yugala Shataka for the Dhrupada style of musical presentation like Jayadeva, however unlike Jayadeva who composed his work in Sanskrit, Swami Shribhatta's compositions are in Vraja Bhasha, a Hindi vernacular which was understood by all inhabitants of Vraja. Indeed the rest of the acharyas of this tradition wrote in Vraja Bhasha and due to the lack of prevalence of this language in modern times, very little research has been done, even though these Acharyas predate the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan by centuries.
In any case, the sole object of worship in the Nimbarka Sampradaya is the unified Divine Couple of Shri Radha Krishna. According to the 15th century Mahavani written by Jagadguru Swami Sri Harivyasa Devacharya
"radhaamkrsnasvaroopaam vai, krishnam raadhaasvarupinam; kalaatmaanam nikunjastham gururoopam sadaa bhaje"
I ceaselessly praise Radha who is none other than Krishna, and Sri Krishna who is none other than Radha, whose unity is represented by the Kaamabeeja and who are forever resident in Nikunja Goloka Vrndavana.
The contribution from the Nimbarka Sampradaya to the philosophy of Radha Krishna is undeniable, as the philosophy and theology originate in it.
Swaminarayan Sampraday.
Radha-Krishna Dev has a special place in the Swaminarayan Sampraday as Swaminarayan himself referred to Radha Krishna in the Shikshapatri he wrote. Further, he himself ordered the construction of temples in which Radha Krishna have been installed as deities. Swaminarayan "explained that Krishna appears in many forms. When he is together with Radha, he is regarded as supreme lord under the name of Radha-Krishna; with Rukmini he is known as Lakshmi-Narayana." The first temple constructed in the sect, built in Ahmedabad in AD 1822, houses the images of Nara Narayana, forms of Arjuna and Krishna, in the central shrine. The shrine on the left of the hall has murtis of Radha Krishna. According to the philosophy of the tradition there were many female companions of Krishna, gopis, but out of all of them Radha was considered to be the perfect devotee. Those who wish to come close to Krishna must cultivate the devotional qualities of Radha. According to theory the sect has set aside Goloka as the supreme heaven or abode (in fact, in some of their temples, such as the Mumbai Temple, the murtis installed are those of Shri Gaulokvihari and Radhikaji), because there Krishna is supposed to be enjoying himself with his Gopis, who according to the Swaminarayana sampradaya the milkmaids with whom Krishna danced; his relations with them symbolize the relation of God with the devotee in reciprocation.
Vallabha sampradaya.
Vallabhacharya, founder of Pustimarga even before Chaitanya, worshipped Radha, where according to some sects, the devotees identify mainly with the female companion ("sakhis") of Radha who are privileged to arrange intimate pastimes for RadhaKrishna.
One of the prominent poets of this tradition, which also called Radhavallabhi, named Dhruvadasa was notable for being principally concerned with the private relationships of Radha and Krishna. In his poetry "Caurasi Pad" and in the commentaries of his followers, the concentration is in meditation on the unique benefits of constant reflection on the eternal lila.
Radhavallabhis share with their Vaishnava co-religionists a great regard for Bhagavata Purana, but some of the pastimes that are outside the scope of relationships with Radha and gopis do not feature in the concept of this school. Emphasis is placed on the sweetness of the relationship, or rasa.
Outside Hinduism.
In opinion of some Hindu scholars as well as scholars of Hinduism, a golden age existed when Muslims and Hindus created a common culture mainly because some Muslim rulers patronized Sanskrit and translations from Sanskrit into Persian, while there were poets with Muslim names who wrote about Krishna and Radha.
Temples.
Temples of Sri Sri Radha Krsna are prevalent throughout India and the world though Braja Mandala including Vrindavan and Mathura are considered to be the centers of Radha-Krishna worship. The most important temples of Vrindavana are
Prem Mandir Vrindavan, Madan-mohan, Govindadev, Radha-Raman, Radha-Gokulananda, Radha-Damodar, Banki-behari, Jugal Kishor, Radha-Gopinath, Radha Shyamasundar, and Iskcon temple.
Shree RadhaVallabh Temple Vrindavan
Shree Radha Ras Bihari Ashta Sakhi Mandir
"Outside India
There are number of traditions that spread the worship of Radha-Krishna in many countries, be it associated with migration or preaching activities of sadhus.
One such prominent adept, Prabhupada opened a number of centers himself wherein he could train mleccha-turned-brahmin students to worship Radha-Krishna murtis and become "devoted to the service of Godhead".
Popular songs and prayers.
The "Shri Radhika Krishnastaka" (also called the Radhashtak) is a hymn. It is said that the reciter can get to Krishna via Radha by chanting it.

Belgrade Theatre

The Belgrade Theatre is a live performance venue seating 858 and situated in Coventry, England. It was the first civic theatre to be built after the Second World War in Britain and as such was more than a place of entertainment. It joined the new Coventry Cathedral as a symbol of optimism and culture in one of the largest re-development projects then undertaken, to rebuild the city of Coventry, which had been almost totally destroyed by bombing. The building is now a grade II listed building. In 1963 the Belgrade was registered as a charity by the Charity Commission (number 219163). 
The Belgrade acquired its name in recognition and thanks for a gift of timber from the Serbian capital city of Belgrade (Coventry's official sister city), that was used extensively in the construction of the auditorium. Since opening in 1958, the theatre has established itself as a centre for the new and innovative productions.
Having pioneered the Theatre-in-Education movement in the 1960s the theatre continues to work with disadvantaged young people and uses drama as a tool to develop personal and social skills. Their most successful programme "Acting Out" has been commissioned by Coventry's LEA for the last 10 years and has been replicated across the UK. One graduate of the course credits "Acting Out" with saving her life.
The theatre reopened in September 2007 after undergoing a £12m refurbishment with a 7-story extension to provide a second auditorium.
Prince Edward officially opened the refurbishment of the Belgrade's B2 studio on 5 February 2008, this also marked the 50th anniversary of the Belgrade's opening performed by Princess Alexandra.

Kyra Schon

Kyra Schon (born October 4, 1957) is an American actress known for her role in the George A. Romero film "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) as Karen Cooper, the trowel-wielding zombie girl. She is a regular contributor to "Dread Central", an online magazine dedicated to horror entertainment. She is the daughter of Karl Hardman who played her character's father in the movie.
Night of the Living Dead.
In 1968 she was cast as Karen Cooper, the daughter of the bickering couple Helen and Harry Cooper in "Night of the Living Dead". She was depicted as mostly unconscious and only spoke two words of dialogue ("I hurt"). Kyra is the daughter of Karl Hardman, an investor and actor in the film, and was selected to play Karen Cooper because of the film's tight budget. In the film, off-screen, Karen was bitten by a ghoul. Her character later dies and reanimates, feasting on her dead father's arm and stabbing her mother to death with a cement trowel.
Pop culture impact.
Kyra's image as the living dead child is one of the most recognizable zombies in film history, and a close up still photograph of Kyra Schon as Karen Cooper appears on many video releases, as well as on various merchandise. "Entertainment Weekly" chose Schon as "Best Zombie" in the magazine's Halloween 2005 edition. In Entertainment Weekly Issue #737, author Stephen King, as part of his occasional essay series 'The Pop of King', described the scene in the farmhouse basement whereby Karen attacks her mother with the trowel as follows: ..."I still remember the pure horror I felt the first time I saw the little girl stabbing her mother to death with a garden (sic) trowel." "I've never in my life been more frightened in a movie theater".

Subclade

In genetics, a subclade is a subgroup of a haplogroup. Subclades are often referred to in genealogical DNA tests of human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups, where they represent subbranches of major branches on the human family tree.
Naming convention.
Although human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and subclades are named in a similar manner, their names belong to completely separate systems.
mtDNA.
mtDNA haplogroups are defined by the presence of a series of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the hypervariable regions and the coding region of mitochondrial DNA. They are named with the capital letters A through Z, with further subclades named using numbers and lower case letters. 
Y-DNA.
Y-DNA haplogroups are defined by the presence of a series of SNP markers on the Y chromosome. Subclades are defined by a "terminal SNP", the SNP furthest down in the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree. The Y Chromosome Consortium (YCC) developed a system of naming major human Y-DNA haplogroups with the capital letters A through T, with further subclades named using numbers and lower case letters (YCC longhand nomenclature). YCC shorthand nomenclature names Y-DNA haplogroups and their subclades with the first letter of the major Y-DNA haplogroup followed by a dash and the name of the defining terminal SNP. Y-DNA haplogroup nomenclature is changing over time to accommodate the increasing number of SNPs being discovered and tested, and the resulting expansion of the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree. This change in nomenclature has resulted in inconsistent nomenclature being used in different sources. This inconsistency, and increasingly cumbersome longhand nomenclature, has prompted a move towards using the simpler shorthand nomenclature.

Johan Ferrier

Johan Henri Eliza Ferrier (May 12, 1910 – January 4, 2010) was a Surinamese politician who served as the 1st President of Suriname from November 25, 1975, until August 13, 1980. He was that country's last governor before independence, from 1968 to 1975, and first president after it gained independence from the Netherlands. He was deposed in a military coup on 13 August 1980.
He was named the twentieth century's most important politician in Suriname in 1999.
Biography.
Early life.
Ferrier was born in 1910 at Suriname's largest city and its capital, Paramaribo. A teacher by trade outside political life, he assisted in the establishment of the country's National Party in 1946, at a time when it was a colony of the Dutch.
Scouting.
Ferrier was co-founder of the "Boy Scouts van Suriname" and its first Chief Scout. At age 16 he was a teacher in the district Saramacca and founded his first Scout Group. This group still exists and now bears the name ""De Johan Ferrier groep, de groep 2 Oranje Dassers"".
Politics.
Ferrier was a member of the National Council until 1948. He then went to Amsterdam in the Netherlands to learn education theory. When he went back to Suriname, which had by then become an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, he continued to study and to have a career in education. He served as both prime minister and interior minister for a three-year period from 1955 until 1958. He also spent time as Suriname's head of education. From 1968 until 1975 he retained the post of governor. At this stage Suriname was made independent. Ferrier was selected as President of the country. Dési Bouterse's 1980 coup d'état prompted Ferrier to resign within six months.
After politics.
Ferrier then accompanied his relations to live in the Netherlands. He lived with them in Oegstgeest. His daughter, Kathleen Ferrier, is a former member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for the Christian Democratic Appeal. In 2005, Ferrier's memoirs "Last Governor, First President: The Century of Johan Ferrier, Surinamese" were published. The Dutch Queen gave him a knighthood. An obituary in national morning daily "De Volkskrant" said he had claimed: "Even in the darkest days, I kept my optimism".
Death.
Ferrier died from heart failure while sleeping in his Dutch home at the age of 99, four months short of his 100th birthday. His body was found early morning on January 4, 2010.
Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands paid tribute. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Ferrier was "an authoritative and wise statesman". Politician and diplomat Jan Pronk paid tribute to his work at uniting divisions.
Ferrier was buried on January 11, 2010, in the Dutch town of Oegstgeest, where he had been living since 1980.
Johan Ferrier Fund.
On 12 May 2010, the day Johan Ferrier would have celebrated his 100th birthday, the Johan Ferrier Fund was officially launched. The Fund strives to follow in his footsteps in supporting Surinamese projects with educational and cultural goals. The Johan Ferrier Fund is an initiative of his daughter Joan Ferrier who first presented the fund in the presence of her father in September 2009.

Coastal plain cooter

The Coastal plain cooter ("Pseudemys concinna floridana") or Florida cooter is a species of large herbivorous freshwater turtle in the genus "Pseudemys".
The species is found within the southeastern coastal plain of the United States, from extreme southeastern Virginia southward through all of Florida and westward to the vicinity of Mobile Bay, Alabama. The nominate race ("P. f. floridana") occupies most of the species' geographic range but is replaced in the Florida peninsula by the peninsula cooter ("Pseudemys peninsularis"), which is primarily distinguished by differences in head markings. Both races can be distinguished from sympatric "Pseudemys" species by the immaculate yellow color of their plastrons and the lack of a U-shaped cusp in the upper jaw (characteristic of the Florida Redbelly Turtle). The carpace length of the size ranges from typically and the normal weigh is (in the slightly larger females) . The record sized female measured in carapace length.
The cooter is mainly herbivorous and inhabits lakes, sloughs, ponds, slow-flowing streams, and other still bodies of water with soft bottoms and abundant aquatic vegetation. However, it can be found in high densities in some Florida spring runs, usually in heavily vegetated areas with little flow. This species is active year-round and spends a large portion of the day basking on logs.
Coastal cooters are frequently exported for consumption and the pet trade, with about 60% wild caught individuals and 40% captive bred. Recent protection by many southeastern states has curbed this exploitation but illegal harvest for local consumption may still threaten some populations.

Laid Saidi

Laid Saidi is an Algerian who has claimed that he was imprisoned, for several years, in a CIA black site in Afghanistan called "the salt pit".
Saidi claims to have spent months in the dark prison prior to his detention in the salt pit.
He was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word "tayrat", meaning "tires" in colloquial Arabic, was mistaken for a similarly sounding word (with a slightly different "T" sound) meaning "airplanes."
Saidi worked for Al-Haramain Foundation, a Saudi charity organization. He was arrested in Tanzania in July 2003 and rendered to Afghanistan via Malawi, where he was "handed over to Malawian authorities in plainclothes who were accompanied by two middle-aged Caucasian men wearing jeans and t-shirts."
Saidi said that scars on his wrists were from being suspended from the ceiling by his hands. American officials assert that they stopped using this form of torture after it led to the deaths of two Afghans, Habibullah and Dilawar in Bagram, in December 2002. Saidi described months of confusing interrogations, during which his interrogators kept insisting that he had spoken cryptically of planes during a telephone conversation. When the tape the Americans had made of this conversation was finally played for him, Saidi described being surprised to realize all these questions and torture were due to a simple misunderstanding, that could have easily been dealt with, without months of torture.

<doc id="5875550" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875550" title="Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)">
Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)

Admiral Sir Thomas Foley GCB (1757 – 9 January 1833) was a Royal Navy officer and "Hero of the Battle of the Nile".
Naval career.
He was the second son of landowner John Foley of Ridgeway, the Foley family's ancestral estate in the parish of Llawhaden near Narberth, Pembrokeshire, and the nephew of Captain Thomas Foley, who accompanied George Anson, 1st Baron Anson on his voyage around the world.
He entered the Royal Navy in 1770, and, during his time as midshipman, saw a good deal of active service in the West Indies against American privateers. Promoted lieutenant in 1778, he served under Admiral Keppel (afterwards Viscount) and Sir Charles Hardy in the Channel, and with Rodney's squadron was present at the defeat of De Langara off Cape St Vincent in 1780, and at the relief of Gibraltar. Still under Rodney's command, he went out to the West Indies, and took his part in the operations which culminated in the victory of 12 April 1782.
In the French Revolutionary War he was engaged from the first. As flag-captain to Admiral John Gell, and afterwards to Sir Hyde Parker, Foley took part in the siege of Toulon in 1793, the action of Golfe Jouan in 1794, and the two fights off Toulon on the 13th of April and the 13th of July 1795. At St Vincent he was flag-captain to the second in command on "Britannia". After the battle he was transferred to the "Goliath" (74), in which he was sent out in the following year to reinforce Nelson's fleet in the Mediterranean.
The part played by the "Goliath" in the "Battle of the Nile" was brilliant. She led the squadron round the French van, and this manoeuvre contributed not a little to the result of the day. Whether this was done by Foley's own initiative, or intended by Horatio Nelson, has been a matter of controversy (see Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, 1885, p. 916).
His next important service was with Nelson in the Baltic. At the beginning of 1801, Nelson was promoted to Vice Admiral of the Blue and after a few months, he took part as the second in command in the Battle of Copenhagen. The "Elephant" carried Nelson's flag and Foley acted as his chief-of-staff. During the action Nelson's commander, Sir Hyde Parker, who believed that the Danish fire was too strong, signaled for him to break off the action. Nelson ordered that the signal be acknowledged but not repeated. Legend has it that Nelson turned to his flag captain and said:
""You know, Foley, I only have one eye - I have the right to be blind sometimes" and then holding his telescope to his blind eye said "I really do not see the signal!""
Nelson's action was approved in retrospect.
Foley was one of Nelson's "Band of Brothers". Nelson himself was a sea-officer par excellence. Yet there were many who struggled, suffered and were wounded as often as he. This could not help but develop a close relationship among the men. Nelson himself was very aware of the brotherhood which had arisen. In his biography of Nelson, David Howarth makes this clear:
""...Nelson's famous phrase, "I had the happiness to command a band of brothers'...After his first great victory, Nelson called his captains 'my darling children', and none was the least embarrassed by that. Under Jervis, the captains of the Mediterranean fleet were becoming a brotherhood, bonded by skill, experience, mutual respect and a common cause. Maybe they had not thought of it in that way before; but from about this time they all did, and Nelson most of all. And the concept - so suitable to his nature - became an important, conscious element in his conduct of the war.""
An amusing illustration of the affection Nelson inspired in his captains, and of the half maternal care they exercised over the fragile and stunted body of their famous leader, is supplied by a letter from Nelson himself to Ball, written from Kioge Bay in 1801. He was racked with the Baltic cold, and wroth, as was common with him, with the still chillier winds which blew from the Admiralty Board:
""But,"" he says, ""all in the fleet are so truly kind to me that I should be a wretch not to cheer up. Foley has put me under a regimen of milk at four in the morning; Murray has given me lozenges; Hardy is as good as ever, and all have proved their desire to keep my mind easy.""
That picture of one sea veteran administering warm milk to his admiral at four o'clock in the morning is amusing enough; but it shows more effectively than graver things could do the feeling Nelson inspired in his captains.
Ill-health obliged Foley to decline Nelson's offer (made when on the point of starting for the Battle of Trafalgar) of the post of Captain of the Fleet. Therefore it was Foley's fellow "brother" Thomas Hardy who was present at Nelson's death.
From 1808 to 1815, Foley commanded in the Downs from his flagship , and at the peace was made KCB. Sir Thomas Foley rose to be full admiral and GCB. He died while serving as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in 1833.
Marriage.
He was married on 31 Jul 1802 to Lady Lucy Anne FitzGerald (1771–1851). She was the youngest surviving daughter of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster and Lady Emily Lennox. Her mother was the great-granddaughter of Charles II, King of England, Scotland and Ireland and his mistress Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth.
Lucy was the favorite sister of Lord Edward FitzGerald, one of the ill-fated leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and was herself an active participant in the rebellion. She worked as a conduit, clandestinely transmitting letters between the Revolutionary Committee in Dublin and their agents in Paris. A biographer of Lord Edward wrote of Lucy that she “"most closely resembled him (Edward) in her strong sense of the ludicrous and her passionate love for justice."” 
She wrote in 1798 of her hope for Irish liberation in an address to the Irish nation that wasn’t published until many years later:
"Irishmen, Countrymen, it is Edward FitzGerald's sister who addresses you: it is a woman but that woman is his sister: she would therefore die for you as he did...Yes, this is the moment, the precious moment which must either stamp with Infamy, the name of Irishmen and denote you forever wretched, enslaved to the power of England, or raise the Paddies to the consequence which they deserve and which England shall no longer withhold, to happiness, freedom, glory..."
The couple's principal residence was Admiral Foley's country estate, Abermarlais, near Llansadwrn in Carmarthenshire, which he had purchased from Sir Cornwallis Maude, 1st Viscount Hawarden in 1795 with his share of the booty resulting from the capture of a Spanish treasure ship, the "St Jago", in 1793. They also had a house at Manchester Square in London. After Sir Thomas' death the widowed Lady Lucy lived at Arundel in Sussex until 1841 when she moved abroad and settled in the south of France, where she spent the remainder of her life. The Foleys had no children. After Lady Lucy's death in 1851 the Abermarlais estate passed according to the terms of Sir Thomas' will to his great-nephew Henry Foley (1824-1871), a grandson of Sir Thomas' elder brother John Herbert Foley. Henry Foley only inherited the estate because Sir Thomas' preferred heir, Osborne Foley, a captain in the Royal Navy, had died without issue in 1848. Abermarlais Park remained in the family until 1909, when it was sold to the Hunter family. The last known person to live in the house was the reclusive Miss Campbell-Davys, before a fire gutted the house in 1980 leading to its demolition in 1982, a terrible loss for the county on account of its long and fascinating history as well as its architectural significance, the original late-medieval manor house having been demolished in order for Admiral Foley to build his more commodious neoclassical mansion nearby. The site of Abermarlais is now used as a caravan park.

Great Ayton Friends' School

Great Ayton Friends' School (1841–1997) in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, England, was an independent, co-educational, agricultural boarding school, run by the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers).
The school was situated on High Green on an estate of around in a picturesque setting in the shadow of the Cleveland Hills. The River Leven (a tributary of the River Tees), ran through the school grounds and was bridged in several places.
History.
Quakers in County Durham, having concern for children of disowned Friends who were not eligible for Quaker education, were searching for a suitable site to establish an agricultural school on their behalf. Unable to find a site in the preferred area of Bishop Auckland, Durham Friends sought the assistance of Thomas Richardson, a Quaker from Darlington who had come to live in Great Ayton on his retirement in 1830.
In 1841 the school was established "for the maintenance of 36 boys and the same number of girls belonging to or connected with the Society of Friends; others are admitted at a charge representing about the average cost of each child per annum. There was now accommodation for 80 boarders. The course of instruction embraces Latin, French, Euclid, Geometry, Algebra, and various scientific subjects - Agriculture, Chemistry, Physiology, Botany, &c. The girls are trained either for domestic work or a higher sphere of life".
An estate of nearly was purchased for the purposes of the school, and many additions were made to the premises.
Disownment for 'marrying out' ended in 1854, and the school changed with the times, becoming the Friends’ School.
The school gradually attracted greater numbers of pupils until there was no room large enough to contain all of the 300 pupils. In 1968 the Meeting House was enlarged to accommodate the complete student body.
In 1991 the school adopted a more commercial approach. It dropped its named association with the Quakers and adopted the new name 'Ayton School'. It appointed a marketing manager to promote the school’s facilities to the general public, a move that signalled hard times were around the corner.
The closure of the school in 1997 came as a shock and bereavement to the Quakers, the villagers of Great Ayton and the staff and pupils at the school. Dwindling pupil numbers had given the trustees no other option but to close the school at the end of the term. In a letter to parents, chairman Robert Campbell explained that 37 of the school’s 200 pupils had withdrawn from the school recently leaving the school massively short of funds.
The school’s 28 teachers and 22 other staff lost their jobs and the school’s grade II listed building and its estate were put up for sale.
During its 157-year history the school was attended by almost 7,500 pupils and employed 550 staff.

The Friends school estate was sold to Wimpey Homes. Working with English Heritage and The Georgian Society, the company established a development with attempted sympathy to the local style and to the surrounding architecture. Many of the school’s original features have been retained and the local wildlife and landscapes have been carefully managed.
Wimpey built 63 exclusive properties on the grounds. The styles vary from the farmhouse family homes, to cottages and traditional three-story town houses.
In the Richardson School Hall, 21 apartments were sold, ranging in price from £120,000 to £200,000.
The Quakers in Great Ayton set aside part of the meeting house as an 'Old Scholars' room containing many items selected by Old Scholars to be retained as mementoes of the School. The War Memorial plaque from the School dining room is placed there while the memorial benches remain in the meeting room.

Boombal

Boombal (pl. Boombals) is the name given to a relatively recent phenomenon of folk dance parties in Belgium, originating in the French bal folk. The partygoers indulge in pair, ring, line, and string dances such as the waltz, polka, An Dro, etc. adapted from the French bal folk scene. The events are seen as a more social and enjoyable alternative to the individualistic dancing that is often seen in modern clubs. There is a very low barrier of entrance due to the emphasis on having fun rather than meticulously performed and complicated dances.
History.
Boombal originated in Ghent, Belgium when accordion instructor Wim Claeys wanted his students to play to a real dance audience. The first Boombal was organised in September 2000 in an old furniture shop, with about 5 couples participating. This shop was located in the Boomstraat (lit. tree-street), which is how the event got its name. A year later, the Boombal concept had grown immensely and with over 100 participants the event was relocated to the Volkshuis van de Dampoort in Ghent. Soon, another move was necessary to the even bigger intercultural centre 'De Centrale'.
In 2006, Boombal is an established and popular concept in Belgium, organised mostly in and around various student cities. In the Netherlands, similar events are popping up, under the name Folkbal. The idea is slowly gaining popularity in other neighbouring countries as well.
Event.
A Boombal typically consists of two parts:
1. Initiation
In about an hour, an instructor will demonstrate and teach various dances. Popular ones include Schottische, Gigues and Bourrées. The emphasis is on dances that can be performed with two or more people at the time.
2. Party
Professional folk musicians play live music to which the various learned dances are performed en masse. There is a lot of interplay between the audience and the musicians. A typical session lasts about two hours.

<doc id="5875569" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875569" title="Saint-Simonianism">
Saint-Simonianism

Saint-Simonianism was a French political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon (1760–1825).
Saint-Simon has been "variously portrayed as a utopian socialist, the founder of sociology and a prescient madman". His ideas, expressed largely through a succession of journals such as "l'Industrie" (1816), "La politique" (1818) and "L'Organisateur" (1819–20) centered on a perception that growth in industrialization and scientific discovery would have profound changes on society. He believed, nonetheless, that society would restructure itself by abandoning traditional ideas of temporal and spiritual power, an evolution that would lead, inevitably, to a productive society based on, and benefiting from, a " ... union of men engaged in useful work", the basis of "true equality". These ideas influenced Auguste Comte (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), Heinrich Heine, Thomas Carlyle, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, the Péreire brothers and many other thinkers and social theorists.
Saint-Simon's writings.
Saint-Simon's earliest publications, such as his "Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIXe siècle (Introduction to scientific discoveries of the 19th century)" (1803) and his "Mémoire sur la science de l'homme (Notes on the study of man)" (1813), (the latter of which is a eulogy to Napoleon), demonstrate his faith in science as a means to regenerate society. In his 1814 essay "De la réorganisation de la société européenne (On the reorganisation of European society)", written in collaboration with his then secretary Augustin Thierry, Saint-Simon seems to have foreseen the European Union, expecting however that England would take the lead in forming a continent sharing the same laws and institutions.
For his last decade Saint-Simon concentrated on themes of political economy. Together with Auguste Comte, (then only a teenager), Saint-Simon projected a society bypassing the changes of the French Revolution, in which science and industry would take the moral and temporal power of medieval theocracy.
In his last work however, "Le Nouveau Christianisme (The New Christianity)" (1825), Saint-Simon reverted to more traditional ideas of renewing society through Christian brotherly love. He died shortly after its publication.
The arts.
In his last years and in the period after his death, Saint-Simon's ideas, which gave prominence to art as a prized aspect of work, interested numerous artists and musicians, amongst them Hector Berlioz, Félicien David (who wrote a number of hymns for the movement) and Franz Liszt. For a brief period, the historian and writer Léon Halévy acted as secretary to the philosopher.
The movement after Saint-Simon's death.
Following Saint-Simon's death, his followers began to differ as to how to promulgate his ideas. A 'charismatic' faction, led by Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin purchased the newspaper "Le Globe" as their official organ, and formed an increasingly religiously-minded ritualistic group based on a community founded at Ménilmontant, before being banned by the authorities in 1832. Following this some of Enfantin's followers visited North Africa or the Middle East in search of Messianic revelations, and the formal Saint-Simonian movement expired.
However, others who had been associated with the group and were not so followers of Enfantin, (such as Olinde Rodrigues and Gustave d'Eichthal) developed Saint-Simonian notions practically and involved themselves in the development of the French economy, founding a number of leading concerns including the Suez Canal Company and the bank Crédit Mobilier.

Atlas Model Railroad

Atlas Model Railroad Company, Inc. makes scale models in N scale, HO scale, and O scale. The company is based in Hillside, New Jersey, United States. They produce a wide variety of locomotives, rolling stock, and vehicles. Atlas is well known for their flex track and codes 55, 80, 83 and 100 track. Atlas also makes compatible structures and bridges.
History.
In 1924 Stephan Schaffan, Sr. founded the Atlas Tool Company in Newark, New Jersey. In 1933 his son, Stephan Schaffan, Jr., came to work for his father at the age of sixteen. Steve Jr. built model airplanes as a hobby and frequented a local hobby shop. Being an enterprising young man, he would often ask the owner if there was anything he could do to earn some extra spending money. Tired of listening to his requests, the hobby-store owner threw some model railroad track parts his way and said, "Here, see if you can improve on this".
In those days, railroad modelers had to assemble and build everything from scratch. Steve Jr. created a "switch kit" which sold so well, that the entire family worked on them in the basement at night, while doing business as usual in the machine shop during the day.
Subsequently, Steve Jr. engineered the stapling of rail to fiber track, along with inventing the first practical rail joiner and pre-assembled turnouts and flexible track. All of these products, and more, helped to popularize model railroading and assisted in the creation of a mass-market hobby. The budding entrepreneur quickly outgrew the limitations of a basement and small garage operation. Realizing they could actually make a living selling track and related products, Steve and his father had the first factory built in Hillside, New Jersey at 413 Florence Avenue in 1947. On September 30, 1949, Atlas Model Railroad Company, Inc. was officially incorporated as a New Jersey company.

Paragroup

Paragroup is a term used in population genetics to describe lineages within a haplogroup that are not defined by any additional unique markers. In human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups, paragroups are typically represented by an asterisk (*) placed after the main haplogroup. The term "paragroup" is a portmanteau of the terms paraphyletic haplogroup indicating that paragroups form paraphyletic subclades. Apart from the mutations that define the parent haplogroup, paragroups may not possess any additional unique markers. Alternatively pargroups may possess unique markers that have not been discovered. If a unique marker is discovered within a paragroup, the specific lineage is given a unique name and is moved out of the paragroup to form an independent subclade.
An example of a paragroup is Haplogroup DE*. It has the marker that defines Haplogroup DE, but not the markers that define Haplogroup DE's most common subclades, haplogroup D-M174 and haplogroup E. An example of a lineage within a paragroup that was assigned a new name is haplogroup E1b1b1g. This haplogroup was previously part of haplgroup E1b1b1* (also known as e3b* or E-M35*) until the marker M293 was discovered in 2008.
Another example is a member of the Y-DNA haplogroup R (defined by marker M207) may belong to the sub-haplogroup R1 (defined by marker M173) or R2 (defined by marker M124). Individuals with neither of these mutations would be categorised as belonging to group R*.

Alabama-Florida League

The Alabama–Florida League was a low-level circuit in American minor league baseball that existed from 1936 through 1939 and 1951 through 1962. In 1940–1941 and from 1946–1950, the absence of clubs based in Florida caused the league to change its name to the Alabama State League.
The Class D loop's longest-serving members included clubs in Andalusia, Brewton, Dothan, Enterprise, Greenville, Ozark and Troy, all in Alabama, and the Florida cities of Fort Walton Beach, Graceville and Panama City.
Montgomery, Alabama, the largest city to be represented in the league, was a member for six seasons (1957–1962).
In , the league's final year, the Pensacola "Senators," a Washington farm club managed by Wayne Terwilliger, won the pennant by 22 games and led the league in attendance. It was the only Alabama–Florida League team to post a winning record.

Trewartha

Trewartha and Andrewartha is a Cornish family name (and placename, Dexter).
According to the "Handbook of Cornish Names" by G Pawsley White, "Trewartha" is a Cornish name meaning "Upper Farm" or "Upper Homestead".
"CORNISH NAMES" by Dr T. F. G. Dexter : Royal Institution of Cornwall : pub 1926 Longmans Green : reprinted 1968 Bradford Barton : says on p15 - 
Nouns: "tre" a "town", feminine, (maybe a hamlet or house, also Brythonic Celt Welsh "tref", about 4-500AD). Adjectives: "Wartha" : "upper" (maybe higher or greater or on a hill) cf. "Wollas" : "lower" ( maybe smaller or lesser or in a valley, of the two). 
"Trewartha" page 25. "Andrewartha" page 60. 
Definite Article: "An", (Brythonic Celt Cornish language)p18, is used as : of the, in the, on the, at the, in place names. 8.2009
"Tre" = Above, Upper (x) - - "Wartha" = Farm, Homestead (x)
As "An" is Cornish for The, and "Dre" is mutated from the Cornish "Tre" "Andrewartha" means "The Upper Farm" or "The Upper Homestead" and it is generally accepted that both names have the same meaning.

<doc id="5875628" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875628" title="Marcescence">
Marcescence

Marcescence is the retention of dead plant organs that normally are shed. It is most obvious in deciduous trees that retain leaves through the winter. Several trees normally have marcescent leaves such as oak ("Quercus)", beech ("Fagus") and hornbeam ("Carpinus"), or marcescent stipules as in some but not all species of "Salix" (willows). Marcescent leaves of pin oak ("Quercus palustris") complete development of their abscission layer in the spring. The base of the petiole remains alive over the winter. Many other trees may have marcescent leaves in seasons where an early freeze kills the leaves before the abscission layer develops or completes development. Diseases or pests can also kill leaves before they can develop an abscission layer.
The term "marcescent" is also used in mycology to describe a mushroom which (unlike most species, described as "putrescent") can dry out, but later revive and continue to disperse spores. Genus "Marasmius" is well known for this feature, which was considered taxonomically important by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1838 classification of the fungi.
Benefits.
One possible advantage of marcescent leaves is that they may deter feeding of large herbivores, such as deer and moose, which normally eat the twigs and their nutritious buds. Dead, dry leaves make the twigs less nutritious and less palatable.
Marcescent leaves may protect some species from water stress or temperature stress. For example, in tropical alpine environments a wide variety of plants in different plant families and different parts of the world have evolved a growth form known as the "caulescent rosette", characterized by evergreen rosettes growing above marcescent leaves. Examples of plants for which the marcescent leaves have been confirmed to improve survival, help water balance, or protect the plant from cold injury are "Espeletia schultzii" and "Espeletia timotensis", both from the Andes.

Louisiana State Police

The Louisiana State Police is the state police department of Louisiana, which has jurisdiction anywhere in the state, headquartered in Baton Rouge. It was created to protect the lives, property and constitutional rights of people in Louisiana. It falls under the authority of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections. It is officially known in that organization as the Office of State Police. The badge worn by its troopers is very distinctive in that it is shaped like the state of Louisiana. The Louisiana State Police is a premier law enforcement agency in Louisiana and was accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) from 2003 to 2008. The agency voluntarily ceased its association with CALEA in 2008.
History.
The organization began in 1922 as the Louisiana Highway Commission with 16 Highway Inspectors covering approximately of roadway. These inspectors patrolled exclusively by motorcycles. These motorcycles were personally owned by the individual patrolmen, and maintained by an allowance from the state. Of the 16 men on the force, one was a captain. This captain served as superintendent of the force. The highway commission was divided into ten districts. The Baton Rouge District had two patrol officers, while the New Orleans District had three patrolmen. The other eight districts had one patrol officer each. The other two officers patrolled statewide on the main highways of the state. In 1928 the agency was known as the Law Enforcement Division of the Highway Commission, and employed 70 uniformed officers. The Bureau of Criminal Investigation was also formed about that time. In 1932, the organization's name was changed to the State Highway Patrol, and it was given the authority to carry firearms. The agency was used by Governor Huey Long as his personal bodyguards, who escorted him all over the state. In 1936, the two divisions of law enforcement were combined, by an act of the Louisiana Legislature, to form the Louisiana Department of State Police. The department's force of patrolmen numbered over 40 at that time, and the primary patrol vehicle was the motorcycle. In 1939, the State Police was divided into eight "troops". Troopers in cars and motorcycles were patrolling nearly 2 million miles per year throughout the state. The agency's fleet of patrol motorcycles eventually grew to 64 motorcycles. In 1942 the Louisiana Legislature abolished the Department of State Police and made it a division of the newly created Department of Public Safety. The state police accepted new responsibilities in 1946, when the state's Drivers License Law was enacted requiring every driver to hold a license for operating a motor vehicle. Prior to this time, only the operators of commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses were required to be licensed in Louisiana. In 1948, the number of motorcycles operated by the agency had fallen to 36 motorcycles. The department was relying more heavily on automobiles for patrol purposes, and eventually patrol motorcycles were only found in New Orleans and other major cities. Motorcycle patrol units were used throughout the 1950s, with Governor Earl Long also using them as bodyguards. In the 1960s, the department was utilizing motorcycles, automobiles, airplanes, and helicopters for enforcement purposes. The department had exclusively used Harley-Davidson motorcycles until the 1980s when it switched to Kawasaki motorcycles. A short time after this switch, the motorcycle patrol program was disbanded. In 1997, patrol motorcycles were brought back on the force. The agency continued to make advancements with the current number of troopers employed by the department listed as 1,022.
Patrol areas.
The department is divided into nine troops, with its headquarters in Baton Rouge. The troops are divided as follows:
Disbanded troops.
The following troops are no longer in existence:
Weapons.
The current standard issue firearm for LSP Troopers is the Glock 22 in caliber .40 S&W. Previously, the standard issue sidearm was the SIG Sauer P220 semi-automatic pistol in caliber .45 ACP. Other optional handguns are also authorized for carry on-duty. Each trooper is also issued a Remington 870 Police 12 gauge shotgun. Some police cars are also equipped with a Colt AR-15 A2 in .223, a Ruger Mini-14 in .223, or an H&K MP-5 in 9mm. The troopers in this agency have been issued batons and pepper spray for quite some time. Tasers have also been introduced, and have been in service since 2005.
Patrol cars.
The current primary Louisiana State Police patrol vehicle is the Chevrolet Tahoe. The agency began a conversion to the Tahoe in 2012. Previously, the agency used the Ford Crown Victoria "Police Interceptor." This vehicle was the main patrol vehicle used by the agency since 1997, when it replaced the Chevrolet Caprice. The vehicle's markings include "State Trooper" written on each front quarter panel, a state badge on the center of each front door, the words "Louisiana State Police" written above and below the door badge, and the words "State Police" written on the trunk. Note that the markings on the Tahoe include a slight variation to the previously used designs. In 2012 the coloring on the door badge has been redesigned. It changed from a light blue to a darker blue, with a state seal done differently as well. It is completely different from the prior one used since 1964 except in dimension. The red "LSP" lettering also now has a small dark blue border around each letter. An "ACE" insignia, consisting of a blue State of Louisiana with a red lighting bolt, is awarded to troopers who recover five or more stolen vehicles within a year. Since approximately 2001, a majority of the marked patrol vehicles utilized by this agency have been equipped with onboard video cameras. Other 'marked' patrol vehicles currently used include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Chevrolet Impala, the Chevrolet Camaro, the Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Caprice, Ford Taurus, and the Dodge Durango. Several other unmarked vehicles in various makes and models are also used for various non-patrol purposes. Police vehicles currently being tested and considered for use include the Dodge Charger. In August 2010, nearly all marked Chevrolet Impala vehicles in inventory were taken out of service, with only a few still in service.
Special units.
Like many other state police agencies around the United States, the Louisiana State Police has several sub-divisions specializing in addressing particular crimes or security needs. These include a Bomb Squad, an Air Support Unit, a Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT) Team, an Executive Protection detail (for the Louisiana Governor, Lt. Governor, and other dignitaries), a Motor Carrier Safety Enforcement (MCSAP) section, and a Hazardous Materials Response Unit. 
The Criminal Investigations Division includes a Statewide Narcotics Task Force, a Concealed Handgun Permit Section, an Auto Theft Recovery Unit, the Casino Gaming & Licensing Section, a Criminal Intelligence Unit, Identity Theft Investigations, an Insurance Fraud Investigations Section, and a cyber crimes section which specializes in online and computer crimes.
The agency also operates the State Police Crime Laboratory.
The agency previously ran a section called the Anti-Terrorist Assistance Program (ATAP) which was a joint venture with the U.S. State Department. This ATAP section trained foreign police and military forces in detecting, preventing, and fighting of terrorism. 
Fallen officers.
Since its formation in 1922, 25 troopers and one Department of Public Safety officer have been killed in the line of duty. The most common cause of line of duty deaths is automobile crashes.

Independent medical examination

An independent medical examination (IME) occurs when a doctor/physical therapist/chiropractor who has not previously been involved in a person’s care examines an individual. There is no doctor/therapist-patient relationship.
IMEs may be conducted to determine the cause, extent and medical treatment of a work-related or other injury where liability is at issue; whether an individual has reached maximum benefit from treatment; and whether any permanent impairment remains after treatment. An IME may be conducted at the behest of an employer or an insurance carrier to obtain an independent opinion of the clinical status of the individual. Workers' compensation insurance carriers, auto insurance carriers, and self-insured employers have a legal right to this request. Should the doctor/therapist performing the IME conclude that a patient’s medical condition is not related to a compensatable event, the insurer may deny the claim and refuse payment.

Danger (company)

Danger, Inc. was a company specializing in hardware design, software, and services for mobile computing devices. Its most notable product was the T-Mobile Sidekick (also known as Danger Hiptop), which was the first smartphone to capture the attention of pop culture celebrities and teenagers. The Sidekick (hiptop) was a pioneer in client-server ("cloud"-based) smartphones and created the App (Applications) marketplace, later popularized by Android and iOS. Danger was acquired by Microsoft on 11 February 2008, for a price rumored to be around $500 million (USD).
The company was originally started by former Apple Inc., WebTV and Philips employees Andy Rubin, Joe Britt, and Matt Hershenson. Co-founder Andy Rubin left in 2003 to create the company Android, which was later acquired by Google.
After the Microsoft acquisition, the former Danger staff were absorbed into the Mobile Communications Business (MCB) of the Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division, where they worked on a future mobile phone platform known as "Project Pink" which would eventually be released as Kin. Because of poor sales, production was ceased just a few weeks after its release. The Kin development team was folded into the Windows Phone team, and Microsoft stopped promoting the devices.
By October 2009, most of the ex-Danger employees had left Microsoft. Until March 2013, Rubin headed Android development, and brought former Danger Director of Design Matias Duarte to Google.
"The Register" described the Microsoft acquisition as "a classic case of M & A failure, where the acquirer has failed to integrate either the technology or the people from the company that it bought."
October 2009 data loss.
In early October 2009, a server malfunction or technician error at Danger's data centers resulted in the loss of all Sidekick user data. As Sidekicks store users' data on Danger's servers—versus using local storage—users lost contact directories, calendars, photos, and all other media not locally backed up. Local backup could be accomplished through an app ($9.99 USD) which synchronized contacts, calendar, and tasks, but not notes, between the web and a local Windows PC. In an October 10 letter to subscribers, Microsoft expressed its doubt that any data would be recovered.
The customer's data that was lost was, at the time, being hosted in Microsoft's data centers. Some media reports have suggested that Microsoft hired Hitachi to perform an upgrade to its storage area network (SAN), when something went wrong, resulting in data destruction. Microsoft did not have an active backup of the data and it had to be restored from a month-old copy of the server data, totalling 800GB in size, from offsite backup tapes. The entire restoration of data took over 2 months for customer data and full functionality to be restored.
The Danger/Sidekick episode is one in a series of cloud computing mishaps that have raised questions about the reliability of such offerings.

Signalling block system

Signalling block systems enable the safe and efficient operation of railways, so as to avoid collisions between trains. Block systems are used to control trains between stations and yards, and not normally within them. Any block system is defined by its associated physical equipment and by the application of a relevant set of rules. Some systems involve the use of signals, while others do not. Some systems are specifically designed for single track railways, where a danger exists of both head-on and rear-end collision, as opposed to double track, where the main danger is rear-end collision.
A block system is referred to as the "method of working" in the UK, "method of operation" in the U.S, while in Australia they come under the heading of "safeworking". The objective of this article is to describe the various methods of block signalling used around the world.
Block signalling methods.
Strict timetable operation.
Trains operate according to a strict timetable, that is cannot leave a station until an appointed time and until any other trains they were to meet at that station have arrived. Rarely used as a block system, as if one train is delayed, all trains it is scheduled to meet are delayed. This can quickly lead to all trains on the railway being affected.
This method is not authorised for use in the UK.
Timetable and Train Order.
Popular on single track lines in North America up until the 1980s, Train Order operation was less a block system and more of a system of determining which trains would have the right of way when train movements would come into conflict. Trains would make use of a predetermined operating plan known as the timetable which made use of fixed passing locations often referred to as stations. Amendments to the operating plan would come from a train dispatcher in the form of train orders, transmitted to the trains via intermediaries known as agents or operators at train order stations. 
This method is not currently authorised for use in the UK. A similar system, known as "Telegraph and Crossing Order", was used in the 19th century, but after three serious head-on collisions in the 1870s (Menheniot, Cornwall Railway, 1873; Thorpe, Great Eastern Railway, 1874; Radstock, Somerset & Dorset Railway, 1876) its use was condemned. 
In North American train order system was often implemented on top of other block systems when those block systems needed to be superseded. For example where manual or automatic block was implemented, train orders would be used to authorize movements into occupied blocks, against the current of traffic or where no current of traffic was established.
One Train Working.
One Train Working (with train staff).
If a single track branch line is a dead end with a simple shuttle train service, then a single token is sufficient. The driver of any train entering the branch line (or occupying any part of it) must be in possession of the token, and no collision with another train is possible. For convenience in passing it from hand to hand, the token was often in the form of a staff, typically 800 mm long and 40 mm diameter, and is referred to as a "train staff". Such a staff may be a wooden staff with a brass plate stating the section of line on which it is valid, or it may be in the form of a key.
In UK terminology, this method of working was originally referred to as "One Engine in Steam (OES)".
One Train Working (without train staff).
A modern variation of the One Train Working system operates without any train staff. On these lines the clearance of the controlled branch entry signal is the driver's sole authority to enter the branch, and once the train has passed that signal, the interlocking will hold it at 'danger' (and the signal cannot be cleared a subsequent time) until the branch service train, on its return journey has sequentially operated two track circuits at the start of the branch. Continuous train detection on the branch is not required. Safety is ensured by the interlocking circuitry, and if a track-circuit failure occurs then special emergency working by pilotman must be introduced.
Electric Train Staff (ETS).
These came in two sizes, large and miniature.
See Token (railway signalling).
Ordinary Train Staff and Ticket (OTST) or (OTS&T).
See Token (railway signalling).
Ordinary Train Staff sections.
Some low traffic lines dispensed with Tickets and became Ordinary Train Staff sections (OTS).
See Token (railway signalling).
Telegraph Block.
Used on multiple track sections whereby the passage of trains from one point to the next was controlled by instruments connected by telegraph wires. Used extensively in Australia.
Tokenless Block.
This a system for use on single track railways, which requires neither the use of tokens nor provision of continuous train detection through the section. The signalling is designed such that the controlling signals will only allow one train to enter the line. The signalman at the far end of the section must visually check that the whole train has left the section and not become divided. Examples abound on railway systems throughout the world. The absence of a token does remove the one visible reassurance that the driver has and head on collisions have occurred where the driver of an unauthorised train has proceeded under the mistaken idea that he has authority to occupy the line.

William R. Mason Regional Park

William R. Mason Regional Park, or as it is more commonly referred to, Mason Park, is a park in southern Irvine, California. It is one of the largest parks in Irvine and is traversed by trails.
Background.
The first phase of the Mason Park, forty-five acres, opened to public use in 1973. A second phase was completed in 1978 that included a lake which has proven to be a popular attraction.
Mason Park straddles Culver Drive and is thus split into two parts. The east side of the park is a wilderness area. It features scrub-covered ground, traversed by a bike trail and a small creek. As it is located on the northern edge of the San Joaquin Hills, the terrain is rugged: the south edge is a large palisade, marking the edge of the park. The west side of Mason Park is more like a typical park than the east side. Though a ring of wilderness surrounds this side, it is mostly flat grassland, with an occasional hill or rise. An artificial lake about wide and long in the center of the park is often home to migrating birds and other local wildlife.
The park is named for former Irvine Company President William R. Mason, who headed the company from 1966 until his death at 54 in 1973.
Its numerous trails eventually lead to Ridgeline, a street that connects Turtle Rock Loop to University Drive. The trails offer a different view of Irvine as well as a popular route for the cross-country runners of University High School as well as runners from other schools.

URAC

URAC, formerly known as the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, is a nonprofit organization promoting healthcare quality by accrediting healthcare organizations.
Mission.
URAC's mission is to promote continuous improvement in the quality and efficiency of health care management through processes of accreditation, education and measurement.
History.
In the late 1980s concerns grew over the lack of uniform standards for utilization review (UR) services. UR is the process where organizations determine whether health care is medically necessary for a patient or an insured individual. As a result of this public concern, URAC was founded in 1990 with a mission to improve the quality and accountability of health care organizations using UR programs. 
From conception, the founders of URAC recognized that an accreditation organization would not be accepted by regulators, health care providers and consumers if controlled by industry interests. To avoid this, several operating principles were incorporated into URAC's structure and bylaws. First, URAC was set up as an organization independent of any particular stakeholder group. Second, the governing board of directors was established with representatives from all affected constituencies: consumers, providers, employers, regulators and industry experts. Today, over 500 committee volunteers and paid staff help run the organization. 
In the mid-to-late 1990s, URAC's mission expanded to cover a larger range of service functions found in various health care settings including the accreditation of integrated systems such as health plans to smaller organizations offering specialty services.
Accreditation.
URAC's accreditation process consists of a review of policies and procedures and an onsite visit to the applicant organization to determine that it is, in fact, operating according to its stated policies. If an applicant organizations passes their review, an accreditation is awarded with a valid period of two to three years after which the organization must go through the review process again to maintain its accredited status.
URAC accredits many types of health care organizations across the care continuum including health plans (HMOs, PPOs, etc.), health care management organizations (disease management, case management, patient-centered health care homes, health call centers, Independent review organizations, etc.), and health websites.
Health Insurance Marketplace Health Plan Accreditation.
Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will ensure almost every American has health insurance and access to an expanded choice of health plans through Health Insurance Marketplaces, otherwise known as Exchanges. The law also requires every Exchange to be composed of health plan issuers accredited by an HHS-approved accrediting entity. URAC’s Health Plan Accreditation program has proudly earned this HHS approval, making it eligible to accredit issuers participating on Exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. URAC’s accreditation signifies an issuer has undergone and passed a rigorous, independent, top-to-bottom review of every aspect of its operation, including the quality of care and level of service they provide their enrollees.
Accreditation standards development.
URAC standards are developed by a committee of experts representing diverse interests in the health care community: employers, health care providers, health care organizations, insurers, and the public interest. When new standards are developed, experts from that particular area of health care delivery participate on the committee. URAC always circulates draft standards for public comment so that anyone can have input in the standards development process.
Education.
Educational programs include workshops, conferences, webinars and audio conferences for individuals and companies in the health care industry to learn about best practices in URAC accreditation in addition to the latest updates on issues at the forefront of health care directly from industry experts and URAC staff. Many of URAC's educational programs have been approved for Nursing CEU's, CCM CEU's and other continuing education credits.

<doc id="5875883" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875883" title="Elcho Island">
Elcho Island

Elcho Island is an island off the coast of Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. It is located at the southern end of the Wessel Islands group located in the East Arnhem Region. The island's largest community is the settlement of Galiwin'ku.
Geography.
Elcho Island is approximately 55km long and 6km across at its widest point. It is bounded on the western side by the Arafura Sea and on the east by the Cadell Strait. Elcho Island is a short distance away from the mainland and Howard Island.
Galiwin'ku, located near the island's southern tip, is the main community on the island. It is the largest Aboriginal community in northeast Arnhem Land, the second largest Aboriginal community (in terms of concentrated population) in the Northern Territory, and ranks eleventh in population of the 69 local government bodies in the Territory. There is a large number of tribal groups, with up to 22 different dialects being used in the community. The people of Galiwin'ku retain their tradition and culture for future generations by strict traditional methods, and through education, embrace the wider Australian community.
The island is home to the largest Aboriginal community in northeast Arnhem Land, with approximately 2,000 residents living in the main settlement of Galiwin'ku and across many outstations including Inglis Island on the namesake island and Matamata, Maparru, and Gariyak on the mainland. The island has a base population of 2,200 people, including 70 non-Aboriginal people. It is the home of the Aboriginal folk musician Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu. The population of Galiwin'ku varies during the seasons, with many outstation residents migrating to the community during the wet season due to inaccessibility. The community also serves approximately 25 outstations with a total population of approx. 450 people, with 12 of the outstations on Elcho Island, which are listed from north to south:
Forty-eight per cent of the population is under 20 years of age, with 7% over 50.
Galiwin'ku is a traditional Aboriginal community with restricted access; permission to visit is required by law and can be made through the Northern Land Council directly or via the Galiwin'ku Council. Total alcohol restrictions apply and there is no gasoline available on the island; all gasoline-powered vehicles use the low-aromatic petrol "Opal" as a fuel substitute.
The settlement was originally established as a Methodist mission in 1942, with the arrival of Harold Shepherdson, a lay associate of the Methodist Overseas Mission from Milingimbi. It remained under Church direction until 1974 when it became self-managed. Eighteen connected clan groups within the Elcho Island locale have close cultural ties with mainland Arnhem Land clans and language groups. The most commonly spoken languages are Djambarrpuyngu and Gupapuyngu (both Yolngu Matha languages). However, there are at least twelve more languages in use in the region.
Another settlement is Gäwa, which is located on the northern tip of Elcho Island.
The island is served by Elcho Island Airport.
Elcho Island Chooky Dancers.
In 2007 a group of local Elcho Island dancers choreographed and performed a dance routine to Zorba the Greek. The performance was recorded and uploaded to the popular video sharing website, YouTube. In under 12 months the video received more than 850,000 views. Due to this success the group toured parts of Queensland and performed in the Art Gallery of NSW in Sydney in June 2008. They also appeared as the opening act at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala 2009.
Cultural references.
Elcho Island was the inspiration for the song My Island Home originally written by Neil Murray for the Warumpi Band. The song was later covered by Christine Anu and she performed her rendition at the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympic Games.
A memorial ceremony for George Burrarrawanga, one of the founding members of the Warumpi Band, was performed on the island.
The island is the birthplace of blind singer Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu.

Ulf Sterner

Ulf Ivar Erik "Uffe" Sterner (born 11 February 1941 in Deje, Sweden) is a Swedish retired ice hockey forward. He played in nine IIHF World Championships for Sweden, where the team won seven medals: one gold, five silver, and one bronze. He was also a member of the silver medal team at the 1964 Winter Olympics. Sterner played for Forshaga IF from 1956–61, Västra Frölunda IF from 1961–64, and for the New York Rangers in 1964–65, before returning to Sweden to play for Rögle BK and Färjestads BK. He finished his career in England with the London Lions in 1973–74. On 27 January 1965, he became the first European-trained player to play in the National Hockey League (NHL).
Playing career.
Sterner made his hockey debut at 15 when he was accepted onto a second division club where he made a name for himself with his speed and scoring ability. On 12 November 1959, he made his international debut with Tre Kronor in a friendly match against Czechoslovakia's team. He scored his first goal in that game, which Tre Kronor won 11–3. He was the team's youngest player of all time. Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was one of Sweden's most popular players. He is also credited with inventing the "stick to skate to stick" maneuver. At the 1962 World Ice Hockey Championships, Sterner scored what he described as his most memorable goal when he scored the 3–0 goal against Team Canada. His team won the game 5–3 and took the gold medal. At the 1963 World Championship, he scored a hat trick against Canada in a 4–1 win. After the game, he and teammate Sven "Tumba" Johansson met King Gustaf VI Adolf and received a royal congratulations.
His first Olympics came in 1960 in Squaw Valley. The team did not earn a medal, but from that point on he was a dominating centre in international play. By 1963, the New York Rangers had taken interest, and in October, Sterner made the trip for training camp. The parties signed a five-game tryout agreement, but Sterner declined to play that season in order to conserve his amateur status for the 1964 Winter Olympics. The team won a silver medal. Sterner arrived for training camp in 1964 and displayed excellent skills. However, the NHL, unlike the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), permitted hitting and physical play on any point of the ice; international players were not allowed to hit in the offensive zone. Allowing him time to adjust to the North American game, the Rangers offered him a start with the St. Paul Rangers of the Central League, which he accepted. After two months, he adapted and earned a promotion to the Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. Finally, on 27 January 1965, he joined the Rangers in a game against the Boston Bruins, becoming the first European to play in the NHL.
Ultimately, Sterner played only four games in the NHL, and he did not register a point. He had been reluctant to play physically or to instigate physical play. He was sent back down to the AHL, and it soon became clear that he was not going to return to the NHL. As much as his skills carried him through games in the AHL, he simply did not have the training to play 60-minute games with full contact. In 1969, the IIHF adopted the same body-checking rules as the NHL, and four years later, Börje Salming joined the Toronto Maple Leafs, ending up playing 17 years in the NHL.
Personal life.
Sterner, his wife Pia, and their family currently live on a farm near Karlstad, where they keep four horses. He nicknames his horses after former teammates and friends; when one of the horses smashed his nose, he nicknamed it Alexander Ragulin.

Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot

Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot (March 9, 1611 – February 21, 1693) was a French priest and missionary. A variety of circumstances led to his pursuing a religious path. He completed his studies at the Jesuits’ noviciate in Florence and, after three more years of training, came to Canada in 1639. 
Life.
Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot was born 9 March 1611 at Châtillon-sur-Seine (Côte d’Or, Burgundy). He entered St. Andrew’s Jesuit novitiate in Rome on 18 May 1632 at the age of twenty-one, and ordained in late 1637 or early 1638. It was at this time that he added the name "Joseph-Marie". 
Leaving Dieppe on 4 May 1639, from the quays of Dieppe, he arrived in New France on 31 July. There he was immediately involved in the Huron mission being constructed at Sainte-Marie-des-Hurons near Georgian Bay under the leadership of Father Lalemant. It was during the next years that Father Chaumonot was to achieve a mastery of the Huron language that he recorded for others to use in the study of the language. From that time on, he experienced a long series of moves under difficult circumstances. (We have good details on much of his life since in 1688 Father Claude Dablon asked Father Chaumonot to write an autobiography.) Father Chaumonot spent nearly ten years in the Huron missions and worked with many notable priests; Jean de Brébeuf, Simon Le Moyne, Claude Dablon and Antoine Daniel to name a few.
One of Father Chaumonot's lasting achievements was the founding of the Huron mission of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in 1674.
Father Chaumonot retired in 1691 to the Jesuit College at Quebec where he died at the age of 82 years. He had served 52 years in his ministries.

1922 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1922 Stanley Cup playoffs concluded on March 22 when the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Toronto St. Patricks defeated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Vancouver Millionaires in the final series, three games to two. With the debut of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) at the start of the season, these playoffs marked the first time that the NHL, the PCHA, and the WCHL all competed for the Cup.
Background.
The WCHL began play at the start of the 1921–22 season. Soon, it was agreed to alter the Stanley Cup playoffs: The champions of the two Western leagues would compete in a series, with the winner facing the NHL champion in the final round.
After the 1921–22 WCHL regular season concluded, the Calgary Tigers lost to the Regina Capitals in a series to determine second place; both compiled identical 14–10 records. The Capitals then went on to beat the 15–9 first place Edmonton Eskimos in that league's first championship series.
Vancouver finished second overall in the 1921–22 PCHA regular season standings with a 12–12 record. However, they then went on to defeat the 12–11–1 first place Seattle Metropolitans in the PCHA championship series, winning both games by 1–0.
Meanwhile, the 1921–22 NHL season was capped with the 13–10–1 second place St. Patricks defeating the 14–8–2 first place Ottawa Senators, 5 goals to 4, in the two-game total goals NHL championship series.
Semifinal: Vancouver Millionaires defeat Regina Capitals, 5 goals to 2.
Each contest in this Vancouver-Regina two-game total goals series was played under different rules. However, the road team prevailed in each match. Game one, played in Vancouver under the PCHA's seven-man rules, saw Dick Irvin score the game-winning goal to give the Capitals a 2–1 victory. Game two was played in Regina under the WCHL's six-man rules, but Millionaires defenceman Art Duncan recorded a hat-trick as he led Vancouver to a 4–0 shutout, and thus clinching the series by a combined score of 5–2.
Final: Toronto St. Patricks defeat Vancouver Millionaires, 3 games to 2.
A fifth and deciding game was necessary in this series to determine who would win the Cup. After Vancouver won the first game 4–3, Babe Dye scored 4:50 into overtime of game two to give Toronto a 2–1 win. Then in game three, goaltender Hugh Lehman led the Millionaires to a 3–0 shutout win. However, the St. Patricks tied the series in game four, 6–0, as John Ross Roach became the first rookie goaltender to record a Stanley Cup shutout. Game five belonged to Toronto as Dye scored four goals in a 5–1 victory to clinch the Cup.
For the series, Dye scored 9 out of the St. Patricks 16 goals, while Roach posted a 1.80 goals-against average.
Cup engravings.
Toronto never did engrave their names on the Cup for their 1922 championship. It was only until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words "1922 Toronto St. Pats." was put onto its then-new collar.

America's Health Insurance Plans

America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) is a national political advocacy and trade association with about 1,300 member companies that sell health insurance coverage to more than 200 million Americans. AHIP was formed through the merger of Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) and American Association of Health Plans (AAHP). AAHP was formed through a merger between two health maintenance organization (HMO) trade associations, Group Health Association of America and American Managed Care and Review Association. AHIP is a member of CAQH, a coalition of healthcare trade associations and health plans that aims to simplify healthcare administration.
The AHIP Center for Policy and Research is the trade association's research arm. The center publishes research on a variety of forms of private health insurance, often based on survey data gathered from AHIP member companies. The forms of insurance studied include disability income and long-term care insurance as well as different types of medical expense insurance.
AHIP President Karen M. Ignagni frequently serves as a spokesperson for the views of the insurance industry. On September 27, 2007, she appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show opposite Michael Moore, the director of "Sicko", to discuss health insurance.
Health Care Reform.
In December 2008, AHIP published its proposals for health care reform:
1. Soaring health care costs due to fraud and waste. It admitted that lower spending typically did mean lower quality. It urged that a public-private Advisory Group should be tasked with the job of restraining and reducing wasteful and unnecessary spending, changing the rewards structure to favor quality and outcomes rather than volume of work, and streamline administrative processes across the health care system.
2. Reforms should strive for higher value and reduce disparities in ethnic and other minorities by focusing on keeping people healthy and intervening earlier, It called for coordinated care for chronic conditions, and the setting of uniform standards for quality, reporting, and information technology. Also there should be more investment in research to better understand which treatments and therapies work best for both the nation as a whole and for specific patients and accountability for consistently delivered, high-quality care based on the best evidence. It advocated a national initiative to increase public awareness of the links between preventable conditions and chronic illness, and prevention programs in our schools, worksites, and communities.
3. All Americans should have affordable, portable coverage and that there should be an individual mandate requiring all Americans to have adequate insurance as a quid pro quo for insurance companies issuing policies with no pre-existing condition exclusions. There should be better tax equity between company plans and private market policies, and tax credits on a sliding scale basis for those earning less than 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Small businesses should get assistance through the tax code and other measures to make premiums stable and encourage them to contribute to their employees' health insurance needs. It promoted an “Essential Benefits Plan” available nationwide, that providing coverage for prevention and wellness as well as acute and chronic care, and that is not subject to varying and conflicting state benefit mandates. The large group market (covering 160 million Americans) should be preserved. The new system should avoid the cost shifting that was inherent in the old system. Public programs should be strengthened supported such as Community Health Centers, SCHIP and the reformed system should prevent so called "Medical bankruptcies".
4. Regulatory reform. It said that the patchwork of federal and state regulations often hinder, rather than helps, efforts to improve care and contain costs. It therefore said that the federal government should create a streamlined and effective regulatory system and the states should enforce it. It said the states should continue to run SCHIP and Medicaid programs and that eligibility for Medicaid should be simplified to those on 100 percent of the federal poverty level without other conditions.[http://www.americanhealthsolution.org/assets/Uploads/ahipreformpolicyproposal.pdf]
Lobbying.
AHIP has spent more than $31.4 million on lobbying from 2005 to 2009, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. This includes $3.9 million alone in 2009, which paid for the work of 50 lobbyists at eight different lobbying firms.
AHIP and "Sicko".
On the July 10, 2009 edition of Bill Moyers Journal, Wendell Potter, former Vice President of corporate communications at the health insurance corporation CIGNA, claimed that the industry was "afraid" of the Michael Moore documentary "Sicko". As a result, AHIP formed a strategy to "discredit this film". As part of the reporting on this allegation, Bill Moyers Journal provides May 2007 and June 2007 drafts of a memo entitled "Ensuring Accurate Perceptions of the Health Insurance Industry". This memo outlines the strategy the health insurance industry would use to battle Moore’s documentary. The later draft lists the following as the "5 Strategies We Reached Consensus On":
The AHIP memos do not list any factual errors in "Sicko". The memos instead focus primarily on media messaging in terms of influencing politicians and public opinion.
Controversy.
AHIP's 2005 television ad "Shark Bait" drew harsh criticism for its claim that "lawsuit abuse" by American trial lawyers cost the typical American family $1,200 a year.
On August 27, 2009, Michael Tuffin a spokesman for AHIP, told CNN's "Lou Dobbs" program that "every survey shows strong satisfaction for private health insurance," as part of the organization's campaign against health care reform. The non-partisan Politfact watchdog organization found that his words were "half-true." In fact, Politifact said polls have found that often the majority of consumers have varying degrees of satisfaction, but are not strongly satisfied. For instance, an ABC News poll in June 2009 about the cost of health insurance premiums found 23 percent were very satisfied, but a combined 75 percent of consumers were somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied (31 percent somewhat satisfied, 19 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 25 percent very dissatisfied.)

Turtle Back Zoo

Turtle Back Zoo is a zoo in West Orange, New Jersey as part of the South Mountain Recreation Complex. Situated on in the South Mountain Reservation, it is part of the Essex County Park System, the oldest county park system in the United States. Founded in 1963, the zoo was originally a showcase for animals indigenous to New Jersey, but currently features species from every continent except Antarctica. As of 2012, it houses approximately 700 animals, including several hundred birds in a free-flight aviary. Located adjacent to the Richard J. Codey Arena, former practice home of the New Jersey Devils, the zoo is open year-round.
The Turtle Back Zoo has been an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 2006.
History.
Turtle Back Zoo, which took its name from a nearby rock formation, opened in 1963 with a collection of 140 animals representing 40 species. It was originally opened seasonally and had a Hans Christian Andersen "storybook theme," with such exhibits as "a giant piggy bank, the ABC house, the pirates’ ship". By 1973 the zoo was home to 850 animals representing 275 species.
In 1975, the Zoological Society of New Jersey was established to help promote the zoo and provide funding. Despite this, Turtle Back Zoo fell into disrepair, and was almost shut down in 1995.
In 2000 the zoo created a master plan with the objective of improving the zoo enough to receive accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Between 2003 and 2006, Turtle Back received approximately $20 million in funding, which was used to improve the facilities, and in 2006 the zoo received its accreditation. New facilities included the Essex County Animal Hospital on zoo grounds, and a new entrance/administrative complex with a reptile center, classrooms, and an auditorium.
In 2010, zoo attendance exceeded 500,000 visitors for the first time in its history.
Exhibits.
Recent additions to the zoo include Filipino "golden mantled" flying foxes, making Turtle Back the first zoo in the country to show this species of bat; an American Black Bear exhibit; the Essex Farm, which holds common farm animals and includes a petting zoo; and the Tropical Currents Aquarium, which exhibits fish from around the world in six large tanks;.
The $4.6 million reptile house and education center, the zoo's first indoor exhibit, opened in June, 2006. The reptile center contains a pair of nine-foot-long "black dragons", a species of monitor lizard which was discovered in Malaysia in 2005 and has yet to receive a scientific name. The lizards at Turtle Back are believed to be the only "black dragons" on display in North America.
The Gibbon habitat is a outdoor mesh tent habitat that is home to the zoos two gibbons. This $1.8 million exhibit was opened in 2009.
Other attractions.
The zoo has a train ride, carousel, and a playground. The trains were originally Iron Horse Trains by Allan Herschell, but were replaced in 1984 and 1999 by CP Huntington trains. The carousel opened in 2008 and is in a large gazebo. On September 25, 2010, the Turtle Back Zoo opened the Turtle Back Zoo Safari Mini Golf course. Designed by French & Parrello Associates, P.A., the miniature golf course replicates three African regions: the Sahara Desert, the African Grasslands, and the Congo located to the center is Mount Kilamanjave. The miniature golf course consists of 19 holes and contains various animal sculptures, such as a camel, an elephant, a gorilla, a lion and more. The golf course alone is projected to bring in $250,000 in revenue annually. In September 2011, the zoo opened a "treetop adventure course."
A $2 million on-site veterinary hospital includes a full surgery suite and x-ray and ultrasound facilities.

Yapahuwa

Yapahuwa was one of the ephemeral capitals of medieval Sri Lanka. The citadel of Yapahuwa lying midway between Kurunagala and Anuradhapura was built around a huge granite rock rising abruptly almost a hundred meters above the surrounding lowlands.
In 1272, King Bhuvenakabahu transferred the capital from Polonnaruwa to Yapahuwa in the face of Dravidian invasions from South India, bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic with him. Following the death of King Bhuvenakabahu in 1284, the Pandyans of South India invaded Sri Lanka once again, and succeeded in capturing Sacred Tooth Relic. Following its capture, Yapahuwa was largely abandoned and inhabited by Buddhist monks and religious ascetics. 
Location and Name.
The rock fortress complex of Yapahuwa is situated in the Wayamba province of Sri Lanka. About 4 km southeast of the town and railway station of Maho, midway between Kurunegala and Anuradhapura. The original name of this Buddhist Heritage site is Yapawwa though now often called as Yapahuwa which is a kind of distortion of its genuine etymological sense.
History.
Yapahuwa served as the capital of Sri Lanka in the latter part of the 13th century (1273–1284). Built on a huge, 90 meter high rock boulder in the style of the Sigiriya rock fortress, Yapahuwa was a palace and military stronghold against foreign invaders.
The palace and fortress were built by King Buvanekabahu I (1272–1284) in the year 1273. Many traces of ancient battle defences can still be seen, while an ornamental stairway, is its biggest showpiece. On top of the rock are the remains of a stupa, a Bodhi tree enclosure, and a rock shelter/cave used by Buddhist monks, indicating that earlier this site was used as a Buddhist monastery, like many boulders and hills in the area. There are several caves at the base of the rock. In one of them there is a shrine with Buddha images. One cave has a Brahmi script inscription.
At the southern base of the rock there is a fortification with two moats and ramparts. In this enclosure there are the remains of a number of buildings including a Buddhist shrine. There is also a Buddhist temple called Yapawwa Rajamaha Vihara built during the Kandyan period.
The Tooth Relic was brought from Dambadeniya and kept in the Tooth Temple built for the purpose at the top of the third staircase. The relics were carried away from the temple here to South India by the Pandyas, and then recovered in 1288 by Parakkramabahu III (1287–1293), who temporarily placed them in safety at Polonnaruwa.

<doc id="5875964" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5875964" title="Win probability added">
Win probability added

Win probability added is a sport statistic which attempts to measure a player's contribution to a win by figuring the factor by which each specific play made by that player has altered the outcome of a game. It is used for baseball and American football.
Explanation.
Some form of win probability has been around for about 40 years; however, until computer use became widespread, win probability added was often difficult to derive, or imprecise. With the aid of Retrosheet, however, win probability added has become substantially easier to calculate. The win probability for a specific situation in baseball (including the inning, number of outs, men on base, and score) is obtained by first finding all the teams that have encountered this situation. Then the winning percentage of these teams in these situations is found. This probability figure is then adjusted for home-field advantage. Thus win probability added is the difference between the win probability when the player came to bat and the win probability when the play ended.
Win probability and win shares.
Some people confuse win probability added with win shares, since both are baseball statistics that attempt to measure a player's win contribution. However, they are quite different. In win shares, a player with 0 win shares has contributed nothing to his team; in win probability added, a player with 0 win probability added points is average. Also, win shares would give the same amount of credit to a player if he hit a lead-off solo home run as if he hit a walk-off solo home run; WPA, however, would give vastly more credit to the player who hit the walk-off homer.
Baseball.
MLB postseason.
In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, St. Louis Cardinals' third-baseman David Freese posted the best WPA in Major League Baseball postseason history, with a 0.969, which was 0.099 better than the now-second-best WPA of .870, posted by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The third- and fourth-best WPAs are .854 (by the San Diego Padres' Steve Garvey in Game 4 of the 1984 National League Championship Series) and 0.832 (by the Cardinals' Lance Berkman in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series).

Cyprus is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean, south of Turkey and west of Syria and Lebanon. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. The Republic of Cyprus has "de jure" sovereignty over the entire island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters except small portions that are allocated by treaty to the United Kingdom as sovereign military bases. It is "de facto" partitioned into two main parts, the area under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus, comprising about 59% of the island's area and the Turkish-occupied area in the north, calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, covering about 37% of the island's area and recognized only by Turkey. The two areas are separated by a United Nations controlled buffer zone.

Dambadeniya

Dambadeniya is a ruined ancient city situated in the North Western Province (Wayamba), Sri Lanka on the Kurunegala - Negombo road. It served as the capital of Sri Lanka in the mid 13th century. Much of Dambadeniya still lies buried on a huge fortified rock. Dambadeniya is situated about 31 km from Kurunegala, the modern day capital of the North Western Province.
It is believed that the Dambadeniya period was the 'Golden Era' of Sinhalese Literature.
History.
Dambadeniya, about 30 km south-west of Kurunegala, became prominent in the mid-13th century. It was selected as the capital of the kingdom of Sri Lanka by King Vijayabahu III (1232–36). The sovereignty of the country was at stake as a result of invasions, which dislodged Polonnaruwa as the capital. Vijayabahu, the king of the Dambadeniya dynasty, fought the invaders and established Dambadeniya. On the summit of the Dambadeniya rock he built fortifications and sturdy walls and gates. The city was made secure by a moat, a marsh and ramparts around the royal palace. During the reign of King Parakramabahu (1236–70), Dambadeniya reached the zenith of its glory.
Environs.
Little remains of the palace buildings. Excavations have uncovered remains of the temple of the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha, the Royal Palace, gardens, moats, and city walls. The double-story temple of the Tooth Relic has Buddha images, which is identified as the Vijayasundaramaya. It also has some interesting wall paintings dating from the 18th century, when it was restored.

The Guns of Will Sonnett is a Western television series set in the 1870s which ran on the ABC television network from 1967 to 1969. The series was the first production collaboration between Aaron Spelling and Danny Thomas, who would later go on to produce one of ABC's most-memorable hits, "The Mod Squad". Today, the series is distributed by King World (now CBS Television Distribution), and, when telecast, is usually seen in tandem with "Branded".
No brag, just fact, said Walter Brennan of Will Sonnett's prowess with a weapon
Synopsis.
This series starred veteran character actor Walter Brennan as Will Sonnett, and Dack Rambo as his grandson, Jeff, who were searching for Will's son and Jeff's father, James. Disgusted with his father's being absent on army-scout business more often than not, James (also called Jim) had disappeared at the age of seventeen. A few years later, a baby boy was delivered to Will, with a letter identifying him as James' son. It went on to say that his mother had died in childbirth, and that not very many people get a second chance in life, but this was one for Will. The young boy was raised by his grandfather, who was grateful for the opportunity and did the best that he could to steer the grandson in the right direction.
The elder Sonnett was capable with firearms and often spoke to strangers about this prowess in a way that intimidated them. In the first episode, he mentions that his son is an expert with guns, while his grandson is better, "and I'm better than both of 'em -- no brag, just fact." This last phrase appeared frequently on the show, and became a catch phrase with many of the show's younger fans.
Apparently Will's absences had been significantly less than total, as he had taught James how to handle a six-shooter, and the younger man had become renowned as a peerless gunfighter. Hearing so much of his father's repute, Jeff decided he had to find him. Will agreed, and they rode across the West looking for their common relative. They often arrived at places which had been recently vacated by James. The inhabitants of those communities had mixed opinions of James, some seeing him as a ruthless killer, others as the only man brave enough to take the side of justice against other men far more ruthless. The middle Sonnett did in fact appear in several scattered episodes, invariably played by Jason Evers. One of those segments, entitled "The Man Who Killed Jim Sonnett" guest starred character actor Robert F. Simon.
Unlike most series with a similar premise, the problem was resolved during the life of the series. In the second season finale, "Three Stand Together", Will and Jeff eventually located and linked up with James. The three became lawmen together in a small town, Will as town marshal and the other two as his deputies. Had there been a third season for this series, it would have been as a much more conventional Western. The last episode aired on September 16, 1969, after ABC showed summer reruns on Monday nights at 8:30 P.M. During the summer, ABC promoted the concluding segment, in hopes of getting a large audience as it had done with the last episode of The Fugitive.
"The Guns of Will Sonnett" aired two years after Brennan's previous ABC series "The Tycoon" failed to develop sufficient audience in the 1964-1965 season.
DVD release.
Timeless Media Group released both seasons on DVD in Region 1 on July 14, 2009 in a 6-disc set entitled "The Guns of Will Sonnett: The Complete Seasons 1&2". However, they are the edited episodes distributed by King World. They are transferred from video tape sources and have not been remastered from the original film prints. The color is often faded, and the sound is rather poor. The edits in the episodes were poorly executed and sometimes confuse the plotline. The DVD package calls "The Guns of Will Sonnett" one of the most underrated westerns in the history of television.

Actinotus

Actinotus is a genus of flowering plants of the Mackinlayaceae family, with about 18 species. It is native to Australasia. Its best known member is the flannel flower, a common site in Sydney bushland in the spring. The generic name, meaning "furnished with rays" is derived from the Greek stem "aktin-"/ακτιν- "ray" or "sunbeam".
Most species are endemic to Australia with one from New Zealand. Other notable species are "A. schwarzii" from the Macdonnell Ranges in Central Australia, which closely resembles "A. helianthi" in appearance, and the rare pink-flowering "A. forsythii" from the Blue Mountains.

GE 80-ton switcher

The GE 80-ton switcher is a diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems. It is classified as a B-B type locomotive. It was designed for industrial and light switching duties around railheads and ports. The locomotive bears a great resemblance to the GE 44-ton switcher, and it is easy to confuse the two.
Military version.
The military purchased 80-tonners between 1952 and 1953 for use switching railheads around Continental U.S. (CONUS) military facilities. In the 1990s Rail Equipment Division at Tooele Army Depot rebuilt most 80-tonners to have Cummins turbo-charged 6-cylinder engines. The rebuild included a small cosmetic change resulting in end radiator screens and dual headlights. This rebuild gave all Army and some Air Force 80-tonners a much longer lifespan. Approximately 27 Army and five Air Force 80-tonners are still in service present day. Navy 80-tonners did not undergo this rebuild. Many Navy engines were rebuilt by contracts with locomotive rehab companies.
Heritage Railways.
At least four 80-tonners have been known to be in tourist service. These locomotives resided on the Virginia & Truckee Railroad. The D-1 was acquired in 2004 and was the mainstay of the fleet while the railroads 2-8-0 No. 29 & 2-6-2 No. 8 were being restored. Another 80-tonner, D-2, was only used in 2003, and its current disposition is unknown. The Valley Railroad in Essex, Connecticut owns a pair of 80-tonners, 0900 and 0901, for use on the Essex Clipper Dinner Train.

Addiction medicine

Addiction medicine is a medical specialty that deals with the treatment of addiction. The specialty often crosses over into other areas, since various aspects of addiction fall within the fields of public health, psychology, social work, mental health counseling, psychiatry, and internal medicine, among others. Incorporated within the specialty are the processes of detoxification, rehabilitation, harm reduction, abstinence-based treatment, individual and group therapies, oversight of halfway houses, treatment of withdrawal-related symptoms, acute intervention, and long term therapies designed to reduce likelihood of relapse . Some specialists, primarily those who also have expertise in family medicine or internal medicine, also provide treatment for disease states commonly associated with substance use, such as hepatitis and HIV infection. 
Physicians specializing in the field are in general agreement concerning applicability of treatment to those with addiction to drugs, such as alcohol and heroin, and often also to gambling, which has similar characteristics and has been well described in the scientific literature. There is less agreement concerning definition or treatment of other so-called addictive behavior such as sexual addiction and internet addiction, such behaviors not being marked generally by physiologic tolerance or withdrawal. 
Doctors focusing on addiction medicine are medical specialists who focus on addictive disease and have had special study and training focusing on the prevention and treatment of such diseases. There are two routes to specialization in the addiction field: one via a psychiatric pathway and one via other fields of medicine. The American Society of Addiction Medicine notes that approximately 40% of its members are psychiatrists while the remainder have received medical training in other fields. 
In several countries around the world, specialist bodies have been set up to ensure high quality practice in addiction medicine. For example within the United States, there are two accepted specialty examinations. One is a Certificate in Added Qualifications in Addiction Psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. The other is a certificate from the American Board of Addiction Medicine following a peer-reviewed Board-type examination. The latter approach is available to all physicians, while the former is available only to board-certified psychiatrists. The American Board of Addiction Medicine is not currently a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists. Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine may also seek board certification via the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must have a primary board certification in Neurology & Psychiatry or Internal Medicine from the American Osteopathic Association and complete an AOA approved addiction medicine fellowship. Successful completion of a board examination administered via the AOA will grant a certificate of added qualification (CAQ) in addiction medicine. 
Within Australia, addiction medicine specialists are certified via the Chapter of Addiction Medicine, which is part of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. They may alternatively be a member of the Section of Addiction Psychiatry, Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.
The International Society of Addiction Medicine also can provide certification of expertise.

William Edward Cousins

William Edward Cousins (August 20, 1902 – September 14, 1988) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 1958 to 1977.
Biography.
Born in Chicago, Illinois, William Cousins studied at Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary, and was ordained to the priesthood on April 23, 1927. He then served as director of diocesan missions, and hosted retreats and other services in various states.
On December 17, 1948, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago and Titular Bishop of "Forma" by Pope Pius XII. Cousins received his episcopal consecration on March 7, 1949 from Samuel Cardinal Stritch, with Bishops John Boylan and Albert Zuroweste serving as co-consecrators. He was later named Bishop of Peoria on May 21, 1952; during his tenure, he established five new parishes and six new grade schools.
Cousins was appointed the eighth Archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on December 18, 1958. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council, during which he sat on the Commission on Communications Media and on the Lay Apostolate. During the civil rights movement, Cousins was pressured to respond to the activities of his priests, particularly Fr. James Groppi, who led many civil rights marches and protests. In 1967, in response to many Milwaukee Catholics' dissatisfaction with Groppi, the Archbishop stated his support for open housing and Groppi's other objectives, but rejected the priest's tactics.
He later retired as Archbishop on September 17, 1977, after nineteen years of service. He died in Milwaukee, at age 86.
In recent years, allegations have surfaced that Cousins was involved in the cover-up of child sexual abuse cases in the Milwaukee diocese.

John Grote

John Grote (5 May 1813, Beckenham – 21 August 1866, Trumpington, Cambridgeshire) was an English moral philosopher and Anglican clergyman. 
The son of a banker, Grote was younger brother to the historian, philosopher and reformer George Grote. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1831, graduated BA with a first-class degree in the Classics Tripos in 1835, and became a fellow of Trinity in 1837. From 1847 until his death he was vicar of Trumpington, where he was a neighbour of his close friend Robert Leslie Ellis, the paralysed mathematician and Bacon scholar. In 1855 Grote succeeded William Whewell as Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge University. 
Grote published relatively little during his life: volume I of "Exploratio Philosophica: Rough Notes on Modern Intellectual Science" appeared in 1865, but "An Examination of the Utilitarian Philosophy" was only published posthumously (1870). Grote's literary executor and editor, Joseph Bickersteth Mayor, also put together a "Treatise on Moral Ideals" (1876) and volume II of "Exploratio Philosophica" (1900). 
A philosophical idealist and opponent of utilitarianism (as befitted his Cambridge and Anglican clerical identity), Grote was nevertheless happy to admit the new experimental psychology of someone like John Stuart Mill's disciple Alexander Bain - as long as such 'phenomenal' and more properly 'philosophical' investigations were not conflated with each other. Grote had the (perhaps unenviable) distinction of coining the word 'relativism', though he did not use it in quite the same sense as it is used today.

IC programming

IC programming is the process of transferring a computer program into an integrated computer circuit. Older types of IC including PROMs and EPROMs and some early programmable logic was typically programmed through parallel busses that used many of the device's pins and basically required inserting the device in a separate programmer.
Modern ICs are typically programmed in circuit though a serial protocol (sometimes JTAG sometimes something manufacturer specific). Some (particularly FPGAs) even load the data serially from a separate flash or prom chip on every startup.

Cal Jones

Calvin Jack Jones (February 7, 1933 – December 9, 1956) was a college football player for the University of Iowa. Jones is one of only two Iowa football players (along with Nile Kinnick) to have his jersey number retired by the school. Jones became the first Hawkeye, and the first African-American, to win the Outland Trophy in 1955. He played one year with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Western Interprovincial Football Union. He died in a plane crash after playing in the East–West All-Star Game on the way to watch the 1957 Rose Bowl.
Cal Jones is a member of The Pigskin Club Of Washington, D.C. National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll.
Youth and recruitment.
Cal Jones was born on the south side of Steubenville, Ohio, the youngest of seven children. His father died when Jones was about one year old. His mother, Talitha Jones, raised Jones and his six older siblings during the Great Depression and World War II.
Jones began playing organized football in the fifth grade. By the time they neared the end of their time at Steubenville High School, Jones and his two friends, Eddie Vincent and Frank Gilliam, were being courted by college football programs. Ohio State and their legendary coach, Woody Hayes, offered a scholarship only to Cal Jones. Jones committed to play at Ohio State, while Vincent and Gilliam accepted scholarships to play for the Iowa Hawkeyes.
Before the fall of 1952, Vincent and Gilliam drove to Jones's house to say goodbye before leaving for Iowa. Jones shocked his friends when he said, "Wait a minute...I'm coming with you." Jones ran upstairs, packed a bag, and rode to Iowa City with Vincent and Gilliam.
Jones' sudden switch from Ohio State to conference rival Iowa caused Big Ten commissioner Tug Wilson to conduct a personal investigation. Iowa was cleared of any wrongdoing. When questioned, Cal Jones reportedly told Wilson, "I'll tell you why I came out here. They treated me like a white man, and I like it here. I'm going to stay." 
Playing career.
The "Steubenville Trio" (as Jones, Vincent, and Gilliam were called) arrived with Iowa football in bad shape. Iowa had had only one winning season in the previous ten years.
Cal Jones was a dominant figure on the field from 1953 to 1955. In 1953, Iowa finished the year ranked 9th in the final AP Poll, Iowa's best finish since the Ironmen in 1939. Jones was named as a first team All-American.
In 1954, Iowa again had a winning season. Jones was named as a consensus first team All-American, despite playing the entire year with a broken wrist. Jones broke it in practice before Iowa's first game but kept the injury concealed from the fans and media all year. That season, Jones also became the first college football player to be featured on the cover of the September 27, 1954 issue of "Sports Illustrated" magazine, which shows a tightly cropped slightly blurry image of Jones face wearing a football helmet. This was the 7th issue of "Sports Illustrated".
In 1955, Cal Jones was named as Iowa's team captain. Though Iowa struggled to a 3–5–1 record, Jones was named as a consensus first team All-American for the second consecutive year. Cal Jones also won the 1955 Outland Trophy, which goes to the United States' top lineman. He was the first African-American player to win the prestigious award. Jones also finished tenth in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy, an impressive finish for a lineman.
Death.
Cal Jones graduated with a 3.0 grade point average at Iowa. He was selected in the ninth round of the 1956 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions, but refused to sign with the team as the NFL paid black players less than whites. Instead, he went to Canada and signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU). As a rookie with Winnipeg in 1956, Jones was named to the WIFU All-Star Team. The East–West All-Star Game in Vancouver would be Jones's final football game.
Iowa qualified for the Rose Bowl after the 1956 season. Frank Gilliam had sat out the 1955 season with a broken leg, so Gilliam was playing his final year for the Hawkeyes. Jones was to fly home to Winnipeg, gather a few possessions, and then fly to Pasadena to watch Gilliam in the Rose Bowl after the All-Star game.
On December 9, 1956, Jones overslept his scheduled morning flight from Vancouver, so he scheduled an afternoon flight to stop at Calgary then travel to Winnipeg. Cal Jones' flight on Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810, from Vancouver to Calgary crashed at Slesse Mountain (aka Mount Slesse), killing all 62 people aboard, including one football official and four players from the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Gilliam and the rest of the Iowa Hawkeye team heard of Jones's death as they prepared for the 1957 Rose Bowl against Oregon State. The team dedicated Iowa's first Rose Bowl appearance to Cal's memory and won the game, 35–19. The team sent the game ball to Talitha Jones, Cal's mother in Steubenville.
Honors.
Cal Jones is currently the only three-time first team All-American in Iowa history and was the first African American on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1954.
He is one of only two Iowa players to be named a consensus first team All-American twice (Larry Station is the other). Jones was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1971 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.
In 1989, Iowa fans selected an all-time University of Iowa football team during the 100th anniversary celebration of Iowa football, and Cal Jones was selected to the team as a lineman. And the University of Iowa retired Cal Jones' #62. Jones is one of only two players so honored – Nile Kinnick's #24 is similarly. 
The street where Steubenville High School's Harding Stadium is located, is named in Calvin Jones' honor.
Personal.
Jones's grandson, Edwin Harrison, was a National Football League guard on the practice squad of the Kansas City Chiefs. He currently plays for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.His search to learn more about the life and death of his grandfather and his family history is at the centre of the 2012 documentary "The Crash of Flight 810", part of TSN's "Engraved on a Nation" series of eight documentaries celebrating the 100th Grey Cup.

Zamora, California

Zamora (formerly, Black's, Blacks, Black's Station, Blacks Station, and Prairie) is a vibrant but unincorporated community in rural Yolo County, California, U.S., on Interstate 5 due west of Knights Landing. Its ZIP code is 95698 and its area code 530. It is in the northern part of the county. "Zamora District is bordered by County Road 10 to the north and County Road 16 to the south, County Road 85 on the west and Highway 113 on the east...In 1879 Zamora District included the areas of West Grafton,the eastern portion of Fairview and a small strip of East grafton. The Zamora District encompasses Oat Valley, along Oat Creek in the northwestern part of the districtand Hungry Hollow which is in an area along the foothills west of Zamora."
Zamora "was once a thriving little town with a hotel, two stores, a jail, blacksmith shops, a barbershop, a butcher shop, a medical office, a railroad depot, telegraph office, town hall, IOOF building, post office and six warehouses. There were schools and churches there, too. In 1949 and 1969 modern highways rolled through cutting the heart from the town. What was left was a town with 'no services', only a rebulit IOOF building, a rebuilt town hall, the planing mill and St Agnes catholic Church, the school building plus a few houses. But the pulse of the community does not stop with the removal of its heart."
For many years, children of Zamora and its farm families attended kindergarten at Cacheville School in Yolo and first through eighth grades at Zamora Union School. This school had two classrooms, one for first through fourth grades, the other for fifth through eighth grades. Most teachers came to teach for one year only. Children now attend schools to the south in Woodland, California; older children attend Woodland High School.
Yolo County officials estimated its 2005 population at 61 and predicted it would have a population of 99 by 2025. Zamora is served by its own post office, a volunteer fire department and St Agnes Catholic church. It lies at an elevation of 52 feet (16 m).
In 2006, the Yolo County Health Department reported a mosquito was found infected with West Nile Virus at a Zamora testing site.
Economy.
Like the rest of Yolo County, Zamora is primarily agricultural. As of 1994, the following families had owned land or lived in Zamora District for three or more generations: Abele, Anderson, Barnes, Bemmerly, Black, Burger, Campbell, Cassilis, Clark, Clausen, Crites, Croll, Curtis, Cutler, Dission, Dill, Fitzgerald, Flournoy, Foster, Gable, Gaddis, Giguiere, Glascock, Hanneman, Harley, Hatcher, Heard, Hermle, Hershey, Hiatt, Horgan, Houx, Huber, Hulbert, Jacobs, Kergel, LaDue, Long, March, Mast, Mezger,Morgan, Morris,Pockman, Quinn, Rahm, Reusch, Richter, Robinson, Rollins, Rominger, Root, Sandrock, Schlieman, Schlosser, Schneegas, Sharpnack, Slaven, Stabel, Stuhlmuller, Taylro, Vickroy, Walker, Weiss, Weyand, Wild, Wohlfrom.
Bill and Joan Slaven raise sheep and world renowned border collies. Michael and Bridget Slaven, from County Tyrone, Ireland settled in Zamora's rolling hills in the late 1800s. Their rolling hills pasture-land is home to Slaven's annual Zamora Hills Sheep Dog Trials. "The range ewes are set out on a ridge maybe 700 yards distant, and the sheepdog won't be able to see them as he walks with his handler to the post. The dog -- a working border collie -- will run more than half a mile to reach the top."
Willow Spring Farms is owned by Jack Mast, fourth generation Yolo county farmer, and his wife Charlotte. Great-grandparents, Gottlob and Mary (Summ) Mast and Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger from Wurttemberg Germany set up farming operations in Zamora. Gottlob and Mary settled in Hungry Hollow in 1868. When the grain came up high on Gottlob's leg while riding his horse, he knew this was where he wanted to bring his family.
Farmers Grain Elevator was established in 1937 by Thomas Mezger. His great-grandparents Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger, originally from Wurttemberg Germany, moved in 1870 to a 160 acre homestead approximately 3 miles southwest of Black's Station. Originally serving as a scale house, Farmers Grain Elevator eventually became a storage facility and grain purchasing center for local growers. As customer demands grew, Farmers Grain Elevator saw the need to provide quality transportation services for the grower’s harvested crop and in 1971 established Mezger Trucking, Inc. For over 70 years, Farmers Grain Elevator has specialized in the carriage and distribution to market of wheat, corn, barley, safflower and various other agricultural products.Since its inception Farmers Grain Elevator has remained a family business. It is currently co-owned and operated by Dan and Mark Mezger.
Alex and Marlene Long own Zamora Mini-mart on Highway 99 at the Interstate 5 Zamora exit which includes a gas station and small store. For most visitors to Zamora, this is the only place they visit.
The Bariani Olive Oil Co. built a processing plant west of Zamora, and of this the "Sacramento Business Journal" reported on October 2, 2004:[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/10/25/tidbits1.html] The parcel in Yolo County is big enough for 18,000 olive trees and a building.
History.
The first known inhabitants were Native Americans of the Patwin (or Southern Wintun) tribe. Using bows and arrows, spears or snares, Patwins stalked the abundant turtles, deer, tule elk, antelope and the occasional bear, mountain lion or wild cat that came down from the foothills and Coast Range. Using bow and arrow or nets they hunted ducks, geese and swans as they came into the tule marshlands during migrations.
Spanish explorers explored the area in the early 1800s and, as a result, thousands of Patwins died from ill-treatment or previously unknown diseases. Patwins were also rounded up and taken as slaves to build Mission churches and work the mission ranches.
Between 1829 and 1846, hunters and fur trappers from Santa Fe, New Mexioco and from Hudson's Bay Company in Fort Vancouver sometimes traded with Patwin resulting in heavy losses of life for the trappers and hunters and for Patwin.
The 1849 California gold rush miners brought more violence and disease.
The first wave of European settlers included: in 1852 John and Michael Bemmerly, Elias Harley, Edmund Burger; in 1853 Elias Harley and Martin Rahm; in 1854 Silas Barnes and Henry Gaddis; in the late 1850s David Hershey, Theodore Weyand, Cary LeDue, Fred Schlieman and John Wolfrom; in the 1860s James J Black, Ephraim Crites, Gustave Anderson, John Huber, Thomas W Long, James Root, John Walker.Many gained their property through 1862 Homestead act which promised 160-acre tract of public land to the head of a family after the land had been cleared, improved and occupied for 5 years.
Some of the Zamora Districtwas once part of Rancho de Hardy-Rio de Jesus Maria Rancho, granted to Thomas Hardy by Governor Micheltorena on October 23, 1843. In 1870, Circuit Court decided in favor of "Landowner's League upon the Hardy Grant", an organization of local landholders.
Many towns sprang up in Yolo County between 1868 and 1888, including Zamora [http://www.yolo.net/ychm/historyc.html], which was previously known as Black's. Black's was on the railroad and was the pioneer home of J. J. Black, who located there in 1865.In 1875, the Northern Railway Company began extending the railroad from Woodland to Red Bluff. When it reached Black's farm he donated a strip of land 100 feet wide by 3150 feet long acres for depot and grounds and the station was the result. Rights of way were sold for $10 to the railroad company by Silas Barnes, Henry Hoffman, Jacob Cunningham, Albion T. Robinson, Henry M. Cassilis and H.O. Dresser. .
Four blocks were laid out with 16 lots of 30x120 feet per block. On September 18, 1875, C. H. Smart purchased 3 lots from Mr Black for $200 and became the first resident thereof, constructing for his use a dwelling house and a blacksmith shop at the corner of First and Main Streets. William Dorgan purchased 3 lots on March 9. 1876. Gustav Anderson bought 4 lots on April 15, 1876. Robert Huston and his brother Edward bought one lot and established the first store in 1876. The plan for the town of Black's Station (10.8 acres) was filed in 1877. A. C. Turner started the first hotel, and Thomas and Hunt erected the first grain warehouse. Among other builders were D. N. Hershey, Ed Huston, George Glascock and John Wolff. Black's Station from the first was an important shipping station, the great farms in the vicinity sending in their harvests to this point for transportation to market. The coming of the Yolo County Consolidated Water Company's system in 1903 to Black's added much to the importance of the place and stimulated business. The new packing plant was finished that year, making the station a fruit center. In 1906 the name was changed to Zamora. According to a 1920 Yolo County map, Zamora was in the Black's District.
A post office opened in Prairie in 1857, changed its name to Black's Station in 1876, and to Zamora in 1915. Prairie Post office was opened on March 19, 1857 at Weyand's Corner where a rural hotel, general store and stage stop were run at the ranch of Theodore Weyand, located at County Road 97 and County Road 13. Mr. Weyand was the first postmaster. Mail was delived by stagecoach from Scaramento. Mr John Wolfrom served 8 years as postmaster when the post office was at his home just north of Weyand's which also served as rural hotel, general store and stage stop. Prairie Post Office altewrnated between Weyand's and Wolfrom's, serving the area until establishment of Black's Station Post Office in 1876.
Robert M Huston was appointed postmaster December 4, 1876; Edward S Howard in 1882; William B. Black in 1888; Mason C. Gorton in 1898; Silas P. Cutler in 1903. The post office was located in the residence or business establishment of the postmasteruntil it was moved to a new hotel. On March 8, 1915, it became Zamora Post Office. Charles E Thomas was appointed postmaster in 1922. The hotel burned and Zamora Post office moved to the IOOF building where Carey L Croll became postmistress in 1924. It mioved to the home of Minnie Croll in 1932 when she was appointed Postmistress. In 1957, Zamora Post Office returned to the IOOF building with Ruth Anderson as postmistress. in 1969, the posty office moved to a new IOOF building. Janice Croll became postmistress in 1978.
Zamora soils.
The town lends its name to a type of soil which is classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as "a member of the fine-silty, mixed, thermic family of Mollic Haploxeralfs. Typically, Zamora soils have grayish brown, slightly acid loam A horizons; brown silty clay loam, neutral Bt horizons; and yellowish brown C horizons." They are found "Along the west side of the Sacramento Valley in central California and other parts of California" and are "used for growing orchards, row, field, and truck crops. Native vegetation is annual grasses and forbs and widely spaced oaks." [http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/Z/ZAMORA.html]
Native plants included Valley Oaks whose ground acorns provided flour for the Patwin, wild oats, sunflower, clover, manzanita, blackberries, wild grapes.
Historically, grain crops were the only source of crop. Farmers in Zamora have had to cope with unpredictable years of drought and years of heavy rains. In the 1930s, the development of turbine pumps resulted in the ability of farmers to pump enough water for irrigation. This resulted in the ability for more diversified crops, including row crops, orchards, grapes, alfalfa and others.

The Monsters Inside

The Monsters Inside is a BBC Books original novel written by Stephen Cole and based on the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". It was published on May 19, 2005, alongside "The Clockwise Man" and "Winner Takes All". It features the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler.
Synopsis.
The TARDIS takes the Doctor and Rose to the Justicia System — a prison camp comprising the six planets in that solar system. The pair are separated and trapped in different environments, each determined to escape in their own distinctive style. However, their plans are complicated when some old enemies show up. Are the Slitheen really attempting a takeover of Justicia, or is it something far more sinister?
Plot.
The TARDIS lands on a different planet, and Rose 'was, officially, Somewhere Else.' The Doctor isn't sure where they are, and says it was 'like something in the area drew us down...' They walk to the lip of a rise, and see people building pyramids. As they turn, four men, each with a whip and 'futuristic space gun' are creeping up behind them. A fight ensues, and the Doctor and Rose are captured and taken away in separate ships. The Doctor tells Rose, 'Wherever they take you, I'll get you back.'
The Doctor is taken to a plain grey room. He is scanned, found to be an alien, gassed, and sent away. He wakes to see a short woman who introduces herself as Senator Lazlee Flowers and tells him that he is at SCAT-house (Species-led Creative and Advanced Technologies). She explains that they are on Justice Alpha of the Justica system, which is a prison, and that they should have seen the auto-beacons and deflection barrier warning them to stay away. Aliens go to this planet to work on projects, and can get time off their sentence or royalties for good results.
Rose is put on a shuttle and taken to another planet. Warders Blanc and Norris tell her that she has been assigned to Detention Centre Six on Justica Beta. They tell her that she can put in a plea to the Governor, but right now she needs to leave the ship. She is attacked by a group of inmates, but rescued by Block-walker Dennel.
The Doctor talks to Flowers. She says that his ship can't be entered or moved. He tells her 'I put the handbrake on so we wouldn't go anywhere else in a hurry.' They discuss the difficulties of escape, and she tells him to find out. He puts his hand to a door, and grey globules descend from the roof and stick all over him, preventing him from moving. Flowers says they respond to anti-social behavior as well.
He is temporarily assigned a room with two Slitheen, Dram Fel Fotch and his brother Ecktosca Fel Fotch Heppen-Bar Slitheen. They tell the Doctor that 'the family' has gotten out of 'the family business.' Dram and Ecktosca are searching for their ancestor's personal effects, including their compression fields. They were arrested after being tricked into breaking into a building on Justica Delta.
After breakfast, Rose is assigned to work in the kitchens, where some of the other inmates cause trouble that she is blamed for. She is taken to see the governor, and sees a flickering blue light coming out of his office accompanied by a really bad smell. She is sure he is a Slitheen, especially since he is a large person, but she couldn't see a zipper and he claimed the flickering light was a malfunctioning desk lamp. He sentences Rose to a minimum of 25 years in prison.
Next morning, the grey globs grab the Doctor and take him to a room with a variety of aliens working on a gravity experiment project. The Doctor and one of the other aliens (a Sucrosian named Nesshalop) come up with a breakthrough within a few minutes, but break the console in the process. The globs descended on both of them, causing pain as punishment for the destruction. The translation circuit is also broken, so only the Doctor can give the supervisors the solution.
Rose's second day is much like her first, but the Governor is eating lunch in her block today. She starts a food fight, and in the confusion tackles him so she can look for a zipper. She doesn't find one, and is thrown into solitary confinement.
Flowers goes to see Consul Issabel, who is the Technocrat Major of Justica Prime. Flowers tells her about the breakthrough, and that the Doctor insists that he needs his astrophysicist friend to finish solving the problem. Issabel says she will think on it. While the Doctor is back in his cell, he goes through the Slitheens' nests, finds a home-made compression field, and deduces that they must have escape plans, which Ecktosca confirms when he catches the Doctor looking at it.
Rose is visited by Warder Norris, who says that he is an undercover agent, because people are vanishing, but hasn't heard from any of his superiors in months. Blanc comes in, kills him easily, and then unzips her head. Rose gets out of her cell, then realizes that's what the Slitheen wanted all along. At the last moment, two other warders come along, because they'd been sent by the Governor to fetch her.
The Doctor was awoken during the night, and told to come to the meeting room. Flowers is there, and tells him that he will be talking to his expert over videolink. While they wait, they talk about the planetary orbits, and how they are perfect circles, and perfectly spaced for using an amplified gravity wave to open a warp-hole.
Rose is brought into the Governor's office, and sat down to talk to the Doctor. The Doctor tells her that there is a test she needs to pass 'with no help.' Flowers asks her the question, and the Doctor tells Rose that if the project works, they will 'get a royalty that could bring in a lot of cash - and we're talking telephone numbers.' When told to be quiet, he tells Rose 'Mum's the word.' She tells the Doctor that someone might think he's 'sending me a coded message' and he responds 'No. No codes.' So Rose gives them her Mum's phone number, and Flowers says it's close, especially since it was a mental calculation, and then asks about the Warp overlay. The Doctor then sneaks the second number to her by talking about the Fowlers' Albert Square address from the EastEnders (Rose had made the Doctor spend a day with her catching up on missed storylines). Issabel tells the Governor to send Rose there immediately. Meanwhile, alarms are going off on Justica Alpha, because the Slitheen have escaped.
Rose is on the shuttle, when she sees smoke seeping out from under the bulkhead door. She bangs on the door to the cabin, and eventually the pilot comes out to investigate, and is dragged into the smokey hold when he opens the door. The alarm goes silent, and Block-walker Dennel comes out. He had seen what happened with Norris and Blanc, and thought he was rescuing Rose. They drag the unconscious pilot to the cabin door and use his hand to open the touchpad. The console starts beeping a countdown, wanting input from the pilot, and when Rose and Dennel try to move him, they realize he's got a zipper in his head.
In order to keep the shuttle moving, they remove the hand skin from the Raxacoricofallapatorian, and use it like a glove to abort the countdown. It wakes up, and they run to the cabin and close the door. Unfortunately, Dennel is knocked against the controls, as the pilot beats on the door. They realize the ship is heading for a planet, and Dennel comments that 'The big bad wolf's ready to blow our house down.' When the monster gets in, Rose tells him not to hurt Dennel, but to prevent the ship from crashing. It says that it has orders not to harm them, and starts to work on the controls. In spite of its efforts, the ship crashes.
The Doctor has the gravity workshop construction the core of amplifier when Flowers comes in. He asks her about the return of his sonic screwdriver, and then tells her that the orbits of the planets in this system have been changed. When Flowers goes to talk to Issabel, she accidentally sees her remove her skin to reveal a monster that is 'bigger and paler than either Ecktosca or Dram Fel Fotch.' As Flowers tried to sneak away, Ermenshrew (Issabel) hears her and gives chase. She comes across the Doctor, and they take off for the systems hub. The corridor is very narrow, and Ermenshrew has trouble coming after them.
Rose and Dennel are on Justice Delta. The monster tricks Rose into calling for help, knowing that there are no longer any humans on the planet, just more monsters like himself. He also tells her that he is a Blathereen, not a Slitheen.
The Doctor tells Flowers to change the gravity settings to zero. As soon as she does so, the two of them float up to the ceiling shelves where the globs live. The Doctor tells her to switch on the sonic screwdriver (which she had brought along to return to him) for light. There are corridors between the shelves that connect the various rooms of SCAT-house. As they crawl through them, they find Ecktosca and Dram disguised as globs.
Rose awakes Dennel, and the two of them take off through the trees. They come to a clearing that is filled with the remains of all the humans who had gone missing from Justica Beta. They find the monitoring station that the shuttle had crashed into when it landed, and by looking at all the screens, figure out what is happening. They see Warder Robsen appear in the clearing, and run out to get him. They find the portal that he came through, but are unable to make it work.
Ecktosca tells the Doctor and Rose that there are warp-hole pathways joining all the worlds in Justica. The Blathereen are using the work done at SCAT-house to improve and make them larger. The Doctor realizes that they are what drew the TARDIS. Flowers realizes the portal must be in the aquaculture compound, which has been shut down for some months. The four of them make their way there, Ecktosca activates the portal, Dram follows, and then the Doctor and Flowers. They end up in a small room on Justice Delta, and the Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver to offset the portal and prevent Ermenshrew from following them. As he finishes, they are discovered.
Meanwhile, back on Justica Beta, the prisoners stage a revolt.
Rose, Dennel, and Robsen are running from the Blathereen, when the monitoring station comes crashing past them. They all jump in. Rose sees the Doctor on one of the monitoring screens, and they turn the volume up to hear what is happening.
The Doctor, Flowers, Ecktosca and Dram are taken to the Blathereen leader, Don Arco. He tells them that what they want to do is create a super-portal that will allow them to move the entire Justica system. Then they will use its suns to burn another system into fissile material to sell. The prisoners remaining in the Justica system will be used to process the material. And then a monitoring platform crashes into the building, and another. The Doctor and Flowers take advantage of the aftermath to escape.
Rose, Dennel and Robsen find that their station is moving faster now that it's out of the trees and approaching the building, so they decide to jump out. They see the Doctor and Flowers emerge from it, and when Rose jumps, the Doctor catches her, but they both fall. He grins and says 'Found you.'
As they talk, Blathereen begin to emerge from the building, and all five take off running for the forest. Suddenly they hear 'cheering and clattering and crashing and shrieking' and see hundreds of detention centre kids coming after the monsters.
Another Slitheen shows up (Callis, the aunt of Ecktosca and Dram), and the three of them, the Doctor, Rose, Robsen, and Flowers head back to Justice Alpha to destroy the work that was done at SCAT-house. Don Arco and Ermenshaw are there ahead of them, starting to activate the project.
The Doctor has Rose and Flowers turn off the gravity again, while Ecktosca, Callis, and Robsen wreck the gravity warp equipment. Dram works on the compression field, and the Doctor heads back to the gravity workshop. They manage to sabotage the works, and when Ermenshrew hits the switch, the room explodes. The Doctor and Rose go back to the TARDIS and leave the system. Dram, Ecktosca and Callis celebrate the fall of the Blathereen and the beginning of "a new golden age of crime" for the Slitheen.

Lewis Glucksman

Lewis L. Glucksman (December 22, 1925 — July 5, 2006) was a former Lehman Brothers trader and former chief executive officer and chairman of Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.
Life.
Glucksman was born into a second generation Hungarian-Jewish family that lived on the upper west side of Manhattan New York City. He served as a teenage volunteer with the US Navy in World War II.
Education.
Glucksman graduated from the College of William and Mary and later earned a Master's degree in business administration from New York University. The National University of Ireland granted him an honorary Ph.D. in 2002.
Career.
Glucksman had a distinguished career on Wall Street. He joined the staff of privately held Lehman Brothers in 1963, a firm with a 130-year history. After rising from head of sales and trading at Lehman to co-CEO, Glucksman, described then as "gruff and tough" beat Pete Peterson, a former United States Secretary of Commerce for control of the then-closely held firm in 1983, a battle documented in the 1986 book Greed and Glory on Wall Street by Ken Auletta.
Shortly after Glucksman took control, however, the firm experienced a sharp drop in profits. That resulted in a forced sale by Lehman's partners to American Express in 1984. American Express paid $380 million for the firm.
Glucksman joined Primerica Financial Services after Citigroup Inc. founder Sanford Weill acquired the company in 1988. 
He also served as Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Ireland and philanthropy.
He travelled to Ireland frequently in his role as a trustee of New York University to promote academic relationships between Irish academia and NYU. He established a home in Cobh, County Cork in 1984 with his wife Loretta Brennan Glucksman and lived there from 1999.
Glucksman directed much of his philanthropy towards projects of benefit to the promotion of culture in Ireland. These included the transfer of the Coastal and Marine Research Centre from UCC to waterfront premises at Cork Harbour; his patronage of the Lewis Glucksman Gallery at UCC and the Glucksman Chair of Literature and the Glucksman Library and Reading Room at the University of Limerick; his support for the Millennium Wing of the National Gallery of Ireland; his 1993 founding of Glucksman Ireland House at New York University as a centre of Irish culture, language, literature and music; and his participation in The Ireland Funds. 
The Glucksman Institute for Research in Securities Markets (formed at NYU Stern) is endowed by a grant from Lewis Glucksman, Stern MBA '1951. It offers faculty and student grants to support research on equities, bonds, futures, options, and other financial instruments and on the markets where they are traded.
Death.
Glucksman died at his home in Cobh in 2006, aged 80. He is survived by his wife and his daughters Mary Salinger Glucksman and Jane Salinger Glucksman.

Sasanian Empire

The Sasanian Empire ( or ; also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as Ērānshahr and Ērān in Middle Persian, was the last Iranian empire before the rise of Islam, ruled by the Sasanian dynasty from 224 CE to 651 CE. The Sassanid Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the main powers in Western and Central Asia, alongside the Roman–Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.
The Sasanian Empire was founded by Ardashir I, after the fall of the Arsacid Empire and the defeat of the last Arsacid king, Artabanus V. At its greatest extent, the Sassanid Empire encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Eastern Arabia (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatif, Qatar, UAE), the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan), the Caucasus (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, South Ossetia, Abkhazia), Egypt, large parts of Turkey, much of Central Asia (Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan), Yemen and Pakistan. According to a legend, the vexilloid of the Sassanid Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani. It was also hypothesized that the transition toward the Sassanid Empire represents the end of struggle of ethnic proto-Persians with their close migrant ethnic relatives, the Parthians, whose original homeland was in modern-day Central Asia.
The Sasanian Empire during Late Antiquity is considered to have been one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods, and constituted the last great Iranian empire before the Muslim conquest and the adoption of Islam. In many ways, the Sassanid period witnessed the peak of ancient Iranian civilization. Persia influenced Roman culture considerably during the Sassanid period. The Sassanids' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India. It played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture in architecture, poetry and other subject matter was transferred from the Sassanids throughout the Muslim world. Even after the fall of the Sasanian empire it remained the ideal model of organization, splendor, and justice in Perso-Arab tradition; and its bureaucracy and royal ideology were imitated by successor states, especially the Abbasid, Ottoman, and Safavid empires.
History.
Origins and early history (205–310).
Conflicting accounts shroud the details of the fall of the Parthian Empire and subsequent rise of the Sassanid Empire in mystery. The Sassanid Empire was established in Estakhr by Ardashir I.
Papak was originally the ruler of a region called Khir. However, by the year 200, he managed to overthrow Gochihr, and appoint himself as the new ruler of the Bazrangids. His mother, Rodhagh, was the daughter of the provincial governor of Pars. Papak and his eldest son Shapur managed to expand their power over all of Pars. The subsequent events are unclear, due to the elusive nature of the sources. It is certain, however, that following the death of Papak, Ardashir who at the time was the governor of Darabgerd, got involved in a power struggle of his own with his elder brother Shapur. Sources reveal that Shapur, leaving for a meeting with his brother, was killed when the roof of a building collapsed on him. By the year 208, over the protests of his other brothers who were put to death, Ardashir declared himself ruler of Pars.
Once Ardashir was appointed Shahanshah, he moved his capital further to the south of Pars and founded Ardashir-Khwarrah (formerly "Gur", modern day Firuzabad). The city, well supported by high mountains and easily defendable through narrow passes, became the center of Ardashir's efforts to gain more power. The city was surrounded by a high, circular wall, probably copied from that of Darabgird, and on the north-side included a large palace, remains of which still survive today. After establishing his rule over Pars, Ardashir I rapidly extended his territory, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighboring provinces of Kerman, Isfahan, Susiana and Mesene. This expansion quickly came to the attention of Artabanus V, the Parthian king, who initially ordered the governor of Khuzestan to wage war against Ardashir in 224, but the battles were victories for Ardashir. In a second attempt to destroy Ardashir, Artabanus V himself met Ardashir in battle at Hormozgan, where Artabanus V met his death. Following the death of the Parthian ruler, Ardashir I went on to invade the western provinces of the now defunct Parthian Empire.
At that time the Arsacid dynasty was divided between supporters of Artabanus V and Vologases VI, which probably allowed Ardashir to consolidate his authority in the south with little or no interference from the Parthians. Ardashir was aided by the geography of the province of Fars, which was separated from the rest of Iran. Crowned in 224 at Ctesiphon as the sole ruler of Persia, Ardashir took the title Shahanshah, or "King of Kings" (the inscriptions mention Adhur-Anahid as his Banebshenan banebshen, "Queen of Queens", but her relationship with Ardashir is not established), bringing the 400-year-old Parthian Empire to an end, and beginning four centuries of Sassanid rule.
In the next few years, local rebellions would form around the empire. Nonetheless, Ardashir I further expanded his new empire to the east and northwest, conquering the provinces of Sistan, Gorgan, Khorasan, Margiana (in modern Turkmenistan), Balkh and Chorasmia. He also added Bahrain and Mosul to Sassanid's possessions. Later Sassanid inscriptions also claim the submission of the Kings of Kushan, Turan and Mekran to Ardashir, although based on numismatic evidence, it is more likely that these actually submitted to Ardashir's son, the future Shapur I. In the west, assaults against Hatra, Armenia and Adiabene met with less success. In 230, he raided deep into Roman territory, and a Roman counter-offensive two years later ended inconclusively, although the Roman emperor, Alexander Severus, celebrated a triumph in Rome.
Ardashir I's son Shapur I continued the expansion of the empire, conquering Bactria and the western portion of the Kushan Empire, while leading several campaigns against Rome. Invading Roman Mesopotamia, Shapur I captured Carrhae and Nisibis, but in 243 the Roman general Timesitheus defeated the Persians at Rhesaina and regained the lost territories. The emperor Gordian III's (238–244) subsequent advance down the Euphrates was defeated at Meshike (244), leading to Gordian's murder by his own troops and enabling Shapur to conclude a highly advantageous peace treaty with the new emperor Philip the Arab, by which he secured the immediate payment of 500,000 "denarii" and further annual payments.
Shapur soon resumed the war, defeated the Romans at Barbalissos (253), and then probably took and plundered Antioch. Roman counter-attacks under the emperor Valerian ended in disaster when the Roman army was defeated and besieged at Edessa and Valerian was captured by Shapur, remaining his prisoner for the rest of his life. Shapur celebrated his victory by carving the impressive rock reliefs in Naqsh-e Rostam and Bishapur, as well as a monumental inscription in Persian and Greek in the vicinity of Persepolis. He exploited his success by advancing into Anatolia (260), but withdrew in disarray after defeats at the hands of the Romans and their Palmyrene ally Odaenathus, suffering the capture of his harem and the loss of all the Roman territories he had occupied.
Shapur had intensive development plans. He ordered the construction of the first dam bridge in Iran and founded many cities, some settled in part by emigrants from the Roman territories, including Christians who could exercise their faith freely under Sassanid rule. Two cities, Bishapur and Nishapur, are named after him. He particularly favored Manichaeism, protected Mani (who dedicated one of his books, the Shabuhragan, to him) and sent many Manichaean missionaries abroad. He also befriended a Babylonian rabbi called Samuel.
This friendship was advantageous for the Jewish community and gave them a respite from the oppressive laws enacted against them. Later kings reversed Shapur's policy of religious tolerance. Under pressure from Zoroastrian Magi and influenced by the high-priest Kartir, Bahram I killed Mani and persecuted his followers. Bahram II was, like his father, amenable to the wishes of the Zoroastrian priesthood. During his reign, the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Romans under Emperor Carus, and most of Armenia, after half a century of Persian rule, was ceded to Diocletian.
Succeeding Bahram III (who ruled briefly in 293), Narseh embarked on another war with the Romans. After an early success against the Emperor Galerius near Callinicum on the Euphrates in 296, Narseh was decisively defeated. Galerius had been reinforced, probably in the spring of 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's Danubian holdings. Narseh did not advance from Armenia and Mesopotamia, leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia. Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius' force, to Narseh's disadvantage: the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces, and, in two successive battles, Galerius secured victories over Narseh.
During the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife along with it. Galerius advanced into Media and Adiabene, winning successive victories, most prominently near Erzurum, and securing Nisibis (Nusaybin, Turkey) before October 1, 298. He moved down the Tigris, taking Ctesiphon.
Narseh had previously sent an ambassador to Galerius to plead for the return of his wives and children. Peace negotiations began in the spring of 299, with both Diocletian and Galerius presiding.
The conditions of the peace were heavy: Persia would give up territory to Rome, making the Tigris the boundary between the two empires. Further terms specified that Armenia was returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; Caucasian Iberia would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene (Sophene), Arzanene (Aghdznik), Corduene, and Zabdicene (near modern Hakkâri, Turkey).
The Sassanids ceded five provinces west of the Tigris, and agreed not to interfere in the affairs of Armenia and Georgia. In the aftermath of this defeat, Narseh gave up the throne and died a year later, leaving the Sassanid throne to his son, Hormizd II. Unrest spread throughout the land, and while Hormizd II suppressed revolts in Sistan and Kushan, he was unable to control the nobles and was subsequently killed by Bedouins in a hunting trip in 309.
First Golden Era (309–379).
Following Hormizd II's death, Arabs from the north started to ravage and plunder the eastern cities of the empire, even attacking the province of Fars, the birthplace of the Sassanid kings. Meanwhile, Persian nobles killed Hormizd II's eldest son, blinded the second, and imprisoned the third (who later escaped to Roman territory). The throne was reserved for Shapur II, the unborn child of one of Hormizd II's wives who was crowned "in utero": the crown was placed upon his mother's stomach. During his youth the empire was controlled by his mother and the nobles. Upon Shapur II's coming of age, he assumed power and quickly proved to be an active and effective ruler.
Shapur II first led his small but disciplined army south against the Arabs, whom he defeated, securing the southern areas of the empire. He then started his first campaign against the Romans in the west, where Persian forces won a series of battles but were unable to make territorial gains due to the failure of repeated sieges of the key frontier city of Nisibis, and Roman success in retaking the cities of Singara and Amida, after they had fallen to the Persians.
These campaigns were halted by nomadic raids along the eastern borders of the empire, which threatened Transoxiana, a strategically critical area for control of the Silk Road. Shapur therefore marched east toward Transoxiana to meet the eastern nomads, leaving his local commanders to mount nuisance raids on the Romans. He crushed the Central Asian tribes, and annexed the area as a new province. He completed the conquest of the area now known as Afghanistan.
Cultural expansion followed this victory, and Sassanid art penetrated Turkestan, reaching as far as China. Shapur, along with the nomad King Grumbates, started his second campaign against the Romans in 359 and soon succeeded in taking Singara and Amida again. In response, the Roman emperor Julian struck deep into Persian territory and defeated Shapur's forces at Ctesiphon. He failed to take the capital, however, and was killed while trying to retreat to Roman territory. His successor Jovian, trapped on the east bank of the Tigris, had to hand over all the provinces the Persians had ceded to Rome in 298, as well as Nisibis and Singara, to secure safe passage for his army out of Persia.
Shapur II pursued a harsh religious policy. Under his reign, the collection of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, was completed, heresy and apostasy were punished, and Christians were persecuted. The latter was a reaction against the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. Shapur II, like Shapur I, was amicable towards Jews, who lived in relative freedom and gained many advantages in his period ("see also Raba"). At the time of Shapur's death, the Persian Empire was stronger than ever, with its enemies to the east pacified and Armenia under Persian control.
Intermediate Era (379–498).
From Shapur II's death until Kavadh I's first coronation, there was a largely peaceful period with the Romans (by this time the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire), interrupted only by two brief wars, the first in 421–422 and the second in 440. Throughout this era, Sassanid religious policy differed dramatically from king to king. Despite a series of weak leaders, the administrative system established during Shapur II's reign remained strong, and the empire continued to function effectively.
After Shapur II died in 379, he left a powerful empire to his half-brother Ardashir II (379–383; son of Vahram of Kushan) and his son Shapur III (383–388), neither of whom demonstrated his predecessor's talent. Ardashir II, who was raised as the "half-brother" of the emperor, failed to fill his brother's shoes, and Shapur III was too much of a melancholy character to achieve anything. Bahram IV (388–399), although not as inactive as his father, still failed to achieve anything important for the empire. During this time Armenia was divided by treaty between the Roman and Sassanid empires. The Sassanids reestablished their rule over Greater Armenia, while the Byzantine Empire held a small portion of western Armenia.
Bahram IV's son Yazdegerd I (399–421) is often compared to Constantine I. Like him, he was powerful both physically and diplomatically. Much like his Roman counterpart, Yazdegerd I was opportunistic. Like Constantine the Great, Yazdegerd I practiced religious tolerance and provided freedom for the rise of religious minorities. He stopped the persecution against the Christians and even punished nobles and priests who persecuted them. His reign marked a relatively peaceful era. He made lasting peace with the Romans and even took the young Theodosius II (408–450) under his guardianship. He also married a Jewish princess who bore him a son called Narsi.
Yazdegerd I's successor was his son Bahram V (421–438), one of the most well-known Sassanid kings and the hero of many myths. These myths persisted even after the destruction of the Sassanid empire by the Arabs. Bahram V, better known as "Bahram-e Gur", gained the crown after Yazdegerd I's sudden death (or assassination) against the opposition of the grandees with the help of al-Mundhir, the Arabic dynast of al-Hirah. Bahram V's mother was Soshandukht, the daughter of the Jewish Exilarch. In 427, he crushed an invasion in the east by the nomadic Hephthalites, extending his influence into Central Asia, where his portrait survived for centuries on the coinage of Bukhara (in modern Uzbekistan). Bahram V deposed the vassal King of the Persian part of Armenia and made it a province.
Bahram V is a great favorite in Persian tradition, which relates many stories of his valor and beauty, of his victories over the Romans, Turkic peoples, Indians and Africans, and of his adventures in hunting and in love; he is called Bahram-e Gur, "Gur" meaning onager, on account of his love for hunting and, in particular, hunting onagers. He symbolized a king at the height of a golden age. He had won his crown by competing with his brother and spent time fighting foreign enemies, but mostly kept himself amused by hunting and court parties with his famous band of ladies and courtiers. He embodied royal prosperity. During his time, the best pieces of Sassanid literature were written, notable pieces of Sassanid music were composed, and sports such as polo became royal pastimes, a tradition that continues to this day in many kingdoms.
Bahram V's son Yazdegerd II (438–457) was a just, moderate ruler, but in contrast to Yazdegerd I, practiced a harsh policy towards minority religions, particularly Christianity.
At the beginning of his reign, Yazdegerd II gathered a mixed army of various nations, including his Indian allies, and attacked the Eastern Roman Empire in 441, but peace was soon restored after small-scale fighting. He then gathered his forces in Nishapur in 443 and launched a prolonged campaign against the Kidarites. Finally, after a number of battles, he crushed the Kidarites and drove them out beyond the Oxus river in 450.
During his eastern campaign, Yazdegerd II grew suspicious of the Christians in the army and expelled them all from the governing body and army. He then persecuted the Christians and, to a much lesser extent, the Jews. In order to reestablish Zoroastrianism in Armenia, he crushed an uprising of Armenian Christians at the Battle of Vartanantz in 451. The Armenians, however, remained primarily Christian. In his later years, he was engaged yet again with Kidarites until his death in 457. Hormizd III (457–459), younger son of Yazdegerd II, ascended to the throne. During his short rule, he continually fought with his elder brother Peroz I, who had the support of nobility, and with the Hephthalites in Bactria. He was killed by his brother Peroz in 459.
In the beginning of the 5th century, the Hephthalites (White Huns), along with other nomadic groups, attacked Persia. At first Bahram V and Yazdegerd II inflicted decisive defeats against them and drove them back eastward. The Huns returned at the end of 5th century and defeated Peroz I (457–484) in 483. Following this victory, the Huns invaded and plundered parts of eastern Persia for two years. They exacted heavy tribute for some years thereafter.
These attacks brought instability and chaos to the kingdom. Peroz I tried again to drive out the Hephthalites, but on the way to Herat, he and his army were trapped by the Huns in the desert; Peroz I was killed, and his army was wiped out. After this victory, the Hephthalites advanced forward to the city of Herat, throwing the empire into chaos. Eventually, a noble Persian from the old family of Karen, Zarmihr (or Sokhra), restored some degree of order. He raised Balash, one of Peroz I's brothers, to the throne, although the Hunnic threat persisted until the reign of Khosrau I. Balash (484–488) was a mild and generous monarch, who made concessions to the Christians; however, he took no action against the empire's enemies, particularly, the White Huns. Balash, after a reign of four years, was blinded and deposed (attributed to magnates), and his nephew Kavadh I was raised to the throne.
Kavadh I (488–531) was an energetic and reformist ruler. Kavadh I gave his support to the sect founded by Mazdak, son of Bamdad, who demanded that the rich should divide their wives and their wealth with the poor. His intention evidently was, by adopting the doctrine of the Mazdakites, to break the influence of the magnates and the growing aristocracy. These reforms led to his being deposed and imprisoned in the "Castle of Oblivion" in Susa, and his younger brother Jamasp (Zamaspes), was raised to the throne in 496. Kavadh I, however, escaped in 498 and was given refuge by the White Hun king.
Djamasp (496–498) was installed on the Sassanid throne upon the deposition of Kavadh I by members of the nobility. Djamasp was a good and kind king, and he reduced taxes in order to relieve the peasants and the poor. He was also an adherent of the mainstream Zoroastrian religion, diversions from which had cost Kavadh I his throne and freedom. His reign soon ended when Kavadh I, at the head of a large army granted to him by the Hephthalite king, returned to the empire's capital. Djamasp stepped down from his position and restored the throne to his brother. No further mention of Djamasp is made after the restoration of Kavadh I, but it is widely believed that he was treated favorably at the court of his brother.
Second Golden Era (498–622).
The second golden era began after the second reign of Kavadh I. With the support of the Hephtalites, Kavadh I launched a campaign against the Romans. In 502, he took Theodosiopolis in Armenia, but lost it soon afterwards. In 503 he took Amida on the Tigris. In 504, an invasion of Armenia by the western Huns from the Caucasus led to an armistice, the return of Amida to Roman control and a peace treaty in 506. In 521/522 Kavadh lost control of Lazica, whose rulers switched their allegiance to the Romans; an attempt by the Iberians in 524/525 to do likewise triggered a war between Rome and Persia.
In 527, a Roman offensive against Nisibis was repulsed and Roman efforts to fortify positions near the frontier were thwarted. In 530, Kavadh sent an army under Firouz the Mirranes to attack the important Roman frontier city of Dara. The army was met by the Roman general Belisarius, and though superior in numbers, was defeated at the Battle of Dara. In the same year, a second Persian army under Mihr-Mihroe was defeated at Satala by Roman forces under Sittas and Dorotheus, but in 531 a Persian army accompanied by a Lakhmid contingent under Al-Mundhir III defeated Belisarius at the Battle of Callinicum, and in 532 an "eternal" peace was concluded. Although he could not free himself from the yoke of the Ephthalites, Kavadh succeeded in restoring order in the interior and fought with general success against the Eastern Romans, founded several cities, some of which were named after him, and began to regulate the taxation and internal administration.
After Kavadh I, his son Khosrau I, also known as Anushirvan ("with the immortal soul"; ruled 531–579), ascended to the throne. He is the most celebrated of the Sassanid rulers. Khosrau I is most famous for his reforms in the aging governing body of Sassanids. He introduced a rational system of taxation based upon a survey of landed possessions, which his father had begun, and he tried in every way to increase the welfare and the revenues of his empire. Previous great feudal lords fielded their own military equipment, followers, and retainers. Khosrau I developed a new force of dehkans, or "knights", paid and equipped by the central government and the bureaucracy, tying the army and bureaucracy more closely to the central government than to local lords.
Emperor Justinian I (527–565) paid Khosrau I 440,000 pieces of gold as a part of the "eternal peace" treaty of 532. In 540, Khosrau broke the treaty and invaded Syria, sacking Antioch and extorting large sums of money from a number of other cities. Further successes followed: in 541 Lazica defected to the Persian side, and in 542 a major Byzantine offensive in Armenia was defeated at Anglon. A five-year truce agreed to in 545 was interrupted in 547 when Lazica again switched sides and eventually expelled its Persian garrison with Byzantine help; the war resumed but remained confined to Lazica, which was retained by the Byzantines when peace was concluded in 562.
In 565, Justinian I died and was succeeded by Justin II (565–578), who resolved to stop subsidies to Arab chieftains to restrain them from raiding Byzantine territory in Syria. A year earlier, the Sassanid governor of Armenia, of the Suren family, built a fire temple at Dvin near modern Yerevan, and he put to death an influential member of the Mamikonian family, touching off a revolt which led to the massacre of the Persian governor and his guard in 571, while rebellion also broke out in Iberia. Justin II took advantage of the Armenian revolt to stop his yearly payments to Khosrau I for the defense of the Caucasus passes.
The Armenians were welcomed as allies, and an army was sent into Sassanid territory which besieged Nisibis in 573. However, dissension among the Byzantine generals not only led to an abandonment of the siege, but they in turn were besieged in the city of Dara, which was taken by the Persians who then ravaged Syria, causing Justin II to agree to make annual payments in exchange for a five-year truce on the Mesopotamian front, although the war continued elsewhere. In 576 Khosrau I led his last campaign, an offensive into Anatolia which sacked Sebasteia and Melitene, but ended in disaster: defeated outside Melitene, the Persians suffered heavy losses as they fled across the Euphrates under Byzantine attack. Taking advantage of Persian disarray, the Byzantines raided deep into Khosrau's territory, even mounting amphibious attacks across the Caspian Sea. Khosrau sued for peace, but he decided to continue the war after a victory by his general Tamkhosrau in Armenia in 577, and fighting resumed in Mesopotamia. The Armenian revolt came to an end with a general amnesty, which brought Armenia back into the Sassanid Empire.
Around 570, "Ma 'd-Karib", half-brother of the King of Yemen, requested Khosrau I's intervention. Khosrau I sent a fleet and a small army under a commander called Vahriz to the area near present Aden, and they marched against the capital San'a'l, which was occupied. Saif, son of Mard-Karib, who had accompanied the expedition, became King sometime between 575 and 577. Thus, the Sassanids were able to establish a base in south Arabia to control the sea trade with the east. Later, the south Arabian kingdom renounced Sassanid overlordship, and another Persian expedition was sent in 598 that successfully annexed southern Arabia as a Sassanid province, which lasted until the time of troubles after Khosrau II.
Khosrau I's reign witnessed the rise of the dihqans (literally, village lords), the petty landholding nobility who were the backbone of later Sassanid provincial administration and the tax collection system. Khosrau I was a great builder, embellishing his capital, founding new towns, and constructing new buildings. He rebuilt the canals and restocked the farms destroyed in the wars. He built strong fortifications at the passes and placed subject tribes in carefully chosen towns on the frontiers to act as guardians against invaders. He was tolerant of all religions, though he decreed that Zoroastrianism should be the official state religion, and was not unduly disturbed when one of his sons became a Christian.
After Khosrau I, Hormizd IV (579–590) took the throne. The war with the Byzantines continued to rage intensely but inconclusively until the general Bahram Chobin, dismissed and humiliated by Hormizd, rose in revolt in 589. The following year, Hormizd was overthrown by a palace coup and his son Khosrau II (590–628) placed on the throne. However, this change of ruler failed to placate Bahram, who defeated Khosrau, forcing him to flee to Byzantine territory, and seized the throne for himself as Bahram VI. Khosrau begged Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582–602) for assistance against Bahram, offering to cede the western Caucasus to the Byzantines. To cement the alliance, Khosrau also married Maurice's daughter Miriam. Under the command of Khosrau and the Byzantine generals Narses and John Mystacon, the new combined Byzantine-Persian army raised a rebellion against Bahram, defeating him at the Battle of Blarathon in 591. When Khosrau was subsequently restored to power he kept his promise, handing over control of western Armenia and Caucasian Iberia. The new peace arrangement allowed the two empires to focus on military matters elsewhere: Khosrau expanded the Sassanid Empire's eastern frontier while Maurice restored Byzantine control of the Balkans.
After Maurice was overthrown and killed by Phocas (602–610) in 602, however, Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor as a pretext to begin a new invasion, which benefited from continuing civil war in the Byzantine Empire and met little effective resistance. Khosrau's generals systematically subdued the heavily fortified frontier cities of Byzantine Mesopotamia and Armenia, laying the foundations for unprecedented expansion. The Persians overran Syria and captured Antioch in 611.
In 613, outside Antioch, the Persian generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin decisively defeated a major counter-attack led in person by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius. Thereafter, the Persian advance continued unchecked. Jerusalem fell in 614, Alexandria in 619, and the rest of Egypt by 621. The Sassanid dream of restoring the Achaemenid boundaries was almost complete, while the Byzantine Empire was on the verge of collapse. This remarkable peak of expansion was paralleled by a blossoming of Persian art, music, and architecture.
Decline and fall (622–651).
While originally seeming successful at a first glance, the campaign of Khosrau II had actually exhausted the Persian army and Persian treasuries. In an effort to rebuild the national treasuries, Khosrau overtaxed the population. Thus, seeing the opportunity, Heraclius (610–641) drew on all his diminished and devastated empire's remaining resources, reorganized his armies, and mounted a remarkable counter-offensive. Between 622 and 627 he campaigned against the Persians in Anatolia and the Caucasus, winning a string of victories against Persian forces under Khosrau, Shahrbaraz, Shahin, and Shahraplakan, sacking the great Zoroastrian temple at Ganzak, and securing assistance from the Khazars and Western Turkic Khaganate.
In 626, Constantinople was besieged by Slavic and Avar forces which were supported by a Persian army under Shahrbaraz on the far side of the Bosphorus, but attempts to ferry the Persians across were blocked by the Byzantine fleet and the siege ended in failure. In 627-628, Heraclius mounted a winter invasion of Mesopotamia and, despite the departure of his Khazar allies, defeated a Persian army commanded by Rhahzadh in the Battle of Nineveh. He then marched down the Tigris, devastating the country and sacking Khosrau's palace at Dastagerd. He was prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the Nahrawan Canal and conducted further raids before withdrawing up the Diyala into north-western Iran.
The impact of Heraclius's victories, the devastation of the richest territories of the Sassanid Empire, and the humiliating destruction of high-profile targets such as Ganzak and Dastagerd fatally undermined Khosrau's prestige and his support among the Persian aristocracy. In early 628, he was overthrown and murdered by his son Kavadh II (628), who immediately brought an end to the war, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories. In 629, Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in a majestic ceremony. Kavadh died within months, and chaos and civil war followed. Over a period of four years and five successive kings, including two daughters of Khosrau II and spahbed Shahrbaraz, the Sassanid Empire weakened considerably. The power of the central authority passed into the hands of the generals. It would take several years for a strong king to emerge from a series of coups, and the Sassanids never had time to recover fully.
In the spring of 632, a grandson of Khosrau I who had lived in hiding in Estakhr, Yazdegerd III, ascended the throne. The same year, the first raiders from the Arab tribes, newly united by Islam, arrived in Persian territory. According to Howard-Johnston, years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, the increasing power of the provincial landholders, and a rapid turnover of rulers, facilitating the Islamic conquest of Persia.
The Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the initial Arab armies. Yazdegerd was a boy at the mercy of his advisers and incapable of uniting a vast country crumbling into small feudal kingdoms, despite the fact that the Byzantines, under similar pressure from the newly expansive Arabs, no longer threatened. Caliph Abu Bakr's commander Khalid ibn Walid moved to capture Iraq in a series of lightning battles. Redeployed to the Syrian front against the Byzantines in June 634, Khalid's successor in Iraq failed him, and Muslims were defeated in the Battle of the Bridge in 634, which resulted in a Sassanid victory. However, the Arab threat did not stop there and reappeared shortly from the disciplined armies of Khalid ibn Walid, once one of Muhammad's chosen companions-in-arms and leader of the Arab army.
In 637, a Muslim army under the Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattāb defeated a larger Persian force led by general Rostam Farrokhzad at the plains of al-Qādisiyyah and advanced on Ctesiphon, which fell after a prolonged siege. Yazdegerd fled eastward from Ctesiphon, leaving behind him most of the Empire's vast treasury. The Arabs captured Ctesiphon shortly afterward, acquiring a powerful financial resource and leaving the Sassanid government strapped for funds. A number of Sassanid governors attempted to combine their forces to throw back the invaders, but the effort was crippled by the lack of a strong central authority, and the governors were defeated at the Battle of Nihawānd. The empire, with its military command structure non-existent, its non-noble troop levies decimated, its financial resources effectively destroyed, and the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste destroyed piecemeal, was now utterly helpless in the face of the invaders.
Upon hearing of the defeat in Nihawānd, Yazdegerd along with Farrukhzad and with some of the Persian nobles fled further inland to the eastern province of Khorasan. Yazdegerd was assassinated by a miller in Merv in late 651, while some of the nobles settled in Central Asia, where they contributed greatly to spreading Persian culture and language in those regions and to the establishment of the first native Iranian Islamic dynasty, the Samanid dynasty, which sought to revive Sassanid traditions.
The abrupt fall of the Sassanid Empire was completed in a period of five years, and most of its territory was absorbed into the Islamic caliphate; however, many Iranian cities resisted and fought against the invaders several times. Islamic caliphates repeatedly suppressed revolts in cities such as Rey, Isfahan, and Hamadan. The local population was initially under little pressure to convert to Islam, remaining as dhimmi subjects of the Muslim state and paying a jizya. Jizya practically replaced poll taxes imposed by the Sassanids. In addition, the old Sassanid "land tax" (known in Arabic as "Kharaj") was also adopted. Caliph Umar is said to have occasionally set up a commission to survey the taxes, to judge if they were more than the land could bear. Conversion of the Persian population to Islam would take place gradually, particularly as Persian-speaking elites attempted to gain positions of prestige under the Abbasid Caliphate.
Descendants.
It is believed that the following dynasties and religious leaders have ancestors among the Sassanian rulers:
Government.
The Sassanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Parthian Arsacids, with the capital at Ctesiphon in the Khvarvaran province. In administering this empire, Sassanid rulers took the title of Shahanshah (King of Kings), became the central overlords and also assumed guardianship of the sacred fire, the symbol of the national religion. This symbol is explicit on Sassanid coins where the reigning monarch, with his crown and regalia of office, appears on the obverse, backed by the sacred fire, the symbol of the national religion, on the coin's reverse. Sassanid queens had the title of Banebshenan banebshen (Queen of Queens).
On a smaller scale, the territory might also be ruled by a number of petty rulers from the Sassanid royal family, known as "Shahrdar", overseen directly by Shahanshah. Sassanid rule was characterized by considerable centralization, ambitious urban planning, agricultural development, and technological improvements. Below the king, a powerful bureaucracy carried out much of the affairs of government; the head of the bureaucracy and vice-chancellor, was the "Wuzurg framadār". Within this bureaucracy the Zoroastrian priesthood was immensely powerful. The head of the Magi priestly class, the Mobadan, along with the commander-in-chief, the Iran (Eran) Spahbed, the head of traders and merchants syndicate "Ho Tokhshan Bod" and minister of agriculture "Vastrioshansalar", who was also head of farmers, were, below the emperor, the most powerful men of the Sassanid state.
The Sassanian rulers always considered the advice of their ministers. A Muslim historian, Masudi, praised the Sassanian administration by saying:
In normal times, the monarchical office was hereditary, but might be transferred by the king to a younger son; in two instances the supreme power was held by queens. When no direct heir was available, the nobles and prelates chose a ruler, but their choice was restricted to members of the royal family.
The Sassanid nobility was a mixture of old Parthian clans, Persian aristocratic families, and noble families from subjected territories. Many new noble families had risen after the dissolution of the Parthian dynasty, while several of the once-dominant Seven Parthian clans remained of high importance. At the court of Ardashir I, the old Arsacid families of the House of Karen and the House of Suren, along with several other families, the Varazes and Andigans, held positions of great honor. Alongside these Iranian and non-Iranian noble families, the kings of Merv, Abarshahr, Carmania, Sakastan, Iberia, and Adiabene, who are mentioned as holding positions of honor amongst the nobles, appeared at the court of the "Shahanshah". Indeed, the extensive domains of the Surens, Karens and Varazes, had become part of the original Sassanid state as semi-independent states. Thus, the noble families that attended at the court of the Sassanid empire continued to be ruling lines in their own right, although subordinate to the "Shahanshah".
In general, "Wuzurgan" from Persian families held the most powerful positions in the imperial administration, including governorships of border provinces (Marzban مرزبان). Most of these positions were patrimonial, and many were passed down through a single family for generations. The "Marzbans" of greatest seniority were permitted a silver throne, while Marzbans of the most strategic border provinces, such as the Caucasus province, were allowed a golden throne. In military campaigns, the regional Marzbans could be regarded as field marshals, while lesser spahbeds could command a field army.
Culturally, the Sassanids implemented a system of social stratification. This system was supported by Zoroastrianism, which was established as the state religion. Other religions appear to have been largely tolerated (although this claim is the subject of heated discussion; see, for example, Wiesehöfer, "Ancient Persia", or the "Cambridge History of Iran", vol. 3). Sassanid emperors consciously sought to resuscitate Persian traditions and to obliterate Greek cultural influence.
Sasanian military.
The active army of the Sassanid Empire originated from Ardashir I, the first Shahanshah of the empire. Ardashir restored the Achaemenid military organizations, retained the Parthian cavalry model, and employed new types of armour and siege warfare techniques.
Role of priests.
The relationship between priests and warriors was important, because the concept of Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire would not have survived in its beginning stages. Because of this relationship between the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried to impose their power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.
Infantry.
The Paighan formed the bulk of the Sassanid infantry, and were often recruited from the peasant population. Each unit was headed by an officer called a "Paighan-Salar," which meant "commander of the infantry" and their main task was to guard the baggage train, serve as pages to the Sarvan (a higher rank), storm fortification walls, undertake entrenchment projects, and excavate mines.
Those serving in the infantry were fitted with shields and lances. To make the size of their army larger, the Sassanids added soldiers provided by the Medes and the Dailamites to their own. The Medes provided the Sassanid army with high-quality javelin throwers, slingers and heavy infantry. Iranian infantry are described by Ammianus Marcellinus as "armed like gladiators" and "obey orders like so many horse-boys". The Dailamite people also served as infantry and were Iranian people who lived mainly within Gilan, Iranian Azerbaijan and Mazandaran. They are reported as having fought with weapons such as daggers, swords and javelins and reputed to have been recognized by Romans for their skills and hardiness in close-quarter combat. One account of Dailamites recounted their participation in an invasion of Yemen where 800 of them were led by the Sarvan officer Vahriz. Vahriz would eventually defeat the Arab forces in Yemen and its capital Sana'a making it a Persian vassal until the invasion of Persia by Arabs.
Navy.
The Sassanid navy was an important constituent of the Sassanid military from the time that Ardashir I conquered the Arab side of the Persian gulf. Because controlling the Persian gulf was an economic necessity, the Sassanid navy worked to keep it safe from piracy, prevent Roman encroachment, and keep the Arab tribes from getting hostile. However, it is believed by many historians that the naval force could not have been a strong one, as the men serving in the navy were those who were confined in prisons.
Cavalry.
The cavalry used during the Sassanid Empire were two types of heavy cavalry units: Clibanarii and Cataphracts. The first cavalry force, composed of elite noblemen trained since youth for military service, was supported by light cavalry, infantry and archers. Mercenaries and tribal people of the empire, including the Turks, Kushans, Khazars, Georgians, and Armenians were included in these first cavalry units. The second cavalry involved the use of the war elephants. In fact, it was their specialty to deploy elephants as cavalry support.
Unlike the Parthians, the Sassanids developed advanced siege engines. The development of siege weapons was a useful weapon during conflicts with Rome, in which success hinged upon the ability to seize cities and other fortified points; conversely, the Sassanids also developed a number of techniques for defending their own cities from attack. The Sassanid army was much like the preceding Parthian army, although some of the Sassanid's heavy cavalry were equipped with lances, while Parthian armies were heavily equipped with bows. The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus's description of Shapur II's clibanarii cavalry manifestly shows how heavily equipped it was, and how only a portion were spear equipped:
Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry lacked a stirrup. Instead, they used a war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved across the top of the rider's thighs. This allowed the horsemen to stay in the saddle at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.
The Byzantine emperor Maurikios also emphasizes in his "Strategikon" that many of the Sassanid heavy cavalry did not carry spears, relying on their bows as their primary weapons. However the Taq-i Bustan reliefs and Al-Tabari's famed list of equipment required for dihqan knights which included the lance, provide a contrast. What is certain is that the horseman's paraphernalia was extensive.
The amount of money involved in maintaining a warrior of the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste required a small estate, and the Asawaran (Azatan) knightly caste received that from the throne, and in return, were the throne's most notable defenders in time of war.
Relations with neighboring regimes.
Frequent warfare with neighbors.
The Sassanids, like the Parthians, were in constant hostilities with the Roman Empire. Following the division of the Roman Empire in 395, the Eastern Roman Empire, with its capital at Constantinople, replaced the Roman Empire as Persia's principal western enemy. Hostilities between the two empires became more frequent.
The Sassanids, similar to the Roman Empire, were in a constant state of conflict with neighboring kingdoms and nomadic hordes. Although the threat of nomadic incursions could never be fully resolved, the Sassanids generally dealt much more successfully with these matters than did the Romans, due to their policy of making coordinated campaigns against threatening nomads.
In the west, Sassanid territory abutted that of the large and stable Roman state, but to the east, its nearest neighbors were the Kushan Empire and nomadic tribes such as the White Huns. The construction of fortifications such as Tus citadel or the city of Nishapur, which later became a center of learning and trade, also assisted in defending the eastern provinces from attack.
In south and central Arabia, Bedouin Arab tribes occasionally raided the Sassanid empire. The Kingdom of Al-Hirah, a Sassanid vassal kingdom, was established to form a buffer zone between the empire's heartland and the Bedouin tribes. The dissolution of the Kingdom of Al-Hirah by Khosrau II in 602, contributed greatly to decisive Sassanid defeats suffered against Bedouin Arabs later in the century. These defeats resulted in a sudden takeover of the Sassanid empire by Bedouin tribes under the Islamic banner.
In the north, Khazars and other Turkic nomads frequently assaulted the northern provinces of the empire. They plundered Media in 634. Shortly thereafter, the Persian army defeated them and drove them out. The Sassanids built numerous fortifications in the Caucasus region to halt these attacks.
War with Axum.
In 522, before Khosrau's reign, a group of monophysite Axumites led an attack on the dominant Himyarites of southern Arabia. The local Arab leader was able to resist the attack but appealed to the Sassanians for aid, while the Axumites subsequently turned towards the Byzantines for help. The Axumites sent another force across the Red Sea and this time successfully killed the Arab leader and replaced him with an Axumite man to be king of the region.
In 531, Justinian suggested that the Axumites of Yemen should cut out the Persians from Indian trade by maritime trade with the Indians. The Ethiopians never met this request because an Axumite general named Abraha took control of the Yemenite throne and created an independent nation. After Abraha's death one of his sons, Ma'd-Karib, went into exile while his half-brother took the throne. After being denied by Justinian, Ma'd-Karib sought help from Khosrau, who sent a small fleet and army under commander Vahriz to depose the new king of Yemen. After capturing the capital city San'a'l, Ma'd-Karib's son, Saif, was put on the throne.
Justinian was ultimately responsible for Sassanian maritime presence in Yemen. By not providing the Yemenite Arabs support, Khosrau was able to help Ma'd-Karib and subsequently established Yemen as a principality of the Sassanian Empire.
Relations with China.
Like their predecessors the Parthians, the Sassanid Empire carried out active foreign relations with China, and ambassadors from Persia frequently traveled to China. Chinese documents report on thirteen Sassanid embassies to China. Commercially, land and sea trade with China was important to both the Sassanid and Chinese Empires. Large numbers of Sassanid coins have been found in southern China, confirming maritime trade.
On different occasions, Sassanid kings sent their most talented Persian musicians and dancers to the Chinese imperial court at Luoyang during the Jin and Northern Wei dynasties, and to Chang'an during the Sui and Tang dynasties. Both empires benefited from trade along the Silk Road and shared a common interest in preserving and protecting that trade. They cooperated in guarding the trade routes through central Asia, and both built outposts in border areas to keep caravans safe from nomadic tribes and bandits.
Politically, there is evidence of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy, the Hephthalites. Upon the rise of the nomadic Göktürks in Inner Asia, there is also what looks like a collaboration between China and Sassanid to defuse Turkic advances. Documents from Mt. Mogh talk about the presence of a Chinese general in the service of the king of Sogdiana at the time of the Arab invasions.
Following the invasion of Iran by Muslim Arabs, Peroz III, son of Yazdegerd III, escaped along with a few Persian nobles and took refuge in the Chinese imperial court. Both Peroz and his son Narsieh (Chinese "neh-shie") were given high titles at the Chinese court. On at least two occasions, the last possibly in 670, Chinese troops were sent with Peroz in order to restore him to the Sassanid throne with mixed results, one possibly ending in a short rule of Peroz in Sistan (Sakestan), from which we have a few remaining numismatic evidences. Narsieh later attained the position of a commander of the Chinese imperial guards, and his descendants lived in China as respected princes. The sister of the Sassanian Prince Peroz III was married into the imperial court, which allowed Sassanian refugees fleeing from the Arab conquest to settle in China. The Emperor of China at this time was Emperor Gaozong of Tang.
Relations with India.

Following the conquest of Iran and neighboring regions, Shapur I extended his authority eastwards into the northwestern Indian subcontinent (Pakistan and Afghanistan). The previously autonomous Kushans were obliged to accept his suzerainty. These were the western Kushans with control of Afghanistan while the eastern Kushans were still active in India. Although the Kushan empire declined at the end of the 3rd century, to be replaced by the Indian Gupta Empire in the 4th century, it is clear that the Sassanids remained relevant in India's northwest throughout this period. The Sassanid rulers exchanged ambassadors with the south Indian Chalukya dynasty during the reign of Pulakesi II.
Persia and northwestern India engaged in cultural as well as political intercourse during this period, as certain Sassanid practices spread into the Kushan territories. In particular, the Kushans were influenced by the Sassanid conception of kingship, which spread through the trade of Sassanid silverware and textiles depicting emperors hunting or dispensing justice.
This cultural interchange did not, however, spread Sassanid religious practices or attitudes to the Kushans. While the Sassanids always adhered to a stated policy of religious proselytization, and sporadically engaged in persecution or forced conversion of minority religions, the Kushans preferred to adopt a policy of religious tolerance.
Lower-level cultural interchanges also took place between India and Persia during this period. For example, Persians imported chess from India and changed the game's name from "chaturanga" to "chatrang". In exchange, Persians introduced backgammon to India.
During Khosrau I's reign, many books were brought from India and translated into Pahlavi, the language of the Sassanid Empire. Some of these later found their way into the literature of the Islamic world. A notable example of this was the translation of the Indian "Panchatantra" by one of Khosrau's ministers, Borzuya. This translation, known as the "Kelileh va Demneh", later made its way into Arabia and Europe. The details of Burzoe's legendary journey to India and his daring acquisition of the Panchatantra are written in full details in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, which says:
Culture.
Society.
Sassanid society and civilization were among the most flourishing of their time, rivaled in their region only by the Byzantine civilization. The amount of scientific and intellectual exchange between the two empires bears witness to the competition and cooperation of these cradles of civilization.
In contrast to Parthian society, the Sassanids renewed emphasis on charismatic and centralized government. In Sassanid theory, the ideal society could maintain stability and justice, and the necessary instrument for this was a strong monarch.
Sassanid society was immensely complex, with separate systems of social organization governing numerous different groups within the empire. Historians believe society comprised four
social classes:
At the center of the Sassanid caste system the "Shahanshah" ruled over all the nobles. The royal princes, petty rulers, great landlords and priests, together constituted a privileged stratum, and were identified as "Wuzurgan", or nobles. This social system appears to have been fairly rigid.
The Sassanid caste system outlived the empire, continuing in the early Islamic period.
Education.
There was a major school, called the Grand School, in the capital. In the beginning, only 50 students were allowed to study at the Grand School. In less than 100 years, enrollment at the Grand School was over 30,000 students.
Membership in a class was based on birth, although it was possible for an exceptional individual to move to another class on the basis of merit. The function of the king was to ensure that each class remained within its proper boundaries, so that the strong did not oppress the weak, nor the weak the strong. To maintain this social equilibrium was the essence of royal justice, and its effective functioning depended on the glorification of the monarchy above all other classes.
On a lower level, Sassanid society was divided into Azatan (freemen), who jealously guarded their status as descendants of ancient Aryan conquerors, and the mass of originally non-Aryan peasantry. The Azatan formed a large low-aristocracy of low-level administrators, mostly living on small estates. The Azatan provided the cavalry backbone of Sassanid army.
Art, science and literature.
The Sassanid kings were enlightened patrons of letters and philosophy. Khosrau I had the works of Plato and Aristotle translated into Pahlavi taught at Gundishapur, and even read them himself. During his reign, many historical annals were compiled, of which the sole survivor is the Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan (Deeds of Ardashir), a mixture of history and romance that served as the basis of the Iranian national epic, the Shahnameh. When Justinian I closed the schools of Athens, seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at Khosrau's court. In time they grew homesick, and in his treaty of 533 with Justinian, the Sassanid king stipulated that the Greek sages should be allowed to return and be free from persecution.
Under Khosrau I, the Academy of Gundishapur, which had been founded in the 5th century, became "the greatest intellectual center of the time", drawing students and teachers from every quarter of the known world. Nestorian Christians were received there, and brought Syriac translations of Greek works in medicine and philosophy. Neoplatonists too, came to Gundishapur, where they planted the seeds of Sufi mysticism; the medical lore of India, Persia, Syria and Greece mingled there to produce a flourishing school of therapy.
Artistically, the Sassanid period witnessed some of the highest achievements of Iranian civilization. Much of what later became known as Muslim culture, including architecture and writing, was originally drawn from Persian culture. At its peak, the Sassanid Empire stretched from Syria to northwest India, but its influence was felt far beyond these political boundaries. Sassanid motifs found their way into the art of Central Asia and China, the Byzantine Empire, and even Merovingian France. Islamic art however, was the true heir to Sassanid art, whose concepts it was to assimilate while, at the same time instilling fresh life and renewed vigor into it. According to Will Durant:
Sassanid carvings at Taq-e Bostan and Naqsh-e Rustam were colored; so were many features of the palaces; but only traces of such painting remain. The literature, however, makes it clear that the art of painting flourished in Sasanian times; the prophet Mani is reported to have founded a school of painting; Firdowsi speaks of Persian magnates adorning their mansions with pictures of Iranian heroes; and the poet al-Buhturi describes the murals in the palace at Ctesiphon. When a Sasanian king died, the best painter of the time was called upon to make a portrait of him for a collection kept in the royal treasury.
Painting, sculpture, pottery, and other forms of decoration shared their designs with Sasanian textile art. Silks, embroideries, brocades, damasks, tapestries, chair covers, canopies, tents and rugs were woven with patience and masterly skill, and were dyed in warm tints of yellow, blue and green. Every Persian but the peasant and the priest aspired to dress above his class; presents often took the form of sumptuous garments; and great colorful carpets had been an appendage of wealth in the East since Assyrian days. The two dozen Sasanian textiles that have survived are among the most highly valued fabrics in existence. Even in their own day, Sasanian textiles were admired and imitated from Egypt to the Far East; and during the Middle Ages, they were favored for clothing the relics of Christian saints. When Heraclius captured the palace of Khosru Parvez at Dastagerd, delicate embroideries and an immense rug were among his most precious spoils. Famous was the "Winter Carpet", also known as "Khosro's Spring" (Spring Season Carpet قالى بهارستان) of Khosru Anushirvan, designed to make him forget winter in its spring and summer scenes: flowers and fruits made of inwoven rubies and diamonds grew, in this carpet, beside walks of silver and brooks of pearls traced on a ground of gold. Harun al-Rashid prided himself on a spacious Sasanian rug thickly studded with jewelry. Persians wrote love poems about their rugs.
Studies on Sassanid remains show over 100 types of crowns being worn by Sassanid kings. The various Sassanid crowns demonstrate the cultural, economic, social and historical situation in each period. The crowns also show the character traits of each king in this era. Different symbols and signs on the crowns–the moon, stars, eagle and palm, each illustrate the wearer's religious faith and beliefs.
The Sassanid Dynasty, like the Achaemenid, originated in the province of Pars. The Sassanids saw themselves as successors of the Achaemenids, after the Hellenistic and Parthian interlude, and believed that it was their destiny to restore the greatness of Persia.
In reviving the glories of the Achaemenid past, the Sassanids were no mere imitators. The art of this period reveals an astonishing virility, in certain respects anticipating key features of Islamic art. Sassanid art combined elements of traditional Persian art with Hellenistic elements and influences. The conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great had inaugurated the spread of Hellenistic art into Western Asia. Though the East accepted the outward form of this art, it never really assimilated its spirit. Already in the Parthian period, Hellenistic art was being interpreted freely by the peoples of the Near East. Throughout the Sassanid period, there was reaction against it. Sassanid art revived forms and traditions native to Persia, and in the Islamic period, these reached the shores of the Mediterranean. According to Fergusson:
Surviving palaces illustrate the splendor in which the Sassanid monarchs lived. Examples include palaces at Firuzabad and Bishapur in Fars, and the capital city of Ctesiphon in Khvarvaran province, Iraq. In addition to local traditions, Parthian architecture influenced Sassanid architectural characteristics. All are characterized by the barrel-vaulted iwans introduced in the Parthian period. During the Sassanid period, these reached massive proportions, particularly at Ctesiphon. There, the arch of the great vaulted hall, attributed to the reign of Shapur I (241–272), has a span of more than and reaches a height of . This magnificent structure fascinated architects in the centuries that followed and has been considered one of the most important examples of Persian architecture. Many of the palaces contain an inner audience hall consisting, as at Firuzabad, of a chamber surmounted by a dome. The Persians solved the problem of constructing a circular dome on a square building by employing squinches, or arches built across each corner of the square, thereby converting it into an octagon on which it is simple to place the dome. The dome chamber in the palace of Firuzabad is the earliest surviving example of the use of the squinch, suggesting that this architectural technique was probably invented in Persia.
The unique characteristic of Sassanid architecture was its distinctive use of space. The Sassanid architect conceived his building in terms of masses and surfaces; hence the use of massive walls of brick decorated with molded or carved stucco. Stucco wall decorations appear at Bishapur, but better examples are preserved from Chal Tarkhan near Rey (late Sassanid or early Islamic in date), and from Ctesiphon and Kish in Mesopotamia. The panels show animal figures set in roundels, human busts, and geometric and floral motifs.
At Bishapur, some of the floors were decorated with mosaics showing scenes of banqueting. The Roman influence here is clear, and the mosaics may have been laid by Roman prisoners. Buildings were decorated with wall paintings. Particularly fine examples have been found on Mount Khajeh in Sistan.
Industry and trade.
Persian industry under the Sassanids developed from domestic to urban forms. Guilds were numerous. Good roads and bridges, well patrolled, enabled state post and merchant caravans to link Ctesiphon with all provinces; and harbors were built in the Persian Gulf to quicken trade with India. Sassanid merchants ranged far and wide and gradually ousted Romans from the lucrative Indian ocean trade routes. Recent archeological discovery has shown an interesting fact that Sassanids used special labels (commercial labels) on goods as a way of promoting their brands and distinguish between different qualities.
Khosrau I further extended the already vast trade network. The Sassanid state now tended toward monopolistic control of trade, with luxury goods assuming a far greater role in the trade than heretofore, and the great activity in building of ports, caravanserais, bridges and the like, was linked to trade and urbanization. The Persians dominated international trade, both in the Indian Ocean, Central Asia and South Russia, in the time of Khosrau, although competition with the Byzantines was at times intense. Sassanian settlements in Oman and Yemen testify to the importance of trade with India, but the silk trade with China was mainly in the hands of Sassanid vassals and the Iranian people, the Sogdians.
The main exports of the Sassanids were silk; woolen and golden textiles; carpets and rugs; hides; and, leather and pearls from the Persian Gulf. There were also goods in transit from China (paper, silk) and India (spices), which Sassanid customs imposed taxes upon, and which were re-exported from the Empire to Europe.
It was also a time of increased metallurgical production, so Iran earned a reputation as the "armory of Asia". Most of the Sassanid mining centers were at the fringes of the Empire – in Armenia, the Caucasus and above all, Transoxania. The extraordinary mineral wealth of the Pamir Mountains on the eastern horizon of the Sassanid empire led to a legend among the Tajiks, an Iranian people living there, which is still told today. It said that when God was creating the world, he tripped over Pamirs, dropping his jar of minerals, which spread across the region.
Religion.
Zoroastrianism.
Under Parthian rule, Zoroastrianism had fragmented into regional variations which also saw the rise of local cult-deities, some from Iranian religious tradition but others drawn from Greek tradition too. Greek paganism and religious ideas had spread and mixed with Zoroastrianism when Alexander the Great had conquered the Persian Empire from Darius III; a process of Greco-Persian religious and cultural synthesisation which had continued into the Parthian era too. But under the Sassanids, an orthodox Zoroastrianism was revived and the religion would undergo numerous and important developments.
Sassanid Zoroastrianism would develop to have clear distinctions from the practices laid out in the Avesta, the holy books of Zoroastrianism. It is often argued that the Sassanid Zoroastrian clergy later modified the religion in a way to serve themselves, causing substantial religious uneasiness. Sassanid religious policies contributed to the flourishing of numerous religious reform movements, the most important of these being the Mani and Mazdak religions.
Indeed, the relationship between the Sassanid Kings and the religions practiced in their empire were complex and varied. For instance, while Shapur I tolerated and encouraged a variety of religions and seems to have been a Zurvanite himself, religious minorities at times were suppressed under later Kings, such as Bahram II. Shapur II, on the other hand, was tolerant of most religious groups except Christians, whom he only persecuted in the wake of Constantine's conversion.
Tansar and the Persian magi's justification for Ardashir I's rebellion.
From the very beginning of Sassanid rule an orthodox Pars-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century CE. After Ardashir I had deposed the last Parthian King, Artabanus V, he sought the aid of Tansar, a "herbad" (high priest) of the Persian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of Iran to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the Letter of Tansar, which was addressed to Gushnasp, the vassal king of Tabarestan. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may have been good for the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of the old ways had been good, and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The "Letter of Tansar" included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attemptd to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.
Tansar would later help to oversee that a single 'Zoroastrian church' was created under the control of the Persian magi, alongside the establishment of a single set of Avestan texts, which were approved and authorised by himself.
The influence of Kartir.
Kartir was a very powerful and influential Persian cleric who served under several Sassanid Kings and actively campaigned for the establishment of a Pars-centred Zoroastrian orthodoxy across the Sassanid Empire. His power and influence came to be so much that he was the only 'commoner' to later be allowed to have his own rock inscriptions carved in the royal fashion (at Sar Mashhad, Naqsh-e Rostam, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht and Naqsh-e Rajab). Under Shapur I, Kartir was made the 'absolute authority' over the 'order of priests' at the Sassanid court and throughout the empire's regions too, with the implication that all regional Zoroastrian clergies would now for the first time be subordinated the Persian Zoroastrian clerics of Pars. To some extent Kartir was an iconoclast and took it upon himself to help establish numerous Bahram fires throughout Iran in the place of the 'bagins / ayazans' (monuments and temples containing images and idols of cult-deities) that had proliferated during the Parthian era. In expressing his doctrinal orthodoxy, Kartir also encouraged an obscure Zoroastrian concept known as "khvedodah" among the common-folk (marriage within the family; between siblings, cousins). At various stages during his long career at court, Kartir also oversaw the periodic persecution of the non-Zoroastrians in Iran, and secured the execution of the prophet Mani during the reign of Bahram I. During the reign of Hormizd I (the predecessor and brother of Bahram I) Kartir was awarded the new Zoroastrian title of "mobad" – a clerical title that was to be considered higher than that of the eastern-Iranian (Parthian) title of "herbad".
Zoroastrian calendar reforms under the Sasanians.
The Persians had long known of the Egyptian calendar, with its 365 days divided into 12 months. However, the traditional Zoroastrian calendar had 12 months of 30 days each. During the reign of Ardashir I, an effort was made to introduce a more accurate Zoroastrian calendar for the year, so 5 extra days were added to it. These 5 extra days were named the Gatha days and had a practical as well as religious use. However, they were still kept apart from the 'religious year', so as not to disturb the long-held observances of the older Zoroastrian calendar.
Some difficulties arose with the introduction of the first calendar reform, particularly the pushing forward of important Zoroastrian festivals such as Hamaspat-maedaya and Nowruz on the calendar year by year. This confusion apparently caused much distress among ordinary people, and while the Sassanid's tried to enforce the observance of these great celebrations on the new official dates, much of the populace continued to observe them on the older, traditional dates, and so parallel celebrations for Nowruz and other Zoroastrian celebrations would often occur within days of each other, in defiance of the new official calendar dates, causing much confusion and friction between the layperson and the ruling class. A compromise on this by the Sassanid's was later introduced, by linking the parallel celebrations as a 6-day celebration/feast. This was done for all except Nowruz.
A further problem occurred as Nowruz had shifted in position during this period from the spring equinox to autumn, although this inconsistency with the original spring equinox date for Nowruz had possibly occurred during the Parthian period too.
Further calendar reforms occurred during the later Sassanid era. Ever since the reforms under Ardashir I there had been no intercalation and so with a quarter day being lost each year the Zoroastrian holy year had slowly slipped backwards, with Nowruz eventually ending up in July. A great council was therefore convened and it was decided that Nowruz be moved back to the original position it had during the Achaemenid period; that being during spring. This changed probably took placed during the reign of Kavad I in the early 6th century CE. Much emphasis seems to have been placed during this period on the importance of spring and its connection with the resurrection and "Frashegerd".
The three Great Fires.
Reflecting the regional rivalry and bias the Sassanid's are believed to have held against their Parthian predecessors, it was probably during the Sassanid era that the two great fires in Pars and Media - the "Adur Farnbag" and "Adur Gushnasp" respectively - were promoted to rival, and even eclipse, the sacred fire in Parthia, the "Adur Burzen-Mehr". The Adur Burzen-Mehr, being that it was said to be linked (in legend) with Zoroaster and Vishtaspa (the first Zoroastrian King) was too holy for the Persian magi to put an end to veneration for it, however, it was demoted during the Sassanid era.
It was therefore during the Sassanid era that the three "Great Fires" of the Zoroastrian world were given specific associations. The "Adur Farnbag" in Pars was associated with the magi, "Adur Gushnasp" in Media with warriors, and "Adur Burzen-Mehr" in Parthia with the lowest estate; farmers and herdsmen.
The "Adur Gushnasp" eventually became, by custom, a place of pilgrimage by foot for newly enthroned Kings after their coronation. It is likely that during the Sassanid era that these three "Great Fires" became central places for pilgrimage among Zoroastrians.
Iconoclasm and the elevation of Persian over other Iranian languages.
The early Sassanids ruled against the use of cult images in worship, and so statues and idols were removed from many temples and where possible, sacred fires were installed instead. This policy was extended even to the 'non-Iran' regions of the empire during some periods. Hormizd I is said to have destroyed statues erected for the dead in Armenia. However, only cult-statues were removed. The Sassanids continued to use images to represent the deities of Zoroastrianism, including that of Ahura Mazda, in the tradition that was established during the Seleucid era.
In the early Sassanid period royal inscriptions often consisted of Parthian, Middle Persian and Greek. However, the last time Parthian was used for a royal inscription came during the reign of Narseh, son of Shapur I. It is likely therefore that soon after this, the Sassanids made the decision to impose Persian as the sole official language within Iran, and forbade the use of written Parthian. The result of this had important consequences for Zoroastrianism, given that all secondary literature, including the Zand, were then recorded only in Middle Persian, having a profound impact in orienting Zoroastrianism towards the influence of the Pars region, the homeland of the Sassanids.
Developments in Zoroastrian literature & liturgy by the Sassanids.
Some scholars of Zoroastrianism such as Mary Boyce have speculated that it is possible that the "yasna" service was lengthened during the Sassanid era 'to increase its impressiveness'. This appears to have been done by joining the Gathic "Staota Yesnya" with the "haoma" ceremony. Furthermore, it is believed that another longer service developed, known as the "Visperad", which derived from the extended yasna. This was developed for the celebration of the seven holy days of obligation (the "Gahambars" plus "Nowruz") and was dedicated to "Ahura Mazda".
While the very earliest Zoroastrians eschewed writing as a form of demonic practice, the Middle Persian Zand, along with much secondary Zoroastrian literature, was recorded in writing during the Sassanid era for the first time. Many of these Zoroastrian texts were original works from the Sassanid period. Perhaps the most important of these works was the "Bundahishn" – the mythical Zoroastrian story of 'Creation'. Other older works, some from remote antiquity, were possibly translated from different Iranian languages into Middle Persian during this period. For example, two works, the "Drakht Asurig" (Assyrian Tree) and "Ayadgar-i Zareran" (Exploits of Zarter) were probably translated from Parthian originals.
Of great importance for Zoroastrianism was the creation of the Avestan alphabet by the Sassanids, which enabled the accurate rendering of the Avesta in written form (including in its original language/phonology) for the first time. The alphabet was based on the Pahlavi one, but rather than the inadequacy of that script for recording spoken Middle Persian, the Avestan alphabet had 46 letters, and was well suited to recording Avestan in written form in the way the language actually sounded and was uttered. The Persian magi where therefore finally able to record all surviving ancient Avestan texts in written form.
As a result of this development, the Sassanid Avesta was then complied into 21 nasks (divisions) to correspond with the 21 words of the "Ahunavar" invocation. The nasks were further divided into 3 groups of 7. The first group contained the "Gathas" and all texts associated with them, while the second group contained works of scholastic learning. The final section contained treatises of instruction for the magi, such as the "Vendidad", law-texts and other works, such as "yashts".
An important literary text, the "Khwaday-Namag" (Book of Kings) was composed during the Sassanid era. This text is the basis of which the later "Shahnameh" of Ferdowsi drew from. Another important Zoroastrian text from the Sassanid period includes the "Dadestan-e Menog-e Khrad" (Judgements of the Spirit of Wisdom).
Christianity.
Christians in the Sassanid Empire belonged mainly to the Nestorian Church (Church of the East) and the Jacobite Church (Syriac Orthodox Church) branches of Christianity. Although these churches originally maintained ties with Christian churches in the Roman Empire, they were indeed quite different from them. One reason for this was that the liturgical language of the Nestorian and Jacobite Churches was Syriac rather than Greek, the language of Roman Christianity during the early centuries (and the language of Eastern Roman Christianity in later centuries). Another reason for a separation between Eastern and Western Christianity was strong pressure from the Sassanid authorities to sever connections with Rome, since the Sassanid Empire was often at war with the Roman Empire.
Christianity was recognized by king Yazdegerd I in 409 as an allowable faith within the Sassanid Empire. In 410, at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, Mar Isaac was elected as Catholicos of the Church of the East.
The major break with mainstream Christianity came in 431, due to the pronouncements of the First Council of Ephesus. The Council condemned Nestorius, a theologian of Cilician/Kilikian origin and the patriarch of Constantinople, for teaching a view of Christology in accordance with which he refused to call Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, "Theotokos" or Mother of God. While the teaching of the Council of Ephesus was accepted within the Roman Empire, the Sassanid church disagreed with the condemnation of Nestorius' teachings. When Nestorius was deposed as patriarch, a number of his followers fled to the Sassanid Persian Empire. Persian emperors used this opportunity to strengthen Nestorius' position within the Sassanid church (which made up the vast majority of the Christians in the predominantly Zoroastrian Persian Empire) by eliminating the most important pro-Roman clergymen in Persia and making sure that their places were taken by Nestorians. This was to assure that these Christians would be loyal to the Persian Empire, and not to the Roman.
Most of the Christians in the Sassanid empire lived on the western edge of the empire, predominantly in Mesopotamia, but there were also important communities on the island of Tylos (present day Bahrain), the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, the area of the Arabian kingdom of Lakhm, and the Persian part of Armenia. Some of these areas were the earliest to be Christianized; the kingdom of Armenia became the first independent Christian state in the world in 301. While a number of Assyrian territories had almost become fully Christianized even earlier during the 3rd century, they never became independent nations.
Other religions.
Alongside Zoroastrianism, other religions (primarily Judaism, Manicheism and Buddhism) existed in Sassanid society and adherents were largely free to practice and preach their beliefs. A very large Jewish community flourished under Sassanid rule, with thriving centers at Isfahan, Babylon and Khorasan, and with its own semiautonomous "Exilarchate" leadership based in Mesopotamia. Jewish communities suffered only occasional persecution. They enjoyed a relative freedom of religion, and were granted privileges denied to other religious minorities. Shapur I (Shabur Malka in Aramaic) was a particular friend to the Jews. His friendship with Shmuel produced many advantages for the Jewish community. He even offered the Jews in the Sassanid empire a fine white Nisaean horse, just in case the Messiah, who was thought to ride a donkey or a mule, would come. Shapur II, whose mother was Jewish, had a similar friendship with a Babylonian rabbi named Raba. Raba's friendship with Shapur II enabled him to secure a relaxation of the oppressive laws enacted against the Jews in the Persian Empire. Moreover, in the eastern portion of the empire, various Buddhist places of worship, notably in Bamiyan were active as Buddhism gradually became more popular in that region.
Legacy and importance.
The influence of the Sassanid Empire continued long after it ceased to exist. The empire, through the guidance of several able emperors prior to its fall, had achieved a Persian renaissance that would become a driving force behind the civilization of the newly established religion of Islam. In modern Iran and the regions of the Iranosphere, the Sassanid period is regarded as one of the high points of Iranian civilization.
In Europe.
Sassanid culture and military structure had a significant influence on Roman civilization. The structure and character of the Roman army was affected by the methods of Persian warfare. In a modified form, the Roman Imperial autocracy imitated the royal ceremonies of the court of the Sassanids at Ctesiphon, and those in turn had an influence on the ceremonial traditions of the courts of modern Europe. The origin of the formalities of European diplomacy is attributed to the diplomatic relations between the Persian governments and Roman Empire.
In Jewish history.
In Jewish history, the Sassanid Empire is a very important chapter in the expansion of the Jewish faith. The Sassanid period saw major developments such as the construction of the Babylonian Talmud and the establishment of several Jewish orientated academic institutions such as Sura and Pumbedita, which were for centuries the most influential in Jewish scholarship. Several individuals of the Imperial family such as Ifra Hormizd the Queen mother of Shapur II and Queen Shushandukht, the Jewish wife of Yazdegerd I, significantly contributed to the close relations between the Jews of the empire and the government in Ctesiphon.
In India.
The collapse of the Sassanid Empire caused the state religion to be switched from Zoroastrianism to Islam. Zoroastrianism slowly went from a major religion to a persecuted minor religion. For the survival of their faith and their lives, a large number of Zoroastrians chose to emigrate. According to the "Qissa-i Sanjan", one group of those refugees landed in what is now Gujarat, India, where they were allowed greater freedom to observe their old customs and to preserve their faith. The descendants of those Zoroastrians, would play a small but significant role in the development of India. Today there are over 70,000 Zoroastrians in India.
The Zoroastrians, still use a variant of the religious calendar instituted under the Sassanids. That calendar still marks the number of years since the accession of Yazdegerd III, just as it did in 632. ("See also: Zoroastrian calendar")

Everglades High currently has an FCAT school grade of ""A"" for its 2012–13 Academic School Year. with 71% of the students passing the math FCAT and 41% of the students passing the reading FCAT. Everglades has a student to teacher ratio of 22:1, above the state average of 15:1. 
History.
Everglades High School was created to provide students in the Southern District of West Broward a secondary education school. At the time only Miramar High School, Charles W. Flanagan High School, and Cypress Bay High School composed the Southwest Region of secondary High Schools in the Broward Country School District.
The temporary location was at the former Charles W. Flanagan High School's Annex location because of the ongoing final construction of the Everglades main building. The school schedule was held in double sessions during the months at the annex because of the large population, where the class of 2007 freshman had classes from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and upperclassmen had classes from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The class of 2004 of Everglades had a total of 12 senior students.
For the 2007–08 school year, freshmen students were sent to the annex portable site that they had originally used for the school's first class of students. The following 2008-2009 school year, Everglades High School was given new school boundaries due to the newly constructed West Broward High School in the Pembroke Pines area. Since then, all students including freshman take their classes at Everglades High School and the former Charles W. Flanagan Annex is no longer in use for lower-class men.
In 2010, Former Florida Governor Charlie Christ visited the High School to honor the recognition of the school's success in improving test scores and graduation rates. 
In 2012 the Former Principal of Everglades High School, Paul D Fletcher, retired from his position. He had served the school since its opening.

Sai Sai Kham Leng

Sai Sai Kham Leng (; ; also Sai Sai Kham Hlaing; born 10 April 1979) is a well-known Burmese singer-songwriter, model, novelist, and actor of ethnic Shan descent. He is best known for his hip hop music.
Background.
Sai Sai Kham Leng was born on 10 April 1979 in Taunggyi to Cho Cho San Tun and Kham Leng of an ethnic Shan aristocratic family. His great-grandfather Sao San Tun, Saopha of Mongpawng, was a signatory to the 1947 Panglong Agreement that was the basis for the formation of modern Myanmar, and one of nine senior government officials assassinated on 19 July 1947. The day of the assassination is commemorated each year as the Martyrs' Day in Myanmar. The hospital he was delivered in was his great-grandfather's namesake—the Sao San Tun Hospital. He is the eldest son and has two younger sisters and a younger brother. Soon after he was born, his parents moved to nearby Aungban for two years before moving back to Taunggyi. He went to B.E.H.S (1) Taunggyi. His parents divorced when he was got to 4th standard. He was living in two houses soon after the divorce but ended up with his father. He would not see his mother for another six years. He did not recognize his own mother when they met again in Yangon.
Sai Sai attributes his interest in music to his father. He grew up listening to songs by Sai Htee Saing and Aung Yin that his father listened to on a "small mono cassette player". Sai Htee Saing and his father were friends. But it was after his parents' divorce that Sai Sai earnestly took up music. His father bought him a guitar at 5th standard, and he learned to play it by 6th standard. Sai Sai became a judo player at eighth standard. He won district level competitions in high school, and even competed in national youth competitions in Yangon.
Sai Sai came to Yangon and enrolled in Dagon University as an English major. He received his bachelor's degree in English from Dagon University and a graduate diploma in English from the University of Foreign Languages, Yangon. His mother lives in Australia and his father died in 2006.
Career.
Like most children of well-to-do families in Myanmar, Sai Sai entered the Myanmar entertainment industry through connections and self-financing. At Yangon, Sai Sai first tried to modeling but could not get any jobs. He then tried a role in a direct-to-video movie that he and four other friends self-financed in 2000. In the same year, he launched his debut album "Chocolate Yaung Yayge Einmet" (Chocolate-Colored Ice Dreams). The followed-up album "Thangegyin Mya Zwa" (Graduation: Friends Forever) released in 2001 made him a household name.
In his 2012 album "Date Date Kyal", he included a song named "ပြီးခဲ့သောဇာတ်လမ်းအကျဉ်း" (Summary of the story till now) about his 33 years of his life. He celebrates his Birthday shows in April every year, gaining thousands of ticket sales which is a large number in Myanmar. He has celebrated 10 shows from 2004 to 2014 so far.
Personal.
Sai Sai is still single, and lives in Yangon. In a May 2009 interview with People Magazine Myanmar, he expressed that he was unsure about marriage as he comes from a "broken family".
He is one of the Myanmar Celebrities who has several scandals with Females Co-workers. His relationship with Myanmar Actress Wut Hmone Shwe Yee was one of the most famous scandals dealing with celebrities. But they never made it to a public relationship and they broke up after some years. Sai Sai addressed the relationship that he was cheated.
He is a Theravada Buddhist.
Controversies.
In 2014, there are several celebrities signing a petition to change a part of the constitution. He wrote on his official Facebook that he won't sign on the petition because he has only one small brain and one body, so he don't want to be responsible for many things, hinting that he is not interested in Politics. Film director Kyi Phyu Shin stated that she also has one small brain and one body but she will sign on the petition and be responsible for many things, clearly dissing him. Since there are many pressures on him, he signs on the petition and shuts his official Facebook account, upsetting thousand of his fans.

Chamber of Nationalities

The Chamber of Nationalities () was the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Burma (Myanmar) from 1948 to 1962. Under the 1947 Constitution, bills initiated and passed by the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, were to be sent to the Chamber of Nationalities for review and revision. The Chamber of Nationalities was primarily formed to give minorities within Burma some political power in the national government.
It consisted of 125 seats, with the constitution providing for specified numbers of representatives from all states and divisions. 25 seats were allotted to Shan State, 12 to Kachin State, 8 seats to Special Division of the Chins (now Chin State), 3 seats to Karenni State (now Kayah State), 24 to ethnic Karens, and 53 to all other territories (including divisions), including 4 seats reserved specifically for the Anglo-Burmese community. The Parliament was abolished after Ne Win suspended the 1947 Constitution in a 1962 coup d'état. A single-party unicameral People's Assembly replaced the Parliament in 1974. 
Sao Shwe Thaik was Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities 1952–1962.

K2 is a 1991 motion picture loosely based on the story of two friends' ascent of the second-highest mountain on Earth, K2. The story is based on a play written by Patrick Meyers and presented as a senior-thesis at Stanford University. These roles were played by Michael Biehn and Matt Craven. The film was directed by Franc Roddam and written by Patrick Meyers and Scott Roberts, adapting the original stage play by Meyers. The two main characters of the film, Taylor Brooks and Harold Jameson, are loosely based on Jim Wickwire and Louis Reichardt respectively, the first two Americans to summit K2 in 1978. Wickwire and Reichardt are acknowledged in the ending credits.
Plot.
Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and Harold Jameson (Matt Craven) are white-collar professionals by weekday, and accomplished mountain climbers on weekends. Though they share a love for scaling mountains, the two friends are somewhat opposites in their personal lives. Taylor is a thrill-seeking attorney and womanizer, while Harold is a married, level-headed scientist.
On a climb, the pair encounter billionaire Phillip Claiborne (Raymond J. Barry), who is accompanied by a team of fellow climbers. They explain they are testing equipment for a major Himalayan expedition but don't reveal the peak. Brooks meets a climber he remembers from law school, Dallas. That night, two of Claiborne's team ignore Harold's warnings of an impending avalanche and are killed when snow careens down the mountain. Claiborne and the other survivors are rescued only thanks to the quick action of Taylor and Harold. With a hole left in his climbing crew, Taylor begs Claiborne to take him and Harold to join him on his next climb - K2, the second highest peak in the world. Claiborne finally relents and allows the two to join his team.
The entire team heads to the Karakoram in Pakistan and starts the climb successfully, though Taylor butts heads with Dallas while Harold has guilt over leaving his wife to participate. As the ascent continues, the team runs into trouble when their Balti porters strike (mirroring the real-world experiences of several expeditions in the 1970s) and Claiborne becomes ill with altitude sickness. A four-man team (Taylor, Harold, Dallas and Japanese climber Takane) continue the summit with minimal gear. They are stopped when Claiborne makes the decision (talking via radio) to only allow two men to make the final summit, while two wait behind at the high camp. Dallas chooses Takane as the second man to go, and they leave, amidst protest from Taylor and Harold. Later, Takane returns to the tents after a bad fall, in severe hypothermia, dying soon after.
Taylor and Harold decide to try for the summit themselves. After a grueling journey, the pair finish the climb and celebrate. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Harold slips on the descent, badly breaks his leg, and drops the climbing rope. The pain is unbearable and he cannot be moved. Luckily, Taylor soon comes cross Dallas' frozen body, as well as his climbing rope and supply of epinephrine (adrenaline) kept on hand. Taylor injects Harold with an epinephrine autoinjector and then begins to lower his friend to safety, several dozen feet at a time. Despite Harold's pleas, Taylor refuses to abandon him and continue alone. They continue to descend until they reach a ridge, where a helicopter comes into view. The men are saved and celebrate.

Frank S. Besson, Jr.

Frank Schaffer Besson, Jr., CBE (May 30, 1910–July 15, 1985) was born on May 30, 1910 in Detroit, Michigan. His father was a West Point graduate and a Colonel in the Corps of Engineers . Frank S. Besson, Jr. graduated seventh in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1932. In 1935, he received a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His early career was noted for the role he played in the development of portable military pipelines, steel landing mats for airplanes, and steel treadway bridges. He is credited with the studies leading to the Army 's adoption of the Bailey Bridge, used extensively in all theaters in World War II. 
He became Assistant Director of the Third Military Railway Service (with rank of Lieutenant Colonel) in 1943, and was promoted to Director (with rank of Colonel) the following year. As Director of the Third Military Railway Service in Iran from 1944 to 1945, Besson ensured the flow of war materials to the Russian forces through the Persian Corridor. He was promoted to brigadier general, becoming, at 34, the youngest general officer in the Army Ground Forces and Chief of the Railway Division. Toward the end of World War II, he was Deputy Chief Transportation Officer of the Army Forces in the Western Pacific and, when Japan's collapse was imminent, assumed full control of railroads in Japan. During the first year of occupation, General Besson directed the rehabilitation of the Japanese rail system, moving more than 200,000 troops and 150,000 tons of supplies in the first two months. 
Subsequent assignments included a tour as Assistant Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), where General Besson formulated logistics plans and overall programs to meet the complex requirements of the fifteen nations of the NATO alliance. His efforts in instituting a system for "costing out" five-year programs, thereby bringing force goals into consonance with available resources, earned him the first Distinguished Service Medal to be awarded at SHAPE headquarters. 
General Besson stimulated both military and commercial adoption of containerization and improved water terminal practices. He introduced the roll-on/roll-off technique for the rapid loading and discharge of wheeled and tracked vehicles. He further refined these concepts upon assuming command of the Transportation Center and School at Fort Eustis, Virginia in 1953. General Besson was the Chief of Transportation, U.S. Army from March 1958 until April 2, 1962, when he took charge of the U.S. Army Materiel Command. 
General Besson was the first Commander of the Army Materiel Command, formed in 1962 during a major Army reorganization. During his command, the mammoth logistical organization, with an annual budget exceeding $14 billion and an inventory of $21 billion, employed more than 160,000 civilian personnel, in addition to its military complement of 14,000. As the first AMC Commander, General Besson was charged with consolidating six Army technical service organizations into a single command without disrupting effective materiel support for the Army. His success resulted in his receiving the Merit Award of the Armed Forces Management Association in 1963. On May 27, 1964, 53-year-old Frank Besson became the 75th officer in the U.S. Army's 189-year history to wear the four stars of a full general. He was the first Army officer to achieve that rank as head of a logistical organization in peacetime. 
In March 1969, General Besson left AMC to become chairman of the Joint Logistics Review Board, formed to review logistic activities in support of the Vietnam War. He retired in July 1970 and was promptly recalled to active duty to establish procedures to implement the board's recommendation. He permanently retired in October 1970. While in retirement, General Besson was nominated by President Richard M. Nixon as one of the founding directors of the National Rail Passenger Corporation, which ran Amtrak. He was also director of the Services National Bank in Alexandria and of ECR International. On July 15, 1985, General Besson died of cancer at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=47293817.
His awards and decorations include the Army Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Iranian Order of Homayoun, Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and the Republic of Korea's Order of Military Merit, Second Class (Ulchi).

1906 French Grand Prix

The 1906 Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, commonly known as the 1906 French Grand Prix, was a motor race held on 26 and 27 June 1906, on closed public roads outside the city of Le Mans. The Grand Prix was organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF) at the prompting of the French automobile industry as an alternative to the Gordon Bennett races, which limited each competing country's number of entries regardless of the size of its industry. France had the largest automobile industry in Europe at the time, and in an attempt to better reflect this the Grand Prix had no limit to the number of entries by any particular country. The ACF chose a circuit, composed primarily of dust roads sealed with tar, which would be lapped six times on both days by each competitor, a combined race distance of . Lasting for more than 12 hours overall, the race was won by Ferenc Szisz driving for the Renault team. FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro finished second, and Albert Clément was third in a Clément-Bayard.
Paul Baras of Brasier set the fastest lap of the race on his first lap. He held on to the lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, defending it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.
Renault's victory contributed to an increase in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the race has become known as the first Grand Prix. The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the following year, and the German automobile industry to organise the Kaiserpreis, the forerunner to the German Grand Prix, in 1907.
Background.
The first French Grand Prix originated from the Gordon Bennett races, established by American millionaire James Gordon Bennett, Jr. in 1900. Intended to encourage automobile industries through sport, by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become some of the most prestigious in Europe; their formula of closed-road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns, over open roads. Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country, and the winning country earned the right to organise the next race. Entries were limited to three per country, which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers, they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority. Instead, the rule put them on a numerical level footing with countries such as Switzerland, with only one manufacturer, and allowed Mercedes, which had factories in Germany and Austria, to field six entries: three from each country. The French governing body, the Automobile Club de France (ACF), held trials between its manufacturers before each race; in 1904 twenty-nine entries competed for the three positions on offer.
When Léon Théry won the 1904 race for the French manufacturer Richard-Brasier, the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify the format of the 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation. The ACF accepted the proposal, but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation, the limits would remain but would be determined by the size of each country's industry. Under the ACF's proposal, France was allowed fifteen entries, Germany and Britain six, and the remaining countries—Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the United States—three cars each.
The French proposal was met with strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations, and at the instigation of Germany a meeting of the bodies was organised to settle the dispute. Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race, to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race. But when Théry and Richard-Brasier won again in 1905, and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell once more to the ACF, the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement, the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France.
Track.
A combined offer from the city council of Le Mans and local hoteliers to contribute funding to the Grand Prix persuaded the ACF to hold the race on the outskirts of the city, where the Automobile Club de la Sarthe devised a circuit. Running through farmlands and forests, the track, like most circuits of the time, formed a triangle. It started outside the village of Montfort, and headed south-west towards Le Mans. Competitors then took the Fourche hairpin, which turned sharply left and slowed the cars to around , and then an essentially straight road through Bouloire south-east towards Saint-Calais. The town was bypassed with a temporary wooden plank road, as the track headed north on the next leg of the triangle. Another plank road through a forest to a minor road allowed the track to bypass most of the town of Vibraye, before it again headed north to the outskirts of La Ferté-Bernard. A series of left-hand turns took competitors back south-west towards Montfort on the last leg of the triangle, a straight broken by a more technical winding section, near the town of Connerré. Competitors lapped the circuit twelve times over two days, six times on each day, a total distance of .
To address concerns about previous races, during which spectators crowding too close to the track had been killed or injured by cars, the ACF erected of palisade fencing around the circuit, concentrated around towns and villages, and at the ends of lanes, footpaths and roads intersecting the track. The planking used to avoid the towns of Saint-Calais and Vibraye was installed as an alternative to the system used in the Gordon Bennett races, where cars passing through towns would slow down to a set speed and were forbidden to overtake. Several footbridges were erected over the track, and a 2,000-seat canopied grandstand was built at the start and finish line at Montfort. This faced the pit lane on the other side of the track, where the teams were based and could work on the cars. A tunnel under the track connected the grandstand and the pit lane. The road surface was little more than compacted dust and sharp stones which could be easily kicked up by the cars, and to limit the resulting problem of impaired visibility and punctures the ACF sealed the entire length of the track with tar. More was added to the bends of the track after cars running on them during practice broke up the surface.
Entries and cars.
Ten French manufacturers entered cars in the Grand Prix: Clément-Bayard, Hotchkiss, Gobron-Brillié, Darracq, Vulpes, Brasier (the successor to Richard-Brasier), Panhard, Grégoire, Lorraine-Dietrich and Renault. Two teams came from Italy (FIAT and Itala) and one (Mercedes) from Germany. With the exceptions of Gobron-Brillié and Vulpes, which each entered one car, and Grégoire, which entered two cars, each team entered three cars, to make a total field of thirty-four entries. No British or American manufacturers entered the Grand Prix. The British were suspicious that the event was designed as propaganda for the French automobile industry; British magazine "The Motor" quoted French daily newspaper "Le Petit Parisien" as evidence of this supposed lack of sportsmanship.
The ACF imposed a maximum weight limit—excluding tools, upholstery, wings, lights and light fittings—of , with an additional allowed for a magneto or dynamo to be used for ignition. Regulations limited fuel consumption to . Every team opted for a magneto system; all used a low-tension system except Clément-Bayard, Panhard, Hotchkiss, Gobron-Brillié, and Renault, which used high-tension. Mercedes, Brasier, Clément-Bayard, FIAT and Gobron-Brillié used a chain drive system for transmission; the rest used drive shafts. All entries were fitted with four-cylinder engines; engine displacement ranged from for the Grégoire to for the Panhard. Exhaust pipes were directed upwards to limit the dust kicked up off the roads. Teams were allowed to change drivers and equipment, but only at the end of the first day's running, not while the race was in progress.
Michelin, Dunlop and Continental supplied tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's one major technical innovation, Michelin introduced the "jante amovible": a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto the car in the event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife, and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars. As carrying each rim added to the weight of the car over conventional wheels and tyres, some teams—such as Itala and Panhard—could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit.
The Grand Prix name ("Great Prize") referred to the prize of 45,000 French francs to the race winner. The franc was pegged to the gold at 0.290 grams per franc, which meant that the prize was worth 13 kg of gold.
Race.
Roads around the track were closed to the public at 5 am on the morning of the race. A draw took place among the thirteen teams to determine the starting order, and assign each team a number. Each of a team's three entries was assigned a letter, one of "A", "B", or "C". Two lines of cars formed behind the start line at Montfort: cars marked "A" in one line and cars marked "B" in the other. Cars assigned the letter "C" were the last away; they formed a single line at the side of the track so that any cars which had completed their first circuit of the track would be able to pass. Cars were dispatched at 90-second intervals, beginning at 6 am. Lorraine-Dietrich driver Fernand Gabriel (numbered "1A") was scheduled to be the first competitor to start, but he stalled on the line and could not restart his car before the FIAT of Vincenzo Lancia, who was next in line, drove away. Renault's lead driver, the Hungarian Ferenc Szisz, started next, and behind him Victor Hémery of Darracq, Paul Baras of Brasier, Camille Jenatzy of Mercedes, Louis Rigolly of Gobron-Brillié and Alessandro Cagno of Itala. Philippe Tavenaux of Grégoire, scheduled next, was unable to start; the only other non-starter was the sole Vulpes of Marius Barriaux, which was withdrawn before the race when it was found to be over the weight limit. The last of the thirty-two starters—the Clément-Bayard of "de la Touloubre", numbered "13C"—left the start line at 6:49:30 am.
Itala driver Maurice Fabry started the fastest of the competitors; he covered the first kilometre in 43.4 seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52 minutes and 25.4 seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position on the road and into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.
FIAT driver Aldo Weilschott climbed from fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five, before his car rolled off the planks outside Vibraye. Szisz maintained the lead he had gained on lap three to finish the first day just before noon in a time of 5 hours, 45 minutes and 30.4 seconds (5:45:30.4), 26 minutes ahead of Albert Clément of Clément-Bayard. Despite a slow start, FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position, 15 minutes behind Clément. Seventeen cars completed the first day; Henri Rougier's Lorraine-Dietrich finished last with a time of 8:15:55.0, two-and-a-half-hours behind Szisz. All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé, a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF, to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning.
The time each car set on the first day determined the time they set off on the second day, hence Szisz's first-day time of 5 hours and 45 minutes meant he started at 5:45 am. Following the same principle, Clément began at 6:11 am and Nazzaro at 6:26 am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings. A horse, which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an engine starting, towed each competitor out of parc fermé to the start line. As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day's running, Szisz and Clément began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars. Clément completed his stop more quickly than Szisz, and Nazzaro did not stop at all, and so Clément closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on Clément. Jenatzy and Lancia, who were both suffering eye problems from the first day, had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers. As planned, "Burton" took over Jenatzy's car, but Lancia was forced to resume in his street clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start.
Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who finished the first day in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car at the start of the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.
Szisz's Renault suffered a broken rear suspension on the tenth lap, but his lead was so great (more than 30 minutes) that he could afford to drive cautiously with the damage. He took the black flag of the winner at the finish line after a combined total from the two days of 12:12:07.0; he had also been quicker on the straight than any other driver, reaching a top speed of . He finished 32 minutes ahead of second-placed Nazzaro, who was in turn 3 minutes ahead of Clément. Jules Barillier's Brasier was fourth, ahead of Lancia and Panhard driver George Heath. Baras—whose first lap was the fastest of any car during the race—was seventh, ahead of Arthur Duray of Lorraine-Dietrich, "Pierry" of Brasier, and "Burton". The last finisher, the Mercedes driver "Mariaux", was eleventh, more than four hours behind Szisz. Rougier, who had set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 53:16.4, had retired on lap ten after a long series of punctures. Of the other retirements, Hémery, René Hanriot and Louis Wagner of Darracq suffered engine problems; the radiators on the cars of Rigolly of Gobron-Brillié, Xavier Civelli de Bosch of Grégoire and Cagno of Itala failed; Pierre de Caters of Itala, Shepard and Hubert Le Blon of Hotchkiss, A. Villemain of Clément-Bayard and Vincenzo Florio of Mercedes withdrew after wheel failures; Gabriel of Lorraine-Dietrich, "de la Touloubre" of Clément-Bayard and Henri Tart of Panhard retired because of other mechanical problems; and Fabry of Itala, Weilschott of FIAT, Teste of Panhard, Richez of Renault and Jacques Salleron of Hotchkiss suffered crash damage. Edmond of Renault was the only competitor whose retirement was the result of driver injury.
Post-race and legacy.
The top three finishers were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies. In an interview after the race, Szisz reflected on the "anxiety" he had felt as he drove the final laps: "I feared something small which would take away victory at the moment when it had seemed to be won." The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600 cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.
Reflections on the race by the organisers and the media generally concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant that there had been very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's detachable rims. Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have the rims, and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the German Grand Prix, the Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Prize) was raced in 1907.
The conference held in 1904 to consider the French proposal for a change in formula to the Gordon Bennett races led to the formation of the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR; the predecessor of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile), the body responsible for regulating international motorsport. Although a smaller race held in 1901 had awarded the "Grand Prix de Pau", the 1906 race outside Le Mans was the first genuinely international race to carry the label "Grand Prix". Until the First World War it was the only annual race to be called a Grand Prix (often, "the" Grand Prix), and is commonly known as "the first Grand Prix".

Saladoid

Saladoid culture is a pre-Columbian indigenous culture of territory in present-day Venezuela and the Caribbean that flourished from 500 BCE to 545 CE. Concentrated along the lowlands of the Orinoco River, the people migrated by sea to the Lesser Antilles, and then to Puerto Rico. 
Name.
They have been given the name of the sites where their unique pottery styles were first recognised. The suffix "oid" has been added in this cultural classification. Hence, the name Saladoid is used by archaeologists, to identify the peoples of the early ceramic age.
Chronology.
The Saladoid period includes the four following subcultures, defined by ceramic styles.
Migrations.
This culture is thought to have originated at the lower Orinoco River near the modern settlements of Saladero and Barrancas in Venezuela. Seafaring people from the lowland region of the Orinoco River migrated into and established settlements in the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. They displaced the pre-ceramic Ortoiroid culture. As a horticultural people, they initially occupied wetter and more fertile islands that could best support agriculture. These Indigenous peoples of the Americas were an Arawak-speaking culture. 
Between 500-280 BCE, they immigrated into the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico, eventually making up a large portion of what was to become a single Caribbean culture. In Puerto Rico, evidence of their historic settlements is found mainly in the western part of the island.
Culture.
Saladoid people are characterized by agriculture, ceramic production, and sedentary settlements. Their unique and highly decorated pottery has enabled archaeologists to recognize their sites and to determine their places of origin. Saladoid ceramics include zoomorphic effigy vessels, incense burners, platters, trays, jars, bowls with strap handles, and bell-shaped containers. The red pottery was painted with white, orange, and black slips.
Distinctive Saladoid artifacts are stone pendants, shaped like raptors from South America. These were made from a range of exotic materials, including such as carnelian, turquoise, lapis lazuli, amethyst, crystal quartz, jasper-chalcedony, and fossilized wood. These were traded through the Great and Lesser Antilles and the South American mainland, until 600 CE.

Easter eggs in Microsoft products

Some of Microsoft's early products included hidden Easter eggs. Microsoft formally stopped including Easter eggs in its programs as part of its Trustworthy Computing Initiative in 2002.
Microsoft Bear.
The Microsoft Bear is a mascot of the Windows 3.1 (and later Windows 95) team. It was the teddy bear that one of the senior developers on the team used to carry around. He makes several cameo appearances in Windows:
Microsoft Bunny.
During the development of Microsoft Windows 95 the shell developers had several stuffed animals as mascots. One was Bear, who was a hold over from Windows 3.1. There were two others, bunnies, as well: the smaller one called "16-bit Bunny" and the larger one called "32-bit Bunny". The naming is connected to the fact that Windows 95 was the transitional OS.
These features needed to be turned on while Windows 95 was tested and the secret of turning them on was not removed. Some of the desktop features, including full window drag and anti-aliased fonts, could be turned on by placing the line ILOVEBUNNY32=1 under the windows section in win.ini.
Just like the Bear, the Bunny has an exported function named after him, BUNNY_351 in krnl386.exe.
Also, the Bunny is the icon for rumor.exe (Microsoft Party Line) in some Windows Chicago betas.

Microsoft decided to include more Easter eggs after 2000 in the Mac version of Office 2004. The game Asteroids is included in the Microsoft Office Notifications application.
Office 2013.
If one sets the background to "School Supplies", a sillouette of Clippy can be seen.
Windows.
An Easter egg that displays the names of all the volcanoes in the United States is found on all Microsoft Windows Operating Systems prior to XP in the "3Dtext" screensaver.
Windows 3.1 has a developer credits page, as described above.
Windows 95 has an animated presentation of the Win95 developers, complete with music.
Windows 98 has a credits screen easter egg.
The pipe screensaver in Windows 95 through to ME inclusive very occasionally has the Utah teapot appear instead of a standard joint. It only appears if the pipes are "multiple", pipe-style "standard", joint-type "multiple" and texture "solid" under the screensaver's settings.
Windows 2000/XP.
Windows 2000 and XP have an undocumented texture in the pipes (sspipes.scr) screensaver that makes the pipes red and white similar to candy canes.
Windows Vista.
Three images are embedded in the surface of Windows Vista's installation DVD. One of the images is the faces of the members of Microsoft's antipiracy team who worked on the hologram.
Internet Explorer.
By typing in "" in the address bar Internet Explorer will display nothing but a solid blue screen (a reference to the blue screen of death). However, this does not work as of 2010-03-16 on XP SP3 with fully updated IE7.
This is also a reference to The Book of Mozilla, an Easter egg accessed on the Netscape and Mozilla browsers in the same way.
Acid1 is included as an offline Easter egg, accessible by typing 'tasman', in Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS with the text replaced by the names of the developers.
Hover!
Hover! is a video game that came bundled with the CD version of Windows 95. It was a showcase for the advanced multimedia capabilities available on personal computers at the time. It is still available from Microsoft and can be run on all of Microsoft's operating systems released since Windows 95 including Windows 8.
Pictures of everyone involved with the Hover! project are displayed along the maze walls upon completion of initialization of an introductory level.
Xbox.
The Xbox contained developer credits in the dashboard. Inserting an audio CD and ripping it with the name "Â«EggsßoxÂ»" would trigger it.
Features often misunderstood to be Easter eggs.
The following are not Easter eggs, but rather features unexpected by many users of Microsoft products.
Microsoft Word.
Every version of Microsoft Word from 97 to 2013 (Windows) or 2004 to 2011 (Word:Mac) contains a function to create filler text: typing codice_1 in a Word document and hitting Enter results in 3 paragraphs of 5 repetitions of the pangram "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Typing codice_2 (with numbers for X and Y) results in X paragraphs of Y repetitions of the sentence. For example, codice_3 will produce ten paragraphs, each with ten repetitions. Microsoft has officially described this as a feature and not an Easter egg.
In Microsoft Word 2007 and 2010, the repeated sentence is replaced with a longer text:
In Microsoft Word 2013, the text was replaced again with
When codice_4 is written, only a simple sentence is shown: in English, it is "On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document."
In Word 2007, 2010, and 2013, the "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" text is available by typing the command codice_5 and pressing enter.
Additionally, typing codice_6 gives the following text:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Maecenas porttitor congue massa. Fusce posuere, magna sed pulvinar ultricies, purus lectus malesuada libero, sit amet commodo magna eros quis urna. Nunc viverra imperdiet enim. Fusce est. Vivamus a tellus. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Proin pharetra nonummy pede. Mauris et orci.
Typing codice_7 will produce "N" (where N is an integer) lines of lorem ipsum text. When "N" is larger than 27, the function begins to repeat itself.
All of these features will be disabled when "Replace text as you type" is turned off.
Microsoft Excel.
Since version 5, Excel has possessed a "datedif" function, which calculates the difference in whole days, months or years between two dates. Although this function is still present in Excel 2007 and 2010, it was only documented in Excel 2000.
Microsoft Windows.
In Microsoft Windows, it is not possible to create or rename a directory with the name "con" (short for "console") because it is a reserved DOS device name along with "prn", "aux", and "nul". This has been subject to a hoax that claims Microsoft is unable to explain why. This also blocks modding of many obfuscated video games, such as Minecraft, which uses the name "aux.class". It is also not possible to rename or create a file with "aux" in the title even in a batch file, thus, advanced editing tools are needed to make or rename a file or directory to aux.
"DeskBar" was feature planned by Microsoft to be introduced in Windows 98. With the help of this feature, Windows 98 users could download Desktop toolbars (Deskbars) from their favorite websites. These mini toolbars could update themselves automatically based on a predefined time interval and could provide latest information from the websites so users didn't have to visit the websites in web browsers. Microsoft did implement this feature in Windows 98 beta builds and thought that webmasters will develop such toolbars for their websites but they didn't like this idea and so Microsoft planned to remove this feature from Windows 98 RTM version. They decided to hide the tab and that's why this tab was not functional because the necessary code to connect this tab functionality with Desktop toolbars was not present in Windows 98.
Windows includes a number of MIDI files for troubleshooting purposes. In Windows 3.1, CANYON.MID and PASSPORT.MID can be found in the directory <drive>:\Windows\Media, with some .WAV and .RMI files. In Windows ME and later versions, these were replaced by ONESTOP.MID, FLOURISH.MID, and TOWN.MID. These files allowed for product support technicians to diagnose problems with MIDI playback without requiring the user to go to a Web page and download a known-good MIDI file.
In Windows XP, a .WMA file named "title" (an environmental mix by Brian Eno) is found under the system directory. This is the background music played during the initial configuration wizard used to perform tasks such as setting up user accounts the first time that a new installation of Windows XP is used.
In versions of Windows from 95 to 8.1, a feature called Phone Dialer is available that allows one to place a call through their phone port, provided they have one on their computer. This was only documented in Windows 95-98.
In the Windows 2000 and XP Pinball games, typing "hidden test" when the game is active starts test mode. In this mode, the user can drag the ball with the mouse cursor, and can press H to instantly get a high score, R to increase rank, M to display system memory, and Y to show frame rate. Typing "1max" at the start of a new ball awards an extra ball. Similarly, the user can type "gmax" to activate the gravity well, "rmax" to go up a rank, and "bmax" for unlimited balls (this last one results in an endless game, thereby precluding activation of the other cheats until the game is restarted).
In Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the game Minesweeper if the user starts the game, types "xyzzy", and presses shift and enter simultaneously, the top left-most pixel of the monitor (not the window) will be white or black when the mouse is hovered above a square, indicating that the square is either safe or mined, respectively. (The first click anywhere in Minesweeper is never a mine. A click on a 'black' square, as first click, moves that mine away.)
Microsoft Windows 7 "God Mode".
The so-called Windows 7 "God Mode" is commonly mistaken for an easter egg. Creating a directory that references a specific global unique identifier allows for the creation of a shortcut to a location; in the case of "God Mode" it creates a control panel applet with all control panel items view enabled.
Port 666.
In Windows, port number 666 uses a service named "doom". This is a reference to the Number of the Beast. The port was originally used for the Doom 95 game, but port 666 has remained labeled "doom" since.

Miramar, in 2011 and 2012, ranked as an "A" school according to Florida's FCAT grading scale.
Newsweek Magazine.
Ten Broward County Public Schools (nine public high schools and one charter high school) were recognized among Newsweek Magazine’s top high schools in the nation in 2009; Miramar High School was ranked in the top six percent of American public schools. The rankings are derived by adding up the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Cambridge tests taken by students at a school divided by the number of seniors graduating the same year. The data ranking was based on data from the 2007/08 school year.
Miramar High School was ranked last in Florida and 6508 in the nation.
Magnet Programs.
International Baccalaureate.
Miramar High was authorized to offer the IB Diploma Programme (DP) in January 2001 and the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) in May 2008. Students take IB exams in May of each academic year while retakes are conducted in November. The program, as of May 2012, offers Biology SL, Biology HL, Chemistry SL, Chemistry HL, English A1 HL, French B SL, French B HL, European History HL, Math Studies SL, Mathematics SL, Mathematics HL, Music SL, Music HL, Psychology SL, Psychology HL, Spanish AB SL, Spanish B SL, Spanish B HL, and Theory of Knowledge. Students can choose to order and take different tests if they are proficient in an area not offered at Miramar High School or they have recently transferred from another International Baccalaureate school.
Aviation Science.
The Aviation Science Magnet program at Miramar High offers college level aviation courses through the Broward College Aviation Institute. Optional tracks available to students include Flight and Aviation Maintenance Technology that may be taken concurrently with Aviation. This program prepares students for advanced training in: Air Traffic Management, Aviation Maintenance, Aeronautical Engineering, and Flight Meteorology/Weather Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
The Aviation program begun in 2000.
Vocational/Technical Programs.
Automotive Program.
Miramar High School is home to both a class and extracurricular automotive program that teaches students skills related to vehicular mechanics; students learn both a trade and life-skills during the program.
In 2012, Miramar High School's Electric Car "The Black Pearl" (in honor of Johnny Depp's tenure at the high school) set a new world record for electric vehicles designed and built by high schools, colleges, and universities at the Electric Vehicle International Expo in Tampa, Florida. The Black Pearl traveled down a 1/4 mile dragstrip in 11.319 seconds and backed up the record within 1% at 11.401. The vehicle accelerated from 0-60 mph in 1.7 seconds and reached 118 MPH before the end of the 1/4 mile. The Black Pearl also netted Miramar High school 1st place against all vehicles, even corporate produced racing vehicles.
Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA).
Miramar High School houses a chapter of HOSA. HOSA is a national technical organization that prepares students for careers in the medical field. HOSA students at Miramar High School plan school-wide blood drives through the American Red Cross; obviously, the procedure is conducted by volunteer health professionals. However, the experience provides valuable insight into a common procedure within the healthcare community and exposes students to the realities of medical practices. The blood is donated by the American Red Cross and used for humanitarian deeds and medical necessity.
Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver Certification.
Students at Miramar High School can leave high school fully certified in either Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Dreamweaver. Students may take a full-time class or attend a small-scale class following school to obtain the guidance necessary to earn the certification.
Student Life.
MHSTV.
During the second semester of the 2008 - 2009 academic year, a group of students founded Miramar High's first television production program named MHSTV. The group met after school every day to pre-record the next day's morning news and announcements, edit them, and upload them to the school's website for streaming the next morning. Although they had very little equipment in comparison to similar programs at other schools, MHSTV received great support from the student body and administration. For the 2008 - 2009 year, the program was mostly student-run. For the 2009 - 2010 year, the school's administration incorporated the program into the International Baccalaureate program's Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS) course. MHSTV has streamed over 120 episodes.
Extracurricular Activities.
Miramar Patriots' Soldier Band From Patriot Land.
Miramar High School has a band enrollment of over 400 students and has consistently received "Superior" and "Excellent" ratings at District and State Performance Assessments sponsored by the Florida Bandmasters Association. The band has been nationally televised and has had feature performances and appearances on stations such as CBS, SunSports, the NFL Network, and WGN Chicago where their performance in the McDonalds Thanksgiving Parade was televised to over 75 Million homes nationwide. They have performed for events and teams such as the Miami Dolphins, Spirit Airlines, the 2010 NFL Pro Bowl, and have been featured in two Broadway musicals.
Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC).
Miramar High's JROTC program, through formal inspection, has received the prestigious 'Gold Star Insignia.' Therefore, Miramar's Patriot Battalion is identified as an Honor Unit with Distinction, the highest possible certification awarded. The award is bestowed upon fewer than ten percent of high schools in the nation.
Athletics.
Soccer.
Miramar High established Broward County's first boys' soccer program in 1974.
Football.
Miramar-Flanagan Brawl (2007).
On September 28, 2007 at Miramar High's stadium, a bench-clearing brawl between seated, rival footballers occurred that interrupted the Miramar-Flanagan football game; this was Broward County's largest on-field brawl. The game was stopped by a referee because of the possibility that further outbreaks on the field and bleachers would erupt.
Following the interruption of the game, a film of the occurrence was sent to the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) to decide the fate of the belligerent parties. The FHSAA suspended 28 Miramar players and 26 Flanagan players from playing. In addition, both schools were fined by the State of Florida a total of $12,150 and neither school was allowed to participate in the 2008 Spring Jamboree and 2008 Fall Pre-season Jamboree.
The game resumed on October 29, 2007 in an empty Lockhart Stadium with five minutes remaining in the third quarter with Miramar leading 20-7. The game was played without the 54 suspended players. This incident is thought to be the largest mass-suspension in state high school history.
State Championship (2009).
Miramar High School won their first State Championship title on Dec 19, 2009. Miramar High School beat DeLand High School of DeLand, Florida 42-20. Miramar High was the first team from Broward County to win a 6A state championship and the first in the county to win in the largest classification since Hollywood Hills won 4A in 1973.
Miramar High's athletic rival is Everglades High School.

Cyclical theory

The cyclical theory refers to a model used by historian Arthur Schlesinger to attempt to explicate the fluctuations in politics throughout American History. Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in the “national mood” that shows a continuing shift in national involvement between public purpose and private interest. Each of these cycles includes a phase of dominant public interest, a transition phase, and a phase of prevalent private interest.
The cycles.
Schlesinger defined these to be “self-generating and autonomous”. They begin in the mentality of the masses, rather than creations of influential individuals of a time period. Leaders or politicians are representations of the “mood”, chosen to express the voice of the majority. Shifts in the national mentality are initiated when discontent with present conditions over time drives Americans to pursue a new trend that promises to satisfy the interest of the masses. This discontent, described by Schlesinger as “inextinguishable”, drives the cycles of change in national politics.
Modernity is the psychology behind the disenchantment of the people with their surroundings. As society modernizes, or advances, the external conditions around each individual evolves, therefore stimulating changes in the individual’s attitude. Over a period of time, the attitude towards society and its goals will become negative, and whichever stage (public purpose/private interest), will cease to be ideal. Studies and surveys show that in the 20th century, this critical time period to develop discontent has decreased, implying that people are quickly dissatisfied with the ever-changing society.
Shifts are produced by changes in the mood of the majority. When more and more people shift from one end of the “balance” to the other, the balance itself begins to tilt to the other side. However, the change in mood must be reflected in a diversity of ethnic backgrounds and social classes to take effect. The cycle is not a permanent transition. Periods of stability in each stage of the cycle (public purpose/private interest), Schlesinger presents the concept the “accumulation of change”. He stated that when certain changes near the end of a phase take effect, they become permanent, and are unaffected by later “swings of the pendulum”. Therefore, the proper way to model the cycles of American History is by using a spiral, or single helix.
Definitions.
Public purpose and private interest do not correlate directly with liberal or conservative, or the ideals of specific political parties. These two systems of American values, albeit distinct, evolved from common ideals and fundamentals of American philosophy. They might be considered different paths to reach a common goal. For example, for the common purpose of attaining popular sovereignty, both systems can be used. In terms of Public Purpose, freedom may be expressed in welfare and protection of social rights, but not of other rights like gun rights or food choice rights in modern times. In terms of Private Interest, freedom may be defined in the practice of a laissez-faire economy, the protection of property, or even in aspects of Social Darwinism.
Some shared values of public purpose and private interest have been defined by theorists. They include anti-absolutism, limitations of government, popular sovereignty, and personal freedom.
Private interest.
This value systems stresses on a non-interventionist government, especially in its economy. Resulting from the 18th century fears of tyranny and a strong federal power, the free society is where an individual controls his own actions. The government’s only functions are to maintain order and structure. The values of Private Interest bear strong resemblance to Adam Smith’s theories of the laissez-faire economy (free market) and also the invisible hand. Smith proposed that the collective result of individuals with a variety of purposes is an economy that will profit the entire society.
Ideally in a Private Interest system, government must respect the “sanctity of private property”. This means that individuals have the freedom to pursue their own interests, but also bear the responsibility for success or failure. One of the possible disadvantages of such Social Darwinism is that the wealthy rise to the top, leaving the poor to fend for themselves, although some poor and middle class people become rich as well and some rich become poor. Another problem that may be present is political corruption. Overall, “survival of the fittest” may lead to “concentration of power”, “evangelicalism”, and “limited citizenship”. In connection to history, periods of Private Interest are often associated with times of economic prosperity.
Public purpose.
The values of Public Purpose assess the reality, often the consequences of a certain revolution. In times of complex social relations and economic and political confusion, the need for equality and opportunity arises. Due to certain, recurring causes in history such as division in wealth and social class distinctions, the majority begins to question the meaning of “liberalism”. Schlesinger explains that in “modern liberalism”, the government must intervene to ensure the protection of the common good. The concerns with “social responsibility” and “commonwealth” often involve the regulation and control of the government. Compared to the stages of Private Interest, times of Public Purpose are usually ephemeral “bursts of reform”. The idealistic goals of this period are only to ensure that government intervention is possible in times of need. The ideals of Public Purpose might include a redistribution of wealth and power and the protection of civil rights.
Transition.
These periods occur as the masses change its “mood”. Results are often increased tension and division. From Public Purpose to Private Interest, the transition involves tensions, violence, and even war, due to the exhaustion from reformation. In the transition from Private Interest to Public Purpose, the people may suffer economic depression caused by divisions of wealth and power, leading to a renewed cause for social reform.
Conclusions.
During the study of American history, no time period may be defined entirely as one stage or another of the Schlesinger cycle, nor can all the aspects of an era be generalized as to be proceeding in one direction. The cyclical theory is a tool to analyze political, social, and economic change with philosophy, identifying recurring trends and correlations. However, the cycle is not accurate in predicting the events of the future, because historians in the present do not have the benefit of hindsight and may lack crucial knowledge and understanding of certain trends.
Overall, the historian Schlesinger believed that the cycles may lead to the ideal society where certain emerging definitions of freedom may gain the support of greater and greater numbers of people, ultimately proceeding towards the form of freedom that is “inclusive of every American”.

Interstate 95 in North Carolina

Interstate 95 (I-95) is a major Interstate Highway, running along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maine. In North Carolina, I-95 runs diagonally across the eastern third of the state, from Rowland in the southwest to Roanoke Rapids in the northeast of the Inner Banks.
Route description.
Interstate 95 in North Carolina serves as the informal western border of the Inner Banks region of the state. I-95 begins at the South Carolina state line near Rowland, Robeson County and Pleasant Hill, Northampton County near the Virginia state line.
US 301 follows the same route as I-95 through North Carolina; they both enter the state at South of the Border, overlap together around Lumberton, and share multiple interchanges before reaching Virginia.
Alternate names.
Though the highway is commonly known as "Interstate 95" or "I-95" throughout the state, the highway does have other known names it uses locally in areas.
History.
Established in 1956, as part of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Interstate 95 was routed along or near existing US 301 throughout the state of North Carolina. By 1961, two stretches of the interstate opened: from mile marker 56, in Fayetteville, to mile marker 107, near Kenly; the other a small bypass near Saint Pauls. In 1964, the Saint Pauls section extended further south into Lumberton; while another small stretch opened from US 158, in Roanoke Rapids, to the Virginia state line. In 1969, Interstate 95 was extended further south from Roanoke Rapids to exit 145 (later used for NC 4). In 1973, Interstate 95 was completed from Saint Pauls to the South Carolina state line.
By the mid and late 1970s, Interstate 95 had two gaps along its route: Fayetteville and Wilson-Rocky Mount. Thus two Interstate 95 Business loops were established at the gaps (both overlapping US 301) to make Interstate 95 appear as one continuous route throughout the state. 
In 1979, the first gap to be completed was the Wilson-Rocky Mount section. The final section of Interstate 95 was completed in 1983, an easterly bypass of Fayetteville.
Tolls.
The idea of tolling Interstate 95 started in 2001 as a way to pay for improvements along the route. In 2003, state officials sought permission from the Federal Highway Administration for a plan that would cost $3 billion and put toll booths every thirty miles along the entire route. However, this was quickly killed by Governor Mike Easley, who did not support tolls.
In 2006, when the Virginia General Assembly passed the resolution calling for an interstate compact to build a toll highway, North Carolina was asked to join in on the compact of putting tolls along the entire length of Interstate 95 in both states. Again, this was stopped by Governor Mike Easley, who did not see the benefit in such a compact and reiterated his opposition of tolls along Interstate 95.
In 2010, North Carolina leaders revived talks on tolling Interstate 95, submitting a request to the Federal Highway Administration to toll the entire route. Approval would be considered after an environmental assessment and other conditions. Support has grown in a number of factors including the fact that the interstate is mostly rural and used predominantly by out-of-state drivers.
On January 20, 2012, NCDOT received final approval of the Environmental Assessment for improvements along I-95 in North Carolina. The following recommendations were made:
It is estimated to cost $4.4 billion with recommendation that it should be paid through tolls. Construction would begin in two phases: Phase 1 (exit 31-exit 81) would begin in 2016 with tolls starting after completion; phase 2 would begin in 2019, which covers the remainder of the interstate. With a possible 2019 start date for the tolls, NCDOT plans to install nine overhead toll collection sensors every twenty miles with additional toll collection sensors at exits before tolls (to reduce drivers from jumping off and on at each toll); main toll stations will charge twenty miles each while exit tolls will charge ten miles each. Gaps along the route, where no toll collectors are located, will allow local traffic to utilize the interstate toll free. Though the toll rates have not been established, a NCDOT report suggest charging 19.2 cents per mile for cars in the phase 1 section, with a much lower rate of 6.4 cents on phase 2 sections; which would work out to be $19.20 from border to border (trucks with three axles or more will be charged more). Drivers that do not carry a toll transponder (i.e. N.C. Quick Pass) will have their license numbers recorded by cameras and will be billed by mail, at a higher toll rate.
Future.
NCDOT plans to widen Interstate 95 from four to six lanes between mile marker 14 and 21, in Robeson County. However it is currently flagged "Scheduled for Reprioritization," with no estimated cost or date established.
An improvement project along Interstate 95 is in development stage, between mile markers 56 and 81, in Cumberland and Johnston counties. Improvements include upgraded interchanges, raise and rebuild bridges, and widen the interstate. The total estimated cost is $526 million, with date of construction starting on the first phase on October, 2017. However, it is currently flagged by NCDOT as "Subject to Reprioritization."

Herder Memorial Trophy

The Herder Memorial Trophy, or Herder, is the championship trophy of senior ice hockey in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is the most prestigious hockey championship solely dedicated to Newfoundland, and as a result, has a significant following within the province. In recent years, Herder games were usually held at Mile One Centre (and before it was built, at Memorial Stadium) in St. John's and frequently sold out the 6,000 seat building. Games were also held in the Pepsi Centre in the city of Corner Brook, on the west coast of the island, when teams from that area were playing for the cup. In 2013 things changed, and the two teams playing for the 'Herder' got the right to play the games in their home stadiums.
In 1935, the trophy was donated by Ralph Herder, who was president of The Evening Telegram newspaper, in honour of his five hockey playing brothers. The trophy was to be awarded to Newfoundland's best ice hockey team. Having been published by a member of the Herder family since the founding of the paper in 1879 until the retirement of Stephen in 1993, has meant that the Telegram has played an integral role in the promotion and sponsorship of the Herder, which continues to this day. 
Originally donated by Ralph Herder in memory of his five brothers, it now honors the memory of eight Herders. The “original five” Herders were Arthur, William, Douglas, Augustus and Hubert and they were later joined by brothers Ralph and James. In 2009, Ralph's son Stephen was added in memoriam. The seven brothers were fine hockey players and often played together, with four of them sometimes playing together on championship teams. In fact, James Herder coached the 1935 Guards team that lost the initial Herder championship to Corner Brook in a two-game, total-goal series at the Prince’s Rink in St. John’s. 
1. It was Ralph who first put the award in place.
2. Captain Arthur, a lawyer, died of First World War wounds in 1917.
3. Hubert was a lieutenant when he was killed at Beaumont Hamel July 1, 1916.
4. William was a vice-president of the Evening Telegram when he died in 1934. (see William James Herder (1849–1922), publisher, born Old Perlican, Newfoundland, Canada, founder of Newfoundland's first daily newspaper, The Evening Telegram).
5. Douglas died from illness in 1908.
6. Augustus was a vice-president of the Evening Telegram when he died in 1934.
7. Ralph, also a lieutenant, was seriously wounded July 1, 1916. He survived the war. He became Publisher on the deaths of his brothers in 1934, and was the driving force behind the creation of the Herder Memorial Trophy in memory of his five brothers who predeceased him. Ralph was the father of Rendell and Stephen and he died in 1955.
8. James was the youngest of the seven brothers. He was vice President and General Manager of The Evening Telegram when his brother Ralph died in 1955. Jim, as he was known, took over as Publisher and piloted The Evening Telegram Ltd through a period of tremendous growth and prosperity during the late 1950s and through the 1960s. He died in 1970.
9. Stephen succeeded his uncle Jim and was the longtime publisher of The Telegram. An environmentalist long before his time he was known for saving Rennies River, and a bridge over that river is dedicated to his efforts. Steve was a proud proponent of the Herder memorial Trophy. He and died in 1993, at the age of 65.
The original base of the Trophy consisted of two tiers but as they were filled out with shields bearing the names and years of championship teams, two larger tiers were added to bring the award to its present size and shape. 
St. Bon’s star Edward “Key” Kennedy was the model for the hockey player that stands atop the Trophy. Donor Ralph Herder took a photo of Kennedy, in playing pose, to New York where he had a model made and then had the figure cast in silver. 
Hockey had been played on ponds and natural ice rinks in St. John’s, Newfoundland's capital, since the late 19th century. Not only was it good physical exercise but it provided a measure of relief from the tedium of long, cold winters. By 1924, the sport had been an organized one for roughly 30 years in St. John's, but in the Bay of Islands area of the west coast, hockey was still a novelty. If there were games, they were played on the frozen bay and were more recreation than competition.
In 1925, a senior league had been organized in Corner Brook, a community in the Bay of Islands on Newfoundland's west coast, under the direction of the Corner Brook Athletic Association (later to branch out into the Corner Brook Hockey Association) and hundreds turned up on a regular basis to cheer for their favorite players. 
The St. John's Guards had earned the right to compete for the inaugural Herder Memorial Trophy in 1935 by first defeating St. Bon's in a 2-game series to become St. John's city champions, and later toppling the Bay Roberts Rovers in a 2-game, total goal series to become the Avalon Peninsula champions. The championship match-up was then set - the Guards of St. John's would play host to the Corner Brook All-Star Team. Fans in St. John's eagerly awaited the arrival of the Corner Brook Royals; tickets to the 2 games were sold out quickly. The Royals edged the Guards 1-0 in Game 1, and were victorious in Game 2 by a 4-2 margin to become the island's top team, and Herder Trophy Champions. 
Today, fan interest and competition is as keen as it was in the glory days of senior hockey. The Herder Memorial Trophy will liver forever in the minds and hearts of the people of Newfoundland.
The 1985-86 Herder Trophy champion Corner Brook Royals didn't stop at the provincial title alone. After the Herder finals, they went on to win the Allan Cup, the national 'AAA' championship trophy of Canadian senior hockey. The Royals defeated the Stephenville Jets in 6 games to win the Herder in their quest for the Allan Cup, and then became Eastern Canadian champions by defeating the Flamboro Motts Clamatos in a tough, 7-game series to hoist the G.P. Bolton Cup. In the final, the Royals downed the Nelson (B.C) Maple Leafs in 4 straight games to win the Province's first Allan Cup. The following year, the St. John's Capitals won the Herder, but were ousted in the Allan Cup semi-final in 6 games by the Brantford (Ont.) Motts Clamatos, led by the stellar goal tending of former NHL star Don Edwards. In 2010-11, the Clarenville Caribous became the second Newfoundland team to win the Allan Cup, defeating the Bentley Generals (Alberta) in the finals held in Kenora, BC.
After broadcasting the Cup-winning games on Rogers Television (and province-wide using the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly Channel) in 2007 and 2008, games 3 to 5 of the 2009 finals were streamed online at thesportspage.ca.

ESPN Major League Baseball

ESPN Major League Baseball is a promotion of Major League Baseball on ESPN and ESPN2, with simulcasts on ESPNHD or ESPN2HD. ESPN's MLB coverage debuted on April 9, 1990 with three Opening Day telecasts. "ESPN Major League Baseball" is guaranteed to remain on air until 2021. Starting in 2014, ESPN will return to broadcasting postseason baseball. ESPN has rights to any potential tiebreaker games (Game 163) and one of the two wild card games (Turner Sports receiving the other game).
The different weekly regular-season packages that ESPN presents (as of 2014) are "Sunday Night Baseball", "Monday Night Baseball" and "Wednesday Night Baseball". The network also airs select games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day.
In addition to regular-season games, ESPN also airs several spring training games per year, the Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game and Home Run Derby played the week of the All-Star Game, and (as of 2014) one of the two Wild Card games each postseason. ESPN also airs a daily highlight show called "Baseball Tonight" at 10 p.m. ET and 12 a.m. ET.
ESPN Radio has also been airing Major League Baseball since 1998 (succeeding CBS Radio), broadcasting "Sunday Night Baseball" as well as select other regular-season games, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, and the entire postseason including the Wild Card Game, Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series.
History.
Since ESPN first received MLB telecast rights, it has become traditional for the network to make an effort to cover live historic moments in the sport. For example, in 2007, ESPN and ESPN2 added several telecasts when Barry Bonds chased Hank Aaron's record for most home runs in a MLB career. ESPN had the national telecasts on August 4 when Bonds tied Aaron with number 755 and on August 7, 2007 when he hit number 756. ESPN was also the broadcaster of the final game at the original Yankee Stadium as a part of "Sunday Night Baseball" with Jon Miller and Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. It also showed Chris Burke's 18th-inning homer to end the 2005 NLDS.
Also, the network has been given permission to interrupt regular programming, when allowed, to show attempts at new records or significant milestones live. Examples include three cut-ins from its coverage of the first X Games in 1995 until Eddie Murray recorded his 3000th hit, live coverage of Sammy Sosa's 600th home run in 2007, and a number of no-hitters, including the Buchholz feat mentioned earlier. Although it cannot show any historic attempts live during the Fox or TBS exclusive windows, it was allowed to show an in-progress highlight of Alex Rodriguez's 500th career home run in August 2007, as this was on a Saturday afternoon before Fox went on the air with its game coverage.
1990s.
On January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week ("Sunday Night Baseball", "Wednesday Night Baseball" and doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day.
On April 15, 1990, ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball" debuted with the experienced play-by-play announcer Jon Miller joining retired Hall of Fame player Joe Morgan in the broadcast booth. In its first year, "Sunday Night Baseball" averaged a 3.0 rating. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By 1998, ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run of the season. When ESPN first broadcast "Sunday Night Baseball", they would show at least one game from every ballpark. Also, every team was guaranteed an appearance. It was essentially, the television equivalent to a cross country stadium tour.
In , ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the season). The new deal was worth $42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract. In , ESPN broadcast the American League West tie-breaker game between the Seattle Mariners and California Angels with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan making the call.
In , ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday night doubleheader and "Sunday Night Baseball", as well as Opening Day and holiday telecasts and all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT, with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game.
In , ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were on the call. In , ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game (this time between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds) once again with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan once again on the call.
2000s.
ESPN and ESPN2 had contracts (which were signed in and ran through ) to show selected weeknight and "Sunday Night Baseball" games, along with Opening Day and holiday games and selected Division Series playoff games. The contracts with ESPN were worth $141.8 million per year and $851 million overall.
After Disney bought Fox Family (who from 2000– aired Thursday night games) in to become ABC Family the Division Series games aired on ABC Family (with ESPN's announcers, graphics, and music) for one year. ESPN then added these games, along with the Thursday night games (subsequently shifted to weekday afternoon "DayGame" broadcasts), to its package.
2005.
OLN was briefly considering picking up the rights to the Sunday and Wednesday games, which expired after the 2005 season. On September 14, 2005 however, ESPN, then the current rights holder, signed an eight-year contract with Major League Baseball, highlighted by the continuation of ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball" series with additional, exclusive team appearances. The key details of the agreement were:
The weekday afternoon "DayGame" telecasts that ESPN and ESPN2 had previously aired were eliminated in the new pact, along with the late (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday night game (although ESPN can elect to show a late game instead of an early one should it so desire), and the coverage of Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day games (except for games that fall under the regular Monday-night slot).
ESPN's Monday and Wednesday telecasts remain mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games also can be televised by each club's local broadcasters. In fact, Wednesday games are blacked out on ESPN unless a participating team's local broadcaster does not choose to televise the game. The Sunday games remain on ESPN only, and with ESPN gaining the rights to "Monday Night Football" telecasts, it looks likely that "Sunday Night Baseball" will run uninterrupted on ESPN throughout the season, except on Opening Night (when it will air on ESPN2, since it usually conflicts with the NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four).
Alternate telecasts for home-team markets which are blacked out have also been phased out, either in an effort to save costs or in an effort to allocate more satellite space for high-definition broadcasts on ESPNHD. Those who get ESPN via cable get ESPNEWS instead, and those who get the channel via satellite see a blank picture and a blackout notice.
MLB will receive, on average, $296 million a year under the new agreement, a television and a baseball official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement in the deal. ESPN will pay baseball $273.5 million in 2006, $293.5 million in each of the following four years, $308.5 million in 2011 and $306 million in each of the final two seasons.
2006.
On July 25, 2006, Harold Reynolds was fired from ESPN. The ESPN spokeswoman confirmed that Reynolds "is no longer with the network" but did not give a reason for the departure. "Three people who work at ESPN and familiar with the case said the cause was a pattern of sexual harassment." Reynolds confirmed that an accusation of sexual harassment was the reason for his departure but called it "a total misunderstanding" and that "I gave a woman a hug and I felt like it was misinterpreted. In February 2008, ESPN and Reynolds reached an out-of-court settlement.
Weeks later, Peter Gammons was sidelined with a brain aneurysm. Gammons returned to ESPN in early September.
ESPN telecasts in 2006, posted an average of 1,115,000 household impressions, up 27% when compared to 2005's 875,000. The corresponding 1.2 rating this year marks a 20% increase over the 1.0 average in 2005. ESPN2's baseball telecasts have averaged 704,000 households, an increase of 34% over 2005's 525,000. Ratings on ESPN2 went up 33% (0.8 vs. 0.6).
After the 2006 Division Series, ESPN lost the rights to broadcast playoff games on TV. All postseason games, from possible one-game playoffs to the World Series, have aired on Fox Sports and TBS since 2007. Games remained on ESPN Radio. ESPN also lost rights to "ESPN DayGame presented by Fruit of the Loom" and "Thursday Night Baseball powered by Castrol".
The play-by-play commentators for "ESPN DayGame" were Gary Thorne or Jon Sciambi, along with Steve Phillips, and Steve Stone as color analysts. The program was sponsored by Fruit of the Loom in 2006. The game generally aired on Wednesday or Thursday. The final game to date was aired on September 30, 2006.
2007.
Because of the reduction of ESPN's weekly schedule from five games to three, ESPN released numerous commentators from the network, including Jeff Brantley, Tino Martinez, Steve Stone and Eric Karros.
With the new deal coming into play this year, several things changed with the Monday and Wednesday night games in particular. For "Monday Night Baseball", the telecast will now co-exist with teams' local carriers up to three times per year, up from two times in previous years. "Wednesday Night Baseball" also changed slightly. Now, in addition to the featured game that night, they will also have some live cut-ins to other games across the nation and discuss some the hot topics in the major leagues.
On April 1, for the season-opening game between the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals, ESPN changed its on-screen graphics to the version that debuted with "Monday Night Football" in 2006 and was later adopted by its NBA coverage at the start of the 2006-07 season. The previous graphics dated back to the advent of ESPN HD in 2004.
During the week of the All-Star Game, "Baseball Tonight" and "SportsCenter" did not travel to the game site as it normally does; the 2007 site was AT&T Park in San Francisco. The reason was that MLB stripped ESPN of its on-site credentials for its studio crew as punishment for leaking the rosters of the All-Star teams before TBS did. TBS' announcement, which was billed as exclusive, was scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern time but was delayed for nearly two hours, by which point ESPN, in apparent violation of its contract with MLB, went ahead and revealed the rosters anyway. ESPN later agreed to promote playoff coverage on TBS and Fox (alongside its own radio coverage) in return for "Baseball Tonight" going on the air shortly after each night's games concluded.
ESPN pre-empted part of the Kansas State–Auburn college football game on September 1 to show the end of the no-hitter thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz.
2008.
ESPN2 showed the season-opening games in Tokyo between the Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. Unfortunately, due to a transponder failure, viewers on DirecTV reliant on the standard-definition feed missed the first of the two games. (ESPNHD was unaffected.)
On March 30, ESPN showed the first-ever game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves on a walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman.
On May 4, ESPN introduced enhanced updates targeting viewers who play fantasy baseball. It shows season batting statistics for the current batter on each potential count and updates batting average and other selected stats after the at-bat concludes.
2010s.
2010.
Starting with the April 3 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, ESPN began using the same graphics package which debuted with "Monday Night Football" in . The score banner was converted to a score box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. And instead of numbers to represent the balls, strikes and outs, dots were represented for each: three green dots for balls, two yellow dots for strikes, and two red dots for outs. The pitch count was also introduced, adopted from the New York Yankees' broadcasts on the YES Network, as well as NESN for the Boston Red Sox. College baseball and softball broadcasts, however, continued to use the previous (2007) graphics for the 2010 College World Series telecasts. ESPN's coverage of the Little League World Series also retained the 2007 graphics until midway through, and then adopted the current (2010) graphics package.
"Baseball Tonight", a daily highlight show aired on ESPN during the baseball season, likewise introduced new graphics adopted from "SportsCenter" in June 2010.
2011.
The "ESPN Major League Baseball" score box was slightly modified beginning with the opening day game between the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees. Numbers indicating the ball, strike and out counts replace the dots used last year; the out dots were adopted by Fox Sports Net on their local broadcasts as well as "Major League Baseball on Fox". The pitch speed and count are now fixed below the bases graphic. Also, the area around the bases graphic and ball, strike, and out counter is slightly translucent.
Beginning with the "Sunday Night Baseball" interleague game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs on June 19, the graphics were slightly adjusted to fit in with the aspect ratio for HD broadcasts, similar to what Fox Saturday Baseball, Root Sports and Fox Sports Net have done for their baseball coverage. TBS would follow suit in adjusting their graphics to the 16:9 aspect ratio.
2012.
The score box and other graphics were carried over from 2011, but a new logo for all ESPN MLB presentations was unveiled at the start of the season. The ESPN logo is fixed on a CGI baseball, with the words 'Major League Baseball' (or "Baseball Tonight" and "Sunday", "Monday" or "Wednesday Night Baseball") in a stylized neon light surrounding it. A 2-D version is also used on print ads or on secondary program IDs.
On August 28, Major League Baseball and ESPN agreed to an eight-year, $5.6 billion contract extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gives ESPN up to 90 regular-season games, one of the two Wild Card games which will rotate between American League and National League teams each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games.
Technology.
Through the years, ESPN has enhanced its Major League Baseball coverage with the introduction and implementation of innovative technology. Which include:

Born Cross-Eyed

"Born Cross-Eyed" is an original composition by the San Francisco, CA Psychedelic rock group the Grateful Dead. It was written by rhythm guitarist Bob Weir during the band's sessions creating the album "Anthem of the Sun", produced by David Hassinger, in 1968. It was released as a B-side with the single "Dark Star", one of the band's most well-known musical excursions.
The single was first released in April 1968 by Warner Bros. Records and is a different mix than the version included on the "Anthem of the Sun" album. The single was re-released in the UK in 1977 as a promotion distributed with the Dark Star magazine. The single release included lyrics of Dark Star on the back cover as well as a message stating "this record presented exclusively by Dark Star Magazine with the kind cooperation of WEA Records Ltd".
This single version of the song would be later released three times:

John Baptist Smith

John Baptist Smith (1843–1923) is believed by some to have provided the most lasting contribution made by either side during the American Civil War. In 1862 he invented and helped build a lantern system of naval signaling.
He was born September 19, 1843, at Hycotee in Caswell County, North Carolina, the son of Richard Ivy Smith (1800–1871) and Mary Amis Goodwin Smith (1815–1889). At seventeen, he joined the Milton Blues to fight in the Civil War. Rapidly promoted and transferred to the Signal Corps, he soon was a sergeant in charge of a Confederate signaling station on the James River at Newport News, Virginia. While there he witnessed the naval battle between the Confederate ironclad "Virginia" when it destroyed the federal frigates "Cumberland" and "Congress" in the James River. When Norfolk was evacuated, Sgt. Smith and his signal corps were ordered to Petersburg, Virginia and given charge of the signal station on the Appomattox River to observe the movement of the enemy fleet and forces. While occupying an exposed position that was often under siege, he and his men held fast. Smith and his men also rendered valuable service during the seven day's fight around Richmond and the retreat of McClellan's army.
In July 1862 Smith was ordered by the Confederate Secretary of War to the Cape Fear River region of North Carolina to assist in organizing the signal service. He was placed in charge of the important station at Fort Fisher under Colonel William Lamb. Being concerned with establishing signal communication between forts at the mouth of the river he focused on the following: "I soon observed the great difficulty a vessel encountered in her effort to enter our port," he later recalled, "and at once began to study how this obstacle might be overcome." The Cape Fear River was used by Confederate blockade-running vessels bringing essential supplies to the South, and anything that could be done to speed their entry and ensure their safe arrival would be welcomed.
One day while in the ordnance department of the Fort, I chanced to spy a pair of ship starboard and port lanterns, and this thought flashed into my mind, "Why not by the arrangement of a sliding door to each of these lanterns, one being a white, the other a red light, substitute flashes of red and white lights for the wave of torches to the right and left, to form a signal alphabet and thus use the lanterns at sea as well as upon land." I at once communicated my plans to Col. Wm. Lamb, commandant of the fort. They met his approbation and I was instructed to submit them to Gen. Whiting commanding the department, who most readily gave me an order to the master of the machine shop at Wilmington, to render me aid in fitting up my lanterns. These, under my personal directions, were speedily fixed to my entire satisfaction. The General then referred me to Commodore Lynch, who ordered a commission of Naval Officers to investigate my mode of signaling by flash lights. This commission, after careful investigation, were so highly impressed with the system that upon their recommendation it was adopted and ordered to be operated on all the Confederate Blockade Runners. To this end, a pair of my lanterns and a Signal Officer were placed on each one of them. Signal stations were also established along the coast, so that an incoming vessel, when she made our coast, would run along as close ashore as possible and her Signal Officer, by flashing his light from the shore-side of the ship, could escape observation by the Blockaders, get the attention of the shore stations, and thus ascertain the position of his ship and send a message to the commandant of the fort to set range lights, by which the pilot could steer his vessel across the bar and have the guns of the fort manual to protect the vessel if necessary.
This successful method of signaling at night was most effective and the advantages of it over the old torches was immediately recognized. Smith reported that a British ship captain whom he met shortly afterwards "urged me to go to England with him and take out letters patent from the British and other European Governments; he agreed to bear all expenses in consideration of an interest in the patent. I declined his most liberal offer because it would to my mind, look like deserting my country in her hour of need, although I was certain I might have obtained permission from the Confederate Secretary of Navy to carry out this proposition, which most certainly would have been a source of great profit pecuniarily, as it has formed the basis of the present system now used in the Naval service generally."
In recognition of the valuable contribution that Sgt. Smith had made, the Secretary of War assigned him for special duty with General Whiting at Wilmington. The general gave Smith his choice of vessels upon which to serve as signal officer, and he chose the "Advance," a state-owned blockade runner recently purchased at Liverpool and perhaps the fastest ship afloat. Smith served well in this capacity until February, 1864, when he was commissioned lieutenant in the Signal Corps and ordered to report for duty at Petersburg. He was given command of the signal station on the lower James River with headquarters at Hardy's Bluff, the lowest outpost of the Confederate army. From this vantage point he relayed detailed reports of the number and movement of the enemy gunboats and transports until the line of communication was broken and he was forced to fall back to Petersburg. In that beleaguered city he and his men fought in the trenches as infantry for forty-eight hours without relief of any kind. Because of his recognized ability and bravery, Lt. Smith was given command of the signal lines from Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard's headquarters. A few days later he was ordered to report in person to Gen. Lee who placed him in command of the signal lines running from his own headquarters to the different points around Petersburg. This has been called "perhaps the highest compliment bestowed in the Confederate States Army upon so youthful an officer."
In 1865 Lt. Smith's men were the last to leave Petersburg, crossing the last bridge as it burned. They served as a rear guard for Gen. Lee's army, and were present at Appomattox Court House where Smith released some Federal prisoners who had been taken along from Petersburg. Smith secured paroles for his men and returned home to Caswell County, arriving on April 15, 1865, four years to the day after his enlistment.
In 1872, he married Sabra Annie Long. The couple produced eight children. He is buried at the Red House Presbyterian Church near the place he was born in Caswell County, North Carolina. For more on the family of John Baptist Smith go to the Caswell County Family Tree.

Yuantang (language game)

Yuantang is language game spoken by Hakka speakers at Yuantang (), a village in southern China. It is also known as the "snake language".
Rules.
Example : 食饭 → 手习花散 fan → jit fa san; eat (rice) → "hand + learn + flower + separation".
Clearly, the words 食 and 饭 are each split into two sounds, the initial and the rime, thus 食 is made up of the initial of 手 [s and the rime of 习 and similarly, 饭 [fan is from 花 and [an from 散. This is similar to the traditional Chinese practice of representing sounds by two characters known as fanqie.
<br>
This practice also resembles Jin, another Sinitic language, in its process of splitting a monosyllabic word into two syllables. A similar process is also found in Mandarin.
History.
There is no solid evidence for the original of Yuantang dialect. But it is believed to be an invention of a local intellectual in Qing dynasty.

Harmony (Schenker)

Harmony ("Harmonielehre", or "Theory of Harmony" in the original German) is a book published in 1906 by Heinrich Schenker. It is the first installment of Schenker's three-volume treatise on music theory entitled "New Musical Theories and Fantasies"; the others are "Counterpoint" and "Free Composition". Schenker's name did not appear on the original edition of the work: the author was listed simply as "an artist".
"Harmony", which was Schenker's first major book-length theoretical writing, is notable for defining the theoretical agenda that Schenker was to carry out over the subsequent three decades. Schenker makes a careful distinction between the theories of "harmony" (which for Schenker is concerned with relations among scale-steps) and "counterpoint" (which deals only with voice leading); he argues that other theorists have confusingly mixed these two concepts. He introduces the principle of repetition, which gives rise to the concept of the motive. Schenker also strongly hints about the ways in which large spans of music can be understood as elaborations of simple structures; this idea is perhaps the most characteristic feature of his mature theory. Finally, he discusses the relationship between music and Nature, which would also be a recurring theme throughout his career.
The work also contains the type of polemical writing that was to characterize most of Schenker's output. In "Harmony", Schenker expresses his dissatisfaction with the state of music theory and music pedagogy in his time, and, by making frequent references and comparisons to other theorists, argues at length that his own ideas are superior. He would repeat this procedure in his later writings, often adding virulent commentary about the social and political situation of early 20th century Europe.

Interstate 95 in South Carolina

Interstate 95 is a major Interstate Highway, running along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maine. In South Carolina, I-95 runs approximately parallel to the Atlantic Ocean shore although about inland, from Hardeeville in the south to Dillon in the northeast.
Route description.
For the most part, the drive is fairly benign, passing through the pine forests, farmlands, and blackwater streams and swamps of the Coastal Plain. However, a few landmarks do exist to break up the monotony. Crossing from the south from Georgia just over the Savannah River bridge, motorists are greeted to an elaborate gateway into the state of South Carolina. The Juanita M. White Crosswalk also exists between exits 18 and 21. A flyover on twin high-spans over Lake Marion provides an unexpected scenic break in the center of the highway's length. Moving further north and out of the Palmetto State, the NC state line is prominently marked by the South Of The Border amusement complex at the US 301/501 exit. Local traffic parallel to the interstate uses US 301 from South Of The Border to Santee, US 15 from Santee to Walterboro, and a combination of US 17 and US 17 Alt from Walterboro to the Georgia state line north of Savannah. In addition, Interstate 95 shares a number of concurrencies, or multiplexes, with three of these U.S. Routes at various stretches in South Carolina.
The old US 15-301 bridge runs along the west side of I-95 and is used for recreational purposes.
Dedicated and memorial names.
Interstate 95 in South Carolina feature numerous dedicated or memorialized bridges, interchanges and stretches of freeway.
History.
Interstate 95 first appeared on state maps between 1962-1964, with construction from US 17 north of Hardeeville to Ridgeland. By 1967, more sections were under construction, including Pocotaligo to Walterboro and Santee to the North Carolina state line. The first section to officially open happened in 1968, from SC 527, near Gable, to SC 9/SC 57, in Dillon.
In 1971-1972, more sections of Interstate 95 was completed: Going north from SC 9/SC 57, in Dillon, to the North Carolina state line. Going south from SC 527, near Gable, along the recently completed 1968-built Lake Marion bridge, to US 321 Connector, in Santee (exit 97). Also part of US 17 between Ridgeland (exit 22) to near Yemassee (exit 33) was combined with Interstate 95, with temporary status through Coosawhatchie; Interstate 95 then continued on new freeway north to SC 63, in Walterboro.
By 1975, Interstate 95 was open continuously from US 17, in Hardeeville, to SC 63, in Walterboro; temporary exits were removed around Coosawhatchie. In 1976, the two sections of Interstate 95 were connected, from SC 63, in Walterboro, to US 321 Connector, in Santee (exit 97). In same year, exit numbers were added along Interstate 95. The last section of Interstate 95 was completed in 1978, connecting US 17, in Hardeeville, south to the Georgia state line.
In 1990, exit 21 was added, for what was then US 278, now SC 336. Between 1998-2000, exit 153, Honda Way, was added. In 2003, Interstate 95 was widened to six-lanes from just south of Interstate 20 to north of SC 170, around Florence.
Future.
Various small projects along the route are scheduled to fix various intersections and replace bridges along route, but no major projects scheduled. Discussions of possibly converting Interstate 95 into a toll road have met with resistance, especially within SCDOT; however if both North Carolina and Georgia changed Interstate 95 into a toll road, then they would consider it as well.
Local leaders in Hardeeville are pushing for a new exit 3, at Purrysburg Road, for a proposed RiverPort Business Park. Project is currently still in the planning stage with no time frame or official confirmation from SCDOT at this time.

Alice Barnett

Alice Barnett (17 May 1846 – 14 April 1901) was an English singer and actress, best known for her performances in contralto roles of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Barnett began her career by 1873 in oratorio and other concert work. Using her imposing physical stature to her advantage, she originated several of the early Gilbert and Sullivan "formidable middle-aged ladies", namely Ruth in "The Pirates of Penzance" (1879), Lady Jane in "Patience" (1881) and the Fairy Queen in "Iolanthe" (1882). She then performed in various comic operas in Britain, America, Australia and New Zealand until 1889, earning strong critical praise. After this, she toured in several of the Gaiety burlesques before creating the role of Dame Hecla Cortlandt in W. S. Gilbert and Osmond Carr's "His Excellency" in 1894. From 1895, she played in Edwardian musical comedy, pantomime and non-musical plays until 1900.
Life and career.
Early years.
Barnett was born in London, the daughter of Charles Barnett and Fanny Kemble. She was the second of three children. Her elder brother Harry Kemble Barnett (d. 1914) became a stage manager. Among her theatrical antecedents were her great aunt, Sarah Siddons and her great-great uncles John Philip Kemble and Charles Kemble. She trained as a concert singer under Natalia Macfarren, the wife of George Alexander Macfarren, and made many appearances as a contralto soloist around Britain. She sang in oratorios such as Mendelssohn's "Elijah", Rossini's "Stabat Mater", and Handel's "Messiah", as well as concerts of ballads and other lighter repertoire.
D'Oyly Carte years.
In April 1879, Barnett joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's touring Comedy Opera Company as Little Buttercup in "H.M.S. Pinafore". She immediately attracted good notices. The theatrical paper "The Era" wrote, "The Little Buttercup of Miss Alice Barnett comes in for the lion's share of approbation." During her first tour, she was joined by another rising performer in the company, W. S. Penley, playing Sir Joseph Porter.
Barnett travelled with W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan and Carte to New York City for the company's production there of "Pinafore", beginning 1 December 1879. She then created the role of Ruth in Gilbert and Sullivan's new opera, "The Pirates of Penzance", on 31 December 1879. Of her Buttercup, "The New York Mercury" wrote, "Miss Alice Barnett, an enormous female, was well made up as Buttercup, but is far behind her predecessors here either as an actress or a vocalist." She played Ruth throughout the New York run and American tour and continued to play the role at the Opera Comique when the company returned to London in July 1880.
Barnett created the next two Gilbert and Sullivan contralto roles, Lady Jane in "Patience" in 1881 and the Queen of the Fairies in "Iolanthe" in 1882. Gilbert wrote these formidable characters with Barnett's imposing physical presence in mind, including such self-referential lines for Jane as "not pretty, massive!" and for the Fairy Queen as: "I see no objection to stoutness, in moderation!" The critic Louis Engel described her as "the successful violoncello-player of "Patience", who measures 5 feet 10½ inches, and is most proportionately built." The review of "Iolanthe" in "The London Figaro" said that Barnett, "a fairy queen of Brobdingnagian proportions, who 'nestles in a nutshell and gambols on gossamer,' invested her part with all the broad humour necessary without overdoing it." "The Times" called her "the unsurpassable Alice Barnett". In 1883, during the run of "Iolanthe", she became ill and was replaced by her understudy, Rosina Brandram, as the principal contralto at the Savoy. When Barnett regained her health, however, Brandram continued with the Savoy cast. Barnett, instead, played the contralto roles in D'Oyly Carte touring companies in 1884, before leaving the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the end of that year.
Peripatetic performer.
Barnett appeared with Lillian Russell in "Pocahontas", by Sydney Grundy and Edward Solomon, at the Empire Theatre in London before travelling to America with Russell in 1885. In New York, and on tour, she performed in Solomon's shows "Billee Taylor", "Claude Duval" and "Polly". She then moved to Australia, where she spent three years, from 1885 to 1888, playing the Gilbert and Sullivan contralto roles (Lady Sangazure in "The Sorcerer", Buttercup, Ruth, Jane, the Fairy Queen, Lady Blanche in "Princess Ida" and Katisha in "The Mikado") with J. C. Williamson's opera company. London's "The Era" noted, "Reports received lately from Australia are so full of the praises of Miss Alice Barnett in her Gilbert and Sullivan impersonations that her appearance … promises to be one of the events of the season." She also appeared as Mrs. Privett in Alfred Cellier's "Dorothy" (with Leonora Braham in the title role), Eliza Dabsey in "Billee Taylor", and the Princesse de Gramponeur in "Erminie". In 1887, she toured New Zealand with Williamson's Gilbert and Sullivan company and won praise for teaching at the various towns visited by the company.
In October 1888, Barnett returned to London. She appeared as Mrs Shelton in Cellier's "Doris" at the Lyric Theatre, which was succeeded at the same theatre by "The Red Hussar" by Henry Pottinger Stephens and Edward Solomon. Barnett was announced beforehand as a cast member for the new piece, but she did not appear. The following year, she toured the British provinces as Martha in Auguste Van Biene's production of the Gaiety burlesque "Faust up to Date", in which "The Era" found her "inimitable". This tour lasted for more than a year, taking in all four countries of the United Kingdom. The company followed this with a production of "Carmen up to Data", in which Barnett played Micaela. She finally returned to London in 1894 to create another of Gilbert's formidable older women, Dame Hecla Cortlandt in Gilbert and Osmond Carr's "His Excellency". "Miss Alice Barnett, as the mighty Dame Hecla, fulfilled the promise of her name, bursting out into flame at the slightest provocation … excruciatingly funny."
After a brief run at the Gaiety Theatre in "The Shop Girl", in the summer of 1895, Barnett again travelled to America, where she toured in "His Excellency" with George Edwardes's Lyric Company. In 1896, she returned to England, touring in "The Telephone Girl", by Augustus Harris, F. C. Burnand and Gaston Serpette, after which she again went to America in November of that year for DeKoven and Smith's "The Mandarin". Barnett's husband, John Thanet Dickens, died at their house in south London in August 1896.
Last years.
In 1897 Barnett toured Britain with "The Telephone Girl". Beginning in December 1897 she appeared in the Drury Lane pantomime, "Babes in the Wood", with Dan Leno. In 1898, Barnett played Becky Blisset in "Billy" by Adrian Ross and Osmond Carr, starring with Little Tich. The production visited major provincial cities but did not come into the West End. Later in the same year, she appeared with Marie Studholme in Edwardes's production of "A Greek Slave", playing the part of Melanopis, in which she toured until May 1899. She then appeared in a third successive touring production, a revival of "The Telephone Girl". Later in 1899, Barnett returned to the West End as Madame Rouge in "Drink", at the Adelphi Theatre, followed by a farce, "Willie's Mrs", at the Strand Theatre. "The Era" described the play as "a crude and unexpert attempt at farcical comedy," but Barnett received excellent notices for her performance.
Barnett died in London in 1901 of bronchial pneumonia following an operation.
